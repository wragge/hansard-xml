<TITLE>Violent Television Programs</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, that:</PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned about the increase in violent television programmes for children and particularly those programmes promoting violent toys that are available for sale in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray:</PARA>
<PARA> That you support the Broadcasting (Prohibition of Violent Programmes for Children) Act 1988 which has been presented by WA Independent Senator for Nuclear Disarmament, Jo Vallentine. This act aims to prohibit the broadcasting of children's TV programmes that are violent and that promote toys modelled on characters, weapons or other war accessories which are also available for sale in Australia.</PARA>

<TITLE>X-rated and Violent Video Material</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA>The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Video Material has concluded that ``Adverse effects upon people, and especially upon children, of exposure to material containing various degrees of violence, pornography or obscenity have been demonstrated''.</PARA>
<PARA> The majority of the Select Committee strongly opposed the proposition for a new NVE (non-violent erotica) category, which would have entrenched X-rated video pornography.</PARA>
<PARA> All six State Governments have, through their Attorneys-General expressed unanimous opposition to the circulation of X-rated videos.</PARA>
<PARA> We consider the continuing distribution of X-rated videos from the A.C.T. to be reprehensible and to be contrary to the wellbeing of the Australian community in general.</PARA>
<PARA> We strongly request urgent Government action to prohibit the distribution of X-rated and excessively violent video material.</PARA>

<TITLE>Pharmaceutical Drugs</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled; the humble petition of the undersigned citizens showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> that your petitioners deplore the Federal Government's decision to remove 53 Pharmaceutical drugs-including the best available for the treatment of high blood pressure, cancer, epilepsy, high cholesterol and uneven heartbeat-and place them for cost saving reasons only on a special list requiring authority from a Canberra bureaucrat, and</PARA>
<PARA> that we believe a patient's doctor is clearly the best judge for medication needed for their particular illness and that it is therefore wrong and unfair to force that doctor to waste valuable time referring a case to a person in Canberra who has no personal knowledge of that case.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled will call on the Government to immediately abandon the proposal and keep its election promise of high quality and universal health care for all Australians.</PARA>

<TITLE>Violent and Pornographic Material</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled, the humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the Australian Capital Territory respectfully showeth; We ask that the Federal Government take immediate action to arrest the spread of violent and pornographic printed and video material within Australia and to have existing material withdrawn to a point where this country once more achieves acceptable standards of social and moral behaviour. As a first step towards this objective, we ask that the Government immediately:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) amend the Customs Prohibited Imports Regulations to once more render it illegal for excessively violent and pornographic material to be imported into Australia, and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) amend the ACT Classification of Publications Ordinance to prohibit the importation into, production within, and distribution from the ACT of R and X-Rated video material and pornographic literature.</PARA>
<PARA>We urge the Government to recognise that it is inappropriate for the National Capital to be the distribution point from which violent and pornographic material can legally be sent by mail order to residents of the various States in which this material has been banned, and to take the steps necessary to redress this situation.</PARA>

<TITLE>Interest Rates</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.</PARA>
<PARA>Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Hawke-Keating government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many Australians out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Violent and Pornographic Material</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of citizens of Australia points out that the community deplores the persistent refusal to ban pornography in X and NVE Videos, Films and Publications, and deplores the resulting escalation of crime and sexual crime in the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA>Because Parliament has a direct and heavy obligation to ensure the safety of women and child-victims, your petitioners therefore request the House:</PARA>
<PARA> to ban the importation, and availability of pornography in Videos, Films and Publications,</PARA>
<PARA> to prevent black-market trading by banning the possession of X and NVE material,</PARA>
<PARA> vote against any recommendation to extend Video and Theatre Film Classifications and Guidelines into television standards,</PARA>

<PARA> (c) further notes that, as with the great bulk of Mr Hawke's promises, this undertaking was given recklessly and without any genuine intention to honour it, as is now evident from the fact that the issue of tax file numbers has had to be suspended following revelations that they have been sprayed around the community indiscriminately, even going to people who have been dead for many years, and that details of tax file numbers have been improperly and corruptly obtainable despite Mr Hawke's so-called safeguards; and</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will amend the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954 and will repeal the Aged or Disabled Persons Hostels Act 1972</PARA>
<PARA> The major purpose of this Bill is to introduce new arrangements to enable improved planning and financial management in the hostel sector. In addition, the Bill proposes measures that will ensure better targeting of subsidised hostel services to those aged people in need of such care and introduces provisions to assist people seeking to avail themselves of respite care services in a hostel. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also seeks to overcome an inconsistency between nursing homes and hostels by enabling moneys borrowed or received from Commonwealth or State governments, or from other sources, to be taken into account when calculating the amount of capital grant in relation to a nursing home. This provision already exists for hostels. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the repeal of the Aged or Disabled Persons Hostels Act 1972 while preserving any outstanding entitlements under the Act through the grant of an approval in principle under the new provisions in the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986 the Government endorsed the findings of the nursing homes and hostels review which recognised that there was a need to develop a total aged care policy with an expanded range of care options to meet individual needs. As part of the strategy to meet this need, the Government has introduced a series of measures directed at the expansion and better resourcing of the sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The discussion document entitled Equitable Funding Base for Hostels, released by the Department in October 1987, made a number of recommendations along these lines, concerning, in particular, the integration of funding and planning for the expanding hostel sector. Primarily these recommendations proposed the introduction of an approval in principle and approval process for hostels to ensure that Commonwealth capital and recurrent funding would in future be provided only to those hostels meeting an identified need. </PARA>
<PARA> To establish the framework for the approval in principle and approval mechanisms, amendments introduced by this Bill enable the Minister to determine the maximum number of hostel places to be funded on a recurrent basis for each State and Territory in a financial year, and to specify the distribution of these hostel places among planning regions. These maxima will be specified by a Gazette notice. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 9 of the Bill also introduces a provision that prevents the Minister from granting an approval in principle or approving additional hostel places for recurrent funding if the effect of doing so would cause the maximum number of committed hostel places in a State, Territory or region to be exceeded. </PARA>
<PARA> The allocation of hostel resources will be determined on the basis of the Government's objective to provide 100 residential care places for 1,000 people aged 70 and over, with a mix, within this 100, of 60 hostel places to 40 nursing home places. In determining priorities in line with this objective, the Minister will take into account advice provided by the aged care advisory committees. </PARA>
<PARA> On 15 July this year the Minister for Housing and Aged Care announced that the Government plans to approve 4,244 new places in 1988-89, 4,723 in 1989-90, and 4,738 in 1990-91; 13,705 additional places overall, of which 12,296 will be for hostels and 1,409 for nursing homes. These new hostel places will be accommodated within the State or Territory and regional maxima to be gazetted for the corresponding relevant periods. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 9 of the Bill also introduces the proposed approval in principle and approval arrangements. A primary objective of these arrangements is to establish firmly for both the eligible organisation and the Commonwealth, the extent of the Commonwealth's financial commitment in terms of recurrent and, where relevant, capital funding, and the conditions that must be fulfilled by the holder of an approval in principle before a formal decision to grant capital moneys or to approve the payment of recurrent subsidy is made. The proposed amendment responds to concerns expressed by service providers that, in the past, the Commonwealth has not always been able to provide assurances, in advance of the commencement of a hostel project that, upon completion, recurrent subsidy will be paid, even though Commonwealth capital funding had been provided. The proposed amendments remove that uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA> As with the comparable provisions of the National Health Act 1953, clause 9 enables an approval in principle to be granted for the construction or purchase of a new hostel, for an extension to an existing hostel, for the demolition and reconstruction of an existing hostel on the same site and the transfer of some or all hostel places from one site to another existing hostel or proposed hostel on another site. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with the Government's commitment to improved financial management and planning in the hostel sector, the Bill (clauses 15 and 24) amends the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954 to ensure that all Commonwealth funded hostels, existing and future ones are approved for a fixed number of hostel places. </PARA>
<PARA> In future, an organisation wishing to receive recurrent subsidy for an extension to an existing hostel facility will first be required to seek an approval in principle for those additional places. These amendments enable the Commonwealth to control growth in the number of subsidised hostel places, to ensure that any additional places are located where the need exists, and consequently, plan for recurrent expenditure by way of hostel, personal care and respite care subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 17 paragraph (g) concerns the individual entitlement to respite care. In April this year the Minister for Housing and Aged Care announced that one of the new measures to improve availability of, and access to, respite care would be an individual entitlement to respite care services of 63 days across all hostels or nursing homes. To satisfy the Minister's concerns and those of the industry that the respite arrangements operate effectively, the arrangement proposed in the Bill will enable payment of recurrent subsidy in respect of an eligible person occupying an approved respite care place for a maximum of 63 days in the same hostel in a benefit period. This will be welcomed by organisations providing much needed respite care services for aged people and by those who require such hostel respite care. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has, on numerous occasions, expressed its policy to target subsidised care services to aged people. This Bill (clauses 19 and 20) introduces measures to ensure that approved hostel places are made available to eligible people, that is, those aged or disabled people assessed as requiring hostel or personal care services, a person who was residing with such a person prior to their commencing to receive care services on a permanent basis and who wishes to continue to reside with that person, and persons who wish to receive hostel care services on a temporary basis, or who wish to receive, and are assessed as requiring, hostel care and personal care services on a temporary basis. Subsidised hostel services are thereby targeted to aged or disabled people who are assessed as requiring such services. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to ensure that organisations satisfy, on an ongoing basis, the conditions of recurrent subsidy, the Minister's powers, in the event of a breach of conditions, are to be expanded by this Bill (clause 20) to enable the revocation of the approval of one or more hostel places. The decision to take such action will be subject, of course, to appeal by the organisation and review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (clause 23). </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, it is important that existing hostels should not be disadvantaged by the introduction of these new provisions. The Bill therefore proposes transitional arrangements to deal with the entitlements of all hostels presently in receipt of recurrent subsidy and those for which a capital grant has been made (in part or in full) but which are not yet receiving recurrent subsidy. In particular, the Bill proposes an arrangement to allow organisations conducting existing hostel facilities a transition period of approximately 5 years during which to adjust their existing resident population so as to comply with the requirement that approved hostel places be occupied solely by eligible persons. (clauses 24, 25 and 26). </PARA>
<PARA> In addition the Bill enables the formulation of principles for determining, inter alia, the number of hostel places for which an approval or an approval in principle will be granted to an organisation to which these transitional arrangements apply. These principles will be tabled and subject to possible disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA> By clause 27 of the Bill the Aged or Disabled Persons Hostels Act 1972 is repealed. This repeal is in fact long overdue, as new approvals under this Act ceased in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> The so-called `hostels' Act provided for up to 100 per cent capital funding for hostels approved under the Act between 1972 and 1975. No recurrent subsidies were provided under the Act. However, organisations which receive capital under the hostels Act are eligible to receive recurrent funding under the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a small number of organisations which has outstanding approvals under section 5 of the Act for which, to date, the organisations concerned have not sought capital. This Bill proposes that any such outstanding entitlements would be preserved through the grant of an approval in principle under the new provisions introduced by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to ensure that these organisations receive the most appropriate funding possible, organisations granted approval-in-principle under these arrangements are to be permitted to elect to receive either the capital grant they would be entitled to under the `hostels' Act 1972, or that which would now be payable under the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me assure the Senate that these new arrangements for managing growth and strengthening the hostel approval process will enable the Government to encourage, direct and target appropriate hostel services in a rapidly expanding sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Unless the Parliament provides otherwise, section 66 of the Constitution prescribes a maximum annual sum for the payment of salaries of Ministers. Amendments to the Ministers of State Act, which sets this sum, are thus required from time to time to cover changes to ministerial salaries. </PARA>
<PARA> Since its establishment in 1973, the Remuneration Tribunal as an independent body required to review and report on the remuneration, allowances and entitlements of members of parliament amongst others, has consistently maintained that parliamentary salaries are too low. </PARA>
<PARA> In its submission to the Tribunal in connection with its 1987 review, the Government proposed that the Tribunal hold a conference similar to the Anomalies Conference convened in that year by the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The Tribunal agreed that a conference be held to consider whether special and extraordinary circumstances existed, as provided for under the then current wage principles, which would justify consideration of an anomaly under the pre-existing principles. The parties to the conference being the government, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Australian Labor Party Caucus, the Liberal Party and the Australian Democrats agreed that an anomaly had existed for a considerable time in respect of all politicians' salaries which should be adjusted by two amounts, the last being the 2.2 per cent increase effective from 1 July 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Also following from the anomalies conference it was agreed that the Tribunal would conduct a review of parliamentary salaries prior to its reporting again. It is as a result of that review that the latest increases have been recommended. In its 1988 review, the Remuneration Tribunal recommended that ministerial salaries be increased by 7 per cent with effect from 1 January 1989. The proposed increase accords with national wage case increases awarded to the work force under the second tier increase granted by the national wage case decision of March 1987, and the 3 per cent increase granted by the August 1988 national wage decision. It is therefore necessary to raise the upper limit on the amount appropriated for ministerial salaries to accommodate both increases. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Ministers of State Act to increase the maximum annual sum from $745,000 to $820,000. Mr President, I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> I seek leave to incorporate the tabling statement in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> I present the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training on `Education for Active Citizenship in Australian Schools and Youth Organisations'. This matter was referred to the Committee on 23 March 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee received 135 submissions to its inquiry and held public hearings in Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and Canberra. In the course of the inquiry, the Committee also distributed a discussion paper on the topic to stimulate further public debate. This paper was tabled in the Senate on 31 August 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The report proposes a national program in education for active citizenship directed in particular at Australia's young people. I hope to speak on this in more detail later. At this stage I simply wish to draw the attention of the Senate to some of the facts which made this inquiry necessary. I believe these facts are a warning signal which Australians ignore at their peril. </PARA>
<PARA> Surveys over a number of years now have shown a quite astonishing level of political ignorance in the Australian community. A study shortly after the 1984 Federal Election found that only about 60% of Australians even knew the names of the two Houses of the Federal Parliament-quite apart from what their functions might be. About 40% could not say in which House the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition sat. Among 18 and 19 year olds over half did not know this. A 1985 survey of four high schools in the Brisbane area found that nearly 60% of students could not name either House of Federal Parliament, and over 80% could not say in which house the Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition sit. </PARA>
<PARA> This ignorance extends to the fundamentals of our Federal system. In 1987 a survey showed that only about one in every two Australians knows that we have a constitution-let alone what might be in it. In the 18 to 24 age group only 30% were aware of the Constitution's existence. We can perhaps agree that there is a certain incongruity in parliaments solemnly proposing amendments to the Australian Constitution when over half the population does not even know it exists. </PARA>
<PARA> A particularly alarming fact revealed in the course of our inquiry is that school teachers, whose responsibilities include education for active citizenship, are themselves frequently ignorant about Australia's political and governmental systems. One submission, from an institution in South Australia responsible for teacher education, reported that in a test administered to student teachers only one student in 55 could pass a rudimentary test, the knowledge tested being little more than that which is required of people to vote. Other evidence we received suggests that many teachers are not only ignorant about Australia's democracy but also apathetic about the whole topic. </PARA>
<PARA> It was against this background that my Committee pursued its inquiry. We know that being an active citizen involves much more than simply answering questions in a political quiz. But the ignorance we found is indicative, we believe, of a widespread `don't know, don't care' attitude in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has called for a national program to deal with this problem. We describe the situation as `a crisis Australians cannot afford to ignore'. It is a sobering thought that only about five nations in the world, apart from Australia, have enjoyed continuous democratic government since the turn of the century. If we are complacent about our democracy we may well find ourselves among those who are destined to lose it. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally I wish to draw attention to three particular points of interest. The Committee took the view at the outset of its inquiry that there would be great value in hearing the views of students themselves on the topic it was considering. Accordingly, we included year 11 and 12 students in our list of witnesses at public hearings in Canberra, Perth and Sydney. In all, we heard from students from seven different secondary schools. This was a valuable experience and the students' views made a useful contribution to the Committee's thinking in formulating its report. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Committee formed the view that one of the many aspects of Australia's parliamentary system which is not well understood by the Australian people is the role of parliamentary committees themselves. Accordingly, the Committee suggested to the Parliamentary Education Office that there could be advantage in producing an educational videotape explaining the work of committees, using the inquiry into education for active citizenship as a major focus. The Parliamentary Education Office took up this proposal enthusiastically and I am happy to say that the production of this videotape is now at an advanced stage. The Committee hopes that it will prove a valuable educational aid. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Committee has decided to make its report available in large print and on audio-tape for the benefit of print-handicapped people. The Committee believes that this step is particularly important for a report such as this which raises issues of concern to all Australians. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JE4">Senator AULICH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw particular attention to what the Committee and the community said about the low levels of political knowledge and participation in this country. Many examples were brought to our attention through surveys and submissions. This report provides recommendations to try to overcome that problem. Very quickly, I indicate that the Committee believes that the aims of this Parliament should make itself known to the rest of the community and as a whole and to have the functions of the Senate in particular understood by the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One area of this Parliament that we believe needs promoting is the workings of the committee system. With that in mind we have enlisted the support of the Parliamentary Education Office, which has produced a videotape of the whole inquiry for use as an education aid. As I have indicated in my tabling speech, this report is intended, because of its subject matter, to have wide circulation. So again we have moved in a different direction and asked that the report be made available to the outside community in large print versions and on audio tape for the benefit of print handicapped people. I commend the report to the Senate. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

Basically, opportunities exist to raise in matters of public importance and urgency motions the matters sought to be raised by way of notice of motion and generally honourable senators avail themselves of those opportunities. It has become a new tactic to present a notice of motion and either to get leave to move it or to move a motion in accordance with a contingent notice of motion. What is happening today is a new facet in the Senate's development. It is one that will live to haunt everyone.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>When organising this last night I thought, with the agreement of the Government as well as the Australian Democrats, that we said we would speak briefly so that all those in the Senate who are interested in women's achievements and the women's debate generally would have an opportunity on this, International Women's Day, to contribute. So it was with some surprise that this morning I heard the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) launch into an argument that in some way this motion is disturbing the Government business before the chamber. I guess that is not surprising because the Government, as we read in this morning's press, is highly sensitive to its falling ratings in relation to the women's vote. When Government members read this morning's newspapers not only are they reminded of what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said to them yesterday-that they must face up to the fact that the women of Australia are deserting the Government-but also that their former stalwart, former Senator Susan Ryan, is telling them that what is needed at the moment is more action and less rhetoric. I am not surprised that Senator Ray sought in some way to divert the debate from what is an important issue; that is, the place that the debate on the status of women has reached and what should be done in future to continue that debate in both rhetoric and substance. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to have moved the motion on behalf of the Opposition parties-the Liberal Party and the National Party-because both have a proud record on the status of women. According to Joyce Stevens's book A History of International Women's Day, the day has been variously seen as a time for asserting women's political and social rights, for reviewing the progress that women have made or as a day for celebration. Therefore, it seems most appropriate that this motion-the only motion that was given in these terms yesterday-be moved from this side of the chamber. Although the Hawke Government has developed the myth that it invented the cause of equality, on this occasion I want to remind the Senate of some of the substantive initiatives and some of the women who have contributed from this side of the chamber and of whom we are so proud. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me start by referring to some of the achievements of previous coalition governments which are conveniently overlooked by the Hawke propaganda campaign. I remind the Senate that the former McMahon coalition Government introduced the Child Care Act of 1972. I also remind the Senate of the introduction by the Fraser Liberal Government in 1976-77 of family allowances paid directly to the mother. This Government has not allowed family allowances to keep pace with inflation. The establishment of the National Women's Advisory Council in 1977 was another achievement of a coalition government. The Office of the Status of Women, formerly known as the Office of Women's Affairs, was established in 1976. It is worthwhile reminding this Government and the Australian community that that was an initiative of the Liberal-National coalition Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I also mention the formation of the Office of Child Care in the Department of Social Security in 1976; the Superannuation Act of 1976, which gave equal treatment to female public servants; the establishment in 1980 of the Institute of Family Studies; the extension of eligibility for pensioner health benefits to single parents and dependants in 1979; and the development in 1983 of the family income supplement scheme to assist low income families. I could go on. That is just a taste of some of the achievements of former Liberal-National Party coalition governments in the field of improving the status of women. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider the achievement within Australian politics of such outstanding womenas Dame Enid Lyons, the first woman member of the House of Representatives--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators opposite wanted a 10-minute debate; they can have a half hour debate. They want to know who were the first women elected to parliament in all States. In 1921 Mrs Edith Cowan, a Nationalist, was the first woman elected to the Western Australian Parliament; in New South Wales Miss M. Stanley, also from the Nationalist Party, was elected in 1925; in Queensland, Mrs I. Longman, also from the Nationalist Party, was elected in 1929; in Victoria Lady Peacock, from the United Australia Party, was elected in 1933; in Tasmania Dame F. Miller and Miss A. Best, from the Liberal Party, were elected in 1955; and in South Australia Mrs Steele and Mrs Cooper, from the Liberal Party, were elected in 1955. In every State of Australia the first women to be elected to the respective parliaments came from the non-Labor side of politics. If that is the information Senator Collins was seeking, I hope he is now satisfied. The natural place for reformist women, as I was saying, has always been with our parties. As I indicated, their achievements are worth remembering on this day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In contrast, the Hawke Government will be remembered for its hype, glitter, and self-glorification, which Australian women are now seeing through. Australian women have been reminded, not only by us but also by such objective bodies as the Institute of Family Studies, by the Government's own chief economic advisory group, the Economic Planning Advisory Council, and, most recently, by the Women's Electoral Lobby at the Women's Tax Convention last Saturday, that in so many material ways Australian women are now worse off under this Labor Government. In other words, Australian women have been cheated, and that is the sad legacy that this Government will leave to history. I make no apology for introducing a moderately partisan approach to this debate because--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are many men who are economic conscripts under this Government; that is true. But the important thing is that, while more women have gone into the work force, an increasing percentage are on lower levels of income, below average weekly earnings. That is the point that Senator Collins should take note of and that is the point that Australian women are recognising.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, there are no more appropriate words than `economic conscripts'-forced by falling living standards and a lack of family support by this Government into low paid jobs with little satisfaction or prospects for advancement. More than 50 per cent of such women are now in employment that pays less than average weekly earnings, and that percentage is rising. By the time women pay record high taxes, pay high child care costs and either pay or contribute to enormous mortgages or high rents, they are left with little in material terms for their labour. In other words, the mere fact that more women are entering employment is not necessarily in itself something to boast about. I refer this Government-if it is not prepared to accept my words-to the Secretary-General to the United Nations in his report to last year's General Assembly of the UN under the agenda item `Implementation of the Nairobi Forward Looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women'. This will be appreciated, no doubt, by Senator Giles, who contributed at the Nairobi conference, which should be recognised. I ask the Labor Government to consider particularly the Secretary-General's statement:</PARA>
<PARA>Although there may be an increase in women's contribution to economic and social aspects of life, it does not necessarily follow that there will be a proportionate increase in the benefits they derive. Moreover, although the United Nations Decade for Women stimulated the reform of laws that discriminated against women and the adoption of new ones providing for equal rights and opportunities, the improved situation de jure may not be reflected by the de facto situation in many economic and social areas. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the picture in this country. The economic position of women, the changes of laws and the new institutions that have been developed have not produced the economic advancement that it was believed would logically follow. I would suggest, and I have always wanted to be fair in these debates, that real progress is better demonstrated by the larger number of young women starting at university. This is another point that Senator Giles made the other day. It is something that we on this side of the chamber are pleased to note. If more were starting in faculties such as engineering or, in other words, non-traditional areas, it would be recognised as even greater progress. Thus we say on this important day that it should not be just a day to assert the political and social rights of women, it should also be a day to assert their economic rights. It is this area that has been primarily overlooked by this Labor Government. Despite all the hype the Government attaches to the women's portfolio and all the self-congratulations which the Government continues to pour on itself, it has overlooked women's economic rights. It is summed up in the expression that I hear so often from women's organisations, namely, the goals of financial independence and financial security. First and paramount, they are expressed to us by women and women's organisations as their goals and they are the principal areas in which they feel they have been let down by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, it was not surprising that at last Saturday's Women's Tax Convention-and I take the opportunity to congratulate the National Women's Consultative Council and the Women's Electoral Lobby on organising it-the predominant themes were recognition of the unpaid work of women and mothers; the need for greater support for mothers of dependent children-for example, restoring the value of family allowances, which this Government has let drop; a message to this Government to abandon additional imposts on women in regard to retraining and upgrading of education, and in particular Labor's higher education tax; and reform in such areas as superannuation so that women might have an equal chance to plan their own futures in the same way as do men. </PARA>
<PARA> In reviewing progress there is much to celebrate on this day. There are many women to applaud, and indeed many women who should be applauded but who will never be recognised because of the system of reward in this country, which does not necessarily recognise women's achievements. It was most pleasing at the women's 1988 awards last year that an attempt was made to recognise women who had achieved in areas that are not the traditional areas for which reward is given under our system of values. There are many women who should be recognised and who are not. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important today, as we say in our motion, to accept that there is a great deal yet to be achieved. The principal point that we want to make is that the women's issues debate within our community has moved on and that it is now a hard-nosed economic debate. Women are a demanding constituency. They now recognise that they have been sold short by this Government in terms of their economic opportunity and the opportunity to achieve economic self-reliance. For that this Government will suffer the consequences. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that the Senate is having this important debate on International Women's Day. I would like to think that Senator Hill is absolutely genuine in bringing forward this notice of motion and that there is no hint of cynicism in his views. I must admit that, having been involved in international women's days since 1971, and having not been aware of the visibility of Senator Hill or indeed of any other Liberal member on such days, I cannot help having a trace of cynicism about today's notice of motion. However, I am trying very hard to put that behind me. I know that there are Opposition members who genuinely want to see a bipartisan approach to the recognition of the status of women and what has been achieved. Senator Hill was gracious enough to point out some of the achievements that I believe he attributes, somewhat grudgingly perhaps, to the last six years of the Hawke Labor Government. His predecessor, Senator Vanstone, was much more generous in a speech to Liberal women some time last year, when she said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>We agree that the Commonwealth Government's economic policies are the means by which the Government can best ensure a bright and secure future for present and future members of our nation. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a direct quote from the National Agenda for Women. On election night last year, when describing the relationship between the Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party, John Howard remarked:</PARA>
<PARA>What unites us is far greater than that which divides us. It is equally true when used to describe the relationship between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party women and issues affecting the status of women. There are many areas where there are improvements to be made and we share with Labor a commitment to find the right solutions. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very constructive way for us to move forward in this debate. Obviously I support a number of the sentiments that were expressed in the motion today. My colleague Senator Pat Giles will talk about the contributions of a number of key women from our side of politics to all that has been achieved to raise the status of women over the last 15 years or so. Regardless of the views that have been put forward about the lack of progress of the Hawke Government-I think Senator Hill described the Government's contribution in this regard as `glitzy hype'-at least it attracted Senator Hill's attention. It has certainly put status of women issues on his agenda, if not necessarily on that of his party. I understand that it is fairly difficult for the status of women policy committee of Senator Hill's party to meet. It certainly does not meet with the same degree of regularity that the Government's status of women policy committee meets. </PARA>
<PARA> For the record, I will run through what we have done to change the type of Australia in which Australian women now participate and in which young women will participate. Since 1983 the annual employment growth rate for women has been 4 per cent, and there has been an historically high women's participation rate of 51.3 per cent. A number of Opposition members have criticised that and said that women do not want to work in paid employment, whether full time or part time. That was not the message I received at the Women's Tax Convention. Certainly, the question of choice is and always will be vital. Women are entitled to a choice. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walters" NAMEID="UJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator Walters</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But you are not giving that choice.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator REYNOLDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walters claims that we are not giving the choice, but she is not able to come forward with valid reasons as to why women are entering the work force in greater numbers. The unemployment rates for women and young women have dropped from 13.7 and 9 per cent in 1983 to 11.2 and 7.5 per cent respectively. The Government has taken legislative measures to ensure that women have a protected role within the work force. We have seen a dramatic increase in the education participation rate of girls. It increased from 44 per cent in 1983 to 61.8 per cent in 1988. All these measures, coupled with a dramatic increase in the numbers of child-care places, the young homeless allowance, the great expansion of the supported accommodation program, indicate that the Government has been very serious in putting status of women policy issues firmly on the agenda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nobody would claim that all goals have been achieved. Of course, enormous problems still face women. The mere fact that 90 per cent of one-parent families are headed by women indicates that women have a tremendous task in balancing and juggling the demands of child-care responsibilities with their responsibilities of making ends meet. We understand the problems that they face in this regard. For this reason, the Government introduced payments targeted at low income families with children. Of course, that has particularly benefited women. I remind honourable senators that in 1983 payments for children had fallen to 11.1 per cent of the married rate of pension. We have committed ourselves to payments of 15 per cent of the married rate of pension for children under 13 and 20 per cent of the married rate of pension for children under 16. We have increased payments for children seven times in seven Budgets, from $10 a week in 1983 to $24 a week for children under 13 and $31 a week for children up to 16 years in 1989. I contrast that with what the Opposition did when in government. It claims that it has a commitment to improving conditions for women, but when in office for seven years it increased payments for children only once. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have this debate about who has done more to ensure that status of women issues are on the political agenda. Senator Hill rightly pointed to the role of Liberal Party women in terms of their participation in the Parliament. He also rightly outlined a number of initiatives of the former Liberal Government. It is only fair to point out that although the Opposition had an Office of the Status of Women, it was not located at the centre of action within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. I have continually tried to demonstrate to a number of honourable senators on the other side the role of the Office of the Status of Women. Its role is to act as a catalyst, a coordinator, and a monitor of so many things that are happening across all government departments. Under this Government, a women's budget has been brought down. We never had a women's budget statement in the days of the Fraser Government. We never had an automatic monitoring by each government department of precisely what is happening in the Public Service in terms of policies for women and their participation within the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party says very little about its policies. It is very quick to attack the Government, but we hear very little about its policies. </PARA>

<PARA> I will ask Senator Hill a few questions which I hope he will ensure are answered by contributors to the debate this morning. The Liberals need to answer some questions about what a coalition government would mean for women. We know what happened when there was a change of government in Tasmania. When Robin Gray took over as the Liberal Premier of Tasmania, he dismantled the women's unit in Tasmania and dismissed the women's adviser. In fairness, the Premier of New South Wales has not gone that far. But he has certainly marginalised the women's unit in New South Wales by taking it away from the Premier's Department and placing it in the Department of Community Services. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course women are vitally concerned with community services. But they are also concerned with health, education, housing, Treasury and Attorney-General matters, et cetera. If women's units are not located at the centre of government decision-making, women and women's issues will be marginalised. As I have said, the women's unit in Tasmania has been abolished and in New South Wales the Liberal Government has marginalised women's issues by putting the women's unit into the Department of Community Services. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Hill" NAMEID="BH4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator REYNOLDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, under a woman Minister. Is this what the women of Australia can expect from a coalition government-the dismantling of the Office of the Status of Women? The author of Future Directions talks about a review of the role of the Office of the Status of Women and gives absolutely no clear commitment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Furthermore, on page 34, Future Directions commits a coalition government to the immediate abolition of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Senator Hill says that he is committed to equal employment opportunities for women and I do not doubt him. Equality of opportunity is actually mentioned in Future Directions. But how is a coalition government going to implement our sex discrimination legislation? How is it going to implement affirmative legislation? Is it going to abolish the Affirmative Action Agency as well? It has been very quiet about this agency. At least it has come out and said, `Yes, we will abolish the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission', but it is quieter about the Affirmative Action Agency. Would it actually repeal legislation which entrenches equality of opportunity in the work force? Would it support the Government's forthcoming amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act which remove the general exemption for superannuation?</PARA>
<PARA> Future Directions, at pages 46 and 74, wants to encourage private child-care provision. Would this result in the dismantling of the children's services program? Would a coalition government retain the nexus between education and income security allowances for young people? Would it retain the Child Support Agency which, to date, has effected a $47 a week increase in income for 83,000 sole parent families? Would it continue the Hawke Government's commitment to benchmark payments for low income families with children under the family allowance supplement? Would it question the adequacy of those benchmarks? How would it amend the taxation system and at what cost? Would this be done through universal payments, income splitting or child-care rebates?</PARA>
<PARA> The last policy of the coalition stated that the dependent spouse rebate would be decreased by $30. Would that rebate now be increased to fit in with the broad sentiments of Senator Hill's motion? Does this mean that a coalition government would return universal, indexed family allowances to real 1976 values? That would cost an estimated $1.7 billion. Is that what is meant by the statement of page 1 of Future Directions that the coalition is committed to smaller government with less interference? Yet, apparently Senator Hill wants to introduce some form of homemakers allowance. What is this allowance going to cost? Will it mean the introduction of income splitting, as mooted by the coalition in the last election as part of a tax package that would have had to be funded with a $2.5 billion cut in services? Senator Hill should remember, as should Senator Newman when she returns to the chamber, that income splitting was rejected by the Women's Tax Convention, as was a commitment to cutbacks in public expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a number of concerns about what the coalition government would do if it were ever given the chance to implement its policies regarding the status of women. We hear a lot of rhetoric from Senator Hill. Frankly, I believe that he would like to do more than his Party and the coalition would probably be able to do. We know that the Liberal Party does have progressive small `l' liberals. We know that spokespeople, like Senator Peter Baume and Mr Ian Macphee, have a very high regard for the issues which the Government sees as very important in raising the status of women. I believe that Senator Hill has the same kind of commitment, but the problem for Senator Hill, Senator Baume and Ian Macphee is that they have to contend with the troglodytes from the National Party of Australia-and I do not include Senator Bjelke-Petersen in that remark. I think on International Women's Day 1989 there is a great deal which women can look forward to under a Labor Government, but there are many uncertainties if a coalition government were to be elected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion before the Senate states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate, on International Women's Day:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) applauds the efforts of farsighted and courageous women who have worked to improve the status of other women;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) pleges itself to full recognition of the contribution of women in the family and in the community and to continue to work to improve the status of women towards the goal of true economic, educational and social equality;</PARA>

<PARA> (d) notes that true equality of opportunity includes the freedom of choice of women to support children outside of paid employment and that such a choice requires greater recognition and support of the unpaid work of mothers. </PARA>
<PARA>Certainly, there is not going to be any argument from the Australian Democrats on any of those points. Senator Hill will have to realise that far more than mere words is needed to secure the vote of women across the country if the Opposition parties wish to gain government. Just as Mr Hawke's rather patronising comments last week, ordering his Ministers to clean up their language so that they can continue to appeal to women voters, will not work, neither will the Opposition's words in this motion convince most women-especially those on low incomes, those who are sole supporting parents and those working women blamed by the conservative forces for youth unemployment-that the Liberals are really committed to equality. He will have to do much more than simply moving a motion on International Women's Day which says, `We have still got a long way to go', and praising the efforts of those people who have got women where they are today. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill ran through a list of women who have been elected to parliament, pointing out that until well into the fifties most of them belonged to the Nationalist Party or the United Australia Party. However, I would also point out that one of those women, namely Joyce Steele-not, I might add, as Senator Hill said, Jessie Steele-was elected to the Legislative Council in South Australia in 1956. However, she had to face a challenge by another member of the Liberal Party who argued that women were not `persons' under the meaning of the Act. That sort of thing has happened before. In 1907, a judge in Western Australia ruled that women could not be lawyers or notaries public because the legislation said that persons who had achieved the academic qualifications could go into the professions and that women were not defined as persons. He argued that if the parliament had wanted them to be defined as persons such a definition would have been in the legislation. He therefore threw out the request by the women who had qualified, as a lawyer, to engage in their profession. That was bad enough for 1907, and on numbers of occasions something similar has happened in Britain and the United States, but the Liberal Party pulled the same trick in 1956. The number of women in the parliaments around Australia who come from the Liberal and National parties has not improved a great deal since then. There is one only in the House of Representatives. Certainly, there is a fair share, and a high quality share, of women in the Senate, but if honourable senators look at the chamber parties which form government around Australia they will see that there are very few women indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no good Senator Hill patting himself and his Party on the back for establishing child-care facilities either, when for years when they were in government they allowed businessmen to claim lunches as a tax deduction and refused to amend section 51a of the Income Tax Assessment Act so that child-care could be a tax deduction or rebatable. The fact of the matter is that in this country, like most other countries, more women than men live in poverty, women are worse off economically than men after divorce, and the majority of children living below the poverty line are living in single parent families headed by women. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am on the question of single parent families, I wish to scotch for all time the belief that is very strongly held in the community, particularly among conservative forces, that sole supporting parents are almost entirely a group of women made up of nymphomaniac teenagers who wander around this country getting pregnant on an annual basis, probably to different men, in order to become millionaires on the sole supporting parent benefit. There is a myth in the community that somebody on a sole supporting parent benefit has never been married and behaves in a highly immoral way simply in order to live off the welfare system. That is not the case, yet there is still prejudice and antipathy towards women who are raising children on their own. Certainly, they are given none of the assistance-nothing similar, for example, to the dependent spouse rebate-that is given to a husband whose wife is able to stay at home and look after the children. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with Senator Hill that we need to acknowledge the far-sightedness and the courage of women who have worked to get other women into the position that they are in today. It is a very great pity indeed that more young women today-and at my advanced age I refer to young women as those under the age of 35 basically, but certainly those under the age of 25--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No; I am talking about the legal right to be elected, not the actual fact of being elected. The right to vote was not something that was given to women because Kingston in South Australia or anybody else thought that women should, as a matter of principle, be given the vote. Women were given the vote because they were expected to vote conservatively and to keep a conservative government in power-and that, of course, was what happened for a long time. There was no altruism in that little bit of legislation, but we got the vote anyway, around the country and slowly around the world. Women fought to be given the right to have access to a university education despite pamphleteers, politicians and medical professionals who said that if women were given the right to have access to a university education it was going to cause all sorts of physical and social problems like atrophy of the uterus, that it would impede lactation and cause marital and nervous breakdowns. They had to fight this sort of prejudice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Women had to fight for the right to own property after marriage. In fact, it was something like 1935 before Tasmanian women were given that right, but again the argument was that women did not have the right or, indeed, the capacity, to look after their own property, property which they brought with them into the marriage, including children. Women had to fight to be given the right to keep their children after divorce. They had to fight for the right to be employed after marriage and the right to equal pay. I do not think there is a woman in this chamber who does not recall starting work in an era when, if she was with the public sector, she had, on marriage, to resign from the permanent working force and become temporary staff or, if she was in the private sector, she was fired outright and when, in all the professions, a woman doing the same job as a man was paid less. We still do not have things like equal pay for work of equal value, and that is a sore point in a number of female dominated professions such as the nursing profession, speech therapy and so on, and women are paid a lot less than men in some other jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Women had to fight through things like the sex discrimination legislation and the affirmative action legislation for the right to access to finance in their own right instead of having to find a male guarantor. We have had to fight for things like government subsidised, and hence affordable, child-care, rape crisis centres and women's shelters generally. We are still fighting for the right not to have to leave our own home with our children in the event of domestic violence. I am not sure that we have yet achieved the right to be regarded as intelligent, capable, multitalented members of the human race. We certainly do not appear to have achieved it if we read some of the things that are said about women by members of the business community or the unions. For example, last week's Bulletin quoted a response from somebody in the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) who, when asked if there were any women on its board, responded with a very concise and rather terse, to say nothing of horrified, `God, no!'. Why have women on the board of BHP!</PARA>

So I say to Senator Hill: yes we are indebted to women such as the Pankhursts and others who faced ridicule, harassment, gaol, force feeding and an assortment of other indignities in order to win the fight for women to vote, to be regarded, at least in that part of the social system, as equal. In Australia we can thank women such as Rose Scott and Vida Goldstein for leading the fight and then being prepared to be role models-not an easy task for anybody moving into a new situation-because they too had to face the abuse and the antagonism directed against them. It does take courage to swim against the tide and these women deserve our thanks and our remembrance for changing laws which discriminated against women as a whole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been very disturbing indeed in this chamber occasionally to see the number of women on the conservative benches-who would not be here if other women had not fought to change the law, rather than waiting for social attitudes to catch up with it-argue that we should not use the law to improve the status of women any more; that the sex discrimination legislation and the affirmative action legislation were social engineering because not all Australians were unified in wanting it. As I have said, these women would not have been here if, over the last 80 years, laws had not been changed to give them access to this chamber. I might add that this says nothing of one of Senator Hill's male colleagues who argued in 1983 that the Sex Discrimination Act was imposing `compulsory close cohabitation' on men and women in the work force, and he got his knickers into a right twist in this place.

<PARA>The Minister-</PARA>
<PARA>who in those days was Senator Susan Ryan-</PARA>
<PARA>would be aware that great difficulties have been created by close proximity working relationships between men and women. </PARA>
<PARA>Prior to this little piece of wisdom, I might add, he had complained about Telecom workers working underground with poles between them and the fact that long distance truck drivers were going to have somebody of the opposite sex sleeping in the cabin as they drove between Melbourne and Perth. However, this was the one that outdid the lot:</PARA>
<PARA>Frequently, marriages of members of parliament and of staff have broken up as a result purely and simply of the close proximity of the couples working together. A sexual relationship may not necessarily develop. </PARA>
<PARA>Not, by the way, if we listen to half the rumours that go around this place. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA>I have tried to explain to the Minister, but she apparently does not seem able to grasp it, that a wife who is at home caring for three or four children, trying to get them off to school and trying to keep them clean, is aware that her husband is at work surrounded by glamorous women who may very well be endeavouring to use their guile to woo him in some way. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know how you feel about that, Florence, but it worries me a lot. The honourable senator continued:</PARA>
<PARA>It is a matter of grave concern to many women in this country that their husbands may in some way be subjected to improper influences. It is a fact of life that that happens, and it is one of the causes for the break up of such marriages. </PARA>
<PARA> All I am suggesting to the Minister is that if an employer can see that a difficult situation might arise as a result of such circumstances, and if he can establish that it is reasonable in all the circumstances to discriminate, he ought to be entitled to make that discrimination. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No names, no pack drill, Senator. It seems to me that, notwithstanding Senator Hill's motion today, we still have a long way to go. Senator Hill raised in his motion questions about the recognition of the contribution of women in the family; the need for true equality between the sexes; and the need to recognise and support the unpaid work of mothers. There is no question at all that those things need to occur, yet in many cases they can be achieved only by changes in this place. I remind Senator Hill that, for women to have true educational equality, they need to have equal access to education. Things such as the imposition of a tertiary tax, to say nothing of the full fees that a Liberal government would impose, will not go any way towards helping women to get into the work force through improved education; nor, might I add, do things such as taking 45-year-old women off the class B widows pension when their youngest child turns 16 and putting them on unemployment benefit help them achieve employment, economic equality or an improved self-esteem. Yet the Opposition supported the Government's move to do just that. Taking 15-year-old children off Austudy when they are in years 11 and 12 will not help either the young girls in that category or the mothers who are trying to keep them at school in order to give them a better chance. Yet the Opposition supported the Government's moves in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> None of this goes close to matching an attempt by the Fraser Government to seriously penalise women caring for children at home through its attempt to ram through this Parliament what was called then the `wives of strikers legislation'-an attempt by the Fraser Government to penalise the wives and children of men who were on strike by cutting off their access to social security benefits, as if somehow those women and children were in a position to influence the decisions made by their menfolk at or out of the workplace. It still appears that members of the Opposition favour the payment of something like the dependent spouse rebate to the husband and that they regard it as more important than the payment of the family allowance to the wife; otherwise, why do they continue to talk about that while at the same time supporting the Government's heavier means testing on the family allowance? There is more to it than simply talking about the need to achieve true educational, social and economic equality for women. Supporting or opposing legislation in this place is one of the things Opposition senators need to look at. </PARA>
<PARA> Maybe the Opposition could go some way towards introducing true equality among the sexes by talking to some of its mates in big business and in the advertising industry, so that women are no longer depicted in the sort of sexual stereotypical way that we see so often when we turn on the television, listen to the radio, or turn the pages of magazines that have advertisements for fax machines consisting primarily of the long legs of what one presumes is an attractive model. </PARA>

In between times the men in this chamber might like to look at their own actions with regard to the way they talk about and treat their wives, their daughters and their female staff. There should be a bit of soul searching about their own sharing of work in the home, their own encouragement of their daughters to take advantage of the opportunities that Senator Hill says are so important and that are now available to them, and a recognition perhaps that they could not do any of their own work in this chamber or outside if it were it not for the research and secretarial work of their female as well as their male staff.

<PARA> I think the last part of Senator Hill's motion is vitally important. It is about time that recognition and support of the unpaid work of mothers, indeed, unpaid work overall, was acknowledged in this country. It will never be done until we confront Australia's system of national accounts, based as it is on the United Nations system of national accounts which arbitrarily defines as productive only those activities for which money changes hands. Until we challenge that, we will remain in the situation where gross domestic product in most countries that use the United Nations system of national accounts ignores the role of women in the home, to say nothing of voluntary workers, male or female. Any unpaid work will be regarded as irrelevant because it is considered non-productive as far as the arbitrary definition of gross domestic product (GDP) is concerned. It is what is included in GDP that determines government allocation of resources. We can have some of the biggest companies in this country paying no tax but being regarded as productive and getting tax concessions, subsidies and other benefits from governments, while women at home see themselves as being on the end of spending cuts time and again because they are regarded as being non-productive. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a vision of a bunch of women at a kindergarten one morning getting together and one saying, `Look, we have got to do something about this. What say, after we've dropped the children off, I come back and I go into your house and I will do your cooking, your cleaning and your shopping?'. I will leave out the rest of the marital obligations for the time being. `You will pay me for that. While I am doing your housework, you can go next door to Beatrix's house and you can do her cooking, cleaning, shopping and mind the baby, and she will pay you for that. By the time we have got around the block, everybody will have been paid for the work they normally do for nothing. GDP will have blown out of all perspective and maybe there will be a recognition that what women do in the home for nothing is productive'. Maybe when that happens we will not see governments of all persuasions arguing that when we are in a tight spot economically it can cut welfare payments, payments to families, payments and funding for education, health care and housing. We will never see any improvement in the status of women, the standard of their living, their economic or educational equality until we recognise that unpaid work is as productive as, and frequently more productive than, some of the paid work that is done in this country and around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The economists will say, `But we can't do that'. Economists are always saying we cannot do things. But they did it for home ownership. If somebody buys a home to rent out, money is changing hands. Money is being earned. Rental property is defined as productive. Living under the roof of one's own house is not defined as productive because one is not earning any money from it. That would have distorted the GDP in most Western countries which have high home ownership levels. What did the economists do? They imputed a value for home ownership. They said, `What would it have earned had it been rented out?'. Why can we not do that for the unpaid work done by women in the home? Insurance companies do when they want to encourage men to take out walloping great insurance policies in the event of the death of a spouse. Most of them have argued that $30,000 is what it would cost to pay someone to do what women do in the house on an annual basis for nothing. So why do we not do as Senator Hill suggests and give recognition and support to the unpaid work done by mothers in the home, impute a value to it and recognise that it is productive and valuable by including it in the gross domestic product? We will then be able to justify allocating the resources necessary to those women to give them real choice about whether to work, full or part time, in the paid work force or whether to stay at home. Then and only then will women have real status, real equality and real economic and other viability. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I personally feel grateful to Senator Hill for proposing this notice of motion and then organising to have it brought on as a debate this morning. It gives us the opportunity to speak once again-for the third time in just a week, which is quite extraordinary-about the status of women in Australia. It occurs to me that, particularly on this side of the House, we do not do very much talking about our achievements in relation to the status of women. We are actually too busy undertaking and carefully implementing the measures that have been carefully thought through during the course of many years and during this decade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a chance, of course, to remind the Senate and the people of Australia of the status of women and the ways in which the Hawke Government has taken up the challenge to raise that status. Many of the issues covered in the notice of motion have already been debated very effectively this morning by the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women (Senator Reynolds). Senator Haines has also contributed a very fine analysis, particularly of the way in which the status of women has changed over the years. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take up the points that Senator Hill made about applauding the efforts of far-sighted and courageous women and recognising the achievements of the women's movement. I have no intention of taking any partisan approach to this. I will concentrate mostly on women who have been particularly prominent in the Australian feminist movement, going back to the turn of the century. I suppose Vida Goldstein was one of the women who were most prominent then. She stood for the Senate very early in the century. She was not successful but she led very many important debates in Australia and travelled overseas as well. She obtained a place for Australian women via the League of Women Voters at the International Alliance of Suffragists. There were Australian women working in the suffrage movement in England earlier this century. One of them, of course, was Dora Meeson, who painted our wonderful banner-the `Trust the Women, Mother' banner-that came home to Australia during the bicentennial year. Another Australian woman who was in London was a Western Australian, Muriel Miller, who floated over Westminster in a hot air balloon crying out through a megaphone, `Votes for women'. She was imprisoned for that little piece of activism. But she came back to Western Australia, worked in a country school and taught, amongst her little pupils, Irene Adelaide Driver, who became Irene Greenwood, a remarkable woman who has worked all of her long life for feminism and peace. Her great talents and wisdom were recognised by her appointment to the International Women's Year Committee in 1974 during the time of the Whitlam Government. She has also been honoured by an honorary doctorate, by an Order of Australia, by having a State ship named after her and by being awarded a United Nations medal for peace. </PARA>
<PARA> Marion Phillips is another woman who went from Australia to London. An economist, she became very influential in the British Labour Party and organised women as part of that mass party. She became one of the first women members of the British House of Commons in 1929. Unfortunately she died only three years later. Her obituary bemoaned the fact that she had concentrated her not inconsiderable talents simply on issues of concern to women. Muriel Heagney, of Victoria, was at the first International Labour Organisation meetings in Geneva in 1919. One of the very few women who were prominent at the Australian Council of Trade Union (ACTU) level, she did a great deal there to sensitise the otherwise male hegemony to women's issues. In the 1930s she wrote a book entitled Are Women Taking Men's Jobs? Her work was commemorated by the fact that the first ACTU child-care centre which was opened in 1982 at Moorabbin was named in her honour. </PARA>
<PARA> Jessie Street is a name that is well known to Australian women these days, particularly as the celebrations of the centenary of her birth are gaining momentum. In 1948 Jessie Street was at the United Nations-once again, one of the very few women there. As a result of her efforts, and others-but she was one of the leading lights among the women's contingent-the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights includes sex as one of the elements in ensuring the rights of individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> Among other women who where very influential early in the century were writers and artists of various kinds. In a new book called Courage a Grace, a biography of Mary Gilmour by W. H. Wilde, there is an account of how Mary went daily to the Worker office in the city. During 1912 she brought out a series on the lot of women and I read from a catalogue of the issues which she covered: the prostitutes who were rigorously treated by the law while the male customers went free and blameless; the married women whose lives were an endless round of child bearing; the right of women to retain their maiden names in marriage if they so chose, and not to have to promise to obey in the marriage service; the need to reform the divorce laws to make them more equitable for women; the difficult life of women on the land; equality of opportunity and equality of wages for women in employment; the need for financial assistance for unemployed women; and her main crusade which was for the maternity grant-the baby bonus that was introduced by the Labor Government of Andrew Fisher in 1912. </PARA>
<PARA> I recommend strongly that Senator Hill and others add to their obligatory reading a book called 200 Australian Women edited by Heather Radi. They will not find reference to Irene Greenwood because she is still alive, but it is an extremely valuable and very easily accessible book put together as a bicentennial project by women historians from all around Australia. I was delighted to hear Senator Hill quote from Joyce Stevens's excellent account of International Women's Day, which we are celebrating today. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that we should put on record the excellent contributions that have been made by the women who have been involved in one way or another with the structures that have been developed by both coalition and Labor governments in Australia over the last 20 years and whose names, I believe, should be honoured, particularly on this day. We go back to the days of the Whitlam Government and the appointment of Elizabeth Reid-the first time ever that a female adviser had been appointed in an Australian government. I pay great tribute to her pioneering work in that extremely difficult and demanding job. Elizabeth was followed by Sara Dowse in a role that had changed somewhat by then, and then by Kath Tapperell. When the Australian Labor Party returned to government in 1983, we restored the Office of the Status of Women to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, led successively by Anne Summers, Sue Brooks and Helen L'Orange. On the non-government side, a fine advisory committee was appointed for International Women's Year in the mid-1970s under the chairwomanship of Elizabeth Reid, comprising such luminaries as Irene Greenwood, Margaret Whitlam and Susan Ryan. </PARA>
<PARA> The advisory committee set up during the time of the Fraser Government, under Beryl Beaurepaire, as has been mentioned this morning, was extremely valuable. I think that Beryl Beaurepaire's place as the convener of that committee should be recognised as a very fine contribution to the status of women in Australia. Beryl Beaurepaire was succeeded by Quentin Bryce, another extremely prominent woman in non-governmental politics. When the National Women's Consultative Council was set up by the Hawke Government as a means of representing, for the first time, non-governmental organisations at the national level so they could give their advice to the Government, Edith Hall chaired that for the first two terms of its existence and was succeeded by Anne Byrne. </PARA>
<PARA> Because there has been a litany of Liberal-National Party women, I would also like to pay tribute to Edith Cowan, the first woman ever elected to an Australian parliament, in 1921, and to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that in 1923 Edith Cowan introduced into the Western Australian Parliament a sex discrimination Bill which became an Act and is still on the books. The effect of that Bill was to make it possible for women to enter into the professions. The first, palpable practical effect was to allow women to become barristers. I also pay tribute to Dorothy Tangney who entered the Federal Parliament from Western Australia in 1943 as the first woman senator. She was in that position for 25 years. During those years she was one of the very few women in the Federal Parliament. She did not have the great advantage that we women parliamentarians have these days of the support, company and encouragement of our fellow female parliamentarians. </PARA>
<PARA> I realise that this debate, despite its importance, is seen to be taking up the time of the Senate which many people would prefer to see spent on legislation, but I wish to pick up a couple of points made by Senator Hill when he gave us an account of the achievements of coalition governments in relation to the status of women. The Child Care Bill was introduced by Mr Peacock, I believe, in 1972 in the dying days of the McMahon Government. I remember listening to the debate on the radio. If I recall rightly, the effect of that legislation was to provide subsidies, chiefly to industry to set up its own child-care centres. I do not deny that that was a progressive move at that time. Unfortunately, the credit which the then Government might have received from that move was totally nullified by the fact that, at the same time, the McMahon Government opposed the equal pay case before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. When the Whitlam Government was elected at the end of 1972, one of its first actions was to call for the reopening of the equal pay case, which was supported by the Whit- lam Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that the Opposition did a number of important things in 1976. Unfortunately, what it did to the Office of the Status of Women was reduce its status. The Minister who had responsibility for the status of women was not the Prime Minister, as was the case at the time of the Whitlam Government and as has been the case again since the Hawke Government: it was reduced to the portfolio of one of the most junior Ministers whose other responsibilities were museums and shipwrecks. That did not go down particularly well with Australian women. </PARA>
<PARA> A point I wish to make quite strongly is that structures that have been developed, principally by the Labor Party, are very highly regarded internationally. We would be very grateful to have some sort of indication from the coalition of its attitude to those structures-for example, the ways in which we have made it imperative for secretaries of government departments to consult at regular intervals with the Office of the Status of Women. Each year we require a report from each department to be incorporated in our women's budget. This is an official Government document. We have a method, through our National Women's Consultative Council, of consulting with the non-government organisations, which have such an enormous amount to contribute from their collective wisdom, experience and talent. We do not `do' things to women; we work with women, through the Government and through our consultative mechanisms, to discover what they believe we should be doing to enhance their status. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said when I started my speech, we have a program which does not start just with a headline-and that is it. We have programs that started years ago, that are continuing and that will continue into the future. The implications of many of those programs are very difficult to quantify, but I have no doubt that the fact, for example, that we have been able to persuade young women to stay at school and complete their secondary education and thus prepare them- selves much better for the rest of their lives is one of our most important achievements. The effects of that will go on, possibly for ever. We can look to a future where our children and our grandchildren have a vastly improved range of genuine options open to them. No matter how conservative or radical any woman is, she cannot deny that her children, her grandchildren and her nieces will have a greater range of opportunities in their lives, opportunities that will open up the chances they will have to support themselves, to achieve independence and to ensure that their own children have a better range of opportunities. This process is never-ending and it gives us all a great deal of satisfaction. </PARA>

I certainly agree with what Senator Haines said, that there should be equal pay for equal work. That is very important. </PARA>
<PARA> International Women's Day is an excellent opportunity to recognise not only the women who have risen to prominence in this country but also those quiet achievers, the many women across this nation who maintain the homes and keep the families together. It is their achievements, so often forgotten in all the statistics and studies into society, that we should remember. Too often, we take too few opportunities for reflection and self-analysis. It seems to me that we can use this occasion of International Women's Day well if we allow time for some thought to be given to the direction and part we want women to play in improving the lives of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take this opportunity to reflect on the achievements in the lives of some of the women who have been central to the growth of society as we know it today, and not necessarily politicians. One woman I would like to pay a tribute to is Sister Kenny, who led the fight to give substantial help to victims of polio. Her treatment was revolutionary in her day but it was successful. I can speak in a personal way of this because my husband had polio at the age of eight. In those days that illness could have proved fatal but because of Sister Kenny's treatment he was left with only a small limp. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to refer to other women. Nurse Edith Cavill was killed for her part in helping troops to escape in World War I. I want to pay a tribute to all the nurses and servicemen who have played a part in helping to keep Australia free over the years and those members of the forces who will continue to do so. Recently we witnessed the achievement of our around the world solo sailor, Kay Cottee, who took on in her boat Blackmore's First Lady not only the physical hardship of the task she set but nature itself, the elements, loneliness, hunger and boredom. She proved that she could achieve in her own right. Now she is busy raising money for life education centres in their fight against drugs. This is another real achievement by a woman who is playing a very vital and important role in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I could talk, too, about Lady Cilento, known to so many people as `medical mother'. She believed in vitamins when not all doctors agreed with her. I do not know whether Senator Peter Baume would agree with all her ideas about vitamins but her patients swore by her and her methods. </PARA>

<PARA> Many women have forged a path in political and public life. As a Queenslander, I would like to pay a tribute to Dame Annabelle Rankin, a senator from my own State of Queensland, who eventually became the first woman party Whip in the Federal Parliament. She was a well-loved politician right throughout our State. But perhaps the most outstanding woman in this field was Dame Enid Lyons, from Tasmania. Senator Hill referred to her earlier, so I will limit what I have to say about her. Not only was she the wife of a Prime Minister but also she raised a family of 11 children. She was the first woman elected to the House of Representatives and the first woman appointed to Cabinet, as Vice-President of the Executive Council. She saw an opportunity to be of service to the nation in another capacity and by doing so she took a big step forward for the women of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> All these women have been to the forefront; they have been in the public eye. But there are others we should recognise on a day like today, others who perhaps have made a far greater and as yet unrecognised contribution to the Australia of today. They are the quiet achievers in the home, in the suburbs, in the country towns and on out- lying properties who work tirelessly to maintain the family unit. The family has been the basic unit of Australian society, despite the great changes that have taken place in recent decades, and all the evidence indicates that the family will continue to be so. It is true that behind every great and humble man there is a mother upholding the values of the family. </PARA>
<PARA> The development of the pastoral lands and the opening up of the outback have depended very largely on the robustness and stability of family life and the often unacknowledged courage of the wives of station owners and workers who had to put up as best they could with the isolation and loneliness, the lack of amenities, remoteness from medical care and social and cultural deprivation. </PARA>
<PARA> Most Australian families are urban dwellers-that is obvious from the statistics-and are unfamiliar with the hardships and problems that are still the lot of country folk, despite the vast improvement in their living conditions. I guess I am lucky that although I live in the country I am only a five-minute drive from our town of Kingaroy. But not everybody is so fortunate. Urban life increases the vulnerability of family life to social problems that undermine the family-problems such as peer pressures, competitiveness, the quest for status, the acquisition of goods, domestic and street violence and drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> In earlier days the family was closely knit and its extended members remained in close touch with each other. Increasing mobility in society regretfully breaks up these close networks, as people move from one part of the continent to another and even overseas. There has been greater exposure to hostile social forces which are increasing rather than diminishing. I speak here of the loss of work opportunity, increasing poverty, a widening gap between the affluent and the needy, violence in society as well as in the family, the threat of war and a prevalent sense of apprehension, acquisitiveness and the search for immediate gratification. Yet throughout all this the family with its pivotal head, the mother, persists. The truth is that the family, large or small, as I said before, is the basic unit of society, and the health of society depends ultimately on the stability, well-being and harmonious functioning of that unit. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there are the migrant women: those who came in the 1940s and 1950s who were largely of European extraction; and those who came later in the 1960s and 1970s, who were, in the majority, from Asian backgrounds. They are the quiet women working behind the scenes in most migrant families, where they ensure the continuation of the importance of cultural and family values. They have helped to maintain the integrity of the family. It was once said that civilisation can be lost in a single generation if the value systems are not preserved and passed on through the family. </PARA>
<PARA> While speaking on this International Women's Day, I want to recognise the importance of rural women in the outback: the women who spend many hours of loneliness doing back-breaking work; the women who have stood side by side with their husbands clearing the land, tending the animals, fighting the elements and then turning to their homes to make them nurturing hearths for their families. These families are being penalised today. They are suffering at the hands of people who fail to recognise the contribution given to society by those in the outback. They should not be penalised by what is sometimes called the tyranny of distance. I say once again that I hope that this Government will reconsider the position of women in those areas. They do not have the opportunity to send their children to conveniently located neighbourhood schools, enjoy good roads or have access to modern conveniences that are not provided to isolated families. I wonder when the Government will recognise that, in farming, by its very nature, liquidity is a major problem and that many farmers do not have the means to afford the cost of schooling. By the discriminatory nature of the assets test on the isolated children's assistance scheme, rural children have been forgotten. They have been given no help and no hope. </PARA>

I believe that discrimination now exists for geographically isolated families. We need to ensure that children in the country have the right to education-and not only the boys but also the girls.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to pay tribute to many of my women colleagues in the Parliament, particularly the Senate. They are playing their part as they see it in their own way, though I confess there are times when I do not always see eye to eye with them, in the same way that Senator Crowley just indicated that she did not quite see eye to eye with what I was saying. I remember that when I was first elected to this Parliament many people would say to me, `You must be busy now that you are a working woman'. In my opinion I was a working woman before I came to the Senate. I was proud of my family, of being there for my children, working on the school committees and tuckshops and, of course, looking after the home. </PARA>
<PARA> I am interested in the fourth part of Senator Hill's motion, which talks about greater recognition and support for the unpaid work of mothers. It has been assessed that if a woman was paid for all her working hours at home-the washing, ironing, cleaning, cooking and shopping that we were reminded of before, and looking after the family-she would be worth $38,000 a year. I know that because of the part that I have played in the home many of the worries and interests of these women are similar to mine. However, I remind my colleagues that we are here as women senators representing not only women's interests but also those of men, children, families and singles. </PARA>
<PARA> Many times government pieces of affirmative action-type policies are claimed to represent the interests of the average woman in Australia. However, the implication of these theories is that women are not already fulfilling their roles as citizens unless they are in the work force-an implication I strongly reject. I accept that many women are out in the work force because of economic necessity and because one income cannot meet rising costs these days due to the policies of this Labor Government. Of course, there are some women in the work force by choice, and I suppose I could say that I am one of those. I want to point out today that women who are at home looking after families are already in the work force doing an excellent job training children. These women are unpaid educators, unpaid psychologists, nurses, doctors, financial planners, administrators, mechanics, teachers, trainers and counsellors in our society. On this International Women's Day I am happy to pay tribute to them all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that Senator Hill recognises in his motion:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> True equality of opportunity includes freedom of choice of women to support children outside of paid employment. </PARA>
<PARA>To my mind the other side of that choice-or the obverse-is the freedom of women to make two other choices: the choice whether or not to have children at all and the choice to work and support or to assist in supporting children or to work simply because they wish to, regardless of economic circumstances. The question of choices of this nature is necessarily linked to the opportunity for women and girls to have a full education, both at school and in later life. That education must include the right to education about fertility and its control in the framework of full health and human relations or personal development education. Otherwise, that other choice-whether to have children at all-may not be available to them. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to focus on Liberal policy in the area of education, such that it is, in contrast with the policies and, more importantly, the record of the Hawke Labor Government in this area. But before I move to education, I want to refer briefly to another, related, point in the Liberal Party document Future Directions which, incidentally, devotes just over one page to its policies for women. This document states that women:</PARA>
<PARA>will derive a greater benefit from our policies for more flexible labour market conditions . . . </PARA>
<PARA>From what I have learned from the Opposition, both in this place and listening extensively to the radio and colleagues opposite, about the meaning of the greater flexibility in this context, it seems to me to be about breaking down working conditions and working counter to protection and against exploitation. To the extent that this does happen, women will be further disadvantaged because on the whole they have less bargaining power in the workplace. Women, particularly those who are mothers and those who have a broken work force record through looking after children and families, are more likely to be restricted as to where and what hours they work. Therefore, they are more subject to conditions which exist at the moment. If working conditions were to be further broken down under a Liberal government, as to the mobility of women, or their ability to say to the boss, `No, you might want to be flexible but this is going to disadvantage me', they will be worse off. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to pay some attention to this Future Directions document. As I said, it has barely more than a page dealing with equal opportunity for women, and there is very little elsewhere in the document referring specifically to women that I have been able to find. It talks about what the next Liberal and National government will do-and these are, I think, laudable aims. It makes these points:</PARA>
<PARA> Expand and make more flexible the higher education system;</PARA>
<PARA>But from what I have been reading recently of Liberal policies, making the higher education system more flexible will not advantage women or students in general. The document continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Promote changes in community attitudes towards acceptance of the greatest possible range of choice for female students. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, I do not remember any previous Liberal government doing very much about that at either State or Federal level. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA> Promote the acceptance of women into all kinds of apprenticeship and on-the-job training schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, there will have to be a radical change in attitudes compared with what the Liberals have done previously. I shall come in a moment to what Labor has done in that area. The next point is:</PARA>
<PARA> Encourage the development of re-training schemes, both private and government, for women whose work patterns have been broken. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, we have seen nothing under previous Liberal governments to give any support to the belief that such a thing would happen. </PARA>
<PARA> I leave that very sketchy document in order to refer to what the present Government is doing and has done in this area. The Liberal document refers also to participation in the work force. Again, the past Liberal record has not helped in that regard. On the other hand, in 1987, in terms of participation in education, 57 per cent of girls stayed on to the end of secondary school compared with only 44 per cent in 1983-at the end of the period in office of the Fraser Government. That was a significant rise. The Government has announced a target of 65 per cent retention by 1992, and some States under Labor governments are already approaching that. In 1988 women enrolled in universities and in colleges of advanced education comprised over 51 per cent of all enrolled students compared to 46 per cent when we came to power-again a significant rise. </PARA>
<PARA> There has also been expansion of women's participation in technical and further education courses. The Government is undertaking a major expansion of the higher education system from this year, and, over the triennium to 1991, 40,000 additional student places will be created. An additional 110,000 places have been created since 1983. Women have benefited and clearly will continue to benefit from greater access to the system that higher education expansion will achieve. That is one of the aims of creating those extra places. Appropriate income support is also necessary if women are to participate in higher education. The Labor Government has recognised this, and since 1983 has implemented major reforms to student assistance that have increased access to education among low income families, significantly enhanced levels of payments, and targeted extra assistance to particularly disadvantaged groups such as sole parents, who of course are mainly women, and Aboriginal women. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Policy for the Education of Girls in Australian Schools, which was launched in September 1987, is promoting increased access and educational choice for girls. This needs to be done if we are to increase, for example, the range of apprenticeships which girls enter. This national policy will also promote coordination between Commonwealth and State governments on the progress of girls in education. This is already happening. To enable women to benefit from increased participation in higher education, the Commonwealth is developing a statement of national equity goals, using the national plan of action for women in tertiary education as a base, which will identify gaps in current provisions and develop guidelines for education institutions to take up in their planning. There are also specific programs and developments which will contribute to this process. These include the allocation of $1m in the current financial year for a project designed specifically to increase the number of girls taking maths and science subjects at the secondary school level, which in the past has been a factor preventing girls from entering many of the traditionally male professions. Initiatives are also being taken in tertiary institutions to address issues such as low participation rates of girls in science, mathematics and engineering courses. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal document referred to women returning to the work force after a period outside it. Our Government has recognised that and has introduced a program called JET, which stands for jobs, education and training, a package designed specifically for sole parents who wish to return to the work force. It is an integrated and voluntary program. In other words, we are not saying to women, as has been implied by some speakers opposite, that they have to be in the paid work force. This will provide sole parents with counselling, access to education, training and employment opportunities and assistance with child-care provision. This is now getting under way, and I think will prove to be of great benefit to that group of women. </PARA>
<PARA> A major step we have taken in the advancement of women and the rights of women in the time Labor has been in government is the child support scheme. I know that there are some Opposition members who also have supported that scheme, but it did not happen until the advent of a Labor government-until somebody was prepared to grasp the nettle and explode the myths in that area, making sure that the people who create children are also responsible for their upkeep. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion moved by the Opposition, through Senator Robert Hill, being discussed today, 8 March, International Women's Day, will, we hope, enjoy unanimous support. It is a proper declaration for the Senate to be making on this day. In its various clauses it sets on record matters of history, a recognition of the contribution of many women, and an acknowledgment of the variety of contributions, whether paid employment or home making or family care, or combinations of all these.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate cannot undertake this task too often. For generations, until recently, women were not given a fair go. To use the language of some economic rationalists, they were asked to compete on a playing field which was not level. They were constrained by history, by law, by force and by their biological role. They had to fight for every small token of equality. Women had to fight for equal common law rights, for the right to own property, for the right to serve on juries. They had to fight for the vote, for the right to education, for employment, for employment security, for equal pay, for access to superannuation, for promotion, for recognition, and for power. It is amazing that so many apparently otherwise liberal people could enforce-could tolerate-a situation for so long where the talents and energies and contributions of half the population were so denied, so restricted in scope, so little recognised and so little encouraged. It is a matter of pride that so many philosophical liberals were prominent in moves-eventual moves-to correct these structural inequalities. </PARA>
<PARA> We have come a long way in just a few years. Let us think about what has happened in this Senate in the last four or five years. The debate on the Sex Discrimination Bill here in 1984 was a disgrace. The dire predictions raised in that debate in some quarters have not come to pass, of course. The debate two years later on the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Bill went a long way to redeeming that situation, and that Bill enjoyed support from all sides of this chamber. But the debate a year later on the provision of equivalent equal employment provisions for women working in Commonwealth statutory authorities was again something to be forgotten. Actually, I find it hard to forget, as it was that Bill and my determination to support it, together with a quarter of the Liberal senators here, including my colleague, Senator Hill, that led to my resignation from the shadow Cabinet and from the front bench. But that is a matter of history and not what we are looking at today. </PARA>
<PARA> We have come a long way in two years. We have in place Commonwealth equal employment opportunity legislation, where none existed before. It now covers women in the Commonwealth Public Service and in Commonwealth statutory authorities, where they were not covered before. The Liberal Party was part of the process by which equal employment opportunity legislation was developed and it assisted its passage through the Parliament. I remember that Mr Howard led for our party in the other place. Even in that debate some speeches by some parliamentarians were less than edifying, but in the light of two years experience with the working of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act, we can say that the dire predictions of some have proved to be groundless, as they knew they would, and that the Act is working. It is accepted generally and it has not led to quotas in employment. It has not required the employment of unsuitable persons and it has codified rights that all people should enjoy simply by virtue of their humanity, but rights which until the passage of the Act were not available to women as a right. </PARA>
<PARA> With the motion moved today in the Senate, we are making an affirmation of our belief in the right of all people to choose how they will develop and use their talents and to do so in a society which recognises their right to choose their role and be supported in that choice. This motion places the Senate where it should be: unanimously in support of the positions sought by women through the bitter struggles of a century and more. As the motion asserts, there is much more to do. Equally the opportunity remains the goal, not yet the reality. It is something yet to be achieved; in spite of all the progress and all the achievement, we have not yet reached that goal, but we are closer today than ever before. This motion, with its declaration of belief and purpose by the Senate today, indicates with clarity where we see the future to be. I support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As have other speakers, I also welcome the opportunity to debate on International Women's Day this motion. I just note in passing, for the benefit of those listening to a broadcast of proceedings, that many women members today looked carefully in their wardrobes so that they could come out with some apparel which reflects the feminist colours which were first used in 1908. For the record, those colours are purple, white and green. The purple symbolised dignity and, to quote from the women of that time, `that self-reverence and self-respect which renders acquiescence to political subjugation impossible'. The other colour is white, `for purity in public as well as in private life'. The other colour is green, `for hope and for the green fire of a new springtide in women's history'. Those are comments from 1908. I had a little trouble with my wardrobe so I had to resort to ribbons. Nevertheless, those are goals and aspirations of women which are reflected in International Women's Day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First, I endorse the statements that have been made about women who have gone before us and who have made contributions to politics and the wider community and Senator Bjelke-Petersen's `quiet achievers', my own mother included. I go from there to a point focused on in paragraph (c) of Senator Hill's motion, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the recognition that true equality between the sexes has yet to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA>I note the comment of a former senator, Susan Ryan, in this morning's edition of the Australian, in which she is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>It's inevitable that men will feel threatened by women's progress. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to address that issue very briefly, as our time is limited. It is a key thought for us on International Women's Day. If we want to achieve that true equality, as the motion exhorts us and as we all want, we have to address the question of how men feel about the progress of women. Some statements have already been made about earlier responses to affirmative action proposals, about whether affirmative action is working. I just draw attention to the fact that while we now have legislative affirmative action proposals and programs, an awful lot of negative action still takes place out there. For instance, last December I was appalled to pick up my copy of the Bulletin and see the cover page headline `Women take over the law'. Thinking that was wonderful, I read the article. I invite honourable senators to guess what I discovered. In that year, 1988, almost 60 per cent of law graduates at the University of Western Australia were women. Many of those graduates will practise as solicitors. The article pointed out that fewer women will become barristers. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Women are beginning to dominate the law, if not yet in status then certainly in numbers: they already monopolise the jury system-probably because they are more available-and most state police forces aim at a target of between 25 and 30% females in any intake. </PARA>
<PARA>The article pointed out that although women had long been in the legal profession, their record numbers were not reflected at the most senior levels. When I read that in Lyndall Crisp's article, I began to be sceptical about the earlier claim that women were taking over the law, and I was still on the first page of the article. I was busy at the time, so I skipped a few pages to a chart showing the numbers and positions of women in the judiciary. At the top of the same page, the article pointed out that Australia has only four female silks, or QCs. The chart showed that, of 338 QCs in Australia, only four were women. Of the 92 QCs in Victoria, there were no women and only two of the 158 QCs in New South Wales were women. Those figures are indicative of the other figures across the chart. I did not feel very much as though the big headline emblazoned across the front of the Bulletin really reflected the facts. It more particularly reflected the comment that Senator Susan Ryan was reported as making in this morning's paper:</PARA>
<PARA>It's inevitable that men will feel threatened by women's progress. </PARA>
<PARA>I regret the fact that the Bulletin article was written by a woman. I could quote many of the comments in the article by women who have achieved senior positions in the legal profession. They point out the same things that we have heard from those in other professions and which we will continue to hear. I refer to problems of attitude, for example. Justice Mathews of the New South Wales Supreme Court pointed out that a lot of incompetent men were at the Bar, fewer women, but that, when women did not achieve the utmost in competence, they were blamed in a way that their male colleagues were not. It is the same sort of line that we have heard across a number of other professions and a number of other areas. I refer also to the practical problems of women performing their caring and nurturing roles as well as being professional women. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I most want to make about the article is the fact that the newsstands of Australia sold a major magazine, one to which many people in this community turn for informed opinion, which carried a front page story saying that women were taking over the law, simply because the numbers at the lower levels were getting close to those of men and were even greater than the numbers of men at the undergraduate stage. As people concerned with issues of equity who believe that we should achieve full equality, we must be concerned not about affirmative action, but about the negative action that this sort of thing reflects. I have not read the latest issue of the Bulletin, but there is something about `Working girls and Success Bitches' on the cover. It is about a new spate of movies which are coming on. The article by another two women journalists, Lenore Nicklin and Jan McGuinness, is about women in the corporate area. It is the same story and outlines the same problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Haines quoted from the story when she pointed out that the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd is aghast that there might actually be women on its board. Again, we have to be very conscious of the fact that while there has been progress there are still many hurdles to be leapt over. I do not believe we will get over those hurdles unless we address the question of how men feel about what is happening. I do not think we can afford to leave men out of the debate. We must listen to men, talk to them and include them in discussions about this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of last year the Age magazine, Good Weekend, ran a story, written by Alan Ramsey, on women politicians. Alan Ramsey commented-and this was highlighted in a box-that he could think of only three or four women who were in the Federal Parliament for anything more than cosmetic purposes. Mind you, only one in 10 parliamentarians are women. I felt personally insulted by that comment, as should every other woman who is currently sitting in this chamber. He could not even name the four women-he could only name our colleagues Ros Kelly and Kathy Sullivan, in the other place, and Senator Haines. What does he know? He has never spoken to me. I doubt whether he even knows what I look like. I certainly do not believe I am here for cosmetic purposes. I would say that perhaps a number of male members of parliament, past and present, might only be here for cosmetic purposes. That kind of response to the struggles of women must be addressed and discussed. </PARA>
<PARA> In March 1988 Eva Cox suggested in the Age that if we really wanted to look in an economic sense at women's contribution versus men's contribution we would realise that men actually are a great cost on the community. They are involved in mass killings; they make up 90 per cent of the prison population; and they constitute 70 per cent of our alcoholics. She listed all of those facts and suggested that if we tackled the problem of the high cost of excessive masculine behaviour with a program of equitably calculated knackering, we might actually make an economic contribution to this nation. I would not want that to be the response in this debate to the attitudes of men and women. Nevertheless, the economic vision which Eva Cox has, and the economic vision which the Australian Democrats represent, must be looked at or some of the horrific attitudes to affirmative action, which apparently surfaced in debate before I came to this place, might actually win the day. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to make the point that there is evidence that women have distinct advantages over men. Recent figures from the Small Business Development Corporation in Victoria show that women are beginning new businesses at three times the rate of men and that they are achieving twice the success rate. This was attributed, in large part, to the fact that many women were beginning their businesses with the opportunity of having first looked at themselves, some of their life experiences, and then getting into something which was more appropriate. My feeling is that many men have expectations placed upon them at a very early stage of their lives. They have a one-track path down which to go in much the same way as women in the past have had expectations heaped on their shoulders and have been denied other aspects of community life. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sorry that our debating time is limited. The theme of this debate needs to be developed. I would certainly endorse Senator Hill's motion. However, bearing in mind what I have said, I think the final part of the motion, which calls for freedom of choice, must recognise that that freedom should also be available to men. The call for recognition of support for the unpaid work of mothers should also include the unpaid work of anybody who is caring and nurturing the young in our community. By recognising the unpaid work of mothers and women, and thereby making those roles more socially acceptable, we will encourage and assist men to undertake such roles. I think this is one of the impediments we face. </PARA>
<PARA> I was told a story last weekend by an equal opportunity officer, who now works as a very high-level executive in an oil company. She went into the office of one of her male colleagues who had a couple of small children sitting in the corner and a bag of shopping. She did not think it was much to comment on and she went on with her business. Soon afterwards, during the lunch break, she overheard a group of other colleagues say what disgraceful behaviour it was for their male colleague to be bringing children and shopping into the office, that it was not the done thing and that there must be something wrong with him. That happened in a major corporation in this country only a few weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA> In supporting this motion, I want to make it clear that I think our major goal has to be true equality among the sexes, because that will be to the benefit of men, women and their children. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased, on this International Women's Day, to join other senators in acknowledging the achievements of women. This is also an opportunity for me, as a member of the Labor Government, to remind Senator Hill that the document we prepared before coming into office in 1983 entitled Towards Equality focused on the needs of women. It picked up on the past achievements for women and pointed to the things that we would do-I am glad Senator Hill is nodding-and to the many things we have done. This is not a day on which we are saying, `We are going to change tack'. This is a day on which to celebrate what we have done until now, what has gone before and what will continue, as part of this Government's commitment to opportunities for women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have acknowledged all sorts of good true women from times past. One woman whose name was mentioned by Senator Powell, and whose name I would certainly want to put on the record again, is former Senator Susan Ryan who, in large part, steered through achievements for women in the last six years of the Labor Government. Anyone who was around this place at that time would know of the success, and the great battle involved, that was largely achieved by the then Senator Susan Ryan. Senator Peter Baume alluded to some of the achievements of this Government which enjoyed some bipartisan support. Certainly, the sex discrimination legislation, and later the affirmative action legislation, were based on a considerable amount of consultation by Susan Ryan to ensure that, as much as possible, all views were taken into account and that the objections that might have been raised in the debate were anticipated and dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> The affirmative action legislation was so successful precisely because of the considerable work done by the pilot committee in the years leading up to the introduction of that legislation. I believe that Senator Peter Baume was a member of that committee. I am very pleased to take the opportunity to put former Senator Susan Ryan's name on the record today as one of the great achievers for women in this country. She is part of an ongoing history of achievement for women. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take up one small point. Senator Bjelke-Petersen talked about women as quiet achievers. I would like to put on record my endorsement for the noisy ones. Women are very often encouraged to be docile, quiet, submissive and peaceful and are even celebrated as quiet achievers. I am not suggesting that we all rush around breaking chairs or shouting, but women are not just quiet, docile, passive, submissive creatures. </PARA>
<PARA> One small example is the number of gold medals won by individual Australian athletes. The last time I looked, I found that women outnumbered men-10 out of 13 medals had gone to women. So, they certainly can run, although it could be said that they were not talking while they were doing so. But women are strong, capable, fit, bold and tough. Some of those points are perhaps alluded to in the first point of this motion, but I need to make it clear that we need to celebrate women in terms of all their activities, representations and capacities. Women did not pioneer Australia by wimping around, taking instructions from people. They did it by having initiative, by having gumption and by having oomph. I certainly want to see those words applied to women. </PARA>
<PARA> Women have achieved in sport, inventions, building, architecture, writing and drama. They have achieved in all areas of activity, both in this country and overseas. What they have not had is suitable recognition. They have very often been written out of history. There has been a campaign to denigrate the achievements of women in a constant effort to reduce them to quiet, docile little creatures. I would ask Senator Bjelke-Petersen to check who really did the work in establishing the merino in Australia. Any record would suggest that Mrs Macarthur was at home to do the work while Mr Macarthur was in England. Proper records do acknowledge Elizabeth Macarthur in the history of the establishment of the merino. I will not go through all those achievements because I want to make two other points that are probably more important than running through a litany. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill moved this motion, which seems to say what a good thing it is to have women, how proud we are of them and what a lot of important things they have done, and then took the opportunity to bore it up the Government for failing to do all the things that it is supposed to be doing for women. He said that perhaps it had done some but that was not enough or perhaps it had done some and they were contradictory. Senator Hill had better get it straight. He has ducked and twisted in saying what he would do to improve the lot of women, but he seems to want to do nothing more than criticise us for what we have done. He suggests that where we have achieved it is not substantial; where we have not achieved it is not enough. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to point out, by way of evidence, that that is not the view of everybody on the other side. Senator Chaney, speaking in this place on the Appropriation Bills, as recorded on page 2632 of the Senate Weekly Hansard, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> With respect to assistance to families, I condemn the Government for the fact that the only families it has been prepared to help have been those on the lowest incomes. </PARA>
<PARA>Having condemned us for having our priorities right, he then condemns us for actually assisting families. I can take that condemnation because clearly Senator Chaney was saying-those opposite have also said it in Future Directions-that this Government has tried to protect only families at the bottom end. He then says that we have not done much for families. He said that we have done it, and then he says that we have not done it. I ask him please to make up his mind. Families on the lowest end of the income scale in this country know what benefits they have had under this Labor Government. This Government has made it a priority to ensure the economic advantages and protection of those people. Payments for children have dramatically increased under this Government-not for all children because of a recognition of the economic constraints of the time, but for the children of families at the lowest end of the income scale. As part of our commitment to try to help those children out of poverty the Government quite clearly has made this area the focus of its contributions. Those opposite recognise those contributions and then say that we have not made them. It is a contradiction inherent in this motion and in all that Senator Hill has had to say. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators opposite say that we have not done much for the economic advantage of women. What about the increased opportunities for education? What about the retention rate, which has gone from 30 per cent plus to well over 60 per cent in the State of South Australia? What about the fact that more than 50 per cent of students finishing year 12 are girls? What about the fact that more than 50 per cent of people in tertiary colleges are women for the first time ever? I say again, just to see the hackles rise and hear the abuse start, that the achievement of a labour force participation rate for women of more than 50 per cent is a huge success. We need only ask the women who now have job opportunities. They may be there out of economic necessity, but they would much rather have a job than be at home on unemployment benefit or the single parent pension and that kind of restricted income. They are making their choice. They are saying, `We prefer those advantages'. Besides, if I listened to the Opposition, I could presume that all women are in the work force because of economic constriction. That is a very insulting remark to the many women who have chosen to go to work for whatever reason. It is not for me to say that their reasons are right or wrong; it is for them to make that choice. We have provided that opportunity. Of the one and a quarter million jobs provided since 1983, 58 per cent have been taken by women. That is advantaging women economically. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Newman comes into this place and says by way of interjection, `Why aren't you doing more about child-care for the defence forces?', and at the same time endorses a policy that does not want government expenditure. What kind of child-care does she want in the defence forces? I understand that she is advocating government expenditure. Are defence forces walled around in Senator Newman's thinking? She wants child-care for the Defence Force spouses and she does not want women to go to work. Are Defence Force spouses some kind of new category? That is another contradiction in Senator Newman's paper and thinking. If she understood our child-care policy, she would know that since its beginning we have argued for a range of options in the child care area so that women who are principally at home can use the occasional care provisions which give them the opportunity to do many things that women do-we all know them; they have been listed today-without having to go into the full time work force. Other women in full time work or part time work use child-care provisions to ensure that they have comprehensive quality child-care that is accessible and affordable under our child-care program. This enables them to enjoy their work knowing that their children are being adequately cared for. That assists them economically. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not understand the Opposition forever telling us that we are not concerned about the economic conditions for women. Yes, we are, and, yes, more remains to be done. There is the challenge, but that is not something that we shrink from; it is something that will be a continuing part of our commitment to women and policies for women and our recognition of the rights and the dignity of women, their strength and their opportunities. These things are all endorsed in some way in Senator Hill's motion. In offering to support the motion, I would have to say that I hope at a later date we have more opportunity to debate what I think are, in effect, inherent contradictions within it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great pleasure that I support the motion moved by my colleague Senator Hill on this International Women's Day. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate, on International Women's Day-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) applauds the efforts of farsighted and cour- ageous women who have worked to improve the status of other women;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) pledges to fully recognise the contribution of women in the family and in the community and to continue to work to improve the status of women towards the goal of true economic, educational and social equality;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) recognises the achievements of the women's movement and those who have supported improvement in the status of women, but acknowledges that true equality between the sexes has yet to be achieved; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) notes that true equality of opportunity includes the freedom of choice of women to support children outside of paid employment and that such a choice requires greater recognition of and support for the unpaid work of mothers. </PARA>
<PARA>Courageous women have always been the backbone of any nation and Australia is certainly no exception. The courage of our women during the days of early settlement points that out. The first settlement at Sydney Cove would never have been expanded into the wonderful country we have today if they had not been so courageous. It is all very well for the men to have set forth to pioneer the outback with a gun in their hand and the promise of great gains, but for women to have followed knowing that their very isolation would render them so vulnerable while they were having their numerous children makes us all pause and wonder at their courage. Theirs was the responsibility for their families-their health, education and moral fibre. How many of us today would care to take on those risks with no doctors in place and no support systems available?</PARA>
<PARA> Yet we do have many modern day examples of extreme courage shown by women working to improve the status of other women. One only has to mention Mother Theresa to understand that women today have not lost any of the courage of those earlier women. The women's movement must have rejoiced at the exploits of people such as Kay Cottee, who has just sailed single-handed around the world. We have so many very good examples, both present and past. I would like to touch on them very briefly. Sister Elizabeth Kenny, a bush nurse in Queensland, was the first woman and the first person to come up with some treatment for poliomyelitis. I will read a very short section out of her biography. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> A year later she was called to a drover's cottage where she found a little girl lying crippled on a cot. Alarmed, she galloped several miles to the nearest telegraph office where she cabled the child's symptoms to Dr McDonnell, He replied: `Infantile paralysis. No known treatment. Do the best you can.'</PARA>
<PARA> Drawing on her experience with her brother and improvising in the best traditions of the Australian bush, she cut strips of blanket, dipped them in hot water, wrung them out and packed them gently about the child's paralysed legs and arms. Soon her whimpering ceased. After a few more applications she went to sleep. Later, when the child was awakened by the pain she said: `I want them rags that wells my legs'. </PARA>
<PARA> Sister Kenny resumed the treatment, coupled with vigorous massage, and after several tension-filled days the child recovered. When she told Dr McDonnell what she had done the man was flabbergasted. `But that's completely contrary to every accepted idea of polio treatment', he said. </PARA>

I also ask: Did he, the Attorney-General or the Department ever express a view about the wisdom or propriety of such a deal, which effectively put the whole matter under wraps and out of public view for more than a year and, of course, meant that there was no continuing investigation? What was that view or those views? Finally, is he aware of a report in Monday's West Australian newspaper which purports to quote from the confidential NCSC report presented to last week's meeting of State and Federal Attorneys-General? In view of the apparent leaking of sections of this report, will the Minister, as a matter of urgency, contact the Western Australian Attorney-General and seek his agreement to tabling a suitably edited version of the report in this place so that the full facts can be known without having to wait until the resumption of the Western Australian Parliament later this month?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first part of Senator Chaney's question recollects a question asked last week which I think followed a question asked by Senator Durack which purported to call on a question asked earlier in the week by Senator Lewis. The question relates to the knowledge of either me, the Attorney-General or departmental officers of an undertaking apparently given by the NCSC to Rothwells that it would not undertake investigations into matters prior to a certain date if certain undertakings were given. The first time that either the Department or the Attorney-General became aware of those matters was when the litigation was a matter of public knowledge in the media. I think that is an adequate answer to Senator Chaney's question. It is certainly the same case with me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the time there was some confusion in my mind only in so far as Senator Durack's question related to that. Senator Lewis actually asked about the decision not to publicise the inquiries that were being undertaken by the NCSC into Rothwells, and I think there was some confusion in Senator Durack's mind when he asked that question. But I believe that I have answered that question. As I have said, it became known to Ministers and to departmental officers only during the course of litigation.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the confidential report that has been leaked, I am not in a position, because I obviously have not seen that report, which is to the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities, to confirm that the alleged extracts printed in the West Australian of Monday, 6 March, are extracts from that report from the National Companies and Securities Commission to the Ministerial Council. I reiterate that it is extremely important in this case as in other instances-for example, the war crimes trials which were mentioned earlier this week-that publicity not prejudice the proper resolution of these matters, should charges eventually be laid and the matters come before the courts. I think it is extremely unfortunate that these purported extracts from a confidential report to a ministerial council should have been published in a way which may lead to such prejudice.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney requested that an edited version of the report be tabled in this place. Of course, the Ministerial Council requested that the report be looked at extremely carefully and edited in a way which, should it be placed before a parliament and thereby attract privilege, would not do harm to persons who might face a court. I will give consideration to Senator Chaney's request. But I believe that the Ministerial Council, which has responsibility for these matters-not the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth-has made a determination that the report be tabled in the Western Australian Parliament. It may be that Senator Chaney's question could be forwarded to the Chairman of the Ministerial Council and perhaps it could consider his request.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The Minister again seems to have answered the question as though it has nothing to do with him. I ask him as the Minister for Justice-and this is the part of the question he did not answer: When he became aware, through the litigation, of the rather extraordinary arrangement made by the NCSC, did he ever express a view about the wisdom or propriety of such an arrangement, given that it effectively put the matter both under wraps and on hold, as far as any investigation was concerned, for more than a year? Did he, as Minister for Justice and as one of the Ministers in this Government responsible for legal matters, have any view and did he express that view? I note the Minister's reply with respect to the publishing of the report. I ask the Minister: Given that it would appear that portions of this report have been leaked to the media, will he give consideration to the potentially greater damage which is done by the selective leaking of the report rather than the tabling of a report which is properly edited simply to protect the question of a fair trial for those who might be charged, rather than something which has clearly been leaked for political purposes?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the first matter, I did not express a view on this matter which was the subject of litigation and, I believe, determination, although this does not suit the political attack which Senator Chaney wishes to wage against me on this matter. The Ministerial Council exercises supervision and control over the National Companies and Securities Commission. We have on that Ministerial Council, for example, the Attorney-General of New South Wales, Mr John Dowd, the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice in Queensland, Mr Paul Clauson, and the Attorney-General of Tasmania, Mr John Bennett. Although I am not privy to the deliberations of the Council, I cannot believe that a body of Ministers charged with responsibility for the National Companies and Securities Commission is not properly constituted as the proper body to undertake the supervision of the actions of the National Companies and Securities Commission in regard to Mr Connell. I believe that the responsibility for making statements in relation to that matter that came out in litigation properly lies with the Ministerial Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I agree with Senator Chaney that the leaking of purported extracts from a report can be extremely damaging. But that does not lead me to the conclusion that we should rush into publishing the matter in a parliamentary chamber, where privilege is attracted, until the most careful examination of the documents is undertaken. The Western Australian Opposition asked for the report to be published in a speedy fashion. I do not think that would be a proper discharge of the responsibility of the Ministerial Council to those who may face charges. I believe that this matter should be allowed to be examined in a proper and considered way and not in haste.</PARA>

Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) publication `Government Financial Estimates 1988-89' which was released on 1 March?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The short answer to the last part of the question is no, and I will give the details later. I have seen the Australian Bureau of Statistics bulletin. It is worth noting, for those who follow these things, that the ABS has decided to change the terminology. In future it will refer to what used to be known as the net public sector borrowing requirement as the net financing requirement of the public sector. The publication shows that for this financial year the net financing requirement is, in fact, negative for the public sector in Australia as a whole. In other words, there is a small surplus on the government account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Between the previous financial year and the present financial year, the Commonwealth sector increased its surplus from some $2.7 billion to $4.1 billion, that is, an increase of slightly more than 50 per cent in the Commonwealth surplus. During the same period the State and local government sector not only failed to reduce its deficit but increased it-I am using rounded figures-from $3.8 billion to just over $3.9 billion; an increase of nearly 4 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the breakdown of the government finance statistics, one finds more evidence of the State and local government sector having not exercised fiscal self-discipline on anything like the scale of the Commonwealth sector. As to the government final consumption expenditure figure, the most important component of which is the wages and salaries paid to public servants in general, but State public servants in particular, the Commonwealth sector's figure is a nominal growth of just over 5 per cent, which is, of course, a real reduction. For the State and local government sector, the figure is a nominal growth of 8 per cent, which represents a real increase.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to that, for those who are interested in this-Senator Stone may have seen it already-Dr Shann published an article in the Business Review Weekly a couple of weeks ago in which he suggested that the States have been substantially escaping from the fiscal discipline that the Commonwealth Government is trying to have applied to the public sector as a whole by selling off assets. He did not quantify that. I understand that it would be extremely difficult to quantify. If Dr Shann is correct-there are certainly some reasons to believe that he is-the States have exercised even less discipline or, to put it the other way, have been more undisciplined than the ABS bulletin suggests.</PARA>

It has recently been assessed by the Commissioner of Taxation as being taxable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us settle on `the alarming resignation rate'. The paid strength of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) for the first six months of this financial year was 70,203, which is on target to achieve the Budget estimate of 70,279. I might say that the number of women in the permanent ADF has continued to increase, and that is a good sign. The total number of voluntary separations from the trained force or trainee or cadet separations for the first six months is 3,025, which is 8 per cent below the number for last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Preliminary indications are that there will be a higher level of separations in the month of January 1989 due to the introduction of open ended enlistments. That higher level of separations, however, is not expected to continue for the rest of the year. Generally, one can therefore accept that there has been an improvement in the separation results, and for that the Government is grateful.</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of what we do about the future, the recruiting effort certainly will be maintained and hopefully improved. We are experiencing some difficulties in attracting experienced recruits in some technical employment categories. Hopefully, we can direct the recruiting effort to remedy that situation. In terms of whether we need to reintroduce the bounty to which Senator Sheil referred, I shall certainly take that up with the Minister. But, in view of the fact that the separation results are improving, I am not certain that that would be necessary.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am surprised that Senator Puplick disdains so comically the issue of energy policies for this country. I would have thought that it was central to our basic economic position and our possibilities for economic growth. Let me, however, go on with my answer to Senator Beahan because it is, indeed, his question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have in place in this country a positive regime of oil excise which is cast in a mould similar to those of countries with like prospects to Australia's. Therefore, by comparison, it is not unduly onerous internationally, but it does meet what I think is a fundamental and necessary test; that is, philosophically this Government is dedicated to the proposition that the oil and gas reserves of this country are public property and if private companies wish to exploit those reserves to make a profit they are entitled to pay some economic rent to the Australian community. That economic rent is in the form of the excise we extract for the right to use those resources.</PARA>
<PARA> What has been referred to in this debate is that that economic rent somehow is a disincentive for exploration. The truth is that at present oil prices, while firming since the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries managed to organise its affairs in a more orderly way, have been low in recent months. The price of oil on the world market is the key-as the price of gold on the world market is the key-to whether or not companies commit efforts to prospecting in this area. The tax regime is also a component. The tax regime, in the case of oil exploration, is cast in a way so as to provide the Australian community with an economic rent from those private companies which exploit the resources.</PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of this debate, which has surfaced in the last day, concerns some quotations of the Chief Executive of Esso Australia Ltd-the company that exploits the Bass Strait fields-that the Commonwealth Government has been slow in meeting that company's demands for a reduction in excise. I should perhaps take the opportunity of using this answer to make an observation about that remark. Esso and Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, the joint owners of the lease for the operation of Bass Strait, approached the Government late last year, when it looked as though oil prices would crash through the $10 a barrel mark, and sought some specific tax relief.</PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with what I have said about the way in which we pitch our policies on excise, we met their demands by proposing a sliding scale which would have reduced excise and, had the price of oil fallen dramatically, would have meant that they would still be able to produce from all of their fields and earn a reasonable margin of profit. It is the companies themselves that rejected that reasonable proposal by the Commonwealth. Because they have rejected it there is no reason for the Commonwealth now to try to alter or renegotiate the sliding scale in any way. It is certainly not my intention to do that. I make the point that here is a clear example of where there was a real need to provide some tax relief, because of the low price of oil, and where the Commonwealth moved to address that directly by proposing a reviewed scale which provided that relief and, in this case, the company knocked it back.</PARA>

Because of the geographical isolation of the islands concerned, obviously it is not practical to station officers there permanently. I notice that Senator Sanders did not ask for that in his question. We certainly have no plans to do that and I do not think that we would be terribly successful in a recruiting campaign to organise officers to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ordinance contains some fairly strict environmental measures, including a requirement for a permit to gain entry to the islands. Hopefully, that will be something of a measure of how many people attempt to visit them in the very near future. The ordinance provides for severe penalties for introducing any organism-not just rats but plants as well. It also requires the preparation of a management plan `as soon as practicable' after the commencement of the ordinance. Work has commenced on the draft management plan. Unfortunately, the officer who began that work, who was from the Antarctic Division, resigned late last year. We have been unable to continue work on that in the last few weeks due to the constraints we have on staff in the Antarctic Division-the difficulties we have in getting a sufficient number of staff to handle the tasks that are given to them. However, even in the absence of a management plan, entry to the territory is controlled by the permits to which I have referred. We shall certainly get to work on the management plan as soon as we can. I shall keep Senator Sanders and the Senate informed on the progress of its development.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Attorney-General to amendments which I moved to the Family Law Amendment Bill, which received quite substantial support here but were defeated five years ago. Those amendments would require a party to a marriage 12 months prior to applying for a dissolution thereof to undergo, together with the other partner, counselling for the purposes of considering the legal, social and financial consequences of the dissolution of the marriage and, in particular, the effect of the dissolution of the marriage on any children of the marriage. The Minister would have observed that the report on homeless youth Our Homeless Children states that a very substantial percentage of homeless youth are from parents whose marriages have broken down. Did the Minister hear the Minister for Social Security in the other place, Mr Brian Howe, state publicly that one of the causes of our homeless youth is the irresponsibility of parents? Would it not be an appropriate time now to reconsider the propositions that I put forward at that time so as to ensure that those who are separating and are considering applying for a dissolution of marriage should have special regard to not only the legal, social and financial consequences of the dissolution of that marriage but also, and in particular, the effects of the dissolution of the marriage on any children of that marriage?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fact, and a cause for great regret within our community, that many young Australians who find themselves without shelter are in that tragic predicament because the household which ought to offer them warmth, security and care has become intolerable for them, perhaps because of disputes between the parents or other factors. When the parents go further and seek to formalise the breakdown of their marriage by seeking to have a decree of dissolution of the marriage ratified-that is what it amounts to-children can once again be put in jeopardy. For one reason or another it might be impossible to find the normal care and protection that ought to exist within the households of either of the parents who have separated or divorced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, anything that can be done to try to reconcile a couple who are contemplating separation or divorce ought to be undertaken. For that reason, the Government, under the Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Bowen, has increased the funding available for marriage counselling and marriage education. We see this as an investment in trying to secure the family unit against disintegration, which can, as I say, lead in some situations to a destabilisation of the normal expectations of young people who may find themselves on the streets and homeless.</PARA>
<PARA> There has been a dramatic increase in the financial commitment to marriage counselling under this Government. I think Senator Harradine would acknowledge that this financial year $7m has been allocated to marriage counselling organisations compared with $4.74m only two years ago. In my own State of Tasmania, for example, the contribution to marriage counselling organisations this financial year is $331,000. That contribution is playing a very significant part because it has helped to secure the continuation of the offices on the north west coast, which are an important part of marriage counselling in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Harradine's question suggests, there is an important role in trying to ensure that such counselling occurs. Whether it ought to be further formalised in the way he suggests as a condition precedent, as I understand it, to seeking a decree for the dissolution of the marriage by requiring counselling which gives particular attention to the possible plight of children of the marriage, perhaps could be considered once again. I believe that it is important to note that over the past five or six years there has been a decline in the number of divorces involving couples with children. I do not say this in any partisan way. Obviously this is the result of various factors, demographic and social. But it may be of interest that in 1982 there were 27,157 divorces involving children in Australia and, since the change of government, there has been a steady decline, dropping to 23,279 in 1987. This important sociological factor is not often adverted to. I believe that marriage guidance, marriage counselling and marriage education are important matters to which this Government has shown its commitment over the last several financial years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can confirm that Harris-Daishowa has applied for an additional export licence for woodchips of 150,000 tonnes to export during the calendar year 1989. The additional chips will be derived from residues from Victorian sawmills. Most of these residues will be produced from the milling, as the honourable senator has said, of D-grade sawlogs but some will also be produced as a result of thinnings trials in crown native forests. The forest operations proposed by the New South Wales Forestry Commission in the Coolangubra and Egan Peaks forests are primarily for the production of sawlogs to supply the local sawmills in that area. Woodchips will be produced only from timber which is unsuitable for sawmilling or which is left over after sawmilling. It is likely that the operations will proceed regardless of whether approval is given to export the waste material as woodchips or not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposed forest operations in the Tantawangalo forest involve the logging of 81 hectares and are part of a research project being conducted to determine the effects of logging on water quality and quantity. As the Victorian residues are not associated with sawlogs going to New South Wales mills, there is no impact on proposed New South Wales operations in areas on and nominated for the register of the National Estate. The possibility of changes to the logging plans for those areas will be the subject of discussions in the near future between me and the New South Wales Minister for Natural Resources, Mr Causley, and arise from advice to me by my colleague Senator Richardson, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. I had hoped that the discussions between me and Minister Causley would have been completed by this date, but that has not been possible. I hope to have those discussions completed and the issue finalised in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, however, the Commonwealth has not approved the export of any pulpwood material from the areas to which I have referred. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy has referred the application that Senator Dunn has spoken of to Senator Richardson's Department for comment. No environmental impact statement has been prepared on the additional 150,000 tonnes as yet. The proposal is being considered by the relevant Commonwealth departments-that is, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and Senator Richardson's Department-and the Victorian Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands and Department of Planning and Environment to determine whether further detailed environmental impact assessments are necessary.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that most D-grade sawlogs are, in fact, sawn by millers to extract the available millable material after appraisal at the mill. Then they are chipped. But the economics of the operation are such that the sawmillers must maximise the sawn material as well as sell the residue as chips. I also point out that D-grade logs have, by definition, a low proportion of millable material. They are graded by the Victorian Department of Conservation and Lands and are regarded as essentially rubbish from which it might be possible to extract some sawn timber. But in the main they are regarded as material which would probably be chipped in any case.</PARA>

I am sure that Senator Cooney will be very pleased to hear that. I will provide a few other details. In December 1988 the Government decided to phase out the overseas subsidised student program. From January next year all new overseas students will enter Australia on a full fee paying basis, but a selection of them will be on scholarships.

The new scholarship scheme, which is to be administered by the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau, will provide full scholarships to students from developing countries on the basis of both equity and merit.

I agree that it is very important. Senator Hamer then moved to his very old chestnut, which is the manning scales on Australian ships. In addressing that question he by implication made the point that, although the manning scale position has improved, it is perhaps not comp- arable with the best international standards. When I say `the best international standards', I do not mean the standards which prevail in ships registered in Panama or somewhere like that, and I do not think Senator Hamer does either. I mean ships of Norwegian and other Scandinavian lines and so on. I make the point that an analysis which I recall of the costs of the Australian shipping industry indicated that the total element of labour costs was between 12 and 14 per cent of the total costs of the shipping industry here, which made the industry uncompetitive in international terms.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am broadly aware of the nature of that study. In essence it is a positive contribution to the information available on this issue, although, like many studies of this kind, it tends to make some rather wild claims about the behavioural consequences of some of the matters it recommends.

The women's housing issues working party is responsible for coordinating the Commonwealth-State Ministers' responses to the National Women's Housing Conference, and will be reporting to the housing Ministers April conference. Secondly, Council recommends that the release of Commonwealth land for housing should include a component for public housing. The Commonwealth's submission at the housing summit last Friday included references to the appropriateness in many cases for land to be offered, in the first instance, to State and local governments, and that the provision of land for public housing purposes would be looked at on a case by case basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thirdly, the Council recommends continuation and expansion of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. In 1987-88 the Commonwealth provided a total of $1.563 billion to housing under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, Loan Council nominating arrangements and departments of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs rent assistance. A figure of $1.6 billion went to public rental housing. Total Commonwealth assistance provided under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement to State and Territory governments has increased from $567m in 1983-84 to $700 in 1988-89.</PARA>
<PARA> In points 4 and 5 the National Women's Consultative Council recommends the establishment of monitoring mechanisms on service provision to women under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement and collection of gender based data on mobility patterns. In a letter of 22 February 1989, responding to representations I had made about women's housing, Minister Staples pointed out that provision of gender based data is an agreed principle of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. Officers of the Department are currently involved in a Commonwealth-State working party on that data collection, which aims to ensure collection of gender based data by State.</PARA>
<PARA> The Council's sixth recommendation relates to tenancy protection in the private rental market, and such protection is very much a matter for States. The final recommendation relates to the establishment of a national program for short, medium and long term housing for women. The Government has established a review of Commonwealth housing policy. Senior officers of the housing review have met with the women's housing interest working party and the Office of the Status of Women has also provided advice. As honourable senators will be aware, the outcomes of the housing review and matters concerning housing funding in 1989-90 are yet to be considered by the Government.</PARA>

Senator Chaney is quick to point the finger at the Federal Government, but housing is also very much a responsibility of State governments. In a number of States, notably Queensland, there is not the commitment to public housing that there should be. There are certainly waiting lists in a number of States. I would be interested to look at waiting lists on a State by State basis and compare them according to the politics and commitment of the government concerned. I do not dispute the fact that there are waiting lists; I do not dispute the fact that women are affected. But Opposition senators continually ignore the very real commitments given by this Government on housing and on a whole range of other issues which vitally affect the lives of Australian women and their families.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Powell for the question. The matter has had some publicity in recent days. Accordingly, I am aware that used cars are being imported from Japan in commercial quantities. I have heard allegations that these cars do not meet Australian design standards. Some of the allegations and concerns expressed have come from the Australian automobile industry, which claims that the cars might possibly breach Australian vehicle design rules. I would also have a major concern that the manufacturers' recall provisions which apply in Australia may not be able to be used if the allegations are correct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some of the specific allegations that Senator Powell raises are ones that I am not closely apprised of. The registration of motor vehicles is obviously within the ambit of State authorities. However, on the national level we can take and are taking a number of actions. I have asked the Trade Practices Commission to examine the application of the Trade Practices Act to these vehicles to see whether the provisions of this Act have been breached. I am also consulting urgently with my colleague the Minister for Transport and Communications to see whether any ongoing hazards involving safety are associated with these vehicles. The other ongoing activity is to bring the States into this response as well. I am consulting with State Ministers to ensure that their consumer protection provisions also apply in cases of substantiated allegations.</PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, however, I think that, we should advise consumers, firstly, to have whatever car they buy checked by an independent association, such as the National Roads and Motorists Association or the Royal Automobile Club. Secondly, when buying a car consumers should check the compliance plate to see whether Australian design rules have been complied with. That plate is under the bonnet of all motor vehicles. The allegations and the publicity have been of concern to me. That is why I have embarked upon this course of action.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At Question Time on Friday, 3 March, Senator Newman asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade a question relating to a defence industry sales mission to South East Asia. I do not think I need to repeat the question, but will do so if need be to make the reply intelligible. The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows: The trade mission to South East Asia late last year was a joint Defence and Austrade initiative, undertaken with the full knowledge of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The mission report made a number of recommendations to enhance the level of trade in this area, one of which concerned export finance packages, which was the subject of the honourable senator's question, which need to be competitive with those currently being offered in the region by other countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thirdly, the Government is currently looking at the whole question of financial assistance for exports generally. Indeed, late last year, as Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, I appointed a committee of review chaired by Professor Helen Hughes to examine this question and to report by June this year. I understand that the Department of Defence has made a submission to Professor Hughes's committee, based on recommendations from the South East Asian industry mission. That submission notes that current policy is inconsistent with the intent of changes in export approval procedures announced by the Government in order to enhance the level of defence exports.</PARA>
<PARA> The Export Finance Insurance Corporation (EFIC), administered by Austrade, is able to provide finance packages for exports of both defence and non-defence items. The Australian International Development Assistance Bureau makes available the development import finance facility with which EFIC can combine with finance packages. This facility is not currently available for defence equipment sales. Future action by the departments will involve further consultation and the outcome of the review by Professor Helen Hughes.</PARA>

As Senator McLean is not here and I am not sure that there is universal interest in this topic, I ask that the answer be incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) No. All staff who are performing the duty officer role have been fully accredited under the relevant safety requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business last week issued a press release to rebut similar claims made by the Opposition about the safety of the HIFAR reactor.</PARA>
<PARA> The facts of the matter are not as the Honourable Senator describes. An extensive external review of staffing arrangements at HIFAR was undertaken in 1984-85. After a very long period of consultation with the relevant unions and reactor engineers, ANSTO implemented the new staffing arrangements on 13 January this year.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There is no breach of safety procedures involved in current staffing under the new arrangements, in which a number of reactor engineers have refused to participate in the rostered after hours duty officer system.</PARA>
<PARA> All safety requirements are fully met. Although reactor engineers will no longer be on rotating shift duties, they are performing more important engineering work associated with the reactor. A HIFAR accredited engineer is readily available at all times when the reactor is operating.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO), after being unable to reach agreement with the APEA in relation to the five HIFAR engineers involved, filed an application on 22 February 1989 with the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to vary their award.</PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements have been operating satisfactorily since 13 January. The safety of reactor operations is not an issue, so there is no urgency on safety grounds for the hearing to be reassigned.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Representatives of the APEA and the reactor engineers met with the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business on 16 February 1989 and could not come to any agreement on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister wrote to APEA on 22 February to advise that he considered the issue is essentially a management one and should be resolved within the organisation.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The safe operation of the reactor is the responsibility of ANSTO management and this safety is monitored and reviewed by the Nuclear Safety Bureau, which is established under the ANSTO Act as an independent body reporting directly to the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bureau has advised that the revised arrangements are acceptable on nuclear safety grounds.</PARA>

John Gayler, the member for Leichhardt, whose name was mentioned in the statutory declaration tabled in the Senate on 28 February, issued a press statement rejecting the claim made in this declaration. That would be well known to honourable senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Regarding the funding for the Hopevale community referred to in the statutory declaration, I take this opportunity to set down some chronological facts. On 1 December the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs met with Hopevale representatives, including Mr Gibson, and discussed a $6m funding for a community infrastructure program. On 23 January the Minister formally signed the documentation approving the expenditure of the $6m funding, $3.6m in 1988-89 and $2.4m in 1989-90. Formal advice of the Minister's decision was forwarded to the Hopevale Community Council by the regional office of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs on 3 February.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also worth pointing out to the Senate that the Minister met with Mr Gibson and two other ACC representatives on Monday, 27 February, where no reference was made to the fears and allegations contained in the statutory declaration tabled in the Senate on 28 February.</PARA>
<PARA> Hopevale is a community with great needs and there has never been any consideration given by the Minister not to proceed with funding for the community because of a political point of view held by any individual.</PARA>

<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that many hundreds of questions were answered during the course of the Budget session last year. Indeed, I took the opportunity today over the lunch hour-since Senator Crichton-Browne, in his courteous way, gave me a small hint that this matter might come up-to have a look at the number of questions which I had answered in this chamber on Aboriginal affairs during the Budget session. Including supplementary questions, I answered 90 questions; and I spoke on 23 occasions on matters relating to Aboriginal affairs during the Budget session. That does not include the many hundreds of questions asked and answered during the Estimates Committee proceedings.</PARA>

The short answer is that very considerable work is required to answer these questions. This work is being undertaken and an answer will be provided by me, on behalf of the Minister, as soon as it is put together.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tate might well draw breath. The truth of the matter is that, since he was last required personally to answer a question in the Senate, not another answer has been forthcoming. For the moment, it is quite irrelevant for him to tell us the number of questions he was asked in the Parliament. Since that time, to my knowledge, no answers have been given. For Senator Tate to suggest that he will answer all the questions when he has the answer to the most difficult one, clearly is an abrogation of responsibility. There is no proper reason why he could not have answered those questions for which answers are immediate and apparent. He is quite right: there are 25 questions which can be divided into 92 separate questions which almost, without exception, stand alone.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Without question, the vast majority of those could have been answered had the Minister bothered or cared, or showed some regard and some respect for the Senate. They could have been answered in a matter of days, but the Minister has chosen not to. I have no doubt that if the same questions had been asked without notice in this Senate during Question Time, the Minister would have answered them within 24 hours. However, because the Parliament was not sitting, it was convenient to ignore them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me remind Senator Tate of how simple those questions were. I touched upon the matter of the unacquitted grants within the Department. I asked him how many grants were unacquitted. It took, if I recall, two weeks for the Department to tell the Minister, and for Senator Tate ultimately to convey to the Senate, that there were 151 unacquitted grants in Western Australia alone. It took that long before Senator Tate was in a position to tell the Senate what grants had been unacquitted. </PARA>
<PARA> I then asked some supplementary questions, for which the Minister did not have satisfactory answers. I provided the Minister with a copy of Mr Dunlevy's and Mr Lyne's report on the competence, capacity and efficiency of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in Western Australia. They were both scathing and condemning in their comments. What they said contradicted almost everything that the Minister said, as a matter of fact, in answering the questions. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the first questions which I asked the Minister was whether he had misled the Senate. With the greatest of respect to Senator Tate, it does not take eight weeks to tell the Senate whether or not he has misled it. Presumably he could have learned, in a matter of moments, if he had cared, if the Department had cared or if, most of all, the Minister had cared. I asked a simple question. Having referred to the Dunlevy and Lyne report, I asked:</PARA>
<PARA> does he have reason to disagree with the report;</PARA>
<PARA>To this point, eight weeks later, Senator Tate is not in a position to tell the Senate whether or not he disagrees with a report brought down by officers of the Department for the benefit of the Department and presumably, if he cares, the Minister. I further asked:</PARA>
<PARA>was the Minister aware of the report at the time he answered the question . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tate still cannot tell me that, eight weeks later. I asked, `Were you or the Minister aware of any other reports critical of the Department's management?'. Eight weeks later Senator Tate does not know whether any other reports critical of the Department have been prepared. I asked, `Has the Minister seen the report prepared in respect of the activities of the Department in Geraldton?'. Eight weeks later we still do not know whether the Minister was aware of that report. We do not know whether the Minister agrees or disagrees with it. As we go through each of these questions, we see that they are questions that are capable of being answered properly and effectively yet there was some inefficiency from the Department-a Department which has a Budget of $467m and a staff of 1,000 people. Senator Tate is not able to answer elementary questions that go to the heart of the efficiency, competence, management and conduct of the Department. It is not satisfactory for him to rise now, eight weeks later, and tell the Senate that in due course it can expect a response to questions which ought in many respects to be promptly available upon the files of the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> I am driven to the conclusion that the Minister is demonstrating the same arrogance and the same disregard and disdain for the Senate that he has shown in recent times by his own public utterances in condemning committees of the Senate. </PARA>

The tragedy is that the questions I asked him relate in many respects not only to the management and the efficiency of the Department but to corruption and to theft of hundreds of thousands of dollars and mismanagement of millions. To date there has been no satisfactory answer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry that the honourable senator has made the remark. The person referred to is an active organiser for the Australian Labor Party in Fitzroy Crossing-the person who proudly rounds up the Aboriginal vote and delivers it to the Labor Party every Federal and State election. That is the same man who has his hand in the till; the same man who wrote out cheques for his own use out of chuck-out money; the same man who supports the Labor Party and represents it in the Pilbara of Western Australia. There seems to be little concern. Little regard seems to have been paid to this matter. When I inquired about the matter the answer was that the community involved had not taken any legal action. I asked in these questions, eight weeks later, whether this man was a fit and reasonable person to be employed. I asked whether this was the sort of man who ought to be in charge of taxpayers' money intended for proper use by the Aboriginal community. Eight weeks later the Department cannot tell me. It seems to me, quite frankly, that the Minister cares very little.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has always been my view that when dishonest or incompetent white advisers end up misappropriating or mismanaging funds intended for the white community it ultimately ignites an environment in the community which causes ill will and creates a cradle for foment of prejudice and racism against the very people that the funds are designed to give support to. </PARA>
<PARA> As I am speaking I note that Senator Tate has his earphones on, listening to the House of Representatives debate. He has little regard for and little care about these matters. We are not able to get a response from him to a report which was provided to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in August last year by Mr Dunlevy and Mr Lyne. We still do not have a response from him in this chamber in respect of the report that they made. It is a report-I note that Senator Tate is no longer listening to the House of Representatives-which flies in the face of the answers he gave this chamber. I asked Senator Tate whether the Department is enforcing financial rules and guidelines for the administration of these grants. The answer from Senator Tate was yes. Yet Mr Dunlevy and Mr Lyne are saying not only that they were not being enforced, but also that the departmental officers were so incompetent that they were not capable of enforcing them. </PARA>
<PARA> When we go to the back of the report we see that there was talk about solving the problem by using damage control. That is the solution the Department has to the problem-damage control. As I say, that report flies in the face of Senator Tate's answers. I asked, `Is the Department enforcing financial rules and guidelines for the administration of these grants?'. Senator Tate said yes, but the answer is no. By any measure he has misled the Senate. I asked, `Are the departmental officers sufficiently skilled to deal with the matters?'. Again Senator Tate said yes. He said that the officers were sufficiently skilled. Mr Dunlevy and Mr Lyne say that they are not-far from it. They described them, in another way, as incompetent. I asked, `Are these officers incompetent by definition of the Department? Are they being paid a level equal to that intended for an officer capable of efficiently discharging duties and responsibilities?'. Of course, we got no answer to that. Senator Tate, all I can say to you is this: the answers you have given are unsatisfactory to say the least. The disregard that the Department, the Minister and presumably you have for the Senate does not, at least for my part, go unrecorded.

<PARA> That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA>The need for the Government to acknowledge</PARA>
<PARA>(a) that the new guidelines on arms sales and defence exports mean that Australia can no longer be considered a country which chose to refuse membership of the arms club</PARA>
<PARA>(b) that the decision means that the export of arms and defence material by Australia is more important than the point of impact: the people in other countries, primarily the Third World, who will suffer and die because of Australia's decision to improve its balance of payments in this way; and</PARA>
<PARA>(c) that there is therefore an urgent need for the Government to reconsider its decision to change its policy on the export of military equipment and to refuse to join the accelerating competition around the world to market and export such equipment. </PARA>
<PARA>I put forward this matter of urgency as a result of a concern long held about the dangers of increasing the international trade in weapons, or arms transfers as they are now called. For many years Australia refused to have much to do with arms transfers as we had very strict export controls and we were proud of the fact that we had not joined the arms club. We could be critical of those countries that sold arms to both sides in the Iran-Iraq war from 1980 to 1988, we could criticise the flow of arms into south-west Asia, and we could view with disfavour those countries, such as France and the United Kingdom, that quite blatantly promoted the sale of arms to repressive regimes in imitation of the United States of America and the Soviet Union. Until recently these two countries controlled most of the global arms trade, which no longer is solely in the hands of the merchants of death but also is in the hands of governments. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the 1988 report of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, world arms sales last year totalled $US35.1 billion at 1985 constant prices, compared with $US32.3 billion in 1986. At the same time, however, there has been a significant drop in the share of the arms trade controlled by the United States and the Soviet Union as competition has come from new exporting nations such as Israel, China, Taiwan, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, India, Singapore and South Korea, among others. These countries produce cheap but effective military equipment for export at competitive rates. As a result, we have increasing competition in a decreasing market. An article in the Current Affairs Bulletin of February 1988 pointed out that, from a high of $43.6 billion in 1982, Third World orders for new arms dropped to $29.9 billion in 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> The major powers still control the export of sophisticated military equipment, such as jet fighters and nuclear submarines, but the day-to-day lethal hardware used in wars going on around the world at this moment is increasingly being supplied by countries trying to offset their own defence purchases by exports, primarily to other Third World countries. They are not strict about export controls and much of the equipment turns up where it was not designed to be; hence, the use of the term `arms transfers' rather than `arms sales'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore disturbing that, at a time when many countries are showing increasing concern about the international arms trade and transfers, Australia should decide to join in. This is despite the strong statements made by the former Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Hayden, at the United Nations Special Session on Disarmament in New York last June. I think it is worth reminding the Senate of two statements he made at that gathering:</PARA>
<PARA> It is also clear that arms exports should not be turned to as a way of solving domestic economic problems. Arms transfers must not become a new cash crop. It should also be recognised, especially by those whose development needs are great, that the purchase of arms is at the cost of the purchasers of the investment goods essential to the creation of employment and economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA>Ten days later the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) announced a new export drive for military equipment. Mr Hayden said:</PARA>
<PARA> I can't go to the United Nations Special Session on Disarmament, as I did a fortnight ago in New York and talk about our commitment in Australia . . . to work to try and cut back the arms trade . . . and then come back home and talk about a huge burst in the sale of conventional arms. </PARA>
<PARA>But that is exactly what happened. Bit by bit this Government is changing the old controls to free up military exports. Already we have had a sales drive through the national security states of South East Asia last September although apparently we did not make any sales on the spot. Not surprisingly, Senator Newman has already complained that, unless we also make a competitive soft loan package available to potential buyers, we cannot meet the demands of the Defence Manufacturing Council, which claimed in its February 1989 newsletter:</PARA>
<PARA> Until the Australian Government is prepared to match the financial packages provided by the governments of Australian industries international competitors there is not much prospect of selling major equipment. </PARA>
<PARA>At least the writer is honest in stating that Australia needs this strong export trade in order to improve the balance of trade figures. However, much of the present imbalance is caused by the import of expensive items such as computers for the Department of Defence and the Geraldton spy base, as well as the FA18s and submarines. </PARA>
<PARA> What else are we prepared to do to compete in this market? Should we follow the example of Sweden, where four executives from Bofors face trial for illegally exporting weapons to Iran and other Persian Gulf states, while two businessmen are on trial for illegal gunpowder exports? Yet as Paul Palsson, the President of the state owned Kockums Marine Co., said recently:</PARA>
<PARA> Sweden is too small a market to carry the arms industry it has. You have to get out and export. </PARA>
<PARA>This sounds rather like the words of Senator Evans, who last week said during Question Time:</PARA>
<PARA> From a narrow commercial perspective, the encouragement of defence exports can contribute to the development of our domestic industrial domestic base which enhances Australia's overall defence self-reliance as well as our economic position. </PARA>
<PARA>Then again we might take note of an article in the New York Times last month which quoted India's Defence Minister. He said that India also plans to increase exports of its own arms industry to raise funds to import high technology weapons systems and to upgrade its military forces. I suppose one of the things they have to pay for is the new naval base out of Goa which is being built by an Australian-Dutch consortium. The contract is worth $2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> When the competition becomes hot, corners get cut, corruption becomes rife and export controls, if they exist, are progressively slackened. That is what happened in Sweden and the trend is now evident in Australia. It is made more likely by the climate of secrecy around arms transfers and the cynicism that flourishes in this murky atmosphere. Virtually the whole world condemned the Iran-Iraq war, but, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, 40 countries supplied arms to the warring parties while a number of them supplied arms to both sides. These included the United States of America, the Soviet Union, Switzerland, North Korea, China, Brazil and Italy. When it comes to a deal, ideology does not seem to make much difference. It is interesting to note that one of Iran's best suppliers was Israel, which made covert shipments to Tehran worth hundreds of millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> Another example of the covert market is South Africa, which is now one of the 10 largest exporters of military equipment in the world, despite global sanctions imposed by the United Nations in 1977. According to the South African Armaments Corporation, South Africa now sells to 32 countries. Jane's Defence Weekly reckons that South Africa sold $A1,090m worth of arms to foreign countries last year and expects to sell $1.45 billion worth this year.</PARA>
<PARA> I make these points because this Government claims to maintain strict controls, although the reality is that they will be slackened with the new changes which the Minister for Defence announced last June and which he hopes to implement this year. It is therefore worth noting the example of Sweden, a country much admired in certain circles of the Australian Labor Party. It is one that has often taken the high moral ground in international affairs. It too has strict military export controls. Sweden's biggest exporter of military equipment is Bofors. It has been estimated that its exports would be three to five times bigger without these restrictions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is extremely instructive to read the book by Ingvar Bratt, who worked at Bofors for 14 years and whose involvement with the Swedish Green Party after 1981 led him to question the export of arms to the Third World. This was after the Swedish arms exports increased by four times during the last years of the 1970s. A major part of these exports was directed to the Third World. Ingvar Bratt discovered that a project he was working on as technical project manager for an anti-aircraft system, the RBS-70, was being sold to Dubai and Bahrain, although the whole of the Middle East was a forbidden area for arms exports. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently Bofors was involved in the scandal which I have already referred to as well as allegations of enormous bribes paid to Indian officials to secure a contract there and the diversion of military supplies to Libya. Singapore, Britain and Yugoslavia have also been named as countries reselling Swedish made weapons or munitions to circumvent Swedish regulations, although no charges have been laid in these cases. </PARA>
<PARA> On a historical note, it also appears that Swedish State Arms Firm FFV flouted an official arms embargo 20 years ago by selling the Carl Gustav anti-tank system to Australia between 1966 and 1972 when we were engaged in the Vietnam conflict. Company officials admitted the sales and claims that the Government knew about it at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> What defence exports are we talking about in relation to Australia? Thus far they have been essentially restricted to small arms and ammunitions and associated equipment, although we have sold or are about to sell some larger items such as artillery pieces and missiles. The emphasis for the future appears to be on high-tech equipment with markets envisaged in South East Asia as well as further afield in countries like the United Kingdom, Brazil, the United States and New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA> I would next like to consider the controls on these exports. Under the new policy the controls have been reduced and the Department of Defence will become the dominant party in the export process. In effect, future military exports are to be governed more by narrow defence and bureaucratic concerns than by broader political, economic and humanitarian considerations. </PARA>
<PARA> Preceding the decision to promote the export of arms and defence equipment, there was a struggle between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Defence, but Minister Beazley was able to trade on a climate of political and public opinion that increasingly believed the main enemy in Australia was the balance of payments. Exports of anything, including defence material, were therefore regarded as in the national interest. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, perceived by the industry to date as the more intractable on exports, has now been relegated to the sidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not yet know in detail what the new guidelines are but some indication may be given by recent sales drives in the Indian subcontinent. There was a big push to get the contract for the new naval base in India and to make sure that it did not go to France. At the same time we extended, at Pakistan's request, the tender closing date for countries wanting to buy 50 ex-Royal Australian Air Force Mirage fighters. Pakistan is planning to extend its air force by acquiring 125 planes-75 from China and the other 50 from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If there were ever two countries which had a bad record of conflict over the last 40 years, they would be India and Pakistan. Yet Australia is busy doing deals on both sides while defence commentators write endless articles on the arms race in the Indian Ocean and the rapid expansion of the Indian navy. Indeed, some of the more conservative analysts have said that Australia should respond by acquiring nuclear submarines, which will no doubt have to be paid for by selling more arms overseas to prop up our trade deficit. I waited to hear some objections to the contract for the new naval base but there was a deafening silence. Obviously a dollar is a dollar. The defence industry benefits either way despite the spin-off effect of the diversion of resources at home, whether India or Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The new export controls will apply only to items specifically designed or adapted to military purposes and to products which are inherently lethal or destructive. What is included under the heading of `non-lethal' equipment? That is not entirely clear, but there appears to be an assumption that if one cannot shoot somebody with a piece of equipment one is not supporting military establishments which are engaged in human rights abuses. Jeff Atkinson, Education Officer for Community Aid Abroad in Melbourne, has observed:</PARA>
<PARA> We think this is a retrograde step. </PARA>
<PARA>Where do we draw the line between offence and defence? In countries which have no external enemy, where are the police and military deployed after they have learned to shoot at these training targets we sell in South East Asia? Michael Klare, Associate Professor of Peace and World Security Studies at Hampshire College, Massachusetts, noted:</PARA>
<PARA>We find that many countries which import conventional weapons supposedly for defensive purposes actually use these weapons more often than not on their own populations. Rather than to resist aggression . . . the bulk of the military infrastructure is engaged in internal security against social forces which are suffering for one reason or another in those countries. The arms trade is actually contributing to the perpetuation of an authoritarian regime. </PARA>
<PARA>It is, therefore, ironic that our first big sales drive last November and December-the Australia-South East Asia industry mission-visited such bastions of human rights as Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines. The sales push cost $90,000, plus the salaries of officers on the mission. Yet almost all of those are countries where Australia has had to make representations on human rights in the last couple of years. So we have this ludicrous contradiction of our sales people popping in through one door while human rights people follow through another. In other words, Australia is taking precisely the same path as all other countries which have turned to arms exports to pay for their own arms imports, or to improve their balance of payments position. </PARA>
<PARA> The global economic recession has meant a drop in demand at the very time when Australia decided to enter the market along with countries such as China, the two Koreas, India, Israel, South Africa and Singapore. It was embarrassing to witness the hypocrisy of Australia's words at the United Nations Special Session on Disarmament last year, when I was in New York, with the reality back home. The Ambassador for Disarmament supported motions calling for a database to be established on arms transfers as the first step from the United Nations in eliminating the transfers of armaments worldwide and, at the same time, the Minister for Defence said that we would double Australia's exports in the near future. Of course, it was not so embarrassing for other people at that stage because they did not understand the hypocrisy. But it is a fact that our government delegations are sometimes forced into the situation where they act a lie because they do not tell the whole truth about what is going on in Australia. So the fine words were spoken at the same time as our defence export industry was taking off at home. </PARA>
<PARA> Another issue I wish to touch on is what I have described as the point of impact. The export drive is designed to help us reduce our trade deficit and pay for all those expensive planes, ships, submarines and computers that we import to fend off threats to our security, wherever they come from. What we forget too often is that innocent men, women and children get killed in war, and in modern warfare 90 per cent of the victims are civilians. Over 20 million people have been killed in wars since 1945, almost entirely in the Third World. Despite the gradual ending of a number of regional conflicts, there are still 36 wars being fought around the world today, according to the latest Stockholm International Peace Research Institute handbook. </PARA>
<PARA> Even when people are not being killed there is enormous injustice being done to the countries which buy military equipment, whether lethal or non-lethal. We criticise those poor countries which spend so much on the military while their people live in poverty without access to clean water, basic health care, education or decent housing; yet at the same time we cheerfully go to those countries to sell expensive military equipment. I doubt that the members of the South East Asia industry mission bothered to visit the slums of Bangkok or Smoky Mountain in Manila-the garbage tip where thousands of Filipinos eke out an inhuman existence. </PARA>
<PARA> On 3 March, in a debate on the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (General Capital Increase) Bill, Senator Macklin suggested that maybe multilateral finance institutions should start making arms reductions a condition of loans to developing countries. Such an idea is fine in principle but, at the same time, we cannot try to sell military equipment to countries with a huge debt already and whose people often live in degrading poverty while the military plays with its new toys. I remind the Senate of the former Foreign Minister's oft-quoted conditions which he emphasised in 1986 that we should not sell arms to countries which are at war, preparing for war or which would use those weapons against their own people. That just about cuts out the whole market, particularly when one considers the third item. </PARA>
<PARA> The military hardware which is being sold today is becoming increasingly lethal. It is not surprising that so many countries sent official representatives to Iraq last year after its use of chemical weapons to find out how they could acquire the poor nations' nuclear weapons. At the same time, both the United States and the Soviet Union are showing concern over the proliferation of ballistic missiles which can now be made by countries such as India and China. What I am saying is that either we want to be part of this club or we take a stand against it. We cannot declaim against global arms transfers at the United Nations and proclaim our human rights record when at the same time Australian officials are busy selling military equipment to countries which cannot afford it and will use it against their own people. I know that the usual response will follow, that if we do not sell it someone else will. That is the old argument of the dope pedlar or the drug pusher and it is no justification for getting involved in this evil trade. Finally, I draw the Senate's attention to a press statement put out by the Reverend Neville Ross, Chairman of the Australian Council for Overseas Aid, last July. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia does not need to abandon its traditional and internationally respected stance against the arms race for the sake of a few easy dollars from the merchants of death. </PARA>
<PARA>The statement was sent to the heads of the Council's 85 member organisations and church leaders, most of whom endorsed it, including my own denomination-the Religious Society of Friends or Quakers. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree that Australia needs to improve its trade deficit, but I suggest that there are better ways of doing it and that there are more socially useful items that we can manufacture and export. We might also contemplate a decision to stop importing expensive new military equipment that is not relevant to the defence of Australia and thus promote real security in the region rather than joining the growing arms race around us, which benefits only the dealers and is to the detriment of everyone else. I commend the motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Vallentine's motion is one that could have been expected. It is consistent with the view that she has expressed on many occasions. However, I think there are a number of inconsistencies in the general view that she makes in this place about the need for Australia to be independent of alliances and so on. There is no doubt that if we want to have Australia independent of all alliances we need to have a more self-sufficient arms industry in Australia. That is the case of the Swedes and a number of other Western countries which have a neutral and non-aligned policy: they are independent of other alliances. I am a bit bemused that some days we get lectured by Senator Vallentine on the need for Australia to withdraw from all alliances and be more independent and then today we were lectured that we cannot have an independent arms supply industry in Australia because it creates problems elsewhere.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This whole area is extremely complicated. Unfortunately, Senator Vallentine always uses the purity of the black and white situation to explain her position. She suggests that she has a higher morality than the rest of the Parliament and members of other political parties put together. One detail that has often bemused us on the Government side is that in the 1960s, when all of us in the Australian Labor Party opposed Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War, Senator Vallentine--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I say to Senator Vallentine that May this year will be the twenty-third anniversary of the first death in Vietnam of an Australian conscript, Errol Wayne Noack from Port Lincoln, South Australia. As I understand it, at that time Senator Vallentine was a member of the Country Party in Western Australia which supported our involvement. All members of the present Government Party opposed our involvement. If Senator Vallentine intends to quote morality at us, she should have a very good look at the background of her own involvement in politics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The motion before us has three parts. I will deal with the parts as raised by Senator Vallentine. In the first paragraph she states:</PARA>
<PARA> that the new guidelines on arms sales and defence exports mean that Australia can no longer be considered a country which chose to refuse membership of the arms club;</PARA>
<PARA>I wish to make a couple of points about that. First of all, this Government has a principled approach to defence exports. We will not sell to countries which are the subject of United Nations or other arms embargoes; nor will we sell to countries whose strategic or political interests are opposed to those of Australia or its friends and allies. We reserve the right to deny permission for exports of military goods to governments violating human rights. Generally, we oppose private traffic in arms and only approve military exports to private purchasers acting on behalf of a recognised government. Regarding Senator Vallentine's reference to an arms club, other countries have the same right as Australia to defend themselves and deter external aggression. Other countries like Australia have the sovereign right and obligation to buy the equipment required for this purpose. As for the description of an arms club, is Senator Vallentine suggesting that both the United States of America and the Soviets are in the same arms club? It would be hard to imagine that they had agreed to be in the same arms club. Are China and Sweden, which claim to be neutral and non-aligned, in the same arms club as the Soviets and the United States of America?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have often heard Senator Vallentine lecture us about the wonders of countries such as Sweden being neutral and non-aligned. Yet today she gave examples of how Swedes, though neutral and non-aligned, have been prosecuted because they have broken their government's embargo.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Vallentine" NAMEID="IG4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IG4">Senator Vallentine</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. That is the point I was making.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Next time Senator Vallentine starts telling us about the wonder of Sweden being neutral and non-aligned, I hope that she also reminds herself that even countries like Sweden transgress international arrangements and sell arms to the benefit of their own interests. Further to the question of Senator Vallentine's definition of an arms club, there are innumerable buyers and sellers of an enormous variety of defence stores and equipment. This is not limited just to the so-called arms club Senator Vallentine has described. I remind Senator Vallentine that Australia has announced clear guiding principles in supplying defence equipment to legitimate purchasers overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next paragraph of Senator Vallentine's motion states:</PARA>
<PARA> that the decision means that the export of arms and defence material by Australia is more important than the point of impact: the people in other countries, primarily the Third World, who will suffer and die because of Australia's decision to improve its balance of payments in this way. </PARA>
<PARA>I know that at times one has to draft motions in a certain way if they are to have a dramatic impact in the Senate. But to suggest that people in the Third World will die directly as a result of Australia's regulations and policy on allowing arms sales from this country is really putting a very long string to a very short bow. It is an exaggerated claim that denigrates the motion completely. Australia has an active overseas aid program which last year amounted to over $1 billion. As a senator, I have taken an interest in observing and promoting that aid program. I certainly know that Senator Vallentine has also shown interest in the overseas aid program. I believe that all members of parliament would like to see Australia being able to afford an even larger overseas aid program to help the developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of that aid program we also have a defence cooperation program for the provision of patrol boats and other equipment to countries of the South Pacific. Those countries need to patrol boats because they want to protect their economic interests, particularly fishing, from being exploited by illegal fishing by Taiwanese, Japanese or American fishing interests. I am again bemused that Senator Vallentine should be jumping up and down in the Senate, being extremely critical of American foreign policy. Yet, we are providing equipment to South Pacific countries under a defence cooperation program so that they can protect their economic interests in their fishing industries against the tuna boat fishing association of America. Senator Vallentine should be consistent, and say that at times our aid program is to the benefit of Third World countries, even to the detriment of the interests of the tuna boat fishing association of America. </PARA>
<PARA> The final part of the motion asks that the Government reconsider its decision. Senator Vallentine should be in no doubt that the Government's revision of Australia's defence export controls has been done in a carefully considered way. Australian industry makes a vital contribution to the self-reliant defence of Australia. Defence exports help provide a more balanced workload for the Australian companies involved. The honourable senator's approach would undermine Australia's capacity to provide for its own defence in a self-reliant way. The honourable senator has also greatly overstated the nature of the changes we have introduced. I will not repeat the clear restrictions on defence exports now. I will come to them in a moment. The new policy clarifies just what equipment is subject to control. The new controls will focus on those goods that are designed for military purposes and are either lethal or of major military significance. The Government has moved to streamline the old cumbersome process that led to anomalies and inconsistencies. The new arrangements will enable a sensible balance between Australian commercial, defence and international interests. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now give details of the export policy changes by the Government and outline the differences between what occurred before June 1988 and the new policy announced by the Minister in June 1988. I refer here to the defence export controls in schedule 13 of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations. The old schedule 13 failed to differentiate between lethal and non-lethal military goods and between military goods and non-military items like sporting firearms and commercial explosives. The old schedule included items devoid of real military significance, for example, uniforms and obsolete items such as barrage balloons. The old schedule failed to include items of obvious military significance, for example, naval ships and military aircraft. It failed to define the scope of controls in broad terms only, for example, firearms. </PARA>
<PARA> The new schedule 13 confines controls to export of those goods which are, firstly, specifically designed or adapted for military purposes and inherently lethal, incapacitating or destructive or, secondly, of major military significance. The new schedule 13 will also distinguish between exports of, firstly, military goods and, secondly, items like sporting firearms and commercial explosives which could be used by terrorists or insurgents but which also have widespread perfectly legitimate use by bona fide private citizens. The new schedule 13 defines items subject to control more clearly and includes technical notes for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the policy concerns government endorsement of defence exports. Under the old policy there was a widespread perception in industry that government opposed defence exports, although defence exports had been going on for many years. Senator Vallentine is trying to give the impression that we are suddenly going to start defence exports. Under the old policy of the endorsement of defence exports, firms were content to supply limited Australian peacetime defence requirements. Under the new policy, the presumption is that defence exports will proceed, subject to clearly defined constraints. Under the new policy, public affirmation of government support for defence exports will help motivate firms to pursue legitimate opportunities overseas. There will be a presumption to approve an export application where our friends or allies would supply comparable equipment and the export would not prejudice any Australian military advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> The third part of the policy deals with policy constraints on defence exports. Under the old policy, guidance was confined to a few broad principles, for example, no arms were to be exported to countries engaged in military conflict or where the risk of conflict is high. Officials had to interpret these broad principles. This left the door open to anomalies and inconsistencies. Under the new policy, circumstances precluding defence exports are more tightly defined in terms of mandatory arms embargoes, international sanctions, Australian strategic interests, the violation of human rights with exports favoured where there is no reasonable risk of the equipment being used against the citizens of a country with a dubious civil rights record. I trust that Senator Vallentine will take note of that point. Defence exports are also precluded where specific foreign policy interests outweigh export benefits or are in opposition to private traffic in arms. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of balancing our interests, under the old policy defence export applications could be vetoed on general foreign policy grounds. Under the new policy, balanced consideration of Australian commercial, defence and international interests is required. Defence strategic or foreign policy objections must be specific and must outweigh the export benefits in the particular case, for example, human rights. There is now a clearer responsibility. Under the old policy, no clear distinction was drawn between, firstly, the provision of policy advice by non-defence Ministers and officials and, secondly, responsibility of the Minister for Defence and his officials for defence export approval or denial. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the new policy, the controls will be administered in accordance with agreed policy guidelines by defence officials delegated authority by the Minister for Defence. The Minister for Defence and his officials will consult the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce in preparing specific practical policy guidelines. The Minister for Defence is clearly responsible for developing and applying defence export policy. Interdepartmental consultation will be confined to a denial of export permission or to particularly sensitive cases. Under the old policy a decision could take several months or more than a year in extreme cases. Individual applications were handled as if each one was completely new. Under the new policy export applicants are to be advised within 21 days. Previous approvals will be used as precedents to expedite approval of follow-on buys of equipment, spare parts and stores. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, under the new policy guidelines will be published for exporters. Under the old policy guidelines for administering defence export controls were classified as confidential. Exporters had to rely on officials for authoritative guidance. Under the new policy defence export guidelines will be published. I am sure Senator Vallentine will welcome that in particular. She and others who share her viewpoint will be able to see those guidelines and to argue in this and other forums in the community if they believe that the guidelines are being objected to or if they oppose, as they obviously do, according to this motion, any arms trade between Australia and overseas. The newly published guidelines will enable the export control system to be made as transparent as practicable with the nomination of contact officers. Again, Senator Vallentine will be able to use that information. This will facilitate necessary and welcome dialogue between exporters and responsible officials. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the guidelines outlined by the Government in this new policy will enable an industry already operating in Australia, and already exporting weapons under a complicated system of guidelines, to do so in a more clear and coherent fashion. It will enable people with viewpoints which differ from those of the Government to more readily identify what is happening and make those issues public in Australia. That will contribute to the debate. It will ensure that more of the Australian people know what is happening in regard to the export of Australian arms overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> I reject completely the suggestion that Australia is developing an arms trade that means that we will be in some sort of arms club on a similar level to the Soviets, the French, the Americans, the Swedes, the West Germans, the Chinese or the Czechoslovakians. That is an absurd suggestion which does proponents of Senator Vallentine's motion no good and affects considerably the credibility of their point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to conclude on Senator Vallentine's remarks about the inconsistency of our position in the United Nations. I had hoped that she would have the good grace to congratulate the Australian Government on achieving a significant breakthrough during the past week concerning the chemical weapons treaty. This is something the Australian Government has pushed considerably. The Bush Administration has now taken that matter up in the United Nations and it has become a major policy agenda item for that Administration. It looks as if we will be able to achieve a significant improvement in the position of the use of chemical weapons and their proliferation in the world. I agree with Senator Vallentine on one point: she described chemical weapons as the poor countries' atomic bomb. I think that is correct and I think that Australia's influence with the American Administration, resulting in its taking up this issue, is a great breakthrough. It also further underlines the fact that Australia, through its alliances within the Western group of nations, is able to influence countries such as the United States to adopt such attitudes. That is an improvement. If we adopted Senator Vallentine's general attitude that we should be neutral and non-aligned, we would not have had that influence to achieve what could be a significant breakthrough in controlling chemical weapons use in the world. I ask the Senate to reject the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating a motion on a matter of urgency moved by Senator Vallentine. We have all sat here before hearing some of this diatribe. It is a little different today, but it is still very much the same. I think Senator Vallentine should consider whether she can get herself a new speech writer because the punch is going. We are accustomed to hearing this at length at midnight; it makes a change to hear it mid-afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This motion is all based on a principle which lies behind it and which is virtually unsaid-that by having no arms a country will be safe from aggression. There is no way that we in the Opposition can possibly countenance any motion based on that principle. That is the basis on which Senator Vallentine approaches any defence debate in this place. She fails to understand the incontrovertible lesson of the Second World War. I have reminded her over and over again how directly the deaths of the Second World War were the responsibility of those who preached and implemented disarmament in the 1930s. The disarmament movement will never learn how dangerous and ignorant its proposals are, proposals which we hear over and over again from Senator Vallentine. It will be a gracious blessing when eventually she departs from this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention, in passing, the movement towards the control of chemical weapons. We welcome this and we support moves to try to achieve international control in that area. I am glad to add my voice to the comments of Senator Schacht on that issue. It is interesting to note that when Senator Vallentine speaks in this place-and she usually speaks very fast and her words are somewhat turgid, as I have told her before-the quotations and authorities that she uses in her speech all seem to come from an anti-authoritarian, left wing flock of publicly funded organisations. As I listened to her reel off first one organisation and then another front organisation, I was musing that so many of these are funded by the very taxpayers of Australia whom those organisations are working so hard to see undefended. I take offence at her holier than thou, moralistic diatribe about the values of those people from Australian industry and the defence personnel who went on the mission to South East Asia late last year. I find it quite offensive and feel that it is totally unacceptable that the Western Australian senator should ascribe such impure motives to those people. I take exception on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> We in the Opposition believe very strongly that Australia should not take the line that Senator Vallentine has been proposing. We believe that Australia must maintain alliances and good and friendly relations with its neighbours. We also believe that we should aim for the highest possible degree of self-reliance. Senator Vallentine would not have us do either. She would not have us maintain alliances, nor would she allow us to ensure that we were self-reliant in terms of our equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine's motion refers to three matters. The first is:</PARA>
<PARA>The need of the Government to acknowledge-</PARA>
<PARA>(a) that new guidelines on arms sales and defence exports mean that Australia can no longer be considered a country which chose to refuse membership of the arms club;</PARA>
<PARA>The second is:</PARA>
<PARA>(b) that the decision means that the export of arms and defence material by Australia is more important than the point of impact: the people in other countries, primarily the Third World, who will suffer and die because of Australia's decision to improve its balance of payments in this way;</PARA>
<PARA>The third is:</PARA>
<PARA>(c) that there is therefore an urgent need for the Government to reconsider its decision to change its policy on the export of military equipment and to refuse to join the accelerating competition around the world to market and export such equipment. </PARA>
<PARA>We in the Opposition would not be able to accept any one of these points. First, it is a badly worded motion. It displays awkward use of the English language and is turgid in the extreme. Leaving that aside, the sentiments behind it are also confused and ill-informed. First, item (a) of the motion refers to `the new guidelines'. I would ask which new guidelines Senator Vallentine is referring to. Is she referring to some guidelines that she has already seen? If so, she seems to have an advantage that most of us in this Parliament have not enjoyed. She has acknowledged today that she has not seen them, and that she is only guessing. Therefore, on that score this has to be dealt with as a rather premature motion. These guidelines are not yet available, and I understand that they will not be available until the legislation goes through the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion contains a misleading and emotive use of the term `arms club', a matter that Senator Schacht has already successfully dealt with. If Senator Vallentine means government policy when referring to the new guidelines, I would put the matter fairly simply-and as a member of the Opposition I find myself in a somewhat strange position in seeking to describe government policy. Judging by the information put out publicly by the Government, it appears to cover items that have uses other than solely military which can then be sold without government intervention and items of a purely military nature which have to be treated on a case by case basis depending on who is buying the equipment and how necessary it is to keep the secret technology to ourselves. I draw attention to the statement put out by the Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, on 14 June last year, in which he said that the Government announced `new principles for the control of defence exports that will speed up approval and rationalise the type of goods affected'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>the Government aims to promote our defence exports without prejudice to important defence, international and human rights concerns. The new export controls will focus on those goods that are designed for military purposes and are either lethal or of major military significance. </PARA>
<PARA>The controls are to focus on those, but there will be a freeing up of controls in some areas. In the past, the exporters had no access to the old defence export guidelines, which were classified. It was reasonable that the Government should take action to deal with things that were out of date or inappropriate if our defence industry were to be able to make headway overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad also to draw to the Senate's attention the fact that on the same date the Opposition spokesman on defence, Mr Peter White, announced in a press release that the Opposition welcomed the Government's decision. He said that it was:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a sensible policy towards defence exports which will do a great deal to assist Australian industry and to give Australia a further degree of defence self-sufficiency. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr White went on to say that commonsense appeared to have triumphed and that another Opposition policy had been implemented. The Government and the Opposition are looking at the matter very much from the same point of view, but the left wing elements in our society have a different agenda and find difficulty in accepting what we think is the right future direction for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (b) of the motion refers to `the export of arms and defence material'. This is extraordinarily important to Australia. Senator Vallentine will dispute my reasons for arguing on these lines, but I believe that Australians must first think about the enormous trade deficit that this country faces. The figure for January was the worst on record, at $1.537 billion. Do we have the luxury of deciding that we will not allow any of our defence industry production to be sold overseas when we face such an incredible trade deficit? We also face a reduction in our living standards which is due entirely to the problems involved in having such a trade deficit. With our economic standing so low, it is nonsense to prevent legitimate exports such as those proposed by the Government. We would not agree with any prohibition on legitimate exports. </PARA>
<PARA> I also draw attention to the fact that the effort that is put into trying to stop these legitimate exports is similar to the efforts that are being put towards the prevention of legitimate exports of paper pulp. The same groups are dead keen to see that Australia does not improve its balance of trade position with regard to wood pulp exports. There is a group of people in this country which has no recognition of our diabolical economic position and which would try to push its unrealistic economic views down our throats, to the disadvantage of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from that, the arms industry and defence related industry could be of critical importance in terms of our defence self-reliance. It is quite impossible, in a country of this size, to have production runs in industry which are large enough to keep unit costs down to an affordable level for our own defence requirements. Defence is an enormously expensive item for taxpayers to fund and an enormously important and vital area. Unless we can spread some of the costs by greater runs in industry, we shall be hard pressed to be able to provide any sort of self-reliance in equipping our own forces. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention to the lessons learned in this area during the Vietnam war. Senator Vallentine referred to this aspect, but did so pretty inaccurately, in my view. In fighting that war, we had soldiers whose lives depended on our ability to keep them supplied. Sweden refused to supply us with Carl Gustavs and also with the guns and ammunition for the helicopter gunships. In the case of the gunships, eventually Australia was supplied because Sweden sold the items to England, which in turn, sold them to Australia. But the fact remains that, when our troops needed this equipment desperately, there was a country remote from Australia which did not approve of our involvement and therefore sought to exercise its will upon us, thereby harming our troops. We must not be in that position, and we must do all we possibly can to see that never again are we in the hands of people who would defeat our war effort. </PARA>
<PARA> The people in other countries referred to in the motion also put great store in our ability to supply them. Senator Schacht mentioned the needs of the Pacific island countries with the Pacific patrol boat. They also need to be well equipped to meet the possibility of aggression in their countries. It is unrealistic to assume that the Pacific can possibly stay peaceful forever. We need countries that are well-equipped to defend themselves. We cannot be the defenders of the entire Pacific. If our neighbours are well-equipped and can operate with us in times of instability in our region, there will be more opportunity for us to enjoy peace with our neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (c) of the motion refers to the urgent need, as Senator Vallentine sees it, for the Government to reconsider its decision to change its policy. I say that no way should the Government change its policy. There is an urgent need for the guidelines to be published quickly, for the sake of certainty, because that is an area of difficulty for industry. Industry needs to know exactly what the Government intends. I draw attention to the fact that the Cooksey Review of Australia's Defence Cooperation Programs and Policy on Export of Defence Equipment called for the Government to reach a decision on revised procedures for handling applications for defence exports by the end of 1986 and to have the related administrative structure in operation by July 1987. That action has not occurred and we criticise the Government for its lack of action. Things have taken far too long, and it is believed that it was the former Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Hayden, who delayed action in that area. We are glad that the Government has moved in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has not yet moved in the area in which we believe it must move, and this relates to a question I asked Senator Evans last Friday. There is a desperate need for our neighbours to be able to get finance from the Australian Government if they are to make meaningful use of the purchases available to them. Until that time, our Australian industry will not be able to take full advantage of the new procedures. Nevertheless, we support the Government's action and totally reject Senator Vallentine's motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I support the urgency motion. I hope to do so in a manner more gracious than that in which Senator Newman opposed it. The Australian Democrats identify with the three elements of the urgency motion. Senator Vallentine, in moving the motion as a matter of urgency, drew attention to the fact that the Australian Government, in bringing down its guidelines and stating emphatically its policy on arms exports, had placed Australia firmly in the membership of the arms club, the arms exporters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second element of the urgency motion cites the fact that by virtue of these guidelines and policy we are placing Australia's export interests first, over and above the impact of the export of those arms on the recipients. In other words, the policy gives an approval to the export of weapons, guns, weaponry and instruments of war, because it happens to earn for us dollars and cents, irrespective of what the impact is upon the recipient country. Those two things being so, it seems eminently sensible to call upon the Government to reconsider that policy. Indeed, that is the third element of the urgency motion. </PARA>
<PARA> Before going on to develop the Australian Democrats' argument in support of the urgency motion, I devote a minute or two to one or two things that Senator Newman said. She mentioned the fact that she was somewhat embarrassed by the fact that the Opposition finds itself aligned with the Government on this question. I am surprised at that. If we look at the Hansard record, we find that the Government and the Opposition were aligned time and time again. A look at the record of voting patterns in this chamber over the last 12 or 18 months would show that on more than 50 occasions the Opposition and Government sat on the same side of the chamber confronting between seven and 10 Independents and Democrats. The fact is that ideologically they are one. The electorate is beginning to find it increasingly difficult to differentiate between the ideologies of the Opposition and the Government. I, for one, am not in the slightest bit surprised to find that the Opposition is aligned with the Government on this issue, in the same way as I am not surprised to find them aligned on other issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Where do we begin to address this urgency motion? In Australia we do not seem to question propositions such as that which states that a free society is better than an enslaved society. We would not even begin to question that proposition. Neither would we question the proposition that a just society is preferable to an unjust society, or that a more democratic society is preferable to an undemocratic society. However, for some reason or other, when it comes to questions and issues of peace and the eminently sensible proposition that a peaceful society is vastly preferable to a warlike society, we find that people like Senator Newman, other members of the Opposition and, indeed, the Government, have a hangup about peace. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me eminently sensible that in 1989 and into the 1990s, a nuclear age, quite clearly we have to do everything in our power to move towards global peace. Therefore, we in the Democrats do not for one moment wonder whether we should question a policy and a set of priorities which make Australia a manufacturer and an exporter of arms to Third World countries in the pursuit of dollars. We are really talking about a handful of dollars, relative to our gross domestic product. It strikes us as being an unethical, indeed immoral, position for the Government to place us in. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, in summary, the Democrats have grave reservations about these new policies. We believe they have no ethical basis. Australia has made many statements recently in the United Nations and elsewhere calling for the curtailment of the international arms trade; acknowledging the link between military expenditure and social hardship, particularly in developing countries; and urging nations to embrace non-military approaches to guaranteeing their security. These are the sorts of statements we make in the world forums, yet these are the sorts of policies and priorities being put in place by our Government. They stand in total contradiction to the statements that we make in world forums. They lie. They project to the world contradictions. Despite this, the Government now announces a policy of targeting developing countries for arms sales; reducing controls on sales of Australian arms and commercial explosives; defining whole categories of products and services as defensive, irrespective of the military position of the purchasing country; making the presumption that we will export to any country to which our allies export; and that exports to our allies will be unrestricted in any way. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is locked into the mentality which said that we would fight in any country where our allies fought; we would go `all the way with LBJ'; we would export arms to any country to which our allies exported arms. It is a flawed rationale which historically has been tragic for us and all mankind. We must stop this insanity. This change of priorities and policy does nothing to stop it. Indeed, it reinforces the negative spiral and the negative processes that have been in place in the postwar period. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats, therefore, are disgusted by the Government's stand on this issue. We will push for parliamentary scrutiny of Australian arms exports, because details of military exports are currently not reported to the Parliament. We find that situation totally unacceptable. Approval of arms exports should be a joint decision by the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, because in this case trade priorities override the other two sets of priorities. In fact, they contradict them. Even if they were reinforced by what is argued by the Opposition-and presumably by the Government-to be defence priorities, they fly in the face of our foreign affairs priorities. The Government's policy is not only unethical, but also inherently illogical and contradictory. It must surely be a millstone around the neck of our new Ambassador for Disarmament, Mr David Rees. </PARA>
<PARA> We are trotting around the world stage, assuming leadership on the issues of chemical warfare, calling and convening international conventions in Australia to discuss the issue of chemical warfare and how it can be brought under control and how chemical weapons can be stopped in their production and distribution. On the other hand, we are turning our back on the issue of conventional weapons, somehow or other pretending that to be destroyed by a grenade, a bullet or a rocket is somehow less offensive than death by chemistry. It is farcical, hypocritical, contradictory and insane. </PARA>
<PARA> The position I have just stated has been stated in world forums by those who represent our Government in those forums. I will quote some of the things that we have said to be our official position in relation to the need to reduce the arms trade and military spending, precisely the question under discussion now, in some of those world forums. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was quoted in an article in the Peace and Disarmament News of May 1988 as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Australia would like to see included in . . . an agenda for the UN Third Special Session on Disarmament . . . an enhanced approach to the problem of reducing conventional weapons including legitimate and illegal arms transfers between states . . . </PARA>
<PARA> At the same conference, Mr Richard Butler, the former Ambassador for Disarmament, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The absence from the multilateral disarmament agenda of the Conference on Disarmament of serious consideration of the problem posed by conventional arms and international arms transfers-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, arms trading-</PARA>
<PARA>is entirely inappropriate to today's circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Butler further said:</PARA>
<PARA> This is the case for review of the Conference on Disarmament's agenda, but I would add one other reason, which is the shocking, the continued expansion of the global arms economy and the international trade in conventional weapons. How much longer can we ask people to take us seriously on the issue of global disarmament if we retain an agenda which does not address the horrible phenomenon of international trade, both overt and covert, in conventional weapons?</PARA>
<PARA>Yet, today the Government is saying, `Let us get in on this rat race. Let us get in on this insane trading of conventional weapons because we have a balance of payments problem and it will earn us a few bucks'. That is the mentality of drug pushers. </PARA>
<PARA> I was in Senator Newman's State of Tasmania only recently and saw opium being grown for medical uses. One might as well say, `Let us double, treble, quadruple, the acreage of opium and sell it overseas in order to rectify our balance of payments problems'. That is precisely the same mentality. The same moral code could be used to justify that proposition as is being used to justify the massive production and exportation of and international trade in conventional weapons. Yet, on the other hand, we argue against the production and distribution of chemical weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hayden, whom I respected as a Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Arms transfers must not become a new cash crop. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a phrase I heard Senator Vallentine use at the beginning of this debate. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>It should . . . be recognised, especially by those whose development needs are great, that the purchase of arms is at the cost of the purchase of the investment goods essential to the creation of employment and economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA> What is being suggested is that the whole business of selling arms to Third World countries simply disadvantages those countries in two ways: it prepares them to slaughter one another, usually for the most spurious reasons, and it simply drains their economies of the absolutely essential dollars necessary for their inherent positive growth. </PARA>
<PARA> Our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made the following statement in India about two weeks ago:</PARA>
<PARA> About 25 billion dollars are being channelled every year from the developing to the developed countries in the form of a reverse flow of resources. The most heavily indebted countries find themselves diverting to debt repayment more than half the value of their mercantile exports and close to 5 per cent of their gross domestic product. Developing countries face serious shortages of finance to manage their balance-of-payments problems and meet their requirements of development. Yet, sources of development assistance are drying up. . . . It is a sad comment on the inequity and inefficiency of the current order that developing countries are, in effect, financing the developed. </PARA>
<PARA>What is more, they are financing them in terms of the purchase of conventional arms. This abominable situation should not be tolerated by the Australian public, or by the world community. It is a situation that should not be argued about in our parliaments or tolerated politically. It is the essence of hypocrisy for the Government to put in place these policies and our Prime Minister to make these sorts of statements while strutting the international forum as a statesman. That is the view of the Australian Democrats in support of this urgency motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion with the qualification that I already consider Australia to be a member of the arms-exporting club, although it must be said that it has shown, up to now, more discrimination in both the material exported and its destination than have many other nations, like the United States and the United Kingdom, which we would expect to know better. This may have been merely a by-product of the tangled inefficiency of the bureaucratic approval system that Cooksey condemns in his report-in other words, anyone who wanted to kill anyone quickly would not have come to Australia for his military equipment. For all its possibly benign effects, I would not support the existing system. Apart from any- thing else, it has been impossible to know exactly what and how much military equipment is being exported. I believe that it is time that all such transactions were collected in a central registry where they can be subjected to the most open review possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have all been sold a rather cunningly wrapped package by the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley). He has tied his defence policy of `self-reliance', with its stirring suggestion of the national self-respect that Australians have always hoped for but will not achieve while the Government persists in its current inequitable alliance, to a strong defence export industry which will more cheaply and more efficiently supply us with so-called `self-reliant' arms. If less had been spent on totally unsuitable and aggressive equipment in the past, we might be able to be truly self-reliant. Mr Beazley has also tantalised us with promises of large sums of money. A passing reference to the latest escalation in the trade deficit and the use of the word `banana' would seem to peel away moral reservations about selling arms. But I strongly suspect that Mr Beazley has sold himself his own market-place spiel and I agree with our Governor-General, Bill Hayden, who doubted that Australia would be broadly competitive in a market with many new suppliers. </PARA>
<PARA> If Australia does succeed in qualifying as a full-fledged `merchant of death' arms supplier, I do not see how we could avoid the further moral compromises-in addition to the moral problems associated with the fact of selling arms-that are likely to follow. The arms trade has a reputation for inducing corruption that is in no way inferior to the reputation of the heroin trade, as has been pointed out several times in this debate. The temptation to resort to bribery in a market-place where `everyone else is doing it' will be enormous, especially when dealing with countries with what I will call `alternative' ethical mores. </PARA>
<PARA> This is relevant to the widely publicised Bofors affair, where different moral imperatives were in conflict. Sweden, with half our population, faces a disproportionately larger threat and depends heavily upon its defence exports. The individuals involved faced a conflict between an abstract principle and the well-being of their families and work communities. Mats Lundberg was a prime mover in the clandestine shipment of explosives to Iran. He now faces criminal charges. But in speaking of local reaction to his offence, he said in a Four Corners program on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation:</PARA>
<PARA>It's a pleasure for me to go to the grocery store or the mail office. People are noticing me, people are talking to me much more than they did before. They keep slapping my back, wishing me luck and so on, so I have no problems at all at home, in that sense. Whatever I did, right or wrong, it was not for my personal gain or anything like that. It was concern about the company and the employees of the company, and they give me credit for that. </PARA>
<PARA>So, local and even national loyalties will always prevail over the welfare of distant and anonymous people. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Swedes found out, after his assassination, that Olaf Palme had been involved in brokering a corrupt artillery deal with India, they realised that the `prophet of our time' had been only a politician after all. Honourable senators will sympathise with the Swedes and will know the shock they must have suffered, but in Australia we are used to seeing our heroes fall off their clay feet and we have no excuse for not anticipating these problems. For instance, there will be a strong temptation, when negotiating substantial arms deals involving military weapons, not to inquire into the provenance of end-user certificates. The Swedish example, of course, provides a salutary lesson for Australia. I doubt whether the length of time that is proposed in the new legislation for an examination of end-user certificates-namely, only 21 days including weekends-will provide the sufficient time necessary for investigations into these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems likely that any substantial growth in Australia's arms exports will arise from sales to nations in our own region. Even if we avoid arming them against ourselves, we may well end up arming them against each other. This would represent a further decline in our Government's much cherished but not much respected peace-promoting international image. It is up to this Parliament to investigate thoroughly the moral implications of an increased arms export trade. The Parliament will have an opportunity to do so in detail in April when the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill is debated in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> As I see it, there are three possible positions that Australia might take on this question. The first is virtually to export no arms at all, perhaps with the exception of small patrol boats to Pacific island states. The second is to establish clear guidelines defining defensive weapons that would be exported to nations not in conflict and not in breach of human rights conventions. This position is probably closest to Australia's current policy, but is much more clearly defined than the current slack regulations which govern exports. I am afraid the new regulations will do nothing to tighten up controls on exports-quite the contrary. The third position is to adopt the actual policy of the major arms exporting states. This position assumes that peace can be maintained only by a balance of terror. Australia could easily end up adopting this stance under the proposed new regulations. This Parliament, and particularly this chamber, has an obligation to raise the ethical questions of an expanded arms export trade and force the Government to face all the implications of its new policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously, I am opposing Senator Vallentine's urgency motion. It must be very comfortable to be elected to this Senate as essentially a one issue senator and not to have to worry about balancing the competing elements that go to constitute the national interest. It is one of those flaws in the proportional representation system that it throws up people who do not have to purport to govern and do not have to weigh the competing interests that go to making judgments about the national interest and bear the responsibility for those decisions. Apart from not having to turn up at the Parliament when it is not convenient, one also does not have to bear it in mind that sometimes foreign affairs, defence, industry and economic issues interrelate and that we need to look at them all and make a balanced and considered judgment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we peel away the rhetorical flourishes from this motion, it is not quite clear what it actually means, what it is saying should be the policy of the Government. Does it say-it is not quite clear to me-that Australia should not have any defence exports at all? That may well be what it says. It is probably the most logical interpretation of the words, although it does not actually say that. If that is the case-and it was not clear from the debate; listening to what people had said, particularly Senator Vallentine, I still was not sure-it seems to me illogical. I do not see why the world would be a safer place or war would be less likely if Australia-this is not inconsistent with what Senator Dunn was saying in the last few moments of her contribution-were to sell quite widely the minehunter catamarans that we are developing very successfully or the patrol boats which seem to contribute significantly to the defensive capacity of many nations, and not just in our region. In selling them in the short term we might make the world a safer and more peaceful place. We might wish nobody ever had to buy them. </PARA>
<PARA> If the world were a better place government would be easier and we could all adopt policies that would be more appealing to the people in Senator Vallentine's constituency, but it is hard to see why anyone would advocate that we should not sell minehunter catamarans or patrol boats but that we should continue to sell those things that are turned into weapons so often such as iron, steel and computers. Those who have a longer memory will recall the story about Malcolm's wool keeping the Russians warm at the time of the so-called trade boycott of the Soviet Union after its invasion of Afghanistan. Australia is contributing in a wide number of ways to the military endeavours of countries around the world, many of which, if we had our choice, we would oppose. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also somewhat perplexed about the part of the motion that implies that Australia used to refuse to be a member of what is so graphically called the `arms club'. Australia has never refused to be a part of that, if there is such a thing. Certainly, Australia has a long established tradition of arms exports. It is somewhat loosely controlled by byzantine and outdated regulations; nevertheless, the estimate by Bob Cooksey, the consultant who prepared a report on Australia's defence exports, was that our defence exports are currently worth $250m. But we have some restrictions. For example, it has been a part of the regulations that control defence exports that we cannot sell uniforms. I am sure that that is a very substantial contribution to world peace and that people around the world are calling off their coups and military interventions because we do not make our uniforms available! We need to maintain rigorous controls, bring those controls up to date, make sure that the principles for which this country has a proud record of standing, and certainly for which this Government stands, are maintained while maximising the defence, economic, and industrial benefits and the foreign affairs advantages for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very difficult, if not impossible, to name a country with the capacity to undertake arms exports which has more rigorous controls that those which have been introduced in Australia. Some people have on paper slightly more rigorous controls, but we all know that they are there just as a facade to cover very substantial arms exports to people who are not in conformity with that process. That has not been a problem in Australia, to our credit. I am optimistic. These improved, enhanced and simplistic controls should guarantee that it will not become a problem. We are establishing a more rational basis for maintaining the controls but we will not in the process lose the moral, the foreign affairs and the civil rights aspects. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear from the new guidelines that Australia will not be exporting defence goods to countries subject to a United Nations Security Council embargo, or which are employing armed forces in a manner contrary to a resolution of the Security Council or international agreements to which Australia is a party. We will not be allowing exports of military equipment where that equipment may be used to suppress human rights and, of course, we will not be allowing private trafficking in arms. I think those views are shared by most people, if not by everybody in this House. I think it is fair to say only that they are held by most people, but I strongly support them, and they are a key part of the Government's policy. </PARA>
<PARA> What I glean from the sentiment of this motion, with which I do agree, is that we should not have exports at any price. The view was put by Bill Hayden when he was Foreign Minister-I think it is absolutely correct-that arms exports can be a source of revenue at a moral price which is not worth paying. Australia does not have a record to be ashamed of in that area, and nor should it, and nor should it develop such a policy. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of chemical weapons-in which the Government is taking significant disarmament initiatives-Australia has a very well-developed chemical industry. If we did not have a government which had a rigorous policy and was not trying to build walls against people exporting chemical weapons but was actually going out and initiating a dialogue with Australian industry to get its support-to its credit, its very strong support-for a chemical weapons ban and working with it on the implications of a convention banning such weapons, we would start to see the permeation of a culture of the export of military material that was a source of very real and substantial moral and ethical problems. But I do not believe that those negatives apply. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to rely in my contribution to the debate merely on the double negative that certain things that are alleged are not likely to occur. I think one also has an obligation to look at the case for taking these initiatives. Essentially, it comes down to two principal arguments and some subsidiary points to which I wish to refer. Of course, the pre-eminent argument is the argument about the part of a defence industry in self-reliance-a fact that I would have thought was self-evident. Certainly, the evidence substantially supports the fact that we cannot have an Australian defence industry capable of meeting Australian demand if it is forced to survive solely on demand from within Australia. I do not understand why we are better off as a nation or why we are making a more substantial contribution to world peace if we have to import arms because our defence industry declines because it does not have an economic level of demand and therefore goes into recession and closes down and we have to import more arms than we now do in order to maintain Australia's defence capacity. This was the case previously with regard to shipbuilding in Australia. I cannot see how we made a more substantial contribution by running down our shipbuilding industry to such an extent that we were not capable of building our own ships. </PARA>
<PARA> It also makes a contribution to defence in another way in terms of the cost at which we can buy Australian produced equipment if we are able to have longer production runs and achieve economies of scale in the production of defence equipment in Australia. I do not accept that we are in any way better off because we have to pay more for Australia's defence to achieve the same standard of service and of equipment purchases. It is possible to argue that we should purchase A rather than B; I understand that argument. There is an argument about defence strategy that says, `You are strategically wrong; you could be buying different equipment for a different purpose'. That is a legitimate argument. But to say that we should allow the Australian defence industry to go into decline to the extent that it cannot provide the percentage of the Australian defence equipment requirement that it now does, or that it has to do so at a higher cost because it is operating at an uneconomic level, seems to me to fly in the face of the national interest. I think the self-reliance element of the capacity to sustain and develop an industry to provide Australia's defence requirements is the substantial argument in favour of the policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Australia also has to acknowledge, and those taking a broader and balanced view should recognise, that Australia has a vested interest in enhancing our regional security, in helping our friends in the region, particularly those who do not have any defence industry and who, I imagine, we and they, in terms of their economic interests, would prefer not to develop a defence industry but still to have a capacity, through the purchase of patrol boats and other things from us, to contribute to stability and security in the region. To reiterate a point made previously, I think the case for some of this activity is that some of the more defensive items provided by Australia and in some instances at the moment through the aid program and in a developing way commercially-I referred previously to the mine hunters and to the patrol boats-are making a contribution to a safer world by enhancing people's capacity to defend themselves in a way which they can afford and which can be effective. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to an important point about the provision of arms. It may well be that we all wish that nobody had any armed forces because it would be a lovely, peaceful world where everybody just shook hands with each other, but the United Nations has always recognised and, I believe, will always recognise the inherent right of nations for self-defence. Australia recognises this for itself, and we should recognise it for others. Armaments in themselves do not necessarily contribute to, nor undermine, the very high-minded and proper principles of the United Nations. It has always recognised the capacity and the need for people to have an inherent right to defend themselves. Australia's policy does not in any way change the limitation which has always applied to our sale of arms to nations which are using those arms to violate the rights of their citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> I find somewhat offensive the gratuitous Third World argument thrown into the motion-a sort of intellectual colonialism-that these poor people do not understand what is in their own interests and we, in the Senate, should lecture them so that they understand that they should not be buying these things from Australia; it is against their interests; it is a terrible thing. It is always necessary in a pseudo-progressive argument to shed a few crocodile tears for the Third World, but I think it is patronising bunk and intellectual colonialism. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I think Australia has a consistent and continuing commitment to disarmament and arms control. The policies of defence experts are in no way inconsistent with those principles; they are consistent with our objectives of self-reliance; of our support for the United Nations charter on human rights; and of our recognition of the inherent right of nations to defend themselves. It is a difficult balance, but that is what governments are about-balancing competing objectives. It is what distinguishes government parties from minorities that get elected with 3 or 4 per cent of the vote. Therefore, I urge the Senate to reject the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon the Senate is debating a motion on behalf of the peace movement from Senator Vallentine. I really wish that she would put some of the effort that she puts into the peace movement into basic grammar, because the first sentence in paragraph (a) is simply ungrammatical, quite apart from the fact that it is couched in very emotional language. Paragraph (b) puts the worst possible construction on defence. It just happens to be one of the most fundamental and important obligations of any government to defend its people. To run off with the rather hysterical construction that, because one is involved in defence one is visiting death and injury on a whole lot of innocent people, is to neglect to look at the consequences of what a negligent government visits upon its defenceless population when a usurping or invading army comes through. Of course, it denies the concept of deterrence, the concept on which the Western democracies have based their posture for the last 45 years-and a very successful posture it has been, because for 45 years we have enjoyed freedom from a major world war. So the concept works, whatever the peace movement might say about it. The final paragraph of the motion deals with the urgent need for the Government to reconsider its position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think I am reasonably alert to what the community is saying. Through you, Mr Deputy President, I can tell Senator Vallentine that I am not aware of any movement in the community protesting about the Government's actions. There were a few extremist groups, such as the Australian Council for Overseas Aid, the peace movement and all their subsets that operate in the community, at the time the legislation was talked about last year before it was introduced into the House of Representatives, but there certainly has been no reaction in the community. So it would be quite wrong to be talking about an urgent need arising from disquiet at the present policy of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Newman said that Senator Vallentine's attack on the policy was based, to a very large degree, on supposition. Although the Government has made clear its intentions to liberalise the strict prohibitions that were on the supply of arms and armaments to other countries, at the moment we have only a press release-No. 99/88-of the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) which Senator Schacht read from in his address, and I believe that draft guidelines have been promulgated to industry on a confidential basis. I have not seen those guidelines and I think it is a fair assumption that neither has Senator Vallentine. So for her to mount a detailed attack on the grounds of supposition is a little unwise. </PARA>
<PARA> Her principal defence, though, was on the canard that we needed to sell defence equipment to other countries to resurrect our balance of payments, and that the balance of payments was in disarray and deficit purely because we were buying computers and new aircraft for the defence forces. Those propositions are absolutely false and Senator Vallentine knows it. We who are supporting this policy are not saying that at all. What we are saying is that it is desirable for Australia's own defence that we sell to other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point on which Senator Vallentine and Senator Dunn placed some emphasis was the corruption in other countries in relation to arms sales. I say in passing that Senator Dunn needs to get another speech writer because if she can only go for seven minutes, reading a speech, she ought to steal some of Senator Vallentine's old papers and have them photocopied because she can read for 15 or 20 minutes when she has something to say. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that many of the arms sales around the Third World countries have involved bribes is in no way necessarily a reflection on the integrity of the arms providers. The fact is that in almost all of those countries a standard of corruption is involved in the way that the Government does its business, whether it is buying food, wheat or arms. The evidence of bribery and corruption in getting arms sales contracts illustrates the way these countries do their business. Australia certainly will not get involved in that kind of activity but I stress the point that it is a symptom, not the cause. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine also quoted at great length about the Swedes. If one nation on earth reeks of hypocrisy, duplicity and double dealing it is that country. It is a country which hosts peace movements and pacifist groups to a nauseating degree, yet it is as heavily involved in the provision of arms to other countries as it can be. It sells the arms, takes the money and runs. Sweden doublecrossed us at the time of Vietnam when it failed to support the Carl Gustav weapons system we bought from it. But Sweden was not alone in that. We had trouble with France and even with the Labour Government in the United Kingdom at the time until the then Prime Minister of Australia, John Gorton, took a very firm line with some of his opposite numbers in Britain and that position was turned around. The essential point to be learnt from that is that, as well as deterrence, Australia's defence must be based on self-reliance. We must be as independent as it is possible for us to be in our own defence capability. By generating our own defence manufacturing capability and by being able to sell that product overseas we add to our independence and thereby add to our national security. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has a history of achievement in arms production. We did very little before the Second World War. Throughout the Second World War we came from nothing in a few short years and we produced everything-ships, tanks, aircraft and engines. After the Second World War the armaments industry moved into increasingly higher levels of technology and it became cost ineffective for Australia to produce with the small markets we had. The general level of military preparedness of the country, being quite low at the time, contributed to this. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, under the Labor Government, we have seen a re-establishment of defence manufacturing in Australia. I applaud the Government for what it has done in that regard. However, it has not thought it through very carefully. I will just give one example of that. The big cost in setting up industries is the establishment cost. We put a lot of money into the Maribyrnong facility in Melbourne to build the 105 millimetre guns for the Army. Instead of continuing the production line to supply weapons and artillery to the Reserve, as was originally contracted, it was discontinued at the end of last year. So, after the very high cost of establishing the production line for a short run, it has been chopped. Mr Beazley and the Australian Labor Party, while they are busy setting up these industries, ought to realise that continuity is the key to them. We are much better off buying 10 weapons a year for 10 years rather than 100 in one year and having the place close down. </PARA>
<PARA> At present the trade in defence equipment that Australia involves itself in is absolutely minuscule. The best figures I can get relate to 1986. In aggregate about $250m is involved, which is just peanuts. The great part of that goes to our close allies. I presume-I have not seen the figures-it relates to things such as barra sonar buoys, jindiviks and ikaras, which are rather large items and now rather old equipment. However, they are still in service with some of our close friends. The regional trade that we are involved with is absolutely minuscule. I hope that the projections that the Government makes of being able to double that in a period of three to five years come true because this is a matter of great importance to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As you know, Mr Deputy President, I have always argued in the 11 years that I have been in the Parliament that Australia should expand its own resources for the production of its defence requirements. When I first came into this place I had a look at the production of ammunition by the Australian facilities in Melbourne and Sydney. At the time there was a good market in South East Asia for ammunition. That is no reference to the Vietnam War as that had just been completed. But service ammunition requires very close quality assurance procedures. Very precise loads and combustion characteristics are required for automatic weapons. Not all nations can do that. We had those facilities in place. I found that the reason why Australia could not sell small arms ammunition was simply the fact that we did not have a ship. So many requirements on loading precautions have to be met that a dedicated ship is needed. It does not have to be very large. But because we did not have a ship to take ammunition around South East Asia commercially, other than a Navy vessel, we simply could not get into the market. Of course, it is old history now that Singapore set up its own production facilities and has scooped the pool. </PARA>
<PARA> The biggest reason for developing our own industry is that we in Australia and in South East Asia, which is our presumptive area of operations, live in a peculiar environment. All the equipment which is produced for the Western democracies is optimised for the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) theatre, which is a cool temperate climate. It is an intensive, competitive climate from a technological point of view and requires the leading edge of technology. On the other hand, in Australia we are dealing with very much higher temperatures and humidities and the nature of the competition is not necessarily as high. I always argued that there is great scope in many directions for Australia to be developing its own weapons systems and platforms which are appropriate for the region and selling them to the South East Asia region. It is important that we involve the South East Asian countries in our defence because the threats to Australia come not from them but through them. It is very much in our interest to maintain friendly co-operative programs and to have strong countries to the north of us. </PARA>
<PARA> To return to the environmental considerations, you, Mr Deputy President, would remember well that when the Americans went to Vietnam some of their air to air missiles had a high failure rate simply because they were optimised for a cooler climate in the NATO European theatre. When the missiles were exposed to the high humidities and temperatures of Vietnam they simply did not work. In our own case, if one looks at Darwin the temperature today, I suppose, is 34 to 36 degrees on the ground. A missile sitting on an aircraft in Darwin is cooking off inside at a very much higher temperature. Within a few minutes, when the aircraft climbs to 40,000 feet over the city of Darwin-one of the geographical peculiarities of Darwin is that one of the biggest pools of very cold air sits at altitudes over that town right in the tropics-the environmental change is enormous and it is significant for us. There are numerous comparisons that can be made on equipment. If one looks at the whole of the electronics field, at radar propagation in tropical areas, there are special skills and characteristics for us to develop which are relevant to the region. If Australia is to be a supplier we should develop the industries and skills that are of national importance to us. Honourable senators should always remember that most of the advantages in modern communities come from the defence industries. They never come from the peace movement, most members of which demonstrate that they cannot even write a grammatical sentence. They are a spin-off from the high technology defence industries which have done so much to improve the quality of life of countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that we do get into this business of supplying defence equipment to our neighbours because it strengthens them and strengthens us. I hope that we can make money out of it. One of the tragedies of the present situation is that we do not have enough money in defence. I talked about the 105 millimetre weapons before. We do not have any ammunition for them because we do not manufacture it. We put a lot of money into pavetack, a multimillion dollar upgrading program for the F111s; yet the Government will not buy any GBU15 precision-guided weapons so that we can exploit this capability. The defence industry is an essential part of Australia's defence capability and, as such, I totally reject the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I wish to summarise and to refer to some of the points that have been made during the debate. I remind Senator Schacht that in many ways he completely contradicted his own argument. Ideology goes completely out the window when the dollars count more. The criticism of Sweden that has been proffered by both me and Senator Dunn proves the point that government restrictions count for little when there are dollars to be made. The only argument advanced by the Opposition and the Government is that if there are dollars in it, it is okay to be involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Schacht said that it was a gross exaggeration for me to use the wording that I did in part of the motion, that people in the Third World would die as a result of Australia's arms exports. That is no exaggeration and the Senate needs to be reminded of that. I have seen the results of Australia's training of the military in the Philippines. The military constabulary, trained here, uses its skills to suppress the rights of the Filipino people unto death. It is no exaggeration whatsoever to say that. I have dozens of documented cases of that being so. One can claim that that is the case not only in the Philippines but also in Indonesia, whose defence forces suppress their own people, Singapore and Thailand. The very countries that Australia wants to sell to are the ones that suppress human rights. I noticed that Senator Schacht was very quiet on that. He is concerned about these issues but, when this matter comes up, he has to support the Government and he conveniently forgets that the people on the receiving end of defence export industries sometimes suffer unto death. That is no exaggeration whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Newman, unfortunately, could only make a personal attack. She had no arguments to advance an Opposition point of view except to say that the Opposition wants more government assistance to Australian defence exporters. I will not retaliate in Senator Newman's vein as I think it degrades the whole argument and the debate in this place to make such personal attacks. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator McLean pointed out so aptly, the Government and the Opposition are becoming increasingly similar to each other on many issues, including this one. They both want to push further militarisation in order to make dollars. It is no wonder the electorate is so disillusioned with both major parties. We see evidence of that increasingly in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McMullan started off with another personal attack. I could do without them, but I do not get particularly upset. It is just a waste of the Senate's time. We should be debating the issues and not personalities. I believe that we will be allowing defence exports-in contradiction to what Senator McMullan said-to those countries which have bad human rights records, as I have pointed out. As I have mentioned, the mission went to Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Singapore. Those are the very countries to which we constantly make submissions on human rights cases. That reflects the absolute contradiction in the Government's position and the absolute hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Dunn pointed out very ably that we would not be a new player in the international arms club; rather, we would be increasing the stakes. Unfortunately, we have been part of it for a very long time. Perhaps I should have been clearer by saying that the report of the Cooksey Review of Australia's Defence Cooperation Programs and Policy on Export of Defence Equipment, on which this whole issue is based, recommended a doubling of Australia's arms exports. We have been in it for quite a long time, to the mutual regret of both Senator Dunn and me. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon made a further personal attack which I will not bother to refute. There was a very patronising put down of what he called the peace movement and he included the Australian Council for Overseas Aid as an extremist group. It will be interested indeed to hear that. The council reflects the views of hundreds of thousands of Australians who want to share the world's resources in order to build a more peaceful international climate.</PARA>
<PARA> Senators Newman and MacGibbon made much of the use of the word `guidelines' in my motion. I was referring to the key defence export policy changes which Senator Schacht read into the debate. Both honourable senators missed hearing me say during the debate that detailed guidelines were not available. </PARA>
<PARA> The disarmament development link probably has not been absorbed or understood by the Opposition, but I thought it had been understood by the Government. Some of its members have understood the utter hypocrisy of pushing arms sales. For example, John Langmore, the member for Fraser, wrote to the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) and said that he was disappointed and very sad that a Labor government had decided to build a larger stall in the world's arms bazaar. He is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> If morality has any place in foreign policy then this is a doubtful thing to be doing . . . </PARA>
<PARA> There could be a world-wide reduction in arms and yet we will be trying to get countries which can least afford it to buy Australian-made weapons. </PARA>
<PARA>I wonder how many Government members and senators will have the guts to stand up for their own principles and what ought to be the principles of their Party in this matter. It must be very embarrassing for good and principled people in the Australian Labor Party to witness the hypocrisy of our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on the world stage while at home his Defence Minister-the benign, affable-looking Mr Beazley-is getting Australia further and further into the horrible business of flogging weapons overseas as fast as possible. We do not have to go down that path. It is morally indefensible under any circumstances to try to trade our way out of our deficit by flogging military equipment. Thankfully, there is no guarantee that it will be as economically viable as the Government and the Opposition seem to think. I commend the motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The annual report of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority 1987-1988 gives us the opportunity to raise briefly a couple of matters which have been of concern both to the Marine Park Authority and to people concerned with the status and preservation of the Great Barrier Reef. The Opposition congratulates members of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority for the excellent work the Authority does. The members of the Authority-the Chairman, Mr Graeme Kelleher, Sir Sydney Schubert and Dr Joe Baker-are all distinguished leaders in their field. The Australian community is fortunate to have them as members of the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> As you would know, Mr Deputy President, there has been some debate during this year about the problems of the crown of thorns starfish. Some hysterical and untrue claims have been made by a large number of people in this regard and, indeed, by some television programs, at least one of which I thought was remarkably disingenuous and, frankly quite dishonest. The television program 60 Minutes substantially misrepresented the extent of crown of thorns infestation and substantially understated the work which was being done towards its control. </PARA>
<PARA> There are four sections of the reef: the far northern section, the Cairns section, the central section and the Mackay-Capricorn section. The proportion of the reef affected by the crown of thorns starfish is as follows: the far northern area, approximately 4.2 per cent; the Cairns area, 58.2 per cent; the central area, 34.8 per cent; and the Mackay-Capricorn area, 13.5 per cent. I believe that the Authority is doing all that it can at the moment to undertake control programs and to minimise damage by the crown of thorns infestation. The ill-chosen comments in a number of journals, television and other media reports have not portrayed a proper understanding either of the cause of the infestation-that is, the actual nature of the crown of thorns infestation-or of what is being done to combat it. </PARA>
<PARA> I was pleased to hear about the recently announced decision by the Federal and Queensland Governments to impose a two-year ban on floating hotel developments on the Great Barrier Reef. Further work will be done to assess the impact of the existing hotel and similar developments on the reef. It is important that that moratorium be imposed while that assessment is under way. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to know whether the Authority, under pressure from the Government, the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) and the Department of Finance, in terms of cost recovery policies, will move to a user pays principle for tourist operators on the reef. This matter will have to be dealt with very carefully. As the report says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the commitment of users of the Marine Park to its protection may be undermined if fees are introduced, or applied, in a way that appears unreasonable or unfair. Resolution of these issues may well be the most important and difficult task for the Authority in the coming years. </PARA>
<PARA>I certainly agree with that. I am sure that the tourist operators have made representations to both sides of the Parliament about the imposition of user-pays fees on people who visit the reef. Those fees would be passed on to the travellers and tourists. I think it would be a great shame if the commitment to the preservation of the reef, which I know is shared by virtually all Australians, were undermined by an attempt to commercialise visits to the reef in a way which might cause some disharmony and which, as the report points out, might undermine the commitment of users of the marine park to its protection. This is an area that we will watch with some degree of interest, raising it in the appropriate forums, both in the Estimates committees and in debates in the Senate. In the meantime, however, I conclude by taking this opportunity to pay tribute once again to the work which the Marine Park Authority is doing and to indicate my support for it. </PARA>

On 31 August 1983, while announcing that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park would be extended to cover 80 per cent of the reef region, the then Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, Mr Cohen, said it was Government policy that the marine park should extend to the western boundary of the region on the Queensland mainland coast where that was necessary to protect areas of ecological significance. However, when the final two stages of the marine park were proclaimed, on 30 October 1983, some 26 inshore areas were excluded by the marine park boundary being established five kilometres off shore. The Federal Government said that that would alleviate unnecessary restrictions on local authorities and would involve less administrative work but, in fact, the 26 exclusion zones reflected the Queensland Government's interests in potentially developing these areas for port sites or as tourist resorts and its unwillingness to have the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) exert any direct control over such activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That took place quite a while back. What is happening now? At this moment $1 billion worth of development proposals are under consideration in areas of the Great Barrier Reef which have World Heritage status but which are not listed under the legislation. Why are they not listed? It is because the Federal Government is gutless. It does not want to tangle with the rip-off artists of Queensland. The projects under way are massive. One of them is a $10m re-development of the Great Keppel Island resort which is owned by Australian Airlines. The Queensland Cabinet recently approved plans at the existing resort on Lindeman Island in the Whitsundays to develop a golf course on 60 hectares of national park. Only in Queensland would that happen. On Wild Duck Island naturalists fear that a $125m resort to be built soon could lead to the destruction of one of the world's largest nesting colonies of the endangered flat back turtle. A $1m hotel and resort complex planned by Interwest Ltd on Magnetic Island off Townsville has run into a storm of local protest. But what are the local people to do? We know that in Queensland local protests often end in arrest and very little else. Earthworks have started on Dent Island for a golf course to service the adjacent Hamilton Island resort. Other World Heritage listed islands on which resorts or extensions are proposed include Keswick, Long, Hummock Hill, Daydream and St Bees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the annual report of which we are discussing, has no jurisdiction over this land above the low water mark. Even when developments affect the marine environment, GBRMPA's powers are limited. They do not need to be, but they are. Hamilton Island continues to be a sore on the Great Barrier Reef. It continues to discharge raw sewage into the sea, even though the construction of a treatment plant has been a condition of licence issued by the Water Quality Council since 1985. Although the resort was directed to comply with the condition last May, the plant has still not been completed. </PARA>
<PARA> So what are we to do? We should ask our Government to do something to save this national treasure. So far it has been reluctant to lock horns with the Queensland Government for reasons that I simply do not understand. I think the Federal Government has the power-it certainly has the constitutional power, as has been shown in the Franklin Dam case-to protect this area, but it simply does not want to do it. I think it is time that the Hawke Government developed enough guts to save what is basically a priceless asset for the rest of the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hate to disagree with my colleague Senator Sanders in relation to Queensland being the only State in which developments such as golf courses can occur in national parks. You would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, that in South Australia the South Australian Government at this very time is attempting to establish an 18-hole golf course in the Flinders Ranges National Park at Wilpena Pound and is considering other developments on Kangaroo Island. I am afraid that in this respect we have a rather poor government in South Australia at present. What both previous speakers have said indicates the conflict which arises between the national park values and the problems of tourism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority itself draws attention to the substantial additions which have occurred to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park recently, with the Mackay-Capricorn section extending a further 66 per cent to the area of the park. The report also draws attention to the main goal of the Marine Park Authority, which is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the protection, wise use, understanding and enjoyment of the Great Barrier Reef in perpetuity through the development and care of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. </PARA>
<PARA>I draw attention to the term `in perpetuity' because it seems to me that what we are seeing, and the matters to which Senator Sanders has drawn attention, are threatening that protection in perpetuity. I also draw attention to the conflict between the idea of development and care on the one hand and protection in perpetuity on the other. </PARA>
<PARA> The Marine Park Authority has subsidiary roles to minimise regulation of and interference in human activities consistent with meeting the main goal and other aims of the Authority and to provide for economic development. Yet we find repeatedly that those aims-the economic development and the reduction of regulatory measures on the use of the reef-are in direct conflict with the aim of protecting the reef in perpetuity. Indeed, early in the report the precarious balance between development on the one hand and protection of the environment on the other is drawn to our attention. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Whenever there is an event in the marine park that adversely affects the environment there are demands that regulations should be tightened. At the same time other sectors of the population demand deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA>The report also draws attention to the fact that the staff-visitor day ratios have declined very substantially in recent years from 1 : 5,200 in 1980-81 to 1 : 44,000 in 1987-88. Increasingly there are fewer staff to supervise adequately the problems of damage to the park. The report also draws attention to the problems which might be overcome by revenue raising in the marine park. While in this instance I would certainly encourage the charging of commercial operators on the Great Barrier Reef, I would hope that we would not get to a situation in which ordinary visitors to the reef were charged to visit in a private capacity one of the great wonders of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to commercial developments on the reef, there is an interesting account in the report dealing with the Fantasy Island development which was a concrete, doughnut shaped pontoon designed as a day trip reef destination by Reeflink Pty Ltd, owned by Mr Doug Tarca. It was intended to replace a string of steel pontoons. The report states that on 30 March 1988, a week after being put into operation, Fantasy Island sank and subsequently parts of the structure broke up. Mr Tarca has been asked to remove the wreckage at no cost to the Commonwealth. I point out that unless a charge is made before these structures are put in place and the money is paid into a fund, the Commonwealth and the Queensland Government jointly with the Marine Park Authority could find themselves in a situation where they would have to clean up the damage resulting from this sort of development. That is something to which attention needs to be given. The report also draws attention to a number of proposals under consideration-a floating hotel at Fitzroy Reef, a marina at Nelly Bay, Magnetic Island, a pontoon at Masthead Island Reef, and a marina at Shute Harbour-and clearly indicates that the reef is under considerable commercial exploitation pressure. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The annual report of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service is an interesting one this year, bearing on its cover, both front and back, a picture of a giant panda, which I suppose simply draws attention to the fact that these days one can sell almost anything provided that it has a panda on it. It is a serious attempt, however, by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service to draw attention to the problems of the protection of endangered species. As honourable senators will know, during 1988 two giant pandas were on display in Australia. They created a great deal of what was commercially referred to as `pandamonium' around the place, and attracted huge numbers of people to see these animals. The disappointing thing in some respects is that it is a great deal easier for Australians to get agitated about the fate of somebody else's endangered species than it is for them to get agitated about the fate of endangered species within Australia. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On this occasion I am not referring to the Australian Democrats. The general problem of the very large number of animals in Australia, particularly the small marsupials, is not well recognised. It is a pity that there is not more active involvement of many of the organisations which are happy to promote events such as the panda visit to make more of the fact that we are losing large numbers of significant Australian species in all areas of the continent and that not enough is being done about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point I wish to make on the problem of endangered species is that, although many people believe in protecting endangered species, they have no difficulty when they are overseas in buying pieces of ivory, for example, and bringing them into the country. They do not realise the contribution that they are making to the elimination of another of the great species of the world, the elephant, by simply trading in and purchasing ivory, despite the fact that legislation prohibits the importation into Australia, as indeed it should, of products derived from endangered species. One sees from page 35 of the report that the largest single item of goods seized as being illegally imported into this country related to elephant products. </PARA>
<PARA> The report covers a huge variety of issues, all of which are comprehended in the work of the Australian Parks and Wildlife Service, a service which I believe has been unnecessarily starved of funds by this Government and which, with the limited funds available to it, does a most outstanding job. Under the heading `Australian Alps National Park Memorandum of Understanding', the report says in part:</PARA>
<PARA> On 4 July 1986, four Ministers of the Commonwealth, Victoria and New South Wales responsible for nature conservation signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the Co-operative Management of the Alps Parks. </PARA>
<PARA>The State of New South Wales has, under the leadership of Tim Moore, the Minister for Environment in that State, proposed an examination for possible World Heritage listing of the Alpine Parks region of New South Wales. I draw attention to this item because it indicates the extent to which cooperative endeavour between the Commonwealth and the States can lead to significant areas of cooperation in wildlife management and protection of the environment, the creation of national parks, the preservation of the wilderness, and nomination for World Heritage areas, without all these matters becoming matters of permanent confrontation. That is one of the interesting things in this excellent report. I commend it to honourable senators as a document that contains a wealth of information. It is a great tribute to the people who work in the Parks and Wildlife Service. I wish to indicate the Opposition's support for the Service and for its work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been interested to read the annual report of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service 1987-88 because of the Australian Democrats' commitment to the conservation of natural environment and our concern for endangered species. Like Senator Puplick, I was very interested to see the section on endangered species on page 3 of the report, where we read:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Considerable progress was made this year towards the implementation of an Endangered Species Program comprising an Endangered Species Advisory Committee and an Endangered Species Unit. </PARA>
<PARA>Last month in Adelaide I had the good fortune to meet a dedicated expert in this field, Dr John Walmsley of the Warrawong sanctuary, a private wildlife park which I believe to be one of the most important and successful projects of this kind in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Walmsley has collected and bred a substantial population of Australian small native animals which are not only endangered in their natural habitat but some of which are generally believed to be extinct. If honourable senators, including Senator Puplick, and members of the public want to see what sort of wildlife abounded on this continent just 200 years ago, before European habitation, they can see a rare selection of these animals at the Warrawong sanctuary. Besides the familiar kangaroos and wallabies, some of these animals are: the pademelons, small browsers which feed on native grasses and underbrush and, therefore, in times past saved the bush from big fires; and bettongs, which are small wallabies, the former staple diet of the Aborigines rather than the larger kangaroos. Dr Walmsley has about 250 bettongs in his sanctuary, about half the population of the animals left in Australia. There are potoroos, a small primitive member of the kangaroo family. There are also bandicoots, possums and quolls. Quolls are native cats which Dr Walmsley has there to keep the population down to size in a natural way. The Tamar wallaby and the redneck wallaby are other rare species to be found at the Warrawong sanctuary. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Walmsley told me of his high regard for the work of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, which has assisted him in introducing a small colony of platypuses to a specially made blackwater lake at the sanctuary. Platypuses have a very short life in zoo captivity, but at Warrawong they have survived and adjusted for just over a year, which I believe is something of a triumph. It is also interesting that Dr Walmsley has designed a retaining wire fence which keeps out foxes and feral cats. As everyone knows, we have such a small number of native animals left in Australia because of the feral animals which have been introduced since we have been here. This fence is easy to erect, is very economical compared to other types of fences and, I am sure, would be of interest to the proposed advisory committee on endangered species. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot praise the sanctuary highly enough. It has won all sorts of prizes and awards. It has won a tree care award, tourism awards, heritage and culture awards, an award from the Small Business Corporation of South Australia, and many others. People can explore the sanctuary in the day time. They can also go there at night to see the small animals coming out to feed in their natural environment. They can also see rare and unusual plants and shrubs which are no longer easily seen in our urban areas. We are concerned about endangered species in other countries, but first and foremost we must look after our endangered species in this country. I believe that sanctuaries such as that run by Dr Walmsley can fill that function very well indeed. I hope that other States also will follow suit with sanctuaries of this kind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak briefly on the annual report of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. I am a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, which has been looking at annual reports and commenting on their worth. This particular report is an exceptionally good report because it covers the wide range of services that the National Parks and Wildlife Service provides. That body's budget is not insignificant. Something like $12m is spent all over Australia on various national parks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer, in particular, to that part of the report which contains reference to the Tasmanian World Heritage area, especially the Cradle Mountain Lake St Clair National Park Management Plan that is being formulated with cooperation between the Commonwealth and State Governments. There is reference in the report to that plan and it is very interesting to note that the State Government, the Gray Government, which is often criticised for its approach to the environment, is actively engaged with the Commonwealth Government in doing something very positive and something that is very good for our State. It is easy to see what can be achieved when the political point scoring is left out of a situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the management plan will be tabled in State Parliament in the very near future. The main thrust of the report is to make recommendations on the future use of the park, wilderness retention and the provision of recreation areas. One highlight is that the development will be limited to the park boundary only, which will allow something like 133,000 hectares to be set aside purely for wilderness purposes. In that park, the important wilderness areas will be protected, but recreational day walk tracks will also be provided, and the very famous overland track to Lake St Clair will be retained. </PARA>
<PARA> The State and Federal governments are jointly funding a new visitors centre which will be completed in November this year. That will provide a wonderful entrance to this world-acclaimed national park. Tourists visiting the park and students of our local flora and fauna will be able to study what is being preserved in the park. I refer to the rainforest, glaciation and the unique botany of the alpine and subalpine areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Another part of the report refers to the management plan of the World Heritage area which is being made with the cooperation of the Commonwealth and the State Governments. As I said earlier, when political point scoring is left out of it, things can be achieved. I compliment the Gray Government for its record on the environment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wanted to make some comment on the fifteenth report of the Committee of Privileges, but I have come direct from a meeting and do not have a copy with me. I will make some preliminary remarks while waiting for a copy. The report arises from a matter which was brought forward by Senator MacGibbon, who raised as a matter of privilege the matter of certain answers which had been given by an officer of the Department of Defence to the Estimates Committee of which he was part. The report incorporates as an attachment the Hansard of that Estimates Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is quite clear that a number of senators were disturbed by the nature of the answers which were being given by that witness from the Defence Department. Even a casual reading of the Hansard at the Estimates Committee shows that the answers were, on their face, quite unsatisfactory. As a result, the matter was sent off by the Senate after we had gone through the usual procedures, the matter having been considered by the President in the normal way. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the report does not find that there was a breach of privilege, it is important to note the very careful way in which the Committee addressed the unsatisfactory answers which had been given. I do not believe that any of the public servants who appear before the Estimates Committees should be under any illusions about the concern there is within the Senate about the importance of having accurate, honest and straightforward responses to the questions which are put. The report ought to be almost compulsory reading for those many public servants who are called upon to appear before the Estimates Committees. I now have the report and thank the attendant for having chased it up for me. </PARA>
<PARA> The report notes comments which were made by Dr McIntosh in his submission to the Privileges Committee of 2 February. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>While the discussions of the project were of a partial nature so as not to preempt Ministers and were clearly unsatisfactory to Senators, I do not believe that false or misleading evidence was given by what I said (as opposed to the paraphrasing by others of what I said) as to the facts or status of the project. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senators were misled, it was certainly not deliberate on my part and I can only apologise for any deficiencies in the phrasing of my responses, which did not make the position, as outlined in this submission, sufficiently clear. </PARA>
<PARA>When one looks at the Committee's conclusion, it having heard the evidence, looked at the transcript and so on, it is important to note that the Committee found:</PARA>
<PARA>It would have been helpful to the Senators concerned if the officer had been more forthcoming . . . </PARA>
<PARA>But the Committee accepted the explanation and apology contained in the submission. The Committee went on to make observations which, as I say, ought to be drawn to the attention of all public servants appearing before Estimates committees. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The submissions of Dr McIntosh and Major General Francis have presented the factual background at the time of the Estimates hearings and technically the answers that were given to the Committee were correct. </PARA>
<PARA>In paragraph 7 the Committee went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> We appreciate the problem faced by public servants in the position of Dr McIntosh at the time of the hearings, but it is fair comment that he was an experienced public servant and quite familiar with dealing with Ministers and Members of Parliament. He should have been able to overcome the problem without leaving the Senators in the state of dissatisfaction which was created by his unhelpful approach. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 8 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Although public servants should not be pre-empting the decisions of Ministers or disclosing advice given to them, there is no reason why information should not be volunteered when it is quite clear that Senators are seeking more information than has been made available or if they seem confused by such information. In this case there had been news reports which had given Senators some inaccurate information about the situation with Project Parakeet. Senators may also have been given inaccurate information from other sources. </PARA>
<PARA>Penultimately, paragraph 9 states:</PARA>
<PARA> If Dr McIntosh had been as helpful to the Senate Estimates Committee as he has been to the Privileges Committee this whole exercise would have been avoided. </PARA>
<PARA>While the Committee concluded that `there was no intention to give any false or misleading evidence to a Senate Estimates Committee in relation to the Department of Defence project' it follows that there was no contempt. However, I want to say that it is quite clear, on a reading of that report and on a reading of the Senate Hansard, that Dr McIntosh's evidence was clearly unsatisfactory and was not given in a way which was designed to meet the objective of the Estimates Committee, which is to place before the people of Australia the information which their duly elected representatives believe is properly required. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fundamental role of the Parliament to examine and to disclose matters which are the public's property, because the public, after all, is paying for all this. The programs administered by public servants are public property because they are carried out on behalf of the people of Australia and are paid for by the people of Australia. In conversations I have had with honourable senators who have been on Estimates committees over a long period-and I have relatively limited experience of Estimates committees compared with many honourable senators in this place-it is clear that this sort of prevarication and inadequate response is not unique. I hope that this reference to the Privileges Committee and the cautions which are contained in that Committee's report, will ensure that we do not face the sort of obfuscation that I believe we faced in the particular Estimates Committee consideration which went before the Privileges Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that the record, as it has finally been produced by the Committee of Privileges, shows a situation that is in any way satisfactory to the Senate. More importantly, I do not believe that it is satisfactory to the people of Australia. I have little doubt that if honourable senators find there is similar obfuscation by public servants and Ministers in future, they will object to it and take appropriate action to ensure that that situation does not continue. I do not think anyone else wishes to speak on the report now so I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training on education for active citizenship must be one of the least controversial Senate committee reports to come before the Senate. There is no minority report. In fact, it is a report on which there was unanimous agreement. However, even though it is non-controversial, I believe it must be one of the most important committee reports to come before the Senate in this parliamentary term.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee examined the level of involvement of the community, particularly among young people. It also received submissions from older immigrants who were concerned about their level of knowledge and understanding of the system of government. They were interested in finding out how they could be involved in community participation. The Committee became very concerned, as it went through the submissions and as it heard evidence from various groups-school children, youth organisations, individuals in the community, teachers, people in tertiary education-about the lack of knowledge and understanding as well as the ignorance, apathy and sense of powerlessness of many of these people. </PARA>
<PARA> It is well for us to note that a survey undertaken in 1987 showed that only 54 per cent of Australians knew that Australia had a Constitution. In the 18-24 age-group, only about 30 per cent of Australians were aware of the Constitution's existence. As some commentators noted-and the report points this out-following the 1988 referendum, there was a certain incongruity in proposing amendments to the Australian Constitution when about half of the population does not even know that it exists. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of surveys were presented to us-some undertaken by school children themselves amongst their own peers; others by students entering tertiary institutions. These surveys painted a similar picture. One example was a study commissioned by the Australian Electoral Commission shortly after the December 1984 Federal election. When responding to the question, `Federal Parliament is made up of two Houses. To the best of your knowledge what are their names?', 64 per cent of those surveyed named the House of Representatives and 60 per cent named the Senate. About one in five were unable to name either of the Houses of the Federal Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know that being able to name the Houses of Parliament is not necessarily indicative of people's understanding of the functions, but one would imagine that, if one did not know the names, one would be even less likely to understand the functions. The evidence concerning levels of knowledge of State government also appeared to be scarce. A 1987 study by the Armidale College of Advanced Education of teacher education students at that institution found that only three of the 154 students surveyed could name both of the New South Wales Houses of Parliament; only four more could name one House. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee found that people's knowledge and understanding of local government was about the same-abysmal. The Committee was concerned, not only with people's understanding of the structure and function of the political system, but also how they could participate in decision-making at a local, State and Federal level. </PARA>
<PARA> We were privileged that the first group to appear before the Committee in this Parliament was a group of students. I found it interesting that the young people presented submissions which were outstanding, exciting, interesting and challenging. However, I could say the same for the presentations of some of my peers. It was interesting to note that the students, in fact, put their finger on one of the problems that was highlighted throughout our inquiry. At page 36 the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Students seem conscious that teaching of this kind has a lot to do with inadequate training. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee was referring here to the teaching of politics in schools, and the teaching of politics in general. One student from Hollywood High said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it comes back to the way that teachers are trained. Some teachers are not trained well enough to give practical examples or bring out issues that are happening at the moment. They can just teach from text books and that is all. </PARA>
<PARA>That comment interested me. Some of the text books which are produced and used in high schools are, in fact, very bookish. I asked a number of people from colleges of advanced education (CAEs) whether they used primary sources. I was a little stunned to find that very few of these people were able to answer in the affirmative. The very informative and important articles that are produced by people such as the Clerks of the Senate, or staff of our committees, are unread by the people who actually teach. Some of those papers tell us about the characters in the Senate. One written by Peter O'Keefe tells us about Ian Wood and his commitment to the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances over a period of 23 years, having been Chairman of that Committee. It puts flesh on the bones of the information that these tertiary educators would do well to read. It behoves those who are politicians to make sure that that material is available and referred to, that we speak of it in schools, to tertiary students and to tertiary educators and that we encourage the staff of the Parliament to ensure that it appears in educators' journals and that reference is made to it so that that very important material is not lost to a group that ought to be reading it. </PARA>
<PARA> We were also heartened to see the work that was being done by a number of youth groups such as the Young Men's Christian Association, the Girl Guides and the Girls Brigade. These groups were presenting programs and involving young people in decision making. Organisations which some may see as fairly conservative are actually giving young people a greater opportunity to participate and to learn about democracy, decision making, and being involved in their own destiny, and are encouraging them to understand and to know about the political system through their own programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The report goes on to talk about the importance of citizenship. Especially in this year of citizenship, I believe that we should be taking note of the Committee's recommendations. The Committee emphasised in the report that great significance is placed on immigrants taking out citizenship but little importance is placed on attaining the status of an enrolled voter in Australia. The Committee asked that more emphasis be given to placing importance on new enrollees, so that they see enrolment as a privilege and are informed about the process through material that could be sent out to them. The Committee did not want to specify but left the matter open, possibly for the Australian Electoral Commission to develop ways of making people feel that becoming a voter was a very important aspect of playing a role in Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA> The report serves as a reminder that voting is the responsibility of everybody, including politicians. I hope that in this situation we can be more parliamentarians than politicians. It is our role to tell the community about the structure and function of Parliament, especially Federal Parliament. It is the parliamentarians' role at State and Federal level and the responsibility of local councils and the staff of government bodies at all levels to inform the community. It is a role that the staff of the Parliament have played very well. Educators, youth organisations and the media should be encouraged. When the Regulations and Ordinances Committee wins a battle we do not see the media shouting from the rooftop, `Another blow for freedom'. This report serves as a warning to Australians as to the fragility of our democracy and the measures we can take to ensure its continuity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have pleasure in supporting the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training and the recommendations included therein. In so doing, I want to make a few points. It is not surprising, but I think it is a pity, that the media attention throughout the progress of this report-and it has gone on now for some time-has focused on the negative aspects of the report. As Senator Patterson has already pointed out, there are some good examples in the report of research indicating a worrying level of ignorance on the part of students, teachers and the community at large about the political process in general, not simply about the Parliament. While that is of concern, I think we ought now to concentrate more on the positives, which can take two forms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some positive things are already happening. Senator Patterson has already drawn attention to the very positive contribution that was made by young people in appearing before the Committee. Two schools in particular sent delegations along, having put in written submissions-Trinity Senior High School in Wagga Wagga and Hollywood Senior High School in Perth. If I may be parochial, I would like to praise the very articulate team of advocates from Hollywood High School: Adam Bandt, Amanda Bower, Mitchell Henville, Bronwyn Morris, Lisa Roberts, Natalie Silver and Anna Takac and their very dedicated and creative teacher, Chris Hill. They were doing promising things that showed that achievements can be made. They were not typical children in the sense that they had chosen to do political studies, and I guess they were more than averagely articulate, but they were a very good example of what can be achieved if we really try. They had, in my view, a very good understanding of the processes. </PARA>
<PARA> We also need to concentrate on the recommendations of the report, which are very moderate and non-costly-as Senator Peter Walsh will be very pleased to know-and give some direction to the sorts of things that we learned. I am appalled at the view expressed by an article in the Sydney Morning Herald quoted on page 7 of the report. It was written by an academic. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Sydney Morning Herald published an article entitled `Political ignorance is bliss' which questioned the need for any investigation of the topic . . . the article argued that, having perceived the gap between democratic theory and political practice, Australians had rightly chosen to respond with `a combination of ignorance, apathy and cynicism'. Political ignorance, it was claimed, is a `valuable part of our national heritage'. </PARA>
<PARA>That is all very funny and cynical. It is dead easy for people to express that point of view and I guess they will get a laugh from it, but the Committee-I think rightly-rejected it out of hand. It rejected it not only because of its general view that an informed and aware society-an intellectual, alert and flexible society-is infinitely better than a society that is based on ignorance and intellectual rigidity, but also for a number of other, much more practical reasons. In that generalised sense of a society being better if it is informed, I think we have seen some good examples of what an uninformed, ignorant, inflexible society can do. The Salman Rushdie affair in Iran is a good example of what can happen when ignorance rises to the level of almost being an institution. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to make a political point here, but the level at which the recent referendum questions were argued was abysmal. The example was set here, but it was developed further in the community. I was, frankly, appalled by some of the questions that were seriously put to me to answer. Senator Patterson has already drawn attention to the fact that the Committee report refers to a commentator who noted in regard to the 1988 referendum that there was a certain incongruity in proposing amendments to the Australian Constitution when about half the population did not even know it existed. The same ignorance demonstrated in Iran can be shown in a society such as ours, even though it might not go as far as the Iranians have recently gone. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the ignorance in any community which leads to support of extremist groups. For example, in this country, the League of Rights was right behind much of the opposition to the referendum questions and we have paranoid malcontents such as the Peter Sawyer group. I believe that ignorance is the seedbed of extremism. We need to break down that cycle of ignorance which is so obviously and so patently present, according to the research that we have detailed in the report, among students and, unfortunately teachers and academics as well as the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA> Having looked at that broad area of whether ignorance is bliss or whether an informed society is better than an ignorant and sterile one, for those who want a more instrumental and economic approach there is also a good justification for making sure that our students and our populace at large are politically aware and articulate. In many vocational areas a knowledge of the political process is now considered essential. In the Public Service, for example, and increasingly in commerce, the media, the welfare sector and industry, a knowledge of the political process is considered to be a fundamental part of one's training. To be a decent manager nowadays is simply not good enough. One should have some idea about what goes on in the formulation of public policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I think there are lessons here for the Parliament. They are not spelt out clearly in the report, but I think they are implicit in it. I think there are lessons, particularly for those conservative minds within the parliamentary parties-and I mean all parties here-and within the parliamentary bureaucracy who oppose change for the sake of opposing change. It became clear when we talked not only to young people but to many of the people who appeared before us that the Parliament is seen as an archaic and out of touch institution. How can observers of parliament have any respect for the institution when they see it as so far removed from their everyday reality? How can visitors to this Parliament really understand what goes on when they see a person like me standing up and speaking to a handful of people, most of whom are half asleep-with no disrespect to anybody-or at least with glazed eyes, while the rest of the Parliament is absent, supposedly listening in, although I bet that not too many members are? How can people really understand that process? It is a silly, archaic process and it needs to be looked at. I know that currently there are attempts to do that. We need to make sure we throw out some of our old-fashioned ideas and really take up the challenge of modernising this Parliament to make it a little more relevant to the society in which we live. Not only is it a question of the behaviour in Parliament-and I think the events in the other House today give a good example of where that can be a big negative in influencing the views of the public towards this institution-but it is also a question of the anachronistic processes which people simply cannot relate to. That is one small aspect of a very broad problem over which we, as parliamentarians, have some direct control and ought to be able to do something about. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the writing of the report and the hearings were an enjoyable process, particularly, as Senator Patterson has already pointed out, with the active involvement of so many young people, which made it a lot more fun than the average public hearing. It is a very good example also of a productive use of a Senate committee, not only because we managed to come up with a consensus report and no minority report, but also because we took on an achievable task and were able to draw from submissions and public hearings the research necessary to develop a body of knowledge on an issue, and to come up with some realistic and sensible recommendations within the framework of our current constraints. This Committee did not enter into any political witch-hunt, as many Senate committees do, or try to reinvent the wheel. We undertook a small achievable task and did it well. I would like to thank the secretary, Derek Allan, and his staff and the other members of the Committee for their assistance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support my fellow members on the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training and to commend to the Senate the report entitled Education for Active Citizenship in Australian Schools and Youth Organisations and its recommendations. I am proud to have been associated with the preparation of this report. It has been a very stimulating experience. I draw this report to the attention of honourable senators. It is literally one of hundreds of documents that pass across our desks in a session, but I urge honourable senators to pluck this one out and to give it very serious and deliberate consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am proud to have placed this matter of active citizenship before the Committee. With the support of Senator Patterson, we urged the Committee to address the question of active citizenship. Probably the most satisfying aspects of having been associated with this report were the speed with which the Committee identified with what we were on about; the enthusiasm with which it was approached; the enthusiasm with which it was received by the community at large; the quality of submissions; and the very positive response to what was considered by the community as being an urgent need. </PARA>
<PARA> I was prompted to place the question of active citizenship before the Committee as a result of an experience I had working under the Australian Assistance Plan. Honourable senators may recall that that fine plan was introduced by the Whitlam Government, but unfortunately terminated only three years after it began. Essentially, the Australian Assistance Plan was a plan about people power which acknowledged the fact that communities have a great capacity to resolve their own difficulties, to marshal their own resources, to focus their attention on their own needs, to resolve their problems, and to satisfy their own needs. </PARA>
<PARA> I was enormously stimulated by that experience under the Australian Assistance Plan, but one of the things that became obvious to me in working in communities in this sort of process was that some communities are utterly powerless to resolve their own differences while other communities are quite powerful. There is a disproportionate distribution of these abilities within the community. In fact, some communities are quite frustrated; they do not know how to get their hands on resources and they do not know how to approach their problems. This disproportionate distribution of power, knowledge, skills, insight and commitment detracts from the quality of our democracy and, indeed, is an inherent limitation to the quality of democracy as it exists in Australia today. I think this was reinforced by the evidence that was brought before the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, active citizenship is more than just knowing about government. It is something one feels in one's heart; it is something one feels in one's gut; it is a confidence that one is able to affect what happens in one's daily life because of the structures within which one works. If one does not have that positive attitude towards those structures and if one does not feel that commitment, one will not be an active citizen. As a result, communities will be powerless, impotent, disillusioned and apathetic. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Vulnerable, poor and everything else goes with these things in an affluent society such as ours. So active citizenship is something which one feels in one's heart and one knows to be one's own potency. Sadly, the evidence that came to us through this Committee was that young Australians, and indeed mature Australians, today do not feel those things. That lack of feeling, that impotence and that apathy greatly detract from the quality of our democracy. The strongest message to come through in this report and in the submissions that were made to the Committee is that this strikes at the very heart and the quality of our democracy and that, if we neglect it, we do so at our own peril. The evidence that came to us was that it is now neglected, and that neglect reflects our lack of responsibility towards the great Australian democratic processes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We probably know more than most that the democratic and parliamentary process is imperfect. We also know that it can be improved, and we are looking at it from the point of view of those who have perception, knowledge and power. What must it look like from the point of view of those who do not have knowledge, perception and power? This report says to the Government that the quality of our democracy is less than it should be. It says quite clearly that we must address this as a matter of urgency, and it makes what we believe to be significant, achievable and realistic recommendations to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> All of us as members of the Committee and certainly all of those who made submissions and provided evidence to it say to the Australian Government of today, `Please, address the recommendations of this report seriously. Please put in place very soon a national program of active citizenship by which we will dramatically enhance the quality of Australian democracy; by which we will attack the apathy that is out there; by which we will dismantle and counter the ignorance that is out there; by which Australians will begin to feel committed and potent, and stop feeling powerless; and by which we will render the great Australian democracy, of which we are indeed the elected representatives, much more effective in the interests of our community'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is vital that Australians of all ages are better able to understand their rights and privileges as citizens and also the obligations and commitments that active citizenship confers. Education for active citizenship through the Education for Active Citizenship report reveals that there are substantial gaps between theory and practice. There is almost universal agreement for active citizenship to be an educational goal. But unfortunately the strength of that commitment really leaves a lot to be desired. At the head of page 6 of the report we stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the situation revealed in this report amounts to a crisis which Australians cannot afford to ignore. These are indeed very strong words, but they are quite true. </PARA>
<PARA>We found at our public hearings in each of the States and through written submissions that many young Australians do not understand the Australian political system and how they can participate in it. </PARA>
<PARA> Political systems are like artworks. To appreciate them in full, they must be understood. It is in this area of understanding that we are falling down. I believe that any responsible educational system should equip all young people to be good citizens. But are we doing this? In fact, we are not doing it well. It is of concern to me, as it was to all members of the Committee, that the subject that used to be called `civics' is no longer taught in many schools. This has led to better educated young people knowing less about their rights and responsibilities than every before. The media can play a major role in educating people in citizenship. It is something that in the past has been largely neglected. We praise the Commonwealth Parliamentary Education Office and the work done by other parliaments, especially in New South Wales. But these are only peripheral attacks on a major problem. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most sobering experiences for me during our public hearings was listening to articulate and intelligent students who came before us to plead for a more comprehensive education on active citizenship. These students showed by their understanding of our task that they would have greatly benefited from a course in active citizenship. At the first meeting of the Parliament in this building last year, the Governor-General, Sir Ninian Stephen, pointed out that only Britain, Canada, the United States of America and two European nations have a parliamentary democracy with an unbroken history longer than our own 88 years. </PARA>
<PARA> We have developed and refined an effective parliamentary system in each of the States, the Northern Territory, Norfolk Island and, shortly, the Australian Capital Territory. In 1947 the late Sir Winston Churchill spoke in the House of Commons about his views on democracy with this well-known saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government, except all of those forms that have been tried from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not only the students who must be taught. Their teachers are also often found lacking in their ability to teach adequately about active citizenship. Alarming figures were presented to the Committee by the Mitchell College of Advanced Education. In a 1983 survey carried out by the college, only 5 per cent of first year teacher education students could name the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia and only 22 per cent could name the president of their own Students Representative Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, the problem has to be tackled in more than one way. Teacher training institutions have to give active citizenship a much higher priority, as some colleges have already recognised. But active citizenship is not only concerned with understanding the Commonwealth parliamentary system. It should also include an appreciation of the State parliaments and how they work, of local government bodies and of such basic concepts as the independence of the judiciary, the role of the Crown and the idea of executive government. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Committee's members were staggered at the lack of knowledge about civics, there are certainly encouraging signs. An example is the secondment of a teacher to the Parliament of New South Wales, specifically to assist that State Parliament's education program. Further moves in the right direction are illustrated by the excellent Parliamentary Pack and Parliamentary Pack 2 produced by the Parliamentary Education Office of this place. This provides opportunities for young people, especially those in remote parts of Australia, to see videos, play educational games and read well-presented material about their rights and obligations as citizens and a system of government which exists for them and all Australians. I commend all those various people who made contributions from all walks of life-from the schools, voluntary organisations such as the Girl Guides Association of Australia and others-because I thought their contributions and concerns were first rate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training report on education for active citizenship and draw attention to the remarks of both Senator Patterson and Senator McLean. In relation to the recent referendum in which we asked the people of Australia to vote on certain issues, as Senator Patterson has already indicated, a large proportion of the Australian population did not even know that Australia had a constitution, much less know what the content of it was. That really strikes at the very root of our democratic process because surely we must ask ourselves what it means when people vote in a certain way on issues of which quite clearly they have very little understanding. Of course, one can reflect on the recent Western Australian election where Grey Power was able to get one in 16 votes and quite clearly was an organisation with only a name. This again indicates the lack of understanding of many people when they go into a polling booth to exercise that very precious democratic right and elect governments which will determine many aspects of their lives for three or four years into the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Several people have used the word `apathy'. I certainly would not wish to blame the victim. I would not want to argue that what we are seeing here is in any sense apathy. I think that we have a combination of factors, some of which attention is drawn to in this report, namely, that our education in an understanding of the democratic process and how to participate in it and what it means is deficient. At the same time we have in many areas journalists, middle level editors and editors of newspapers who are more interested in titillating their readers than in properly informing them. Senator Beahan drew attention to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald which bears some repetition. An academic writing an article in that paper, which was obviously acceptable to the Sydney Morning Herald, said that there is a gap between democratic theory and political practice and that Australians had rightly chosen to respond with `a combination of ignorance, apathy and cynicism'. The repetition of that sort of remark merely serves to reinforce this attitude which we call apathy but which in fact is something which is quite positively produced in the Australian public by that combination of lack of education and the slick remark which causes people to disrespect the political process. </PARA>
<PARA> The report draws attention to the very grave dangers in which Australia finds itself as a result of these deficiencies. At page 8 of the report we read:</PARA>
<PARA> Some submissions saw dangers in current educational policies which appear to stress narrow labour market requirements and to underestimate the importance of a capacity for critical analysis of social and political issues . . . `we will pay a price, for we will end up with a technologically trained, but politically illiterate, young citizenry' . . . this trend is laying the ground for `the phenomenon of the skilled barbarian-a section of professional or educated society whose attitude towards civic questions or ideas is uninformed or crude to say the least'. </PARA>
<PARA>It is worth pausing there and stressing that we are in grave danger at this time when we have a government which appears to see education as a cost to society and not as a benefit and a government which sees the need to train people narrowly because education is seen as something which contributes principally to the economic benefit and the economic welfare of the country. In these times it is important to stress the other values of education-the values which produce widely literate, informed and critical citizens who can participate in the political process, make informed decisions and translate those decisions in their personal lives into intelligent voting patterns and can then, through that process, influence the government of the country. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also draws attention to the high levels of political ignorance already in the community. It draws attention to that by saying that it is a danger sign. It points to a situation in which accountability is weak-that is, the accountability of the elected parliaments at both Federal and State levels and at the local government level-and in which power may be concentrated in the hands of a few. In other words, it is relatively easy for those who are informed, those who are able to manipulate the political process, to concentrate power to the detriment of the many. The report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>They are a warning that the quality of democracy may be under threat. </PARA>
<PARA>The deficiencies in the educational process are further expanded upon where the report says, quite unequivocally and without any qualifications:</PARA>
<PARA>Many children are reaching the end of their primary schooling without any real opportunity to grasp what is meant by participation in democratic processes or to understand what parts such processes play in the society around them. </PARA>
<PARA>The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Even on a conservative view of the matter, students stand more than an even chance of completing their secondary education without taking any course which genuinely prepares them to be an informed and active participant in the democratic process of Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is worth stressing that there are enormous opportunities at school, particularly at the secondary grades, for students to participate both actively in the community and in their own democratic processes within the school in circumstances which give them a real understanding of democracy at work. For instance, most secondary schools have student representative councils (SRCs). Those councils have officers that stand in a unique position, such as the president or chairman of the school council, the vice-chairman and the secretary. There is an ideal opportunity for electing those members by a process similar to the processes of election which occur in the lower Houses of all the State parliaments. </PARA>
<PARA> Those SRCs also have committees. There is an ideal opportunity for those committees to be elected by processes which, in every respect, are the same as the processes by which we elect the Senate and the upper Houses in several States of Australia. I would commend the adoption of those practices. Given that understanding at the hands-on level, I believe that many students would be able to participate more actively in the community and understand the way in which they can properly exercise their vote to achieve the desirable ends. The report says that the aim should be to make maximum use of whatever opportunities are available within such subjects to focus on the question of participation in society-not just in the national context but right down to the level of the local community. I suggest that that starts right in the school where students are involved in the processes of election and determining, through that election process, how their school will be run. </PARA>
<PARA> The report concludes by drawing attention to the wider dimension of the political process. A quote at page 60 sums up the desirable end goal of this process:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . young people should be encouraged to progress beyond a purely insular view of the world and to become aware of the interdependence of all nations-in short, to see themselves as `global citizens'. </PARA>
<PARA>That leads directly to the principal recommendation of the report that the Commonwealth initiate a national program in education for active citizenship. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

The memorandum of 15 December 1988, which was referred to in my earlier answer, did not notify any change to the Governor-General's style and title but merely confirmed it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 13 December 1988, the Senate referred to the Committee two matters relating to the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill 1988, which is now an Act. These matters concerned the constitutionality of including certain clauses in the Bill and the constitutionality of the Bill itself. In preparing this report, the Committee sought opinions from various organisations and individuals with expertise and/or an interest in the matter before the Committee. For the information of honourable senators, those opinions are reproduced in the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill incorporated an agreement between the Commonwealth and Westpac concerning the sale of the Defence Service Homes Corporation to Westpac Banking Corporation. The agreement was a commercial and contractual arrangement between the Commonwealth and Westpac. It is a matter of commercial reality that Westpac would not wish to be bound by terms to which it had not agreed. Clause 6 of the agreement, upon which concern has been focused, merely preserved this right. On the basis of the material presented and the Committee's own examination of the issues, the Committee has concluded that there was nothing in the Bill which purported to limit or affect the Senate's power to amend legislation. In the Committee's view, the Bill did not give rise to any constitutional problems. The Bill expressly recognised the ability of the Parliament to amend the Bill as it thought fit. It also encompassed the concept that, if there is an agreement between the Commonwealth and a private institution such as Westpac, that institution, according to the usual rules of contract, should be entitled not to go ahead with an instrument which has been changed by one party, which in this case would have been the Commonwealth. As it turned out, the Bill is now an Act and the agreement has been consummated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act, I present reports relating to the following projects: construction of national medical cyclotron facility, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney; construction of new communications and recruits schools, HMAS Cerberus, Crib Point, Victoria; and development of a military police complex at Green Hills, Liverpool military area, New South Wales.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The Committee welcomes the Government's decision to establish a national medical cyclotron at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney. The provision of the facility will enable a production of a range of short-lived radioisotopes which presently are unavailable in Australia or have to be imported. The use of the cyclotron, in conjunction with a positron emission tomography camera, to be operated by the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, will enable the introduction of technology which is vital to the early diagnosis and treatment of a wide range of medical conditions, including cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, and severe trauma.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee's report on the construction of new communications and recruits schools at HMAS Cerberus, Crib Point, Victoria, at an estimated cost of $15.95m, is the second report the Committee has presented in relation to the redevelopment of HMAS Cerberus since November 1986. In November 1986 the Committee recommended the construction of the first phase of the redevelopment of facilities at HMAS Cerberus, including a wharf, seamanship school, marina and boat ramp, at an estimated cost of $14m. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has also recently held a public hearing into a further phase of the redevelopment of HMAS Cerberus-the upgrading of living-in accommodation. The Committee will report on this project shortly, the estimated cost of which is $15.7m. HMAS Cerberus is an historical base and the Committee is particularly pleased with the architectural design of the redevelopment and wishes to congratulate both the Department of Defence and Australian Construction Services for their efforts in this regard. However, in the report I have just tabled the Committee has suggested that there is merit in involving heritage organisations, particularly the Australian Heritage Commission, in heritage issues at an early stage in the planning process. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's report relating to the development of a military police complex at Green Hills continues the Committee's involvement in the upgrading of facilities in the Liverpool military area. Since mid-1986, the Committee has recommended the expenditure of approximately $95m on the upgrading of facilities in the Liverpool military area, including this project. This expenditure covers accommodation, warehouse facilities and the redevelopment of the School of Military Engineering. I commend the reports to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the suspension of the sitting for lunch, I was speaking to the motion moved by the Opposition's spokesman on women, Senator Hill, in respect of International Women's Day. The motion states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate, on International Women's Day-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) applauds the efforts of farsighted and courageous women who have worked to improve the status of other women;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) pledges to fully recognise the contribution of women in the family and in the community and to continue to work to improve the status of women towards the goal of true economic, educational and social equality;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) recognises the achievements of the women's movement and those who have supported improvement in the status of women but acknowledges that true equality between the sexes has yet to be achieved; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) notes that true equality of opportunity includes the freedom of choice of women to support children outside of paid employment and that such a choice requires greater recognition of and support for the unpaid work of mothers. </PARA>
<PARA>Prior to the luncheon break I had mentioned the courage of our pioneering women and the achievements of Kay Cottee, Mother Theresa and Sister Elizabeth Kenny. I would also like to pay a tribute to Jane Addams, the first woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, Madame Curie, who won the Nobel Prizes for physics and for chemistry, and Amelia Earhart, the famous woman flyer. Although there are many other women of note, perhaps I could add the names of just two other women-Mairead Corrigan and Betty Williams-who have taken an extremely courageous stand. </PARA>
<PARA> On 10 August 1976, in Belfast, Northern Ireland, an Irish Republican Army getaway car, its driver shot through the head by the British soldier whom he had attacked, jumped the kerb, crushed to death three young children and critically injured their mother. Hours later the mother's sister, Mairead Corrigan, then a 32-year-old secretary, appeared on television and denounced the Irish Republican Army. She was the first Catholic woman in Ulster who had dared to challenge the gunmen. Betty Williams, mother of two and wife of a seaman, lived just a few blocks away from the place where the tragedy occurred. When she met Mairead Corrigan, these two Catholic women began organising the people's peace movement. Despite their lack of experience, within two weeks some 30,000 Protestant and Catholic women in Northern Ireland were marching behind them, demanding an end to the violence. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the sort of courage which I believe women through generations have exhibited and which we acknowledge this day. There are so many names I could mention but, without a doubt, the unique contribution that women make to the world in the bearing and rearing of children is their most important contribution. The motion specifically refers to true equality of opportunity. It says that this:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . includes the freedom of choice of women to support children outside of paid employment and that such a choice requires greater recognition of and support for the unpaid work of mothers. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet so many mothers today are not given this choice. Indeed, we have seen how this choice has disappeared over the last six years that this Government has been in power. How this choice has disappeared was put very well by Eva Cox in her paper The Women's Tax Policy when she said:</PARA>
<PARA> The loss of income by families with children over the last five years comes from the following factors:</PARA>
<PARA>1. The loss in value of Family Allowances as these have not been indexed or increased since the advent of this government. </PARA>
<PARA>2. The loss of family allowances for families with joint income over the limit. This would be exacerbated by the fact that many of these families would include two full-time earners and have high child care costs. </PARA>
<PARA>3. Increases in child-care fees for many families due to changes in the funding system in 1985. The halving of the operational subsidy led to steep increases and the pegging of the top fee has also led to high fees for those with joint incomes over $35,000. </PARA>
<PARA>4. The fact that the cuts in income tax have been primarily directed at higher-income-earners with no compensatory payments, such as FAS, for most dual (but relatively low) income earners. </PARA>
<PARA>5. The rapid increase in housing costs and interest rates which fall primarily on households with younger children in their early mortgage stages. </PARA>
<PARA>6. The general fall in real wages which will affect spending power in larger households more than in smaller households as children are additional consumers. </PARA>
<PARA>That complete criticism by Eva Cox of the way that this Government led women to have high expectations but then deserted them completely is supported by our statistics, which show that women have turned from the Australian Labor Party and now intend to vote Liberal. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to mention a few of those criticisms. I refer first to the loss of value of family allowances, which have not been increased once by this Government. Under the previous Fraser Government the family allowance was increased on three separate occasions: When we first came to power we made the previous rebate a family allowance which was paid right into the hands of the mother. On the second occasion we increased the allowance for the third and fourth children and on the third occasion we increased it across the board. As Eva Cox said, there has been a loss of family allowance to people with incomes exceeding the means-tested limit, decreasing the number of recipients of that benefit by 10 per cent. There has also been a loss of value in the dependent spouse rebate. When we first came to power we increased that allowance, for women with children, from $400 to the present $1,030. All these increases were put into effect by the Fraser Government. Not one increase has been made by this Government. Of course, the increases in the Fraser years were a direct recognition on our part of the unpaid work that women do in the home. </PARA>
<PARA> It is pointed out very clearly in the document Families and Tax in 1989, put out by the Institute of Family Studies, that there have been taxation increases through bracket creep. That document states that the average disposable income for families with two children increased by $34.23 under the Fraser Government. Under the Hawke Government it has decreased by $41.71: it is down by $7.48. There is a great need for the Government to answer this report, which is very clear and very indicting. It states that since 1984-85, under this Government, real disposable incomes have fallen sharply for all income unit dependants on one income. These falls have ranged from $30.61 for single persons to $47.85 for couples with four children. It is an absolute indictment of the way this Government has treated women. Yet we have had such rhetoric from this Government. We have had statements from the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, Senator Reynolds, for the past 12 months that the Government would spend money on domestic violence. Not one penny has been spent. She made the announcement in May last year, but the money that she has been talking about will not start to be spent until April this year. </PARA>
<PARA> We were told by Senator Crowley with great pride that this year women comprise more than 50 per cent of the work force. She had not attempted to establish whether this was what women wanted or what it would do to families. She did not try to establish that at all; she said with great pride that this was what the Government had done. You bet it is what the Government has done! It has forced more than 50 per cent of married women into the work force. We know that in many instances women are doing menial jobs which they do not want to carry out. If we are to have true equality, without any doubt we must give women a choice. I have a definition that I have used many times in this place for what I believe is true equality. I would like to repeat that definition tonight:</PARA>
<PARA>True equality, put simply, gives every woman the right to choose the type of life she wishes to live. She may choose the traditional role of wife and mother, she may choose to follow a wonderful career, she may choose a combination of the traditional role and a career or she may choose the traditional role and just another job, either full time or part time, to earn the extra money that she believes would be of great help to her family. She may choose to do some part time work just because she likes to accomplish something but wants to fit in with her family arrangements. Of course, the emphasis is on choice. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not on pushing or pressganging women into the work force. That is what high housing costs and interest rates-up to 16 per cent and 20 to 22 per cent for bridging finance-are doing to the women of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think the Government understands what the situation is all about. When Senator Crowley got up in her place this morning she said that women were happy to be in the work force, but she could not know that without going through some of those menial jobs that the women are doing and without an understanding of what they are putting up with. Many women do not want to put their babies in childminding centres. They would prefer to have some financial recognition for the work they do in the home. I hope that the Senate at least will be unanimous on the definition I have given tonight of what true equality means to women. I feel that the Labor Party would agree. I am sure that Senator Harradine and perhaps even the Democrats, although they are not present, would also agree with my definition. I hope that at least it will have unanimous acceptance in the Senate on this International Women's Day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What is your assessment?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure one of the women opposite will agree that when suffragettes were necessary women had real advances. That is a nonsensical proposition, and those opposite know it. In the days when the Constitution which established Australia as a nation, was established, women had little role to play in the life of this country. Indeed, when the framework of the Constitution was established in 1898 the only women in Australia who had the right to vote at that time were residents of Western Australia and South Australia. An eminent commentator on the Australian Constitution, Professor La Nauze, made an interesting personal observation on the delegates who attended the first Constitutional Convention held in Australia. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Their average age was nearly 58. There was one clean-shaven member; one wore a moustache only; one a moustache and side-whiskers; the rest beards, more or less impressive. The clean-shaven features of Edmund Barton, Leader of the second Convention and the first Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, familiar in school text books, are untypical. The Constitution emerged from the labours of an overwhelmning majority of hairy men. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no question that Australian women have come a long way since then. Australian women were at the forefront of the suffragette movement around the world and won the right to vote in Federal election in 1902. They are now involved in updating the Australian Constitution, but it is generally considered that it has been only in recent years that really dramatic steps forward have been taken for women. In the past 15 years the concept of equal pay for work of equal value was enshrined into central wage-fixing systems. Unmarried mothers and deserted wives were provided with income support for the first time, and the Whitlam Government introduced subsidised child-care. Many significant advances have been made in education and employment. The advances, however, have not come quickly enough and obviously much is still to be done to enable women to make their own choices and to gain economic independence. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Zakharov" NAMEID="FE4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Real choices; that is correct. This Government is committed to the view that Australia cannot meet the challenges of the future if it does not allow the full and equal participation of women in society. This Government took a significant step last year with the release of its National Agenda for Women. The agenda, which sets out steps to advance the status of Australian women into the year 2000, was launched by Prime Minister Bob Hawke and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, Senator Margaret Reynolds. The 70-page agenda is this Government's response to the views expressed by more than 25,000 women during exhaustive nationwide consultations with Senator Reynolds's predecessor, Susan Ryan. These consultations included large public meetings in the Northern Territory, and I am sure that many Territorians were eager to read the results of that agenda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The release of the agenda followed the Federal Government's release of a report on Aboriginal women entitled Women's Business and the recently completed survey of rural women, Life Has Never Been Easy. The agenda set out specific plans for the next five years in areas nominated during those consultations and objectives to the year 2000. The areas covered are far too numerous to mention in the time available to me tonight, but include strategies to increase the capacity of women to participate in decision-making and to allow greater access to education, employment and training. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is also looking to consolidate achievements in removing discrimination on the basis of sex and continuing recent initiatives in the area of domestic violence prevention, the portrayal of women in the media, housing and health. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) pledged at the launch of the agenda last year in Sydney that the Federal Government would remove the overall exception for sex and marital status discrimination in superannuation funds and schemes from the Sex Discrimination Act. I understand that that legislation is to be introduced into the House of Representatives shortly. Financial security, particularly in retirement, is a serious concern for women and few are covered by, or have access to, adequate superannuation, compared to men. However, statistics show that women generally retire earlier than men and are more likely to live longer. </PARA>
<PARA> Many women in very arduous circumstances have made an extraordinary contribution to the life of the Northern Territory. One of the most famous-and she must have been an extraordinary women indeed-was Emily Creaghe, who accompanied her husband on the Ernest Favenc expedition from the Gulf of Carpentaria through the Northern Territory in 1883. She was Australia's first woman explorer. One of the most extraordinary things about the trip was that she was pregnant at the time. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Newman" NAMEID="BE4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator Newman</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was not extraordinary. They were usually pregnant at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say in response to that interjection that it was extraordinary for a woman to travel pregnant on horseback for six months through the Gulf of Carpentaria. Her diary, a fascinating document which I commend to Senator Newman, is in the Mitchell Library in Sydney and is worth reading. She was the first white woman many Aboriginals in the Northern Territory had seen. One of the most extraordinary sections of the diary-and I have read the original-was her shock and abhorrence when she called into a Northern Territory cattle station, walked into a shed and found nailed to the wall 40 pairs of human ears. They were ears that had been cut from the heads of Aboriginals who had been shot to death by the station in reprisal for the spearing of cattle. That is in the diary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some extraordinary women in the Northern Territory lived in the most appalling circumstances. What was typical in those days was not only their having to bear children a great deal of the time but seeing those children die very early in their lives. The history of the Northern Territory is full of women who bore seven, eight or nine children and saw none of them live past the age of five. Many of these women lived alone in the most extraordinary circumstances while their husbands were out fishing or mustering cattle-alone for six months at a time. Fortunately, the contribution of those women in the Northern Territory is about to be finally enshrined in print. They are about to come out of the darkness in which they have sheltered for the last 80 years. A book entitled No Man's Land, Women of the Northern Territory is about to be published. I am pleased to be able to say that the author of the book, Barbara James, was my former press secretary when I was Leader of the Labor Party in the Northern Territory. The book, even though read only in its proof stage, has been heralded as a significant contribution to the acknowledgment of the extraordinary role played by women in the development of Australia. I am pleased to be able to contribute to this debate and fully support Senator Hill's motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add my contribution to the motion put forward earlier today by Senator Hill on International Women's Day. In rising to speak on it, I place on record that I look forward to a day when in this place and on the parliamentary broadcast airwaves I will hear a motion to the effect that the Senate take note that it is pledged to recognise fully the contribution of men in the family and in the community and will continue to work to improve the status of men towards the goal of true economic, educational and social equality and notes that true equality of opportunity includes the freedom of choice of men to support children outside of paid employment and that such a choice requires greater recognition of and support for the unpaid work of fathers. It needs to be recognised that only when men and women are truly equal can the status not only of women but also of men be enhanced. It will only be when full time child-caring is given the status of full time paid work for the good of the community and the economy of the country and is not regarded as holding back a career for either men or women that true equality will exist. The househusband, like the housewife, deserves full status recognition. Suitable, affordable child-care also needs to be available to all who require it, both mothers and fathers. In this way, we can achieve for everybody the economic, educational and social equality that is sought in the resolution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look briefly at something of the history of women in the professions. An Age editorial in the 1870s stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . The ladies are again to the front, clamoring for the right of plucking the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, and it seems certain this right cannot be denied them very long. They pass the matriculation examination by scores and find themselves disqualified at the first fence in the steeplechase whose prize is a degree . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Janet Hawley, in her review of Dr Farley Kelly's book Degrees of Liberation: a Short History of Women in the University of Melbourne, writes:</PARA>
<PARA> This Age editorial of the 1870s admirably summed up the predicament faced by young women in Victoria who were barred from entering the University of Melbourne. It was not until 1880-27 years after the University's foundation-that women were admitted to its corporate rights and privileges. The legal right of entry was only a first step in women staff and students' long battle for full acceptance and equality with their male colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA>The review continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The opposition was particularly strong in relation to medicine which, it was believed, would `unsex' lady practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA>In her book, Dr Kelly writes:</PARA>
<PARA> There was some trade jealousy and some genuine revulsion at the thought of the protected female encountering brutal bodily facts. The horror expressed at the notion of a female physician wielding a surgical knife about a defenceless male body requires little elaboration for post-Freudian readers. </PARA>
<PARA>Janet Hawley's article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> In concluding degrees of liberation, Dr Kelly offers the following reflection: ``The first women students of the 1880s and 1890 had expected much and much had been expected of them in return. Their intellectual demands were certainly satisfied; full professional recognition and independence were not so easily pursued or attained. As students they enjoyed, by and large, more nearly egalitarian treatment than they would later encounter in the competitive world of work or within the conventional marriage structure. These conditions have not yet altered greatly.''</PARA>
<PARA>In an article in the Age of 4 May last year, headed `Medicine remains a male stronghold', Valerie Colyer Farfalla reports that women doctors remain in second-class jobs because they are forced, unlike their male peers, to choose between career and family obligations. She writes:</PARA>
<PARA> Women in medicine are struggling to achieve even half of the salary and status of their male counterparts . . . </PARA>
<PARA> They have circumscribed careers, often spent working for male doctors or government organisations, rather than running their own private clinics. They are less likely to publish books or do research, or work as teachers of medicine. </PARA>
<PARA> Their absence in senior administrative or policy-making positions, says Dr Dennerstein, means they have little say on medical courses or practices. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us consider now how the specialists line up. Twelve per cent of paediatricians in Australia are women; 17 per cent of anesthetists are women; 2 per cent of surgeons are women; 8 per cent of physicians; 18 per cent of trainee physicians and 9 per cent of gynecologists and obstetricians are women. Caroline Falls, under the by-line `women in Business', writes:</PARA>
<PARA> The number of women graduating in medicine has increased dramatically in the past 30 years. Today women represent between 40 and 50 per cent of graduates from most Australian medical courses . . . </PARA>
<PARA>As honourable senators will understand, those percentages do not reflect that graduation level of women in medicine. That is because, in the current order of things, to specialise, a medical graduate needs to do post-graduate training for a minimum of six years and up to 10 years without interruption. Those sorts of courses certainly hold women back in the medical area. We certainly still have a long way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to place on record here some of my own experiences in this area. I had my first child in hospital under a very male dominated and paternalistic system. The obstetrician expressed surprise that I demanded to have a say not only in the control of what medication I had and any procedures to be used, but also to know exactly what was going on at all times. He made snide remarks such as, `Do you intend to study midwifery when all of this is over?'. I was more fortunate when giving birth to my subsequent children at home in my own environment and in my own way with the aid of a sympathetic, sensible and sensitive midwife. It is unfortunate that in Australia today if women chose to have their babies at home they cannot get full Medicare rebates. The privilege is reserved for the few who can afford it. </PARA>
<PARA> Women are making their way in many professions, not only medicine. Many articles have been written on women in the professions. There are too many for me to quote from, but I list some of the headings: `Women in the law-The takeover begins'; `Women Scientists on the Move'; `Time to give girls a go in non-traditional trades'; `First woman to head engineering school'; and so on. It can be seen that women are making their way in the professions. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I express the hope that we have moved forward from what Geoffrey Blainey, now Professor Geoffrey Blainey, wrote in A Centenary History of the University of Melbourne, published in 1956:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the admission of women to all the lectures of the universities cramped the style of the professors who could no longer illustrate their lectures with `bawdy stories'. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="706" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Housing and Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Medical practitioners have an ethical responsibility to obtain informed consent from patients for the administration of therapy. In the case of children, informed consent would need to come from the parent or guardian of the child.</PARA>
<PARA> The primary responsibility therefore rests with the prescriber. If a medical practitioner has not adequately informed patients about the effects of prescribed drugs, some information may be provided by the dispensing pharmacist who will hold a copy of the product information for the drug concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> Manufacturers may sometimes print special instructions, warnings or other notifications on the packaging or provide them in the form of a package insert. The manufacturer of Ritalin, Ciba Geigy Australia Ltd., does not provide a patient package insert.</PARA>
<PARA> Ritalin is scheduled under the poisons scheduling arrangements as a Schedule 8 medicine. This means that written State or Territory Government authority (except South Australia) is required before Ritalin may be prescribed to any patient.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Medical practitioners and pharmacists are bound by professional standards of ethical behaviour. The Commonwealth does not have the power to direct the behaviour of individual professionals. However, it is concerned that the highest ethical standards in professional practice be maintained. In the event that damage occurs to the patient as a result of inadequate advice then legal advice may be sought concerning appropriate remedies through the courts.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Individual medical practitioners may refer to this description if they so wish. The description for ``attention deficit disorder'' (which you describe as ``hyperactivity'') is an inclusive and general one. The description given in DSM III would need to be balanced against the clinical picture used to formulate the professional's diagnosis. Since concepts such as ``inattention'', ``impulsivity'', ``hyperactivity'' are subjective assessments and part of a continuum including normality, the applicability of DSM III, or any other organisation's criteria would be decided by the medical practitioner on a case by case basis.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Media reports of this have been noted by the Department of Community Services and Health. The precise particulars of the legal action against the American Psychiatric Association are not known to me.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Under the Medicare arrangements, benefits are payable towards the cost of professional services rendered by legally qualified medical practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA> The diagnosis of ``attention deficit disorder'', when performed by a medical practitioner, would therefore, attract Medicare benefits. It is not possible to differentiate between services on the basis of the diagnostic technique which an individual practitioner may deem appropriate in particular circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Ciba-Geigy do list dependence as a side effect of Ritalin. In addition, there is information on dependence under the heading Precautions. I will provide Senator Childs with a copy of the product information for Ritalin as published in the Prescription Proprietaries Guide of 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department has never evaluated Ritalin as the drug was marketed in Australia prior to any requirement for the submission and evaluation of data. However, a recent article in Australian Prescriber volume 9 number 4 concerning the treatment of hyperactive children states that after decades of use overseas there is still no reputable evidence that this treatment leads to addiction. A copy of this article will be provided separately.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The side effects in relation to the use of Ritalin, Dexamphetamine, and other marketed drugs are monitored continuously through a voluntary adverse reaction reporting scheme administered by the Department and assisted professionally by the Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee, a sub-committee of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee. A copy of the adverse reactions to Ritalin and Dexamphetamine reported between November 1972 and August 1988 is being provided to Senator Childs. There are 3 reports to Ritalin and 2 to Dexamphetamine. None is of dependence.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The Department gives weight to the voluntary reporting scheme referred to in the answer to question 7. Literature searches can be undertaken on a ``needs'' basis. The library service is not used in the first instance.</PARA>
<PARA> The library of the Department of Community Services and Health contains a very large number of books and journals. To search the library's contents for all material pertaining to adverse effects of Ritalin would be an enormous undertaking and has not been done. It is likely however that material pertaining to adverse effects to Ritalin does exist in the library and it would be possible to identify some of the material by searching several computerised drug information databanks. Such searches are not routinely performed after a drug is marketed unless there are reasonable grounds. Manufacturers of imported drugs are expected to inform the Department of previously unrecognised significant or serious adverse reactions to their products.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Housing and Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I accepted the advice of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) that the drug dipyridamole should be deleted from the PBS. Persantin is a brand of dipyridamole.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes. Having noted reports indicating doubt as to the usefulness of the drug, the PBAC requested the manufacturer of Persantin to provide whatever data were available to support the drug's efficacy.</PARA>
<PARA> On reviewing the data submitted, the PBAC was of the view that there was indeed a lack of efficacy data.</PARA>
<PARA> The matter has been reviewed by the PBAC on several occasions.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I am unable to indicate why patients with transient ischaemic attacks appear to obtain benefits from the drug. Persantin has never been approved for use in Australia for this purpose as the application from the manufacturer to include transient ischaemic attacks as an indication was rejected by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No such undertaking can be given as under the National Health Act there is no capacity for special provisions to be made.</PARA>
