<TITLE>Community Services and Health Legislation</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Senate assembled in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate that the Government is about to introduce into the Senate, legislation changing health insurance. These changes will increase the cost of health insurance to members of employee based funds and will do nothing to help the elderly, as is being claimed. Big public funds will increase their surpluses by taking money from more efficient funds. People will be forced back onto Medi- care, which will not help to maintain private health insurance. Your petitioners therefore pray that the Senate reject this legislation.</PARA>

<TITLE>Community Services and Health Legislation</TITLE>
<PARA>To the President and members of the Senate assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> We, the undersigned, oppose changes to general medical practice contained in Community and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, on the following grounds.</PARA>
<PARA> 1. We oppose legislation which creates two classes of general practitioners and two classes of patients. Medicare is for all Australians. All Australians should receive the same Medicare rebates when consulting the doctor of their choice in any general practice or specialised area of general practice.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. We oppose this legislation as it ignores the needs of women as patients and as doctors. It devalues Women's Health, and it will discourage women from, not only, becoming general practitioners, but entering medicine.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. We oppose this legislation as it jeopardises the confidentiality of the patient-doctor consultation. Doctors on this Vocational Register must release patients' confidential clinical records for examination by the Independent Peer Review Organization and also information may be further released to other `relevant' authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate will reject the proposed changes to general medical practice contained in the Community and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989.</PARA>

<PARA> This humble petition of certain citizens of Australia respectfully draws the attention of the Senate to the Government's attack on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which has severely affected the viability of our community pharmacies and their ability to provide the quality and quantity of services to which we as Australians have a right.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners respectfully request the Senate to urge the Government to guarantee an adequately funded Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, so as to ensure the continued viability of neighbourhood pharmaceutical services through our local community pharmacies.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The members of the Australian Armed Forces who served in the Vietnam from 1962 to 1973 did so with distinction, valour and professionalism, upholding the traditions of the Armed Forces.</PARA>
<PARA> After World War 2 and the Korean War the Australian Government approved an End of War List of Gallantry Medals for individual acts of bravery that were not rewarded during wartime.</PARA>
<PARA> The Whitlam Government refused to approve such an End of War List at the end of the Vietnam War.</PARA>
<PARA> Your humble petitioners pray that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government reverse the decision of the Whitlam Government and thus approve an End of War List for the Australian Armed Forces personnel that served in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA> Upon the approval of the End of War List, the case of the 2nd Lieutenant John Fraser, 3RAR be considered for the award of a posthumous military honour.</PARA>

<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and the senators in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That every abortion kills an unborn human baby.</PARA>
<PARA> That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life.</PARA>
<PARA> That the most defenceless and threatened lives are those of unborn babies for whom the Government is duty bound to take extra steps to protect.</PARA>
<PARA> That in 1987-88 taxpayers funds through Medicare provided Medical Benefits for 61,879 abortions totalling $6.4 million.</PARA>
<PARA> That in the same year Commonwealth grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will carry out its duty to protect the right to life of Australian babies by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare, restricting grants to the States and by all other means at its disposal.</PARA>

<TITLE>Home Ownership</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Hawke-Keating government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many Australians out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families.</PARA>

<PARA> That the mountainous terrain and geography of Tasmania makes VHF television transmissions the most suitable for the State;</PARA>
<PARA> That more than 30,000 Tasmanians will have to purchase new television receivers and new antennae if commercial television in the State is forced to change from the VHF to the UHF band;</PARA>

<PARA> From June to September 1989 Australia will host the Kangaroo '89 joint military exercises involving 28,000 Australian and United States troops from the air, navy, and land forces;</PARA>
<PARA> The exercise coincides with a massive increase in Australian military expenditure on frigates, submarines, helicopters, and joint military exercises;</PARA>

I therefore ask: Why should not Ansett be obliged to mitigate its loss by standing down those employees whom it cannot afford to pay for doing nothing, as many companies have been forced to do in the past as a result of union muscle and without any hint of government compensation?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3K4">Senator DUNN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, and follows a question I asked on 5 June in relation to koalas in Tantawangalo and Senator Cook's reply that investigations by the New South Wales Forestry Commission failed to find koalas in the area. Has the Minister seen a statutory declaration by a Mount Darragh property owner in which he says that he told forestry officers on 14 December 1988 and 14 April 1989 of the exact location of koalas in the Mount Darragh area? Have any of the areas identified to those forestry officers been logged, and if they have when did the logging commence and is it still continuing? Has the Minister seen a copy of the report of the independent consultants engaged by the New South Wales Forestry Commission referred to in his answer, and can he say whether the consultants visited the identified areas, and if so when and how long they spent in the areas? Finally, can the Minister say whether the independent consultants interviewed any of the land owners in the Mount Darragh area as part of their investigation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Dunn was kind enough to forewarn me of this question. The answer to the first part of the question, as to whether I have seen the statutory declaration, is yes. The other parts involve quite a detailed reply. I do not want in any sense to cut the ground from under Senator Dunn if she wants to ask me a supplementary question, but I wonder whether it might be appropriate for me to incorporate the detail of that reply in my answer now rather than going through all of those questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The reply read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>1. In my reply to Question No. 933 I said on 5 June 1989 that the 1986 Environmental Impact Statement stated that ``in the Eden area koalas were most numerous in the Myrtle Mountain and Mount Darragh areas to the west and east of Tantawangalo respectively, and in the Bermagui State Forest''. I did not say that Myrtle Mountain and Mount Darragh were part of the Tantawangalo State Forest, as the honourable senator implies in her question. As I stated on 5 June, subsequent investigation by the NSW Forestry Commission and independent consultants have failed to find koalas in areas of Tantawangalo Forest scheduled for logging.</PARA>
<PARA>2. Yes. I am aware that the Mt Darragh property owner has advised various NSW and Commonwealth agencies of indications of presence of koalas near his property. In fact officers of my Department personally relayed details of the land owner's communication to the Regional Manager of the Eden forests and I understand that the matter was followed up by interview with the landowner and the conduct of surveys to ascertain whether koalas were present.</PARA>
<PARA>3. The areas in question, are in compartment 2453 of Tantawangalo State Forest. Part of this coupe has recently been logged and I have been advised that there were no signs before or after logging of the presence of koalas. I understand that the areas where the koalas are reported to have been seen are in a retained coupe which is not scheduled for logging for another 15 years.</PARA>
<PARA>4. As I have already said, I am advised that logging is not occurring in the areas where the property owner reported koalas.</PARA>
<PARA>5. I understand that the consultants' report was prepared for the New South Wales Government and has not been released publicly. I do not have a copy. Whether or not it will be released is for the New South Wales Government to decide.</PARA>
<PARA>6. I understand that the consultants visited the area and carried out three surveys during the day and at night, but found no koalas.</PARA>
<PARA>7. I am advised that the consultants did not interview the landowners but as I indicated earlier, the Forestry Commission met with the landowner concerned.</PARA>
<PARA>8. I did not state on 5 June that there were no koalas in the Tantawangalo State Forest. Rather, I indicated that I was not aware of any evidence of the presence of koalas.</PARA>
<PARA> The reports, which indicate that there may be some koalas at the south-eastern edge of Tantawangalo State Forest where it adjoins private property at Mt Darragh would not be inconsistent with the EIS which recognised that koalas are present in the Mt Darragh area.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Forestry Commission is taking reasonable steps to ascertain whether there are any koalas in areas scheduled for logging. If the presence of koalas is definitely established in the area identified by the landowner I understand that the normal practice would be for that location not to be logged.</PARA>

I had not seen the estimate of $36m a day. That comes out at something like $12 1/2 billion or $13 billion a year.

It was in that capacity that he hired Senator Stone to do some work for the Tourist Corporation prior to the 1985 National Taxation Summit. Perhaps the honourable senator might ask Senator Stone privately at some time whether he thinks $36m a day is a defensible figure. My own inclination is that it would not be. As for the rest of the question, a transcript that I have in front of me quotes the President of the Liberal Party, Mr Elliott, as saying that he does not support the pilots, and that he blames the centralised wage fixing system for the pilots dispute. He says that what the pilots should be doing is bargaining with the individual employers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen those reports. In fact, the Meat Inspectors Association of Australia had announced that it was holding a nation-wide stoppage on Wednesday of next week; that it was holding a protest rally in front of Parliament House over staffing changes within the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service; and that it was launching a campaign about the quality of meat inspection in Australia. That was the case as of last week. On Friday of last week I caused a meeting to be held in my office between the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and the Meat Inspectors Association. At the end of the day the Meat Inspectors Association went back to consult its national executive. I have now been informed that the scheduled nation wide stoppage will not occur and that next Wednesday the Meat Inspectors Association will commence negotiations with the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service over their points of disagreement about the changes to meat inspection arrangements in Australia. As a consequence, the slaughtering loss for one day, nationwide, also will not occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I congratulate the Meat Inspectors Association on deferring its industrial action. I wish the Meat Inspectors Association and the Quarantine and Inspection Service well in pursuing their negotiations, since they have adopted a very sensible approach to resolving what is a complex issue. The issue concerns a change in inspection procedures which leads to a reduction in the number of meat inspectors. It is a very complex issue, one that is difficult for such an Association, which has a small membership, to deal with, but it has opted to negotiate on this matter. I am optimistic-without wanting to be too optimistic-about the prospects of this negotiation being successful. In matters of this nature it is often the case that the issues that organisations promote are not the causes of the industrial unrest. In fact, in our discussions last Friday, one of the causes of dissatisfaction that emerged was the issue of meat inspectors working on their own or in small groups spread around Australia and what they felt was their alienation from the central management of the Quarantine Service. I must say in defence of the Quarantine Service that it does a sterling job in keeping the lines of communication open, but, given the peculiar arrangements of this industry, it is an amazingly difficult job to do. What the two parties will now explore, as well as the issues that have come to symbolise the disaffection, will be ways in which a more participative style of management approach for meat inspectors can be introduced into the Quarantine Service.</PARA>

It is quite clear that he is certainly sensitive to the requirements of the Aboriginal people in a way which the Bulletin article was not. Certainly in relation to the issue of consultation with the traditional owners of the region, I am informed that the Department of Defence is presently in the process of negotiating a memorandum of understanding with the Maralinga people in relation to access to their lands. In particular, an agreement is being sought with the Maralinga Tjarutja, the statutory authority which manages the land in question. There was also a meeting and a presentation to the Aboriginal community at Oak Valley in May this year to discuss a draft agreement. Officers from the Premier's Department and the South Australian Department of Aboriginal Affairs were present. The traditional owners of the Pitjantjatjara lands may also be affected and, as I have said, they are also being consulted. It may be found to be appropriate for a similar memorandum of understanding to be negotiated with the Pitjantjatjara people.

That article reported that Harlin Holdings Ltd, the company currently mounting a takeover bid for Elders IXL, has raised $400m of new equity. Does this new and mainly foreign equity mean that Harlin is now a foreign controlled company as far as the Foreign Investment Review Board is concerned? Does Harlin have FIRB approval for its takeover bid for Elders?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="849" SPEAKER="Walsh Sen The Hon P.A." NAMEID="TJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see the article. On the main part of the question it is important to note that the article refers to the $400m as quasi-equity. Indeed, the paragraph in which that is cited states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whatever happens, Harlin has four new holders of quasi-equity, shown in this morning's table.</PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> It's a nice commentary on modern finance that none of this ``equity'' will actually result in any dilution of existing shareholders in Harlin, even though it will ultimately more than double Harlin's previous equity base of $622 million if it is all drawn down.</PARA>
<PARA>If that is correct, and I have no reason to believe it is not correct, that is in contrast to the 1c paid shares which Mr Elliott and other executives and directors of Elders IXL have in the past issued to themselves because those 1c paid shares subsequently attracted bonus shares, fully paid, with all the rights of all other shareholders, and thereby of course did dilute the equity in the company that was held by ordinary shareholders. In an article published on 26 June, Mr Terry McCrann, formerly of the Melbourne Age and now of the Melbourne Herald, went into this matter in some detail. He revealed that Mr Elliott, for example, had received some $22m worth of free shares in that way-free, that is, to him but at a cost to all the other shareholders in the company-on which he was picking up $1m tax free, that is, tax free because the dividends were fully franked tax free dividends. Mr McCrann also forecast that Mr Elliott would pick up a great deal more this year.</PARA>
<PARA> To return to Harlin, since the equity, or quasi-equity, as Chanticleer refers to it, is of a somewhat peculiar character, I suspect that Harlin will continue to meet the test for being an Australian company, but I will ask the Treasurer to check that out. In respect of the broader question of the dilution of ordinary shareholders' capital through management and directors granting themselves one cent paid shares, there is a contingent liability for the payment of the difference between the one cent and the market price at the day of issue, a contingent liability which would be called up if the director or executive subsequently resigned. It is also hinted-rather broadly, I would have thought-in Mr McCrann's article that it is however possible to avoid that contingent liability if the one cent paid shares are subsequently transferred to a company, and there are some indications that that sort of manoeuvre is envisaged by the present management of Elders as well, the reason for that being that once it is transferred to a company the company has an ongoing life which an individual does not.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the broader questions raised by this sort of `transaction', it has been suggested to me by a member of the Liberal Party who was concerned about these fiscal shenanigans-a different member of the Liberal Party, incidentally-that the most effective way to deal with this sort of fiscal shenanigan is through corporate law, and that is a point of view I will be putting to the Attorney-General.</PARA>

In view of the fact that the alleged crimes took place nearly half a century ago in foreign countries quite outside the experience of the Australian legal system, will it not be a matter of very great difficulty to ensure a fair trial? Might not defendants require access to the countries from which they fled or migrated to establish contacts with potential defence witnesses and would not these defence witnesses need exit visas and some credible guarantee that they would not be punished if they gave defence evidence?

It led to the insertion into the legislation of various clauses which put beyond doubt the fair trial, which Senator Hamer seems to be questioning, of any person who is charged. There is within that parliament-sanctioned framework all the guarantees that the common law protections which attend a criminal trial will be provided to those who might find themselves defending a charge that they are indeed war criminals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have not read the articles Senator Hamer refers to. If Mr Greenwood indicated that he was pleased with the cooperation he had received from the authorities in one type of jurisdiction, I am sure he would not mean to exclude the cooperation that he has received from authorities in other jurisdictions around the world. Indeed, I am quite sure that the sort of evidence that he has been able to gather has been because of the cooperation of those in the communist countries to which Senator Hamer referred and those in democratic countries such as West Germany, the United States and Israel. Mr Greenwood, of course, in discharging his function as head of the Special Investigations Unit, has not pursued his investigations with a prejudiced frame of mind, but has sought not only the sort of evidence which might lead to an allegation being sustained but also exculpatory evidence-the sort of evidence which might indicate that an allegation was baseless, was perhaps even maliciously made, but certainly which might not be sustained. He has made it very clear in all his cooperative work with authorities overseas that he is looking, as I say, for both exculpatory evidence and that which leads to some assertion of blame. I believe that fair trials, and the gathering of evidence which might lead to the assembly of a package which Mr Greenwood can hand to the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration, can be guaranteed, as was fully explained and considered by the Senate in its passage of this legislation.</PARA>

The umbrella opposition grouping, the Mass Democratic Movement, launched a country-wide defiance campaign on 4 August with the expressed aim of forcing the South African Government to bring about changes to apartheid laws by peaceful means. The Mass Democratic Movement has developed a strategy of seeking access to whites-only institutions, including hospitals and schools. South African law and order administrators claim that the Mass Democratic Movement proposes to use violence. This has been denied by the MDM. I note that the only violence to have occurred so far has been as a result of the action of the South African police. Archbishop Tutu and other prominent church leaders are involved in the campaign. He was arrested on 2 September as he led a peaceful demonstration near Parliament House in Cape Town and was held for several hours.

Many people were reported to have been injured in the police action and many journalists, including Peter Cave, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation correspondent based in London, were also reported to have been arrested and tapes confiscated under emergency regulations. The Australian Government deplores the use of violence by the South African police in seeking to stop peaceful demonstrations and strongly urges the South African Government to order restraint on the police.The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is asking our Embassy in Pretoria to convey this call by the Australian Government for such immediate restraint.</PARA>

Vipsogal may be dangerous. It contains a mixture of powerful cortisone-like drugs, an antibiotic and other agents. The use of antibiotics is ridiculous as psoriasis is not caused by infections. The Australian College of Dermatologists, including its Queensland faculty, has opposed vipsogal's use in Australia because the powerful drugs in vipsogal can damage skin. Because the manufacturer has not lodged data sufficient to allow marketing and because all the active ingredients are available in Australia, no further import permits are being issued.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very long and complex question and there are several premises in it which are just wrong. To answer all of them would take me the best part of the rest of the afternoon. Let me answer the question as it unfolds, hopefully with a maximum of succinctness. The first thing was about levels of assistance. I point out to Senator Vallentine that the environment statement indicated that $20m over four years will be available under our foreign aid budget for environmentally sustainable projects, and that is an element of the aid package that I direct her attention to. However, at a Federal level no aid is being provided, I am advised, by any formal government agency to logging operations or trials or for the transmittal of genetic material with Indonesia. I have been advised-and this is anecdotal, I suppose-that there may be an involvement with the Department of Conservation and Land Management in Western Australia, which may be providing some bilateral assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The same is true of the fact that McLean Consolidated has a logging concession in Irian Jaya of about 800,000 hectares. I am not sure whether the terms of production commitment entered into between that company and the Indonesian Government require it to supply any scientific or genetic material.</PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, the CSIRO has sold 63 seed lots at a cost of approximately $1,600 by way of research samples to companies operating in Indonesia, working with the Indonesian Government. It is a normal commercial operation for the CSIRO; it is the sort of thing it has been doing for 30 years. The species it has sold are acacia and eucalypt species. Those species are indigenous and not exotic to Irian Jaya. They were sold to a consulting firm doing work for the Indonesian Government on plantations as a possible basis for developing a feed stock for a pulp mill organised and managed by the Indonesian Government in consortia with private companies. The Indonesian firm that bought them is Scott-Astra and it is working in the consultancy with a Finnish consulting company.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine also asked whether there was going to be a public environmental review. The answer to that is no. She asked about sanctions, and I think here there is a lot of wrong-headedness in her question. The national conservation strategy ought to be read and the Prime Minister's environmental statement ought to be read by Senator Vallentine when she frames these questions. There is a section in the Prime Minister's environmental statement about tropical rainforests which indicates that we are studying the impact on tropical rainforests and will shortly be making a statement about that and that I have been pursuing a tropical rainforests initiative in South East Asia. I have already had talks with the relevant Ministers in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam. I had some discussions with Papua New Guinea before that, and that is a basis for trying to obtain a set of environmental conditions that would apply for tropical rainforest logging in those countries, similar to those conditions that apply in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> I would counsel against any knee-jerk responses such as those implicit in the honourable senator's question by saying that in Indonesia I had a discussion with Dr Emil Salim, who is the Indonesian State Minister for Population Affairs and the Environment. He was also a commissioner on the World Commission on Environment and Development, what is commonly called the Brundtland Commission. He argued strongly-and I must say I have a great deal of sympathy and support for this point of view-that the biggest problem that Indonesia faces is that of slash-burn agriculture. It needs sustainable agriculture, and not logging operations.</PARA>
<PARA> But from an industry point of view he believes, as does the Indonesian forestry Minister, that the move by Japan just recently to lower the import duty on imported logs in their rawest form and increase the import duty on finished timber products militates against developing the economy. It does not enable downstream processing to emerge as an industrial option in those developing economies, thus keeping their economic growth down and meaning that they are always marginal economies unable to deal with the complex issues of forest management. Dr Salim has particularly made a call for that type of restriction to the main markets of rainforests to be changed to enable the economic growth which is necessary to underpin sound environmental management of those forests. So are we going to apply sanctions against McLean's? The answer to that is no, because I do not see any reason for it. I think the rest of the points have been answered.</PARA>

They are arrangements which facilitate the movement of passengers. In so far as what has been described in this question unambiguously as `proposals' is concerned, late last week the airlines sought from the Government a consideration of some form of compensation-I believe that is the word they used-in respect of the losses incurred by them as a result of the air pilots strike.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the criticisms. They have been particularly of the Government's bankruptcy video which was described in here last week by Senator Boswell as a `do it yourself kit'. The criticisms of the video are based on ignorance. They are based on no knowledge of the video or its contents or the reasons for it. They are based on a total insensitivity to the needs of the area. Thankfully, the criticisms are not widespread; they are not valid; they just come from members of the Opposition, and we know how isolated they are in the Australian community at the moment. Senator Boswell based some of his claims last week on the allegation that the amount of business bankruptcy has blown out under this Government. The basic fact about that is that in 1982-83 there were 2,385 business bankruptcies in the Australian community. The figures for the last financial year have recently come out and show that the number had decreased by almost 300, to 2,088. It should also be stated that over the last 12 months the number of bankruptcies overall decreased quite substantially on the previous financial year. So the premise of the allegation is totally wrong. The Government has addressed the question of overcommitment in a number of different ways. In 1982-83 the number of business bankruptcies in the Australian community was 2,385; in 1988-89 the figure had decreased by 300.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the last financial year. The question was in fact about business bankruptcies. As I have said, the Government has addressed the question of overcommitment through education campaigns geared towards youth, through assistance to financial counsellors and through industry funded credit education foundations. But we also recognise that there are people who are overcommitted and people who will be bankrupt. The changes in bankruptcy administration have been geared very much towards that. The moratorium period, for instance, gives individuals a cooling off period before going to bankruptcy. Financial counsellors are then brought into place. The education package is vital as a way not of indicating to people how they go bankrupt but of explaining to them the implications of bankruptcy-implications that they need to know and which, quite often, government is asked by industry to bring to the attention of those who are about to go bankrupt. There is, therefore, a useful role for this sort of education package, which has been recognised by the community, industry and financial counsellors being part thereof.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another part of the criticism went to the video itself. It should be placed on record at this stage that the video has been extremely well received and it has been recognised as an effective and useful video, to the extent that Film Australia has entered the video for several awards in the United States of America and one within Australia. It has been entered for the United States independent film and video festival. It has been entered in the intercommunications festival in Chicago. It has also been entered in the Australian training film and video competition. The video has also been sent to the United States Administration for it to use as a model. The idea of a video came, firstly, as I have said, from a request by industry and financial counselling groups. The Government has put it into effect as part of its overall comprehensive package in this area and it has been recognised by the wider community as useful. However, it seems to have been attacked by those opposite in a spirit of ignorance and insensitivity-something that we are used to.</PARA>

On the AM program this morning, which I heard, Mr Mohl did not refer to his own expectations that the slowdown would be mild.

The answer is that there have been no stand-downs of Australian Airlines employees to date; various other arrangements have been put in place to avoid recourse to stand-down action and the airlines have advised employees that these arrangements will continue without prejudice until a further meeting on 6 September of this year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have moved that, as a matter of public importance, the Senate should this afternoon debate `the damage inflicted on the Australian tourist industry by the pilots' dispute and the Government's failure to resolve the situation'. The damage that Australian tourism is suffering is severe and some of it, regrettably, is permanent. That damage is both to the tourist industry and to the Australian nation. The damage is already occurring, it is getting worse, and we are going to suffer the effects of that damage for years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All of this is happening to a bankrupt country. During nearly seven years of Labor economic mismanagement we have seen taxes increase by 105 per cent, standards of living decline and, most tragically, the debt position of this country increase from about $32 billion to $35 billion, which it was in 1983 when this Government came to office, to more than $125 billion today. We are in no position to take this self-inflicted wound, which is purely a product of this Government's mismanagement of its industrial relations policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The tourist industry is our biggest overseas export earner. The reason why we are in this trouble is this Government's outdated, inappropriate and antediluvian industrial relations policies. It is this Government and no-one else which must accept the responsibility for the mess we are in. It has been in office for nearly seven years; it does not have the skills to cope with a modern, complex, industrialised society. It knew this was going to happen; everyone who took any interest in aviation matters knew that the airline pilots were planning a very serious, major strike this year. Even Senator Collins in the debate last week tabled with a great flourish some of the documentation that had been circulated by the pilots' union to members. The Government knew this was coming. It did nothing to intercept the course of events. It could have had a quiet word with its friend, Sir Peter Abeles; it could have had a word with Mr Strong. It could have said, `Look, there is trouble brewing. What about doing something to pre-empt this disaster which is going to befall us?', but it did nothing. Even worse, it did not even make a contingency plan. It sat on its hands and hoped it would not happen. Now that it has happened, we have not seen one constructive move from this Government to deal with this great national crisis that is upon us. </PARA>
<PARA> Why should this country suffer? Why should a country that is endowed with the human resources and the physical resources that Australia has, be mismanaged by the Australian Labor Party when we have seen so much progress this century? Honourable senators should cast their minds back to each of the four occasions during which the Labor Party has been in power. Under the Scullin Government we had the disaster of the Great Depression of 1929. We had the mismanagement, lack of direction and muddling through with a controlled economy which ensued during the war years, from 1940 onwards, until Labor was thrown out in 1949. What about the absolute chaos and the way in which society was stood on its head during the Whitlam years? The consequence of nearly seven years of the Hawke system of socialism has been this huge and crippling debt position which is around our neck, and will be around our neck for decades to come. Those situations should be contrasted with the great periods of growth in Australia under the Liberal-National Party Government. I refer to the golden age in the 1950s and the 1960s when Robert Menzies was running this country in accordance with Liberal principles that gave everyone a free go. The whole nation developed because economic growth--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The little dissembler should keep quiet; I have the call. Great growth took place because we had economic and individual freedoms. That should be contrasted with the four periods in this century when the Labor disaster has been foisted upon us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I come back to this point: the present crisis is the fault of the Labor Government and no-one else. All we get from the Government by way of resolution is something about compensation. It is all very vague, there are no details at all, but it is talking about compensating the airlines. The Government happens to own one of the airlines. The other airline happens to be owned by one of the friends of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). It is one thing to give support to private industry when it is being bullied by the trade union movement when only one small company is involved; it is one thing to give that company support with its great legal expenses when it is being victimised; it is quite a different matter to open the public purse to an airline that a government owns, and to one that enjoys a duopoly position, so that it can hold the market to ransom. I quote from a letter that was faxed to my office this morning from a Brisbane travel agent, dealing with this matter of compensation. It states in part:</PARA>
<PARA>The airlines are only a small and very privileged part of the tourist and travel industry. The airlines already enjoy enormous Government patronage denied to the rest of the Australian business community by having fixed prices and other commercial advantages which arise from protective legislation. The 21000 airlines employees are equally privileged by generous awards that reflect the airline duopoly. It would be a monstrous travesty of justice to maintain the wages of this privileged group of employees at the expense of the public when some 150000 other employees in the tourist and travel industry will be sacked by next Friday as a result of this dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that puts the case very succinctly. The tourist industry is the biggest sufferer from this problem, not the airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the damages that the tourist industry is suffering? In the first place, the tourism industry is a very big industry, and even the Government realises this. I have with me here copies of press releases by Mr Holding, the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories in the other place, and one from Senator Richardson, the Minister for Tourism amongst all his other duties, and in this press release Senator Richardson says:</PARA>
<PARA> In 1988 overseas visitors spent an estimated $1.6 billion on food, drink and accommodation, $800m on shopping, $320m on domestic air fares, $310m on trains, bus and car transport, $120m on organised tours, $120m on entertainment and $280m on other miscellaneous items. A further $1.6 billion was earnt by Qantas with international airfares. </PARA>
<PARA>Then Senator Richardson goes on to say-and these words must haunt him at the moment if he has any conscience:</PARA>
<PARA>At a time when many of our traditional exports face an uncertain future, tourism is expanding rapidly with the number overseas visitors increasing by more than 25 per cent in each of the last three years to a record 2.2 million in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>Well, I have news for Senator Richardson. The numbers of tourists are not expanding at all; in fact they are contracting dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA> The tourism industry earned $6.5 billion in foreign exchange last year. But that is not the whole total of its earnings, because we have to add to that the domestic travellers within this country. In aggregate the tourist industry involves a turnover of something like $26 billion. There are over 480,000 employees in the tourist industry. It is the biggest private sector employer in this country. It might shock Senator Richardson to realise some of the responsibilities that he so negligently discharges. After the Public Service in Australia, the local government, State governments and Federal Government, it is the biggest employer. It is a very big employer of women and youth, two groups who are critically important in the Australian work force. There is something like $19 billion worth of work that is either under way or contracted for, and a great part of that $19 billion, which has great implications for Australian building and the economy in general, is now jeopardised by this strike, which the Government is doing absolutely nothing about. </PARA>
<PARA> Every sector of the Australian economy is affected by tourism. Just to give a trite example: every tourist in this country eats three eggs a day, so the impact of tourism on the economy is felt by the primary producers producing food, the manufacturers, the distributors and the service industry. The flow-on effects of any troubles in the tourist industry are absolutely horrendous. We have made a very big investment in tourism. In the last five years I do not know how many billions of dollars we have put in, but it has been a very great sum of money that the Australian economy has invested in developing not only hotels but the whole of the infrastructure related to tourism-the airports, the roads, and the service facilities supporting it. It is not a matter so much of saying it will not grow for a while. What is happening at the moment is that it is dying. We made this great investment in 1986, 1987 and 1988 prices. We are paying interest rates at the current time. This is the great difference between the tourist industries and the other great industries of Australia, where we made the investment generations ago in prices that were existing at the time and at interest rates that were about a third or a quarter of those that apply at present, and we have had the chance to amortise them. I am not suggesting that we take easily any setbacks in relation to the coal industry, or the steel industry or the wool industry. But at least setbacks there are more manageable to us than the position we have in the tourist industry, where we are extremely vulnerable. We require a daily throughput of tourists there just to stay alive. </PARA>
<PARA> What is happening at present? Well, the airlines have not stood anyone down yet, because the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) bully boys have seen to that. But the ACTU is not at all interested in what is going on in the hotel trade. I have had some figures come in to me this morning in my office concerning what is going on around my own State of Queensland. One of the largest hotels-I will not mention its name but probably most people here have stayed there-has advised me that it has lost 650 bed nights, that its customer occupancy has dropped from 80 per cent to 40 per cent, and that two conferences and 12 functions have been cancelled. Another one has had 12 conventions cancelled, some with 525 delegates, and that is just for the next two weeks. Another large hotel in Brisbane has lost 200 delegates, a sum of 310 rooms, in the last two weeks, and on it goes. </PARA>
<PARA> I had a report from north Queensland-and honourable senators would know very well that the north Queensland area, the Cairns area, is one of the brightest tourist spots in Australia-that as of Friday of last week 200 to 300 permanent staff and 600 to 800 casual staff had been stood down. Well might Senator Jones be worried about that. I can assure him that none of those people are going to vote for Labor in the coming election. Many other workers have been stood down or have been forced to take leave. The estimate for the Cairns area alone is that as of Friday last week the region had lost $20m in revenue. These are huge figures, multiplied across the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing about the tourism industry is that it has a very high small business component. For example, there are the small travel agencies. No travel agency in Australia has written a domestic airline ticket for the last three weeks. They have lost their 9 per cent sales commission. That is having a devastating effect. Some of them have already gone out of business. As far as we can determine, by the end of this week 150,000 workers in the industry will have been stood down. Hotel occupancy rates are down. The whole infrastructure supporting the tourist trade is grinding to a halt. That is just what is happening within this country. There are headlines about the dispute in the newspapers every day in Japan and in Europe. I was talking by phone to someone in the United Kingdom last week and was told that the strike here is getting much publicity in London. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said last week in a debate, if we are going to hold our position as a tourist destination we have to be predictable. If tourists come to Australia they have to know that they can fulfil their program as planned. They cannot be held to ransom by a socialist Labor Government which is failing to discharge its responsibilities. What are the consequences of the present disaster that we are locked into? One of my colleagues this morning suggested, only half jokingly, that we should refer it to the Natural Disasters Organisation. I do not think that is such a bad idea, but I would send the whole of the Cabinet along as well. The effects we are experiencing at the moment will take there to five years to overcome. It may well take 10 years and a very large advertising budget to work our way out of the mess. </PARA>
<PARA> What response have we had from the Government? All we have seen is the abuse of pilots by the Prime Minister and the dissemination of a degree of inaccurate information. I hark back to Mr Hawke's repeated statement that anyone can learn to fly an aeroplane-in seven hours. I invited Mr Hawke last week to table his log books in the Parliament. I am not aware whether he has done so, but I do not believe that Mr Hawke ever got to a stage where he went solo with the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) university squadron in Oxford.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He got scrubbed, as Senator Lewis, an old pilot, says. As a person who has owned, for more than 20 years, the type of aeroplane that Mr Hawke claims to have flown, I think it highly unlikely that anyone could reach solo status in that sort of aeroplane within seven hours. In fact, it just does not happen. It is not the sort of aeroplane that is easy to get off the ground. The information Mr Hawke has put out about the number of hours that the pilots fly, how easy the job is and all the rest of it has not helped in any way at all to resolve the dispute. The responsibility of this mess lies with the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Collins said when he tabled the paper he tabled last week, the Government knew that there was a major, serious strike on this year. The Government made no plans to divert that eventuality; it let it happen. It has done nothing in the way of contingency planning for when such a problem arose. Even now it is not doing anything to resolve it. </PARA>
<PARA> We would fix the problem if we were in government, but we are not in government. The Government has the responsibility, and I hold very strongly to the principle of responsibility. We do not pay Senator Richardson as Minister and we do not pay the Prime Minister just to see their pretty faces in the paper or on the television set. We pay the Government members, irrespective of the person involved, for their responsibility in the office they hold. All we have seen from this Labor Government is a gross dereliction of duty. It has never accepted the responsibility incumbent on it-the Ministers and the Prime Minister of this country-to take the decisions and actions that the country demands. What has to happen is that the pilots have to get back to work, and that cannot happen unless the two parties meet-unless the employers and the employees come together. The employees are saying every day ad nauseam that they want to talk, but the Government is standing over them with a big stick and saying, `You will come back on your knees; you will come back within the 6 per cent wage guidelines'. It is completely overlooking the fact that the guidelines are broken every day with the connivance and conspiracy of this Government in all sorts of shaky deals around the country. Certainly there is a need for reform in this country's air transport system. We have a duopoly that provides no competition in the marketplace, and one of the essential points in the Liberal-National Party policy is that there be competition between those two airlines. We can do that by easing up the entry requirements for Australian companies to come into the transport pool, and if there are no Australian companies coming in then we can do what this Government is doing under duress-that is, allow interlining by overseas airlines between the capitals. </PARA>
<PARA> There have got to be changes. The pilots recognise they have to make changes; one only has to listen to what they are saying. Everyone recognises that change has to occur, except this Government. It is persisting with an archaic antediluvian system of centralised wage fixing; it is worshipping that shrine and will not allow the Australian community to get out of the mess we are in by allowing simple negotiations to take place between the two parties who are in dispute. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would have to say I am in agreement with at least part of Senator MacGibbon's matter of public importance. He speaks of the damage inflicted on the tourist industry by the pilots dispute, and obviously none of us can disagree with that. In fact, I would hope to spend some time today outlining just how bad and significant that damage is so that hopefully some of the pilots can begin to consider the consequences of their action. In listening to Senator MacGibbon once again one sees just how pathetic the Opposition is on the question of industrial relations. Its failure in seven years ever to come up with a wages policy has been documented time and time again by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). It is, of course, what so consistently knocks Opposition members out of the political ring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today, again, they demonstrate their complete failure to come to grips with industrial relations. There are a couple of ways to show that failure. I think most devastating for them is the fact that almost 60 per cent less average monthly working days are lost per 1,000 employees under this Government in comparison with its predecessor. That is a quite extraordinary figure, but it should not be surprising because this Government has not simply left employees and employers to sort out the industrial relations situation. In fact, I am surprised every time I hear Opposition spokesmen, including Senator MacGibbon, dare to refer to small business and damage that might be inflicted on it by disputes such as this, because this dispute is being fought under the rules which the Opposition would seek to impose on Australian industrial relations. That, of course, is the fundamental weakness of its position, an extraordinary weakness though it may be. But we see it illustrated perfectly in this dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the situation as it has developed over the last two to three weeks, it began with Senator Chaney taking a very hard line against the pilots. I must say that there were those of us who were encouraged by this beginning. But it did not take long for the Liberal Party in particular-one never worries about the members of the National Party on these things; ignorance is bliss for them, so they remain blinkered-to drift away from Senator Chaney's original hard line stance. It did not take long for succour and comfort to be offered to the pilots. That surprises no one at all on this side of the House. When you have no policy then all you can do is attempt to exploit the dispute for political gain. That is the only effort the Opposition can make on this question. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to agree with the Opposition. If it is about highlighting the damage that this dispute can do, I am all for it. Perhaps there will be some honour, some conscience, amongst pilots, and perhaps they will discover a reason to at least begin a process of sane resolution of disputes. But to simply say that the Government has failed to resolve the situation does not say very much at all. In fact, when I interjected on Senator MacGibbon and asked, `How would you solve it?', he could offer no explanation, no solution, at all. All that Senator Alston who is sitting next to Senator MacGibbon could do-and of course Senator Alston has a bit more to say about these things than Senator MacGibbon-was to offer the truly profound observation, `We would let the airlines talk to the pilots'. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts are, of course, that the airlines attempted to talk to the pilots for months. The difficulty with this group, and in particular with the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, was that it was hell-bent on a 30 per cent increase. It will always be the policy of the Opposition to stand back, to wimp out, to let the pilots win and have their 30 per cent increase. The Opposition experienced this situation and it still defends it. When we go back to 1981 or 1982, the facts were that it laid waste to the economy by stepping out of the ring and allowing employers and employees-as the Opposition says-to sort out their difficulties. The difficulty was that that meant wage rises like 14 per cent-14 per cent right across the economy. One cannot ever quarantine big increases, because of the flow-on. The flow-on went right though the economy two years in a row. It will remain the fundamental flaw in the excuse for a policy that the Opposition offers when it comes to industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> All the Opposition can do is opt out-wimp out-and nothing new is offered by Senator MacGibbon today. That of course, as I said, surprises none of us. But now, with the Opposition's policy in tatters, with this fairyland view of the world that in some way one can quarantine an increase for the pilots, all it can do is highlight the damage and then say that the Government has not resolved the situation. I might say, given that the Opposition believes the Government should not have a role in these things, that it should all be left to the parties, that is pretty surprising. But some assaults are pretty easy for the Opposition and we have seen plenty of them. I would have thought it better to concentrate on some of the positives and there have been plenty of those. At least this Government can say that it has created 1.5 million new jobs since it has been in office, that is five times the rate that the Opposition could ever manage. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to look a little more closely at this claim of the centralised wage fixing system in some way being at fault. I dare say that when one looks at the debate no one will take much notice of Senator MacGibbon. The Australian public never has before and there is no reason for it to change its ways in that respect. A lot of people in Australia do take notice of John Elliott, who is of course the President of the Liberal Party. He had some comments to make today on radio and I think they are worth looking at because, once again, they show the complete inability of the Liberal Party to understand the problem. I quote what he said today:</PARA>
<PARA>And the central wage fixing problem, the central wage fixing system in Australia is, as you can see it, starting to crumble-</PARA>
<PARA>this is not great English, but it is not my English-</PARA>
<PARA>get those increases without an improvement in productivity, then who's going to be next, the air controllers or the baggage people or who and it will flow on around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>At least he got the problem right, in terms of the flow-on, but he does not understand the system as it exists. It has always been the Government's view that if they would simply pay attention to the structural efficiency principle, which of course emphasises productivity, then obviously that would have been the way to settle the dispute. Obviously, it would have been up to the pilots to go to the Industrial Relations Commission, seek negotiations with their employers and to come up with an agreement within the system which could-I am led to believe -have led to a substantial increase. It would have been nothing like 30 per cent, and that is, of course, right and proper. We cannot allow increases of that dimension. Nonetheless, that is what they could have expected had they opted to remain within the system. Instead of that, with this bloody-minded, determined attitude to hang on for a 30 per cent increase, in the end they put themselves outside the system. In spite of the hairy-chested and macho bleatings of some of their officials now, about how united they are, I think we will all see in the coming days that that unity cannot and will not remain. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the actual damage to the tourism industry, I do not want to be as bashful as Senator MacGibbon, because there are some areas of Australia that are suffering very badly indeed. There is no reason why we ought not to make some of those examples public. The Regent Hotel in Sydney is a good example; occupancy rates are down 30 per cent. It is said they are losing some quarter of a million dollars per day in revenue. Three conferences have been cancelled and it anticipates some staff stand-downs in the short term. At the Wrest Point Hotel and Casino in Hobart, occupancy rates are down 66 per cent, half the staff have been stood down, and $150,000 is being lost in revenue each week. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia-wide, the Southern Pacific Hotel Corporation is talking about international cancellations running at 30 per cent and its conference market being down by 50 per cent. If one turns to Queensland, Jupiter's Hotel Casino in Surfers Paradise says that occupancy is down from 70 per cent to 30 per cent. It is the domestic market that is most affected. These are, of course, horrific figures, and they demonstrate starkly just what happens when you have a bloody-minded attitude by the pilots carried on into this appalling strike. </PARA>

Of course, if they are to believe that that travel is not going to be possible, then the calculations will be coming in.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just answered that. Senator Tambling was not listening; that is normal for him. Had he listened he would have been educated. God knows, if there is a senator in this place who needs some education, Senator Tambling is pretty close to being the best. I mentioned Tasmania because obviously, as an island State, it has faced particular difficulties, but remote regions have been looked at as well. As soon as the dispute began the Government made arrangements to look after places like Cocos (Keeling) Island and Christmas Island, where isolation is obviously a bigger problem than practically anywhere else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we get to the actual dispute and we wonder why the airlines or the Government should resist, let us look at the position of pilots. Over the past five years the average salary and related payments for pilots has risen by about 49 per cent while average weekly earnings have gone up 38 per cent. Again, pilots are in front of the game, well and truly. The current wage increase sought by the airline pilots would give them an increase substantially greater than the entire wage of the average Australian. Brian Grey has been looking at a new entrant joining aviation in Australia under the deregulation policy, that is, Compass Airlines. I note his comments. He has suggested that in the United States the pilots' counterparts work about twice the hours. I acknowledge that international comparisons are not always easy and one cannot take too much from them, but as an indication it would certainly suggest that there is room for a very substantial productivity dividend with Australia's pilots. That is what the airlines seek and that is obviously what the Government wants. The Opposition does not have any interest in productivity increases, only an interest in attempting--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator MacGibbon" NAMEID="YH4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Rubbish. Read our policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Everyone would like to read the Opposition's policies but no-one can find them. Whether we are looking at wages policies or tax policies, whatever the major policies are in the economy, we still have not heard from the Opposition. Nonetheless, its current leader has promised some policies this month. The breathless Australian public, that have waited so long, are all looking forward to it. But, of course, we also know that the Opposition has not agreed on it yet. With only a few weeks to go for the scheduled release of the major policies affecting the economy, it still does not have agreement. Opposition senators have the hide to come in here and talk about what should happen with the economy, when they cannot tell anyone in Australia what they would do about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When it comes to hide there is a better example of it than that. That anyone in the Opposition would walk in here and talk about tourism is pretty staggering. When the Hawke Government came to office the allocation for the Australian Tourist Commission under the last Fraser-Howard Budget was a miserable $10m; now, only seven years later, it is $40m. Senator Stone is good at these sorts of calculations. I wonder how many hundred per cent real increase in funds there has been for the Australian Tourist Commission and Australian tourism under the Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We can look at tourism numbers. When Fraser and Howard, the Liberal Party and the National Party, ruled Australia they never discovered tourism. It was not Australia's biggest export earner-nothing like it. It was never spoken about in Parliament; it was never mentioned. It was ignored totally for seven years. The Hawke Government put it on the map. The Hawke Government gave funds to develop tourism, to give it muscle. It made it what it is today. It made sure that around the globe people knew all about our tourism industry and made sure that tourism numbers grew substantially. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon read out some very impressive figures. I am glad he referred to them. For several years we had massive growth rates in Australian tourism. That came about because the Hawke Government gave the Australian Tourist Commission the necessary funds to spend around the world advertising Australia as a tourist destination. That is something the Liberal and National parties never even contemplated in government. There could not be a more staggering admission: an industry, now our biggest export earner, was discovered by Senator MacGibbon only today. It has been ignored totally by members of the Opposition, not just in their seven years in government, but in their seven years in opposition. The Opposition has no record on tourism; Opposition members have no right to speak for the tourism industry. By the way, the whole industry knows that: it does not look to the Opposition for support; it never has and it never will. The industry knows the damage that would be done to it if we gave in to the pilots. The whole of Australia knows just what would happen if we were to be so cowardly as to opt out of the system. Rather than that, we will stay in it; we will maintain it. It has served Australia well, and it will do so again in this particular dispute. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon we are debating the matter of public importance submitted to the Senate for discussion by the coalition Opposition, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The damage inflicted on the tourist industry by the pilots' dispute and the Government's failure to resolve the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be no doubt that the damage to Australia's tourism industry caused by this dispute is immense. There have been a number of reports in the media since the beginning of the dispute. Our tourism industry operates on three levels: the international level, the national level and the local level. Combined, these three levels constitute a tourism industry worth billions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> On 8 May this year Senator Richardson was reported in the West Australian newspaper as having described international tourism as having overtaken coal as Australia's second biggest foreign exchange earner. He said that it had generated a massive $5.2 billion last year and that only wool brought in more foreign exchange earnings. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> ``This confirms tourism's place as one of our major industries'', he said. ``We have only just begun to exploit its potential and already it is making an enormous contribution to our foreign exchange earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> ``Each 20 per cent increase in international tourist expenditure results in a net improvement in Australia's balance of payments of around $235 million. Last year, overseas visitors spent an estimated $1.6 billion on food, drink and accommodation, $800 million on shopping, $320 for domestic air fares and $310 million on train, bus and car transport. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Richardson also said that the visitors also paid about $120m for both organised tours and entertainment, with $280m going to miscellaneous items. As to the costs of this dispute on our industry, we read in the press that the Australian Tourist Commission expects it will result in losses of $600m over four months as overseas bookings slow. Most hotels are down by 60 per cent on their normal rates of occupancy, and several thousand workers in the tourism industry have been stood down. </PARA>
<PARA> In today's Australian Mr John Dart, the chief executive officer of the Australian Federation of Travel Agents, said the dispute was costing travel agents and tour operators around the country $10m a day and that more than 1,000 agency employees have been forced to take leave since the dispute began. Tourism at the national and local level provides income for a large number of people and, when pursued with intelligence and sensitivity, tourism also enhances protection and promotion of our history, the natural beauty of our landscapes and our flora and fauna. We Australians increasingly seek to take our holidays as tourists in our own country. We increasingly spend our hard-earned dollars here in Australia and therefore provide our fellow Australians with jobs. There has been a spin-off on a localised basis. For example, having been grounded in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) this weekend myself, and therefore unable to travel to Western Australia to fulfil electoral and family commitments, I took the opportunity to visit historic Berrima, which is in New South Wales, just some 150 kilometres from Canberra. I found this small town bustling with visitors on Saturday and Sunday and in fact it was impossible to stay overnight in any of the local hotels or motels. The local population, with their New South Wales and ACT numberplates, were certainly very well represented. This sort of picture is reproduced in small historic towns in all of our States-for example, Port Douglas in Queensland, and York, Northam and Toodyay in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> But as Senator Richardson said, although all parts of Australia have suffered from damage to the tourism industry, it is the furthest flung parts which are bleeding the most. For example, one of the commitments which I was unable to undertake this weekend was to assist in the official opening of a new Aboriginal art gallery in Perth. The Creative Native art gallery is a classic example of the sort of damage that is being inflicted on the tourism industry. The number of tourists passing through that gallery is only some 30 per cent of the number that would have been expected at this time. The other problem is that 30 per cent of expected tourists have been spending very little, because as we all know tourists have also been involved in additional expenses caused by the pilots dispute. So there is no doubt at all about the damage inflicted on the tourist industry. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I would briefly like to refer to the point made by Senator MacGibbon and indeed by Senator Richardson, that there are other costs involved for the tourism industry which we also should take into consideration as we debate these matters. In a discussion paper put out in April of this year the Industries Assistance Commission described how tourism also uses resources, land, labour, capital and features of the natural environment, saying that we must also take the cost of the use of these resources into consideration when we look at the costs of tourism and the benefits that tourism brings us. As Senator MacGibbon remarked, the big boom in tourism has been described as finished but what we are looking to is a steady state, a steady as she goes tourism industry that we can all count on. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like at this stage to remind the Senate of two facts of life. One is that airline pilots can command higher salaries in countries other than Australia but greater productivity is for the most part demanded of them in those countries. A second fact of life is that one segment of the community cannot dig its heels in and make outrageous demands without the whole of the community being affected, so this dispute, by definition, affects us all. It affects the tourism industry-the tourism industry is bleeding-but it also affects us all and certainly will affect future wages policies. </PARA>
<PARA> In its motion the coalition Opposition lays the blame squarely on the Government's failure to resolve the situation. The Australian Democrats believe that is a somewhat simplistic analysis. Firstly, in 1987 the coalition Opposition objected strongly to the compliance provisions in the Willis Industrial Relations Bill and in fact effectively forced the Government to pull the Bill off the Notice Paper. Secondly, what we have in action is a preview of the model that would prevail if the coalition Opposition were itself in government. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IH4">Senator JENKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What needs to be realised is that a dispute can end only when relevant parties come to the table to talk. There must be a resolution sooner or later. Neither inflammatory statements by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) nor seeking to make political mileage can resolve this situation. No dispute is resolved other than at the table and once heels are dug in it is very difficult without the assistance of an arbitrator. In fact, how little we have moved forward in industrial relations in some 80 years. I remind the Senate of the play by John Galsworthy called Strife first published in 1909. This play is the archetypal depiction of a strike in which the two protagonists are intransigent. Each brings the other to its knees and of course the real victims are the innocent bystanders. The strike in this play takes place in the Trenartha tin plate works. There are finally no winners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a battle of wills between the chairman of the board, John Anthony, and the leader of the striking workers, David Roberts. In this particular case the workers refused the conditions set by the unions. Finally both were brought to the table. The leader of the workers was finally brought there by his own workers after they had bled and bled. Likewise the chairman of the board was brought there by the shareholders who found themselves in a similar situation, and the final resolution was that the workers accepted the conditions set by the unions in the first place. I hope it will not come to that situation where we have the whole of the country bleeding to such an extent that finally the protagonists are forced to the table with nothing to be gained at the end. But this is the danger when proper negotiations are not followed through, when proper arbitration policies are not followed and are not supported by the Parliament and by the Government. Where we have no collective bargaining then it is very difficult to see when we can come to a result and certainly it appears that no collective bargaining is possible at this stage. The Commission itself has been abandoned; the pilots have resigned. So only individual bargaining is possible, which is, of course, the Opposition's policy. </PARA>
<PARA> We have got division, we have got chaos. In the meantime the tourist industry bleeds which means that all of us bleed. Some of us bleed now, but all of us bleed later if it carries on. We saw in today's newspapers a full page advertisement put out by the Australian Tourism Industry Association Ltd where it sought to prevent any parties to the current pilots dispute taking any action to prolong the dispute, interfere with genuine efforts to resolve it or extend its scope. Certainly those are admirable objectives, and I am sure that everybody here would endorse those objectives. But it is incredible to see how gaoling the pilots could actually achieve that. In fact the situation is very well summed up in a cartoon which appears in today's Australian newspaper. Here we see a jet plane marked `Tourism Industry'. It is on fire; all the engines are on fire; there is nobody in the pilot's seat. We have in the plane Mr Hawke actually throwing the last pilot overboard so that the aeroplane marked `Tourism Industry' is going to do nothing other than crash and save nobody. </PARA>
<PARA> The damage is certainly here for all of us to see. It is estimated that the tourism industry, Australia's largest export earning industry, is losing about $100m a month and that losses could rise to $180m a month by December. Mr Holding, the Minister, has said the strike has been as damaging as, if not more damaging than, a natural disaster. We have a failure to find a resolution to the situation-a failure by the Government, by the pilots and their association, by the airlines, by the Opposition, by this Parliament as a whole. Certainly, as this debate continues the Australian Democrats look forward to further contributions by the coalition Opposition to find out what are its positive suggestions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating a matter of public importance, which is the damage inflicted on the tourist industry by the pilots dispute and the Government's failure to resolve the situation. Earlier today my colleague Senator MacGibbon, who led this debate, recounted the problems which are faced by his constituents in Queensland. I think perhaps, as a representative of the only island State, it might be helpful to the Senate if I outline some of the problems which are being faced by constituents in Tasmania, because the resolution of the pilots dispute is the financial life or death for many Tasmanians. The industrial dispute has affected the majority of Tasmanians. The tourism industry, the seafood industry, the fresh flower industry, the retail industry, right through to butchers, launderers and fishermen, all are affected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me look first of all at tourism. From speeches I have made in this place on a number of occasions, honourable senators would be aware of the fact that my family is involved in the tourist industry and I have a personal interest as a result, and therefore I also have a very great understanding of the problems being faced in that industry because it is very much an industry based on small businesses such as my family's business, a small hotel and restaurant. The other small businesses in Tasmania are suffering, and suffering in great pain. </PARA>
<PARA> Tourism in Tasmania accounts for 9.2 per cent of gross product, which is well above the national figure, which is 6.2 per cent. So, in other words, tourism has a much greater influence on our economy than that of the mainland. Expenditure in Tasmania by interstate and foreign tourists last year was estimated to be $305m. For a State with less than half a million people, that is a great boost to our State's economy. When intra- state tourism is added to this, tourism spending can claim to provide economic activity of $1m a day in Tasmania-and $1m a day has to be very important to our well-being. This Government has been very keen to assure Tasmanians that if they save their wilderness areas, if they lock up their forests, and if they prevent the miners from mining, they will be saved economically by such an influx of foreign tourists. Yet it is this same Government which seems so powerless to act while we are in the middle of a national disaster-the pilots dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> When we talk about foreign tourism and about domestic tourism, it is very important to remember that study of the tourist industry has shown that Australian residents travelling internally in Australia still make up the bulk of tourists and they spend on accommodation, meals, drinks, et cetera, about three times the amount that is spent by overseas visitors to Australia. It is important to remember that point because proportionately we get very few of the overseas visitors that come to Australia, and therefore we are particularly dependent upon the health of the interstate tourist industry. Of course, being an island State, we are more affected by a break in domestic tourism than we are by a break in overseas tourism. At least the overseas carriers can fly in to Hobart, as they can fly into Cairns or Sydney. Maybe the tourists cannot get around within the country, but at least the tourist industry in those destinations has some way of continuing during the strike. What is so very important is the fact that we are almost entirely cut off from domestic tourism during a time like this. What should be realised by mainlanders is that the boat, which is our only other alternative, crosses Bass Strait only three times a week in one direction. Therefore, that gives us very little opportunity to make up for the shortfall caused by the airline dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that the tourist industry is currently losing approximately $350,000 a day which, of course, will increase as we move into the peak season. Because Tasmania is not getting its usual 500 visitors a day at this time, smaller organisations and travel agencies especially are going broke due to the loss of cash flow. I do not think I have to remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that these small businesses are the ones that are in the clutch of the financial institutions to the extent of a 22 to 25 per cent interest rate on their overdraft loans. They do not have much leeway. At the best of times they are struggling to keep their heads above water, thanks to the high interest rate policies of this Government. At a time of crisis like this, that is all that is needed to send them under. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point that should be understood in this debate is that while most visitors coming to Tasmania are holiday-makers, last year 28.7 per cent of visitors were business travellers. Of course, they have had to stop travelling. They do not have compassionate grounds for crossing Bass Strait, so the business travel sector has dried up as well. About 17,000 Tasmanians are employed in tourism in various areas in my State. On Friday the Tasmanian Travel Centre told me that it spoke to 30 tourism organisations. There has been a loss of 610 jobs, and by this week almost 1,000 jobs will have been lost. All over Tasmania a very high proportion of staff is being asked to take compulsory leave or face redundancy. Casuals and part time workers are being put off everywhere. Up to 2,000 Tasmanian workers have been put off work as a result of this dispute. The Tasmanian Visitor Corporation-and here is the irony-wanted to send a delegation of industry leaders to see the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in Canberra, but it cannot get an aircraft to bring its delegation to Canberra to talk to him. It is interesting that Mr Hawke is not prepared to send a plane to pick them up, but he is prepared to send a plane to Hobart to pick up a group of disabled children to send them on a skiing holiday, provided that the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) is shown on television as a quid pro quo. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is absolutely factual. If the Minister does not like the way in which the facts of political life are played out by his Prime Minister, he will just have to learn to live with it. The fact remains that no plane is available to bring industry leaders to Canberra to speak to the Prime Minister, and I presume that Mohammed will not go to the mountain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us talk about hotel accommodation. The Sheraton Hotel in Hobart normally has a occupancy rate of 60 per cent at this time of the year. It is down to 35 per cent, and I would say it is quite lucky to have a rate as high as that at the moment. It has 234 rooms, of which two-thirds are idle. Twenty per cent of the staff are taking forced holidays, and more will be asked to do the same in the next couple of weeks. For the month of October it expects an occupancy rate of 15 per cent, in a month in which the normal occupancy rate is 70 to 80 per cent. The Sheraton Hotel alone will lose $500,000 in revenue if there is no change in the dispute in October. Let me tell honourable senators about a new hotel, the Launceston International Hotel, which opened just over a month ago. It has coped in that short time because it has chartered an aircraft. In the next few weeks it says it will be in trouble because it cannot fill seats for a chartered plane. It estimates that Tasmania will lose $1m a day if this situation continues. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell the Senate about Wrest Point. A travel agents convention next week has been cancelled; Wrest Point has lost $500,000 on what was to have been a national release of a James Bond film, which had to be scaled down to simply a State release; there are 800 staff, of whom 400 are casual and have now almost all been put off and a percentage of the full time staff have now been put on holidays. Wrest Point is down to 20 to 30 per cent occupancy instead of the 70 to 80 per cent which is usual, and only last week 500 room nights were lost. Let us turn to the hire car situation. Hertz Rent a Car estimates that two-thirds of its business has been lost and envisages that Avis and Budget Rent a Car System Pty Ltd are about the same. Hertz is accounting $12,000 to $15,000 a day in lost revenue as a result of the industrial dispute. Mr David Phillips from the Tasmanian Visitor Corporation, which represents 500 tourism operators in the private sector, has indicated that three-quarters of the rental car fleet in Tasmania is now idle as a result of this crippling industrial dispute. It is the long term effects that will be so worrying for most of the rental car agencies. Some have experienced cancellations as far ahead as January next year. People just are not prepared to take the risk with Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> Tasmania suffers on two accounts because of its geographical isolation: it has no surface travel alternatives except for the Abel Tasman which, as I say, operates only three nights a week in each direction; and its economy is geared towards tourism. Tasmania is in a state of absolute crisis. Many businesses in Tasmania are small and are operating on overdrafts and will simply not be able to keep up the payments to their financiers. In the seafood industry the turnover, on which we rely also very heavily, is down by more than half. Many customers on the mainland have gone elsewhere and the seafood industry doubts whether they will return once the dispute is over. The seafood season has just closed and many of the seafood businesses cannot or will not be able to recoup their losses. Most of them will be lucky simply to break even. One company has lost overseas orders and one ongoing order of $10,000 per order. Those customers have gone elsewhere. There are one and a half tonnes of lobsters sitting in the freezers which cannot be sold because they cannot be got to the mainland. The seafood businesses are not buying from the fishermen because they cannot sell the fish. In turn, the fishermen have problems because either they cannot sell their fish or they are not going out to get more fish, which of course affects not only their livelihood but their ability to pay their commitments on their boats. </PARA>
<PARA> The cut flower industry has lost $25,000 in sales on the overseas markets over the next two months. Added to this is the cost associated with selling on mainland markets because the growers have physically to drive flowers from Devonport to Launceston or Hobart daily. There is also an extra cost involved in insulating flower boxes because the flowers cannot arrive as quickly as by plane. This industry is badly affected by the dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of this matter of public importance relates to the Government's failure to resolve the situation. Previous speakers have covered this very thoroughly and I intend to mention it again relatively briefly. The reason we are so particularly concerned about the Government's failure to resolve the dispute is that the Government aggravated the situation in the first place and pushed the parties into their corners. There is no getting away from it: it was the Prime Minister's inflammatory statements which pushed the parties into their corners, which are keeping them apart and which are physically preventing the employers and the employees from talking together. Why will the Government not allow the pilots and their employers to talk? Who is paying for that pig-headedness? It is the little people all over Australia. It is my Tasmanian constituents who are trying to travel-to travel as tourists or as business people, as family members separated by the tyranny of Bass Strait. It is the 91-year-old lady I am trying to help who comes from Tasmania and cannot get back from Brisbane. She is stranded and it is not suitable to put her on a bus at her age. These are the people who are paying for the Prime Minister's pig-headedness. These are the people who will not get any compensation even if it is handed out to the airlines. In fact, if compensation is paid to the airlines it will only prolong the agony for these little people and these little businesses. The Government is in a position to take action. It even had warnings earlier this year from the Industries Assistance Commission as to what should be being done, and I draw attention to the IAC draft report on travel and tourism. I will quote quickly, in the brief time left to me, from that report:</PARA>
<PARA>What is needed in the aviation industry, in the interests of tourism and the economy generally, is effective competition. The regulations governing the Australian aviation industry serve to limit competition and this imposes an unnecessary cost on travellers and other tourism related industries. Maximum efficiency requires . . . fully-integrated domestic and international networks. </PARA>
<PARA>Going on to talk about domestic aviation, the report said:</PARA>
<PARA>The two airlines agreement expires in 1990 . . . but for real reform there must be scope for effective competition. The arrangements act as a significant deterrent to new entrants. Airlines acknowledged that it would be very difficult for a new entrant to get established. </PARA>
<PARA>We need competition in the airline industry; we need the Government to free it up. We in Tasmania certainly require the immediate resumption of normal air services through negotiations, settlement or the provision of at least 1,000 air seats a day each way across Bass Strait. We also need Commonwealth assistance to help the tourist industry recover from this serious and debilitating crisis. Tasmanians are imploring the Prime Minister, the airlines and the pilots to negotiate a resolution to this dispute because the entire Tasmanian economy rests upon it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One has to say, after reading Senator MacGibbon's matter of public importance, that really the Opposition has some gall to talk about the issue of industrial relations. I do not think anyone in the Opposition has made mention of the fact that in the last 6 1/2 years, during the period of office of this Government, industrial disputation in Australia is 60 per cent down on the almost equivalent period of the seven years of the Fraser coalition Government. It really is with some gall that those opposite criticise this Government's industrial relations record. I did not hear all the speeches from Opposition members but one has to say that what they are proposing does not quite clarify how they would proceed in this present dispute. They seem to be, at one level, saying that the pilots are nasty, that they are not thinking of the national good, that they are affecting the economy and particularly that they are affecting the tourist industry. That is obvious; we all agree with that. But then when one tries to find out what they would do to resolve it, the best they can put up is that the Government must do something. But we are not quite sure what that is. When we look at the Opposition's policy we are left with a very strong impression that it has no policy at all. I will return in a moment to the Opposition's policy, the inconsistencies of its industrial relations policy and, in particular, how it would handle a dispute similar to the airlines dispute if it happened to be in office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like briefly to express the view, which I think is overwhelmingly held in the community and is understood in our community, that it is the pilots who have created this dispute. That is without contradiction. Everybody accepts that. They have made the decision to go outside the normal procedures in Australia, procedures established since the early part of this century, for handling industrial relations disputes. They made it quite clear that they had a premeditated plan to bust out of the industrial relations arrangements in this country, saying, `We want 30 per cent or nothing. If we don't get that there'll be nothing in the airline industry'. They have stated their position in such a way that we can almost admire their openness. But now, as Captain McCarthy says, they want to negotiate directly with the airlines. It is a bit late after they have withdrawn themselves from the industrial relations system that has operated in this country so well for so long. </PARA>
<PARA> We must look at the impact on the Australian economy. Senator Newman has outlined the impact on her State of Tasmania, in particular. I do not dispute any of the figures that she put forward. The impact on the tourist industry must be sheeted home to one group of people, and one group only-the airline pilots of Ansett Airlines of Australia, Australian Airlines and a couple of small airlines. The Australian Federation of Air Pilots is directly and absolutely responsible for the present situation. Although Senator Newman outlined the impact on Tasmania, in the parts of her speech that I heard I did not hear her sheet home the responsibility for the effect on her State to where it should be sheeted home-to the pilots. </PARA>
<PARA> My own State of South Australia has been significantly affected. I suspect it has probably not been affected as much as Tasmania because we are able through land communications to have contact with other States. But I am told there are figures from the Tourist Bureau in South Australia that the airline strike may be costing South Australia $2m a day in lost business. I suspect that may well be a conservative figure. I have not figures for the impact on employment in the South Australian tourist industry. I heard last weekend in Adelaide anecdotal information that in the hospitality section of the tourist industry large numbers of people will be laid off over the next week or so if this strike continues. Again, the blame should be sheeted home to the Australian airline pilots. They are responsible for what is happening. So far in their public comments they have not conceded that they are doing enormous damage to the Australian economy-not just to tourism, but also to general passenger and freight transport around this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Not many people in Australia realise how much freight, particularly perishable goods of high value added, is now carried by airlines. Horticultural goods and so on are transported around Australia by air to meet the demands of the market each day in different metropolitan areas. As I understand it, there are real problems now for producers getting their horticultural goods to the market in a fresh and top quality order. So in that area there has been a big impact. </PARA>
<PARA> But overall, in view of the subject of the Opposition's matter of public importance, we have to return to the Opposition's policy and how it would handle this dispute or similar disputes if it were in government. If one looks at the public comments of the parliamentary Leader of the Liberal Party, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Andrew Peacock, one is a little frightened, to say the least, at the confusion in his mind about what is the Opposition's policy. The first thing to which I want to draw the Senate's attention is an interview on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) program AM on 24 August 1989 with Mr Peacock, when in relation to this dispute, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is a classic case where you've got to go beyond the employer/employee fight and look after the national interest, and the Government is correct. </PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition made that statement on 24 August supporting the Government's position in the way it is handling this dispute. Then there was an amazing and lengthy press conference that Mr Peacock gave for the Canberra Press Gallery on 31 August, Thursday of last week, when he was asked questions such as `What is your policy? How would you implement it? How does it differ from the Government's policy?'. To say that we got a confused answer would be kind in the extreme. First of all, in his opening remarks at the press conference on 31 August, only seven days later, and in relation to the remarks that he made on 24 August, he attacked the Government's policy and what the Government is doing when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . every industrial dispute is at some time settled and the aim must always be to get the parties together and talking and the behaviour of the Prime Minister has been counter-productive with that in mind and quite the antithesis of what he would have done if he were the President of the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA>People reading that transcript would see that that is a contradiction of what he said only seven days before on the ABC program AM. Then the questions started coming from the journalists about his policy. In response to one of these questions, early in his press conference, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Well I think the Prime Minister's erratic behaviour is destructive of the best interests of the nation and as to what the motivation is I'm not going to guess at, you'd have to ask him that. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, strong criticism of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Government and in complete contradiction to what he said on 24 August, only seven days earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> The press conference transcript I have goes on for some 19 pages, of which well over two-thirds deals with very patient journalists trying to get from Mr Peacock a definition of what his industrial relations policy is. It deals with such issues as secret ballots. Journalists pointed out that, though it is Opposition policy to have secret ballots, in fact the pilots did have a secret ballot and 95 per cent of them voted to go on strike. There was no real answer from Mr Peacock on how his policy of enforcing secret ballots would overcome the strike situation with the pilots. </PARA>
<PARA> We then turn further through this transcript and on page 10 we have quite a lengthy statement by Mr Peacock, which I think in some ways really sums up the confused nature in his own mind, if not in the minds of the total Opposition, of what its policy is. He was asked questions dealing with whether there should be a productivity basis in reaching wage agreements and what power should be given under the laws of the land to carry out those agreements. This is part of the answer--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Knowles for that interjection and for bringing to our attention a printed document of the Liberal Party which is supposedly its industrial relations policy. I suggest that the honourable senator give it to Mr Andrew Peacock to read and remember because clearly in the press conference he had last Thursday, what he was saying bore no relationship to what must be in that document. I trust the document is not as confused as his remarks in the press conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter of public importance, I say to Senator Newman, deals with the industrial relations situation with the airline pilots strike. I am trying to point out to the honourable senator and to the Senate the madness of the Opposition's own policy and the fact that its leader is very confused on the matter. Before the point of order was taken I was going to quote part of the remarks of Mr Peacock. I will now quote them. In answer to these questions from journalists, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>But the reality is the legislation gives you the power to enter into these voluntary agreements provided the wage increases are offset by increases in productivity. Now what will, in fact, happen, I mean, the real determinant is not whether someone will state a case and seek to argue that they have some right under the legislation. You know what'll happen, the company will go broke. That company will go broke if it enters into some wage arrangement that is not offset by productivity and that's its decision. I mean, if it wants to commit economic suicide, I mean, the real constraint is not some party seeking to go before the Commission, albeit that others could, albeit that others could. I mean, you can always seek to, some form of locus standi. Whether the Commission or a court will give it to you, whether you designate people to have that right, at the end of the day, the real constraint on the company that enters into some arrangement that is not offset by productivity is that it walks over the cliff. </PARA>
<PARA>I have read that several times. I even had difficulty reading it clearly here in the Senate because it is so convoluted and confused about what he is trying to explain as the industrial relations policy for the Opposition. But the last two quotes I want to mention from this famous press conference indicate that within the same press conference he completely contradicted himself. According to page 11 of the transcript, as a response to the question about sanctions, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>No, I wouldn't be imposing sanctions. I give people the right to go before the Commission or a court and argue. This is a right, this is a wrong, if they can establish their locus standi. But the reality is the real constraint on them is the economy itself and at root the market. </PARA>
<PARA>So here it is, clearly stated: he would not be supporting imposing sanctions. Then we get towards the end of the press conference, which is reported on page 19 of the press conference transcript, and again journalists are still trying to get from him an explanation of his policy. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>To settle that dispute today operating in the system that belongs to the Government I have said to you there should be a sanctions power. </PARA>
<PARA>Within the same press conference, within 10 minutes, one moment he says there are to be sanctions and other moment there are not to be sanctions. I believe that this transcript, this explanation by Mr Peacock last week, really exposes the Opposition to having no industrial relations policy other than confusion. I believe that the Government is to be commended for the strength of purpose it has shown in handling this dispute. I think the only sensible thing Mr Peacock has said was 24 August, his declaration of support for the Government in this dispute. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator MacGibbon's matter of public importance that has been raised today deals specifically with the damage inflicted on the tourist industry by the pilots dispute and the Government's failure to resolve the situation. As Senator Knowles just pointed out, it is incumbent to point out, despite what Senator Schacht has been saying, that the Liberal-National parties have a most effective industrial relations policy that has been made public. Also, Senator Chaney has, for the last two Thursdays in this place, had an industrial Bill before this Senate for consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us be clear who is responsible for continuing this current airline strike: it is Bob Hawke. The Prime Minister is guilty of plunging the country into chaos and havoc. It is the actions of the Prime Minister that are causing unprecedented financial catastrophes, commercial disruption to the nation, heartache and heartbreak to millions of Australians and to thousands of visitors. And importantly, it is the Prime Minister that has been destroying the infrastructure of tourism, one of our largest industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us remind ourselves that during the financial year 1988-89, the foreign exchange from tourism reached $6.5 billion, and tourism was employing 450,000 people, or 6 per cent of the work force. In its current economic situation Australia cannot afford to put one of its leading industries in jeopardy because of the incompetence of the Prime Minister. The Government should do more to resolve the situation, with communications between all parties involved in dispute. We need to remind Mr Hawke not to talk only to his friends and his mates, that there are other people that are very crucially affected by this. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Northern Territory we are losing $400,000 a day, and if this continues it will complicate and compound to $700,000 a day as the crippling dispute continues to ground domestic flights around Australia. In the Northern Territory tourism is the second largest industry, with expenditure of $398m in 1987-88. Forty-nine per cent of visitors travelling into and out of the Northern Territory, to places such as Kakadu, to Uluru- Ayers Rock, to Lichfield Park and Katherine Gorge, with which so many people are familiar, depend on air traffic in and out. We certainly feel the impact in other important tourist destinations, places such as Cairns, Broome and Tasmania. The Northern Territory last financial year had 886,000 tourists. There should be 25,000 tourists a week there at the moment. These are the matters Bob Hawke should be addressing. In the Northern Territory employment in the tourist industry stands at 10,000 people. What is Bob Hawke saying to these people? The remoteness of the Northern Territory means that people working in the tourism industry cannot afford to lose regular air services. The Hawke Labor Government is abandoning conciliation and consultation in favour of confrontation. It was interesting to read the editorial in the Australian on 29 August. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> The ACTU has assented to the use of law suits in civil courts to bring striking workers into line, a course of action it has vehemently opposed in the past. It has raised no objection to the Australian military and imported foreign workers being used to confront strikers. It is clear that in a matter of days we have seen an industrial world turned upside down. </PARA>
<PARA>Turned upside down by whom? By, of all people, the Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke. The Opposition does not support the extravagance of the pilots' 30 per cent claim or the disruption to travellers in the tourism industry. But-and a big but-what has the Prime Minister done about it? He is conveniently impotent, searching for a reverse vasectomy. The Prime Minister cuddles up to his old mates, Sir Peter Abeles and the airlines, and Bill Kelty the union heavy. Why? Because of the deals over the two-airlines agreement and the hopelessly failed industrial accord. After six years of Labor, the country is struggling with a $108 billion foreign debt. Bob Hawke is losing more face over this issue. He is typically--</PARA>

Let us consider the comments today of the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, Mr Clyde Holding, as reported in the Australian. He said that he would ask the Cabinet to consider compensation for the tourism industry. He argued that the Government could not justify considering compensation for the airlines and not compensate the `real' or `more innocent' victims in the tourism industry. The article goes on:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> `The airlines wrote to the Government . . . asking for compensation of . . . $20m a week, but . . . It is estimated that the tourism industry, Australia's largest export industry, as losing about $100m a month and that losses would rise to $180m a month by December. </PARA>
<PARA> The strike had been `as damaging, if not more damaging, than a natural disaster', Mr Holding said. </PARA>
<PARA>When we have a gambling Prime Minister it is the Australian nation that suffers the consequences, and the nation cannot go to Gamblers Anonymous. The clear message to resolve the dispute is negotiate, negotiate, negotiate, and this is what the Prime Minister is frustrating. The Hawke Government is not facilitating negotiations. The Hawke Government is covertly assisting only the airlines. </PARA>

Obviously even Mr Snowdon cannot get the message through to Mr Hawke. Mr Snowdon said that 300 people in Alice Springs alone would have to apply for social security benefits as tourism operators were forced to lay off staff. Even the Labor mate of Mr Hawke cannot get the message through.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We heard today from the Minister, Senator Richardson, the senior tourism Minister in this place, about the issue. His contribution was both irrelevant and apologetic. What did he talk about? The defence planes for places like the Hamilton Island resort on junket deals. Senator Richardson went out on a limb by saying he wished he could find a principle. If he could just find another principle it would be the second one he has ever found. That is, he should resign as the tourism Minister in disgust with the Prime Minister. Senator Schacht was boring; he droned on and merely sought to bring out `half-true' facts. Senator Knowles quite rightly pointed out that the Liberal-National Party coalition does have a policy. Senator Chaney has been in this chamber for the last two Thursdays debating an industrial relations Bill that the Prime Minister and the Government have not been prepared to pick up. The Opposition is not lacking in making a contribution and wanting to get involved. Very obviously Senator Schacht is ignorant of what happens in the Parliament and in the broader community. </PARA>
<PARA> Back to the Northern Territory: we need to be reminded that where there is a grounding of domestic flights there will be visitors stranded thousands of miles from home and the local tourism industry is thrown into chaos. If there is an 80 per cent drop in domestic flights, and that is highly likely at the moment, we need to be reminded that expenditure will drop by $250m per month. Overseas operators are warning travellers to stay clear of Australia until the dispute is over and if there is a 30 per cent drop in overseas tours, which is likely to be the drop in September, then the loss will be $100m in foreign earnings. How do we pick that up? How do we turn around that type of major loss? Only the Prime Minister can solve the problem by getting people to the negotiating table. It is the Prime Minister's responsibility to get everybody back and talking. </PARA>
<PARA> The time has come for a change after seven years of a Hawke Government which cannot face reality. We cannot afford any longer to go on gambling with Australians. The message comes through very clearly. It is a matter of negotiating, negotiating, negotiating an agreement, and until the Prime Minister faces up and accepts his responsibility in that regard there will not be a solution and it will be the Australian public that will suffer as a consequence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to discuss the matter of public importance brought forward by the Opposition. There is no doubt that we do agree on one thing: the strike has been particularly damaging to the tourism industry, which is being brought to its knees-as is this nation, to a large extent-by the action of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. I do not intend to respond to some of the personal attacks that Senator Tambling made on both the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and me. His speech indicates exactly where we differ on how to resolve this issue. His criticism, of course, was about the way in which the Government has handled this strike. The Australian people do not seem to believe that the Government is wrong in the way in which it is handling this strike. I will read to the Senate a report which came to me a few minutes ago of a telephone poll conducted by the reputable organisation, AGB McNair, which polled 1,300 people in the five mainland States over the weekend about the way in which this Government had been conducting itself during the strike, and had been handling issues related to the strike. The document reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Federal Government has won strong public backing in every aspect of its handling of the domestic airline pilots row, according to a survey released today. An overwhelming majority of people condemned the action taken by pilots, backed the Government and airlines in refusing the demands, and supported the use of the RAAF and international airlines. </PARA>
<PARA>The figures, first released today; were commissioned by the Nine Network Pty Ltd. The poll found that 61 per cent of those interviewed backed the decision by the Government and the airlines to refuse the pilots' demand for a 30 per cent pay increase. Only 27 per cent disagreed. Sixty-eight per cent of those polled disagreed with the pilots' action, while only 10 per cent agreed. The Government's decision to call in the Royal Australian Air Force and international carriers won even stronger support. Eighty-four per cent agreed with calling in the RAAF and 10 per cent disagreed. Eighty per cent agreed with allowing international airlines to carry domestic passengers, and only 12 per cent disagreed. The point made very clear by that poll is that the Australian people are backing the Government to the hilt on its stand on this issue, that the tough stand that has been taken by the Prime Minister and this Government in relation to forcing the Air Pilots Federation back into proper wage negotiations is backed by the Australian public. Therefore, this Government comes into this chamber without any doubts as to where it should be going, but we do have doubts about the approach taken by the Opposition. It is a great shame that, in a moment when this nation needs a Parliament that is solidly behind the proper wage fixing principles and solidly behind doing the right thing in the wage fixing area, we should have to debate this issue raised by the Liberals today. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that the question of the accord has been raised on a number of occasions during this debate. The Liberal Party hates the accord. It hates the accord for one reason, and one reason only-because it is a success. It has enabled the Government, through agreement between employers and employees in this country, to reduce real wages to make Australia competitive and trade off better social service benefits such as the tax-free family allowance supplement, to lift employment by more than one million jobs primarily in the private sector and to reduce strikes to 60 per cent of the level which applied when the Liberals were in office. The improvement has been dramatic. It is a commentary that has been made on this Government's handling of industrial relations over the last five or six years by all informed commentators. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at this dispute. We have an elite group of people bringing this nation and this nation's tourist industry to its knees. Who are they backed by? By the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party is backing an elite group. What is their employment situations? Let us look at them in comparison with the situation overseas. They are not struggling workers. These people are in a position of privilege, and yet being in a position of privilege has not in any way diminished their greed. We are now looking at nearly 30 per cent in terms of their wage application. They are going outside the system to get what they want and using any means that they have at their disposal; not caring whether or not they bring this nation to its knees. Let us look at what they already have, never mind the 30 per cent increase they are seeking in the next few months. They have their seniority system. Where else do they have a system that allows senior officers to pick and choose from the roster as to whether or not they will fly certain routes and in fact whether or not they will fly at all? A senior captain, for example, can pick a stand-by roster which means that he gets paid even if he does not fly. It is not much fun for some of the junior pilots but the senior officers, who are remunerated close to $130,000 a year, are able to pick and choose not to fly and still be paid for it. They can pick, for example, the easier routes-Sydney to Melbourne, say-and be home at night. They can choose where they want to live and the airlines will bring them to their work. They can command salaries of up to $130,000 a year. They work 80 to 85 hours a month-that is, 20 hours a week total duty. Who else in this country has that sort of working arrangement? Thirty-two hours a month is spent at the stick, that is, flying-eight hours a week. They are able to stay, under their award conditions, at five star hotels and they are entitled to and use limousine transport. These are just some of the little extras on top of those conditions. Do not take my word for it. Let us have a look, for example, at a memorandum sent out by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots from Captain B. A. Fitzsimmons to all Ansett Transport Industries Ltd pilots. I will quote from this document which was sent to them:</PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, there is nothing wrong with the 1988 ATI agreement. It is an excellent document that contains and maintains some of the best working conditions in the world of aviation and allows pilots to increase their pay without downgrading promotional opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA>He said further:</PARA>
<PARA>You are the only bid system pilots in the world who have a block guarantee of pay. In all other bid systems if pilots lose flying, that is cancellation or substitution and so on they also lose pay. The pilot then must chose flying for the rest of the month via a make-up book. Many pilots in the United States end up with a quarantine minimum of 65 hours. How long is it since ATI pilots in Australia have had the same problem?' In Europe the pilots work to rosters. This guarantees pay but attracts no penalties for changes to the roster at any time. </PARA>
<PARA>We can go on through any number of pages here in which Captain Fitzsimmons explains completely and very clearly exactly what conditions these elite pilots have in this country, enjoyed nowhere else in the world. So what happens? They take on the airline industry. In fact they take on the tourist industry in search of another 30 per cent on top of those wonderful conditions. What happens in this Parliament? When this Parliament needs every person in it to stand up and be counted on this issue, we have the Liberal Party in bed with the pilots-a most immoral situation. When people need a parliament to stand up and be counted, the Liberals are nowhere to be seen. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned before that 32 hours a month is all that the pilots in this country spend at the stick. In the United States, as a minimum they are expected to fly 50 hours per month, which is nearly a doubling of that which is required under the current situation or employment conditions enjoyed by the pilots in this country. So they have it made. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the way the pilots have negotiated. They have gone to the airlines. They have run rolling strikes. They have worked on a nine to five campaign. They have withdrawn from the industrial relations system. They have had their awards cancelled. </PARA>

By being so wimpy and weak about the way they should be approaching them, the Liberals are supporting them. I do not retract from that at all. So, what happens? The pilots ultimately resign, on AFAP letterhead, which is presented in Melbourne in such a way that one can only come to the conclusion that that letterhead, that resignation, was circulated prior to any individual decision being made by those pilots. In other words, the pilots had already pre-dated their resignations, and that was another part of strangling the Australian economy. It was a carefully calculated attack on the Australian economy and those people who were left stranded, tourists and other people in this country. The pilots planned this more than seven months ago. In a circular sent out by the pilots called `Deadline 89, Issue No. 3' four pages of advice is given to the pilots, indicating to them that a big industrial dispute is on the way. Seven months or so ago this was circulated. It explains how to reduce expenditure. It gives details about the way the pilots should rearrange their personal financial arrangements. It talks about avoiding major expenditure items which are desirable but not essential-I presume that means that they should buy a Holden rather than a Porche. It says, `Be prepared to adjust your lifestyle in the period leading up to and during the NIP', as it calls it-that is, the `no income' period. It even has a nice little cosy phrase to describe the way it strangles this economy: `Be prepared to adjust your lifestyle in the period leading up to and during the NIP', says the circular-`e.g. Eating at home is cheaper than eating out'. In other words, a few of these high flying elite groups must be told that somehow or other one does not eat at restaurants all the time; it is actually cheaper to eat at home. I could go on through a number of items here which clearly indicate that this has been in the planning for a long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not the case of a small union picked on by the Government, picked on by the employers, which downed tools and said, `We are not getting justice'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had debate this afternoon on the appalling effects of the pilots dispute and the airline industry but more particularly its appalling effects on the tourism industry and the industries affiliated with the tourism industry. Let us be quite clear. This dispute is badly affecting the airline industry, but the economic effects of this dispute on the airline industry are as nothing compared with its economic effects on the tourism industry. The effects on the tourism industry will bring this country to its knees in a way which no impact on the airline industry will ever do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us be quite clear. The Opposition is not supporting the pilots claim for a wage rise of 30 per cent. The Opposition is not supporting the disruption to the affairs of the travelling public. The Opposition is not supporting the effects of that upon the tourism industry. What the Opposition is supporting is the view that those responsible for this situation are principally the Government, and in particular the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) of this country. If I have to mention two other gentlemen who might be said to be his collaborators in this matter, they are, respectively, Mr Bill Kelty, the Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), and Sir Peter Abeles, the head of the Ansett organisation. Mr Hawke, in support of his friend and little mate, Bill Kelty, has brought to bear the full weight of the Commonwealth, the full weight of the Industrial Relations Commission, and the full weight of the Commonwealth purse, covertly promised to Ansett Airlines, in support of keeping the airlines from negotiating with the pilots. As long as that continues, so will the tourist industry of this country be further damaged. </PARA>
<PARA> We are familiar in this place with the view being put to us by the Government that we should at all times pay attention to what the Government, with its ACTU background, calls `industrial relations realities'. Let me tell the Government that one of the industrial relations realities confronting this country at present is that there is a very strong association of pilots determined, rightly or wrongly, to get, if not their way, a big part of their way, in this matter. The Government's only response is to say, `On no account are Ansett Airlines and Australian Airlines to negotiate with these fellows'. Does that connote industrial relations reality? Is the whole of the tourism industry in this country to be sacrificed to the overwhelming vanity of this Prime Minister of ours?</PARA>

<PARA> At the moment the pilots wish to talk to their employers. In the end we know that that is the only way in which this dispute can be settled; it always is. Yet the Government will not let the airlines negotiate. What is more, the Government is covertly entering into understandings with the airlines that they will be provided with financial support to pick up the losses they are making by refusing to negotiate. Were it not for that understanding being given to Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines-the latter, of course, the government airline, anyway-they would have to go back to the negotiating table, which is where they ought to be. That is where the agreement which will eventually have to be hammered out would be hammered out. Do we have to go through another week, another month, another two months of this?</PARA>

That is the great contribution which the accord has made to this country, and that is what the Prime Minister is now attempting desperately to prop up in defence of his friend Bill Kelty. Because of that, not only do we have this tremendous disruption to the travelling public of this country, but also-and this is the subject of this debate-the tourism industry of this country is going down in flames. The effect, particularly on the international segment of our tourist industry not just now, not just until whenever it is that this dispute is finally settled, will last for years.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy President, for some reason or other Senator Tate seems to think we only call quorums when someone in particular is not here. There were not enough people in the Senate, hence a quorum was called. The Government has responded to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs report. The Senate gave the terms of reference to the Committee in September 1983 and it was not until December 1988, following two elections, that this Committee finally reported. The Government has now responded to that report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's response to this report is really a rewrite of the Budget Speech of the Treasurer (Mr Keating). I was rather surprised to see that the opening paragraphs had nothing to do with the report but indeed were just telling us how much the Government had done for pensioners in this latest Budget and what good fellows they were as regards the action that the Government proposed to take. The Government put it very clearly that not now, but soon, the pensioners would get $2 a week increase over and above the normal consumer price index increases-$2 a week, not now, as I say, but in April next year. It was telling the pensioners that that was quite a considerable increase for them and what good fellows Government members were. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government then went on to say that by 1995, if you please, pensioners will not have to pay tax. What it did not say is that Budget Paper No. 1 points out that in 1988-89 the Government took $7m in tax from superannuation, but it also points out that the Government expects this next financial year-that is, financial year 1989-90-to be taking $885m in tax. There is a fair bit of difference between $7m last year and $885m this year and it does not take a great deal of thought to work out that if the Government is ripping off about $880m extra this year, the pensioners and indeed all superannuants will be down by that particular amount. It is an incredible amount and I think that it must be pointed out to all those on superannuation that the Government in its recent legislation has indeed made big money grabs in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, the Government has not pointed out in its response that while it is prepared to give pensioners $2 a week in 1990, it is willing to give members of the House of Representatives a 240 per cent increase in their stamp allowance. What it has done is give $21,525 extra a year-that is more than the average pensioner would ever dream of having-just to spend on stamps. That of course is going to be indexed and now represents $32,090 per annum with the new increase from 1 September when the stamps went up to 41c. It is absolutely hypocritical of the Government to say to pensioners. `We will be giving you an extra $2 a week and by 1995 you won't have to pay tax, but in the meantime we will backdate to last July an additional $21,525 for the members of the House of Representatives'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly I want to congratulate the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs for the report which, of course, was brought down some months ago, and to note that the Government's response has not been entirely adequate in the points that were made in the course of that report having been tabled. Secondly, though, I must point out that that report came into existence after five years of inquiry by that Senate Committee. I think it behoves this Government to see that its response to that very long and very important report should not appear as one of the papers lodged by the Government in the ordinary list that comes down each day. Rather we should have seen a full inquiry report given to the Senate in the form of a proper response, read out by the Minister in this chamber, so that all could take part in this debate in a proper way. To respond to the points in the report in the space of a mere five minutes does not do justice to the system and does not pay due regard to the proper parliamentary role of senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, the important point is surely this: this response is another part of the long, sorry saga of the dealings of the Hawke-Keating Government with the superannuants and pensioners of this country since it came to power in 1983. As well, we remember the promise given during the period before 1983 when the Government, then the Opposition, said, `Of course we would not introduce any assets test. We would not tax superannuation', but of course as soon as it was elected it then set about doing all those things, plus a lot more. But the thing that stood out in the course of the period when we saw the introduction of the superannuation tax in 1983 and the various changes to pensions, including the assets test in 1983, was simply that the Government had no comprehensive policy whatsoever for dealing with retirement incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> It was that which in 1983 caused the Senate, forced by this Opposition, together with the Australian Democrats, to set up this very inquiry which is the subject of this report. It was that Committee which sat down over that long period and has brought down what I believe to be a most comprehensive plan, subject to some problems some Opposition senators would have with some details of it. That report does indeed, I believe, bring down the first most comprehensive report for a policy that this country has ever seen. Of course other things have occurred as well. The Government introduced its infamous changes last year on superannuation taxes which, as my colleague Senator Walters, pointed out very eloquently, in a full year, rips, eventually, $1.5 billion out of the taxpayers' superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA> That means that eventually superannuants will suffer because those taxes will be paid in advance. The Government said in introducing that legislation that no superannuant would lose one cent of his superannuation as a result of that tax. Of course, that is a nonsense. Everybody knows that superannuants will miss out on superannuation benefits as a result of those taxes being brought forward. What was the point of that exercise? It was merely to make Mr Keating's Budget in 1988-89 look particularly good. Of course, that will continue during the forthcoming years. What this Government stands condemned for by virtue of its response to this report is that it continues to overtax people in this country and, more particularly, to tax the savings of those who are trying their utmost to look after themselves in retirement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, I wish to speak briefly to this Government response to the report of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs. My Opposition colleagues made a couple of remarks that I thought were worthy of my repairing to the Senate to address. Senator Walters seemed to be outraged that a large part of the Government's response is actually in this year's Budget Papers. One should give congratulations to a government that not only adopted the recommendations of a committee but incorporated a number of them in its Budget on behalf of the current and future retirees of this country. Those of us who sat for five years on that Committee know full well just how complex and comprehensive the inquiry was. Senator Messner seemed not to tell us exactly how this inquiry got started in the first place. The Australian Democrats wanted a royal commission and the Opposition wanted anything except our assets test, so the two combined devilishly to give a term of reference to the Senate Committee. Senator Messner stuck it out for most of the time but not to the end.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is not a bad report at all. The inquiry involved a thorough look at the needs of people under the age pension and superannuation schemes and, importantly, how the two together could best help people during their working life to plan for retirement and then be able to enjoy the benefits of retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> If the worst criticism is that many of those recommendations have been taken up by the Government and incorporated in this year's Budget, I would have to say, `What better commendation to an inquiry than that?'. I think, too, that the Government's response in this year's Budget does take account of the very important point made in the inquiry that a superannuation system and an age pension system often working at odds with each other is, at the least, insufficient and, at the worst, positively destructive in helping people to plan for sensible retirement and being able to expect a reasonable income in their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, since it came into office in 1983, has done a considerable amount to improve the age pension scheme, notwithstanding the comments of my colleagues opposite which are just incorrect. The pension system has been significantly altered. There has been an increase in real terms. The proposals under this Budget will see, over the next few years, a further absolute increase in the pension and, of course, a different tax treatment of allowed earnings, so that, for the majority of pensioners whose income is nothing but the pension, there will be a further increase. I am sure that these are the sorts of things on which the Opposition and the Government are at one, that is, that we hope that people in this country can enjoy at least a regular and guaranteed, if modest, income, so that they can expect not to live as paupers once they retire from the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of us on the Committee were very concerned for those people, very often women, who have had either little or no time in the work force, as may be the case for many people approaching retirement now. We should appreciate as a government, as a community and as a parliament that they largely can expect the pension and nothing but the pension. In only rare cases have they had opportunity to make use of the superannuation system and they do not enjoy the tax benefits of people who have been encouraged to save under the superannuation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's response in the Budget and in this document should be encouraging to the people who bother to sit on Senate committees, very thoroughly examine the issues and write reports, as this Committee did. It was a very long and protracted examination of retirement income, and I think that the recommendations of the Committee, taken up as they are by government in this report and in the Budget, are excellent recommendations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to this response of the Government to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, with the memory of the debate which raged when the superannuation taxation legislation came before this chamber in the last session. I think it is well to remind the Senate how it was the complicity of the Democrats and the Government together which managed to use superannuation as a rip-off of $1.4 billion by way of taxpayers' money, supposedly in the light of saying that it would ultimately be for the benefit of superannuees. I think it is important to remember that the Opposition parties attempted to get rid of an iniquitous tax of 15 per cent; that the Democrats originally supported us; that the Democrats then went to water, ostensibly saying that they would be satisfied by a Government amendment which would give to trustees of existing trust deeds the power to change retrospectively those trust deeds to allow a certain group of people who had invested in approved deposit funds to get the benefit of that 15 per cent excised tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reality of what the Government did and what the Democrats feigned to be satisfied with was this: they brought in a provision that said that only those funds can take advantage of the dropping of the 15 per cent tax that can satisfy the Commissioner for Insurance and Superannuation that only eligible depositors would receive the benefit of that 15 per cent tax. What that did, of course, was simply reduce the number of people who would be eligible. Those people who were in a fund which was mixed, where approved depositors could not be delineated, simply were not entitled to the relief. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this Government has shown itself to be an absolutely cynical Government and has used superannuation as a milch cow for raising taxation. We saw it in that package of Bills which were a result of the statement brought in so many months previously and we have seen another attack on superannuation in this current Budget. I think it is important that the Government's cynicism and the complicity of the Democrats in that cynicism be recognised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to talk briefly on this response of the Government to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs entitled Income Support for the Retired and the Aged: An Agenda for Reform. It is rather sad that the Government has only recently suddenly found the aged. This Government has an appalling record of treatment of the aged, and for evidence of that one has to look only at the cynical way in which it is now treating the aged in looking toward the next election. The Government really needs to look far more sympathetically at the plight of the aged and the way in which their planning for retirement and their existence in retirement has to take shape. Everyone in the community but particularly the aged, who are on very limited incomes in many cases, has to cope with the rate of inflation, increased costs of pharmaceuticals, waiting lists in public hospitals. The aged are now forced to pay increased amounts for stamps, one of their major forms of communication, and telephone costs are huge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many of these areas have not been addressed in this reponse. The most cynical response of the lot was of course contained in the Budget, where the Government saw fit to increase the pension by $2 a week. Of course, it is not going to do that until April next year. One may well ask: When will the election be held-in May next year? It is quite clearly just a carrot for the pensioners, to try to woo their votes. It would be rather nice if the Government looked more sympathetically at some of the other areas which could be of true assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been an increasing time lag in the actual payment of pension increases. Admittedly, the Government's response to this report has been that it will reduce that time lag of 12 weeks. Of course, that will not be done completely until September 1990. If the Government were really determined to try to help pensioners, it would be looking at reducing that time lag that it has increased, far sooner than September next year. Also, when the Government looks at the effect of the assets test and many other measures that it has taken, it will see that many more pensioners are in dire financial straits than there were some years ago. For a government that claims to look after people on welfare, it has not been doing a particularly good job as far as pensioners are concerned. The whole area of retirement incomes and income support for the retired needs to be looked at very seriously by this Government and not just in a way that is designed to win votes, whenever the next election is to be held. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is committed to trying to provide a good quality of life for those who are retired, and trying to encourage those who are approaching retirement-and that means many young people as well-to provide for their retirement now and not depend on government upon their retirement. There is a big difference. Unfortunately, this Government has created a social welfare mentality whereby there is no point in providing for one's retirement because the Government will look after one. If there is one thing that we have to do in this country it is to try to rid people of this mentality, `The Government should provide, why doesn't the Government do this, and why doesn't the Government do that?'. When those who are in real need do need money and support, they should not be restricted or patronised in the way in which this Government has done in announcing the $2 a week increase in April 1990. As my colleague Senator Walters has clearly said, the Government has not blinked an eyelid at increasing its own funding to retain marginal seats at the next election, but it does blink at providing increases to pensioners who desperately need the money. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The death of anyone in custody is a tragedy and there have been far too many deaths of Aboriginal persons. This report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody is a very welcome one, but it raises the wider issue of deaths in custody generally. I wish to spend a few moments reiterating some matters which were raised in the Senate by Senator Jenkins some months ago about some recent unsavoury events which have left a bad taste and which represent unfinished business as far as some of us are concerned. I refer to some deaths in custody about which some questions remain as to whether there was due process and a proper duty of care exercised. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators that the first was the death of Daniel Victor Taylor, who died while in prison and was found at autopsy to have an acute necrotising fungal meningo-encephalitis. That may or may not have been treatable. The point is that it was missed when it should have been detected, and this man died. For those who wish to read the account of the coroner's inquiry, the impression arises that the events which occurred for that prisoner, in that prison system, with that illness, were unsatisfactory. Another unsatisfactory matter about that case was that it was revealed at the coroner's inquiry that this particular prisoner had been receiving methadone-I take it he must have had a heroin addiction-and that at or about the time he became ill his methadone was reduced, not because he no longer needed it but as a control mechanism, as a punishment in fact, for certain behaviour he had exhibited in the prison. As a result of that, it was assumed that the symptoms he then developed, which proved to be his terminal illness, were in fact the symptoms of opiate withdrawal-an unavoidable and a quite tragic occurrence. </PARA>
<PARA> The second case I wish to mention to the Senate was the case of Nicholas Searcy. This was raised with me by a member of Senator Jenkins's staff who was, in fact, the mother of this young man. I think Senator Jenkins referred to that case, inter alia, in the speech she gave on the adjournment one night. Jennifer Searcy is properly grieving and properly angry about what happened to her son. This was a real tragedy. This was a Jamie Partlic type of story. This young man was a brilliant student, who was committed to the prison for 17 days for a minor infraction. While in prison he developed an illness and died from it. I believe it was another case of encephalitis. Again, not only was there some delay in making a diagnosis, not only was there a delay in instituting proper treatment, but during the time of treatment there was some behaviour which attracted much criticism. I believe this young man was chained to his hospital bed. This was a death in custody with some very unsavoury elements to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The third case was that of Malcolm Hatch, who died of meningitis after he had been transferred from Cessnock Prison to the prison hospital at Prince Henry. He died there on 18 July 1988. The fourth, of course, is the case of Jamie Partlic. We know that he did not die, but he has been severely brain injured during a very brief time in hospital; he was a fine defaulter. What should have been a few days in prison has ended up as a life sentence, because he will never recover. </PARA>
<PARA> I know the prison medical service in New South Wales, and I know and like the director of the prison medical service. I know they wish to care for prisoners who come under their care. But the population with which they deal is not representative of the community at large. It is more prone to illness; it is more prone, obviously, to some of these illnesses; and it is quite apparent from these cases-quite apart from the cases of Aboriginals who have died in custody-that people with serious illnesses were not picked up as early as they should have been. There is more illness in prisons, there are more problems. There is a duty of care which falls on the authority which I do not believe is being discharged properly in the States of Australia, and I consider that we have a real problem requiring community attention in the years to come. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The papers tabled by the Minister, although helpful to the Committee, are relevant only in so far as they are relevant to the matter before the Chair at the moment. The Committee is considering the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill to which Senator Peter Baume has moved, on behalf of the Opposition, amendments Nos 2 to 10. The question is that amendments Nos 2 to 10 be agreed to.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, it is slightly difficult because the Committee adjourned, with the effluxion of time, on Friday at which stage I had started to explain the reasoning behind the Opposition's promotion of this group of amendments. I had not finished that task. I suppose that it is neither helpful nor fair for me to go back over all that territory and I will not do that. But I indicate to honourable senators and to the Committee that the argument which is contained from page 802 to page 806 of last Friday's Hansard sets out the opening arguments which I used to explain some of the amendments which the Opposition is proposing in this group 2 of amendments. I had got to the point, Mr Chairman, of discussing our proposed amendment to paragraph 7 (h), which gives a function to the Commission to take such reasonable action as it thinks necessary to protect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural material and information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I had indicated at that stage that the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies had itself expressed some concern about this clause. I refer members of the Committee to the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs:</PARA>
<PARA>In evidence to the Committee the AIAS-</PARA>
<PARA>that is the Institute-</PARA>
<PARA>expressed further anxiety about the implications of sub-clauses 7 (g) and (h) of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The Institute is concerned that these clauses could interfere with the confidentiality of research, and other material in their custody. Any such possibility would also adversely affect future acquisitions of material. </PARA>
<PARA>I cannot overemphasise the concerns we have about that part of the unanimous report of the Senate Select Committee. Many of us have served on the Council of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, as it presently is. I think it is fair to say that many of the researchers in this country have trusted the Institute as being an appropriate repository for what is quite sensitive information. If they were concerned at all about its security and if they believed that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) could have a role to intervene in the security of what is sensitive cultural material, many of them would simply walk away. They would cease doing the work and they would certainly stop using the Institute as an appropriate repository. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister will recall that we sought and obtained an appropriate amendment when the Institute Bill was considered in committee a few days ago. We are now asking that clause 7 (1) (h) of this Bill be amended appropriately to obviate the danger about which we are concerned. What we propose to do simply is to leave out clause 7 (1) (h). I draw to the attention of my colleagues on the Committee that this clause was raised by the Institute with the Senate Select Committee. It was specifically asked to refer to it in its report. I believe the easiest way to resolve the problem which was raised and which was accepted by the Committee is that we should omit that paragraph. I might say that we have chosen to move these nine or 10 amendments together because to do otherwise is to prolong the debate unduly. If it were the wish of the Committee to agree to one and not agree to another, we could seek leave to put the questions separately when the time came. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. (8) seeks to amend clause 7 (1) (j) of the ATSIC Bill by leaving out the words `without derogating from the functions or powers of the Australian Bureau of Statistics' with a view to inserting the words `at the request or with the concurrence of the Australia Bureau of Statistics but not otherwise'. We are concerned to ensure that ATSIC, when it operates, does not try to duplicate the statistical functions of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. As we read clause 7 (1) (j), we believe it could seek to duplicate the functions of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). We are quite happy for ATSIC to carry out any statistical work at the request or with the concurrence of the ABS but we think it should not otherwise so do. </PARA>
<PARA> The next amendment we have proposed in this package is an amendment to paragraph 7 (1) (m). I have to foreshadow that it would be the intention of the Opposition in a few moments to seek the removal of clause 8 of the Bill. That is, as it were, a Henry VIII clause-a phrase used by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and understood by most parliamentarians. It is one of those Bills which say that we will write something now and do the rest by regulation later. Clause 8 (2) as it is proposed says:</PARA>
<PARA>The power under subsection (1) shall be exercised by notice published in the Gazette. </PARA>
<PARA>We do not yet know what those powers are. That particular clause has been referred to by the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, and I will come back to that point in a moment. If we deleted clause 8, we would then want to look again at clause 7 (m), which at the moment proposes that ATSIC's functions could be increased or varied at any time by the Prime Minister conferring functions on the Commission. The Bill states, `by notices in force under section 8'. If, in fact, we are able to amend section 8, it is inappropriate to keep clause 7 (m). </PARA>
<PARA> The last amendment in this group, the last one to which I need to speak at the moment, is amendment No (10). I already indicated a moment ago that it proposes that clause 8, on page 8, should be omitted. In its report on the ATSIC Bill the Scrutiny of Bills Committee informed the Parliament, in relation to clauses 8 and 7 (m)-the two to which I have just referred-as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 8 of the Bill allows the Prime Minister to confer a departmental function on the Commission by means of a notice placed in the Gazette pursuant to subclause 8 (2). </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph 7 (m), in referring to the functions of the Commission, states:</PARA>
<PARA> Such other functions as are conferred on the Commission by the Prime Minister by notices in force under section 8. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee-</PARA>
<PARA>requested that the notices be subject to tabling to enable them to be subject to the scrutiny of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>The Scrutiny of Bills Committee informs us that the Minister responded to that Committee as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 8 of the Bill establishes a system by which administrative responsibilities may be transferred from Commonwealth departments to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. It is therefore equivalent in effect to administrative arrangement orders. Such arrangements are not, of course, subject to parliamentary disallowance. As is the case with administrative arrangement orders, the rights or liabilities of persons cannot be affected by the exercise of the power. </PARA>
<PARA>The Scrutiny of Bills Committee then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee thanks the Minister for his response but regards it as appropriate that notices be tabled. The Committee does not seek that the notices be subject to disallowance but regards it as appropriate that they be tabled. </PARA>
<PARA>Significant functions of departments relating to Aboriginal programs are not proposed for transfer to ATSIC. That is a fact. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), in announcing his intention to establish the Commission, said that it would deal with all aspects of Aboriginal affairs. That is simply not true. It will deal with many aspects of Aboriginal affairs but not all aspects. Among the departments with sizeable empires in Aboriginal program administration we find, for example, the Department of Employment, Education and Training, which covers the function of Aboriginal employment and Aboriginal education. The Department of Community Services and Health covers Aboriginal housing under States grants. The Australia Council has responsibility for the Aboriginal Arts Board. The Department of Administrative Services is responsible for the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, and has responsibility for electoral education. There are various programs under the Department for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Tambling waits a few moments, he will find that I, or my colleague, will have something to say about local government. Among them, those programs which I have just mentioned account for $341m in the 1988-89 Estimates. I may be wrong about the figure, but a very sizeable amount of money is involved. At present, that funding is open to examination by the Parliament, it is open to examination by Estimates committees, and the various Ministers of State are accountable for what is done with that money on behalf of Aboriginal people. But at any future time, if things were to become embarrassing, if things were not working well on any of those programs, the Prime Minister, as the Bill is drafted, could simply transfer the functions by notice published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette to ATSIC. They would then become functions of the statutory body and no Minister would have to answer for what was done thereafter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been on different Estimates committees and we have greater or lesser degrees of difficulties examining the functions of some of the statutory bodies. But the existence of clause 8 illustrates the Government's confusion over the ATSIC concept. When the Prime Minister announced his intention to create ATSIC, it was to be on the basis that the Commission would take responsibility for all aspects of Aboriginal affairs. Yet the Bill presents us actually with an enabling clause-a Henry VIII type clause-which could at some future date transfer functions quite different from those which we know are being transferred now at the outset of ATSIC and which could, by being transferred, change the nature and scope of the Commission's powers and functions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So while this clause remains public servants working on Aboriginal programs of departments will never know whether they will become ATSIC officials at short notice because if the function were transferred the officers serving the function would be transferred as well.

In the case of officers of Aboriginal descent especially, the prospect, I do not think, is very reassuring. So if the clause-that is clause 8-is not defeated, at the very least it should be amended to require that the Prime Minister consult with the ATSIC board before he acts to assign new functions to the Commission. I would suggest that while the amendments have merit, if the Committee felt it could not accede to the amendments-and particularly, say, the proposed amendment to clause 7 (1) (m)-we should have regard to the report of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and we should consider some extension of what is proposed here. I would suggest that it should be the tabling of any notice which would then be subject to disallowance if the Parliament so wished. After all if it is a fair enough transfer no-one would try to disallow it. Making it the subject of disallowance does not mean the disallowance succeeds. I suggest that as things stand at the moment the functions of ATSIC are drawn altogether too widely.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek to speak about a particular aspect of division 2, clause 7, the functions of the Commission, and its potential for conflict with local government itself. Today the Minister for Local Government (Senator Reynolds) has chosen to put out a press release saying how pleased she is that the Government has supported the declaration by the International Union of Local Government (IULA) in Perth-the world wide declaration on local self-government-and extolling the virtues of the need for local government to be recognised as an integral part of the federal system. It is in the light of the fact that both the Opposition and the Government agree that local government is an important, integral part of a federal system, whilst not agreeing on support for the declaration, that I seek to speak on clause 7. Clause 7 (1), paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (g), (m) and of course clause 8 about which Senator Peter Baume has already spoken, give various powers to the Commission to monitor; to develop policy; to assist, advise and cooperate; to provide information; and to have such other functions as may be deemed necessary by the Prime Minister pursuant to clause 8.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These functions include monitoring, developing, advising, cooperating and providing information, and finally cover anything that deals with social, economic or cultural development of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders and is conferred with regard to programs conducted by bodies other than the Commission. There are proposals to meet national, State, Territory or regional needs and priorities at the national, State, Territory or regional levels of government. There is a concern expressed in a submission, for instance, by the Australian Local Government Association in April 1988 to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) that Aboriginal community organisations performing local government functions should not be recognised for the purposes of the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act. But then there is another concern voiced, which is that under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission proposals there could be direct funding to Aboriginal regional groups in furtherance of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) aims of self-determination and self-management which could put them directly at odds with local government itself. A similar position could arise with road funding, where local government may well see the day when the Federal Government is funding roads into ATSIC regional council areas. It is rather curious that, on the day that the Government has put out a release saying how important it considers local government to be, we are debating provisions of the ATSIC Bill which indeed put that important role of local government at risk and in potential conflict with ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been specific concern expressed on these points by councils particularly in Western Australia where a phrase such as `local government as a service delivery agent' may be usurped by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. They would like to seek assurance from the Commonwealth Minister for Aboriginal Affairs that ATSIC will not be competing with local government for Federal funding that normally accrues to local government. A very specific example is given with regard to the road funding question that I raised. A report points out that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs has indeed identified some 3,083 kilometres of Aboriginal access roads in Western Australia that would require upgrading at a cost of $50m. Over a third of this road length falls within a particular shire of Western Australia. Indeed, one could be concerned that the councils being established are more like Gough Whitlam's regional councils and could end up having a most divisive effect. It can be said, without overexaggerating, that there is the potential to split the nation on issues such as these. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Baume has indicated in moving amendments to this proposed legislation that the Government's attitude is one that requires a response more of sadness than of anger, and I think he has been very reasoned in the amendments that he has moved. He has pointed out the grave concerns that confront the nation. My pointing out specifically the potential conflict between local government and ATSIC is done in the same vein. It is done to ensure that our federal system of government, which comprises Federal, State and local governments, is not in any way usurped by the establishment of a set of councils which are quite outside the frame work of our federal system. </PARA>

Whilst there have been a number of issues raised by Senator Bishop, particularly with regard to clause 7 (d) and the application to local government, I would like to point out to the Senate that the Northern Territory Government has devised a very special and successful form of local government called the community government scheme which operates under the auspices of the local government Act of the Northern Territory and provides for a very peculiar, particular and, as I have said, successful form of local government administration where rating is not the normal base for local government.

<PARA> I am fearful that, through having a Commonwealth agency and the Northern Territory system, we could pit Aboriginal communities into competing for funds and for the form of administration that they think would best serve their local needs. To a certain extent this goes on under the various forms of incorporation that are currently adopted in various areas. Therefore, I fully support the amendments that have been put forward by Senator Peter Baume. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to read clause 7 very carefully because it lists the functions of the Commission. Clause 7 (1) (f) states:</PARA>
<PARA>to advise the Minister on:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, including the administration of legislation; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the co-ordination of the activities of other Commonwealth bodies that affect Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders;</PARA>
<PARA>I prefer the wording put forward by Senator Peter Baume because, if one thinks through the logic of that printed 7 (1) (f) clause, this could also involve participation in Premiers Conferences, in the Commonwealth Grants Commission and in a number of other very important areas that are properly the prerogative of both government and the Parliament, and not--</PARA>

<PARA> Clause 7 (1) (h) gives the areas of heritage that need to be addressed. This matter has been highlighted by the contribution in the Senate the other day by my colleague Senator Bob Collins from the Northern Territory, who pointed out the inadequate and iniquitous way of funding the Aboriginal Cultural Foundation in the Northern Territory. The Aboriginal Cultural Foundation has a very fine history of representing the traditional Aboriginal owners of northern Australia in those things that are very properly cultural. In the last few years we have seen its budget slashed because its members are out of favour with the powerbrokers who seem to advise the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand)-not those in the Department but those on his personal staff or on the staffs of the Northern and Central Land Councils. As a result of their conflict with the Aboriginal Cultural Foundation-a very fine body of men who in so many areas protect cultural and, to a certain extent, sacred matters-the only way in which they have been able to muzzle the Foundation has been in effect to reduce Commonwealth funding available to the Foundation. This has been most unfortunate and, I believe, thoroughly unnecessary. It is causing huge divisions in the body politic within Aboriginal communities and affecting their development in the Northern Territory. Having given those types of local reservations that I can bring from the Northern Territory, I fully support the amendments put forward by Senator Peter Baume. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have here a large number of suggested amendments to the section in this Bill which deals with the functions of the Commission. It is true that the functions of the Commission will change over time and that at present there are a number of areas of government involvement with the welfare of Aboriginal people which are not covered and at this stage not envisaged to be covered by the Commission, as Senator Peter Baume has pointed out. However, it seems to me that the terms of clause 7 and clause 8 are sufficiently widely drawn here so that over time, if the Aboriginal people so choose, certain functions can be transferred into the ambit of the Commission and those functions can be extended, and I believe it is appropriate that that should happen.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That deals with the honourable senator's amendments to the functions of the Commission, clause 7(m) and 8 specifically. I will deal with that in a moment. Dealing with the amendments in the order in which they have been introduced by Senator Baume, his amendment 2 is to clause 7, lines 13 and 14. At the moment the clause reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Commission has the following functions:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . to monitor the effectiveness of programs for Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders-</PARA>
<PARA>and these are the words which the Opposition seeks to leave out-</PARA>
<PARA>including programs conducted by bodies other than the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>If I recall correctly the argument for support of that deletion which Senator Baume brought up the other night, it was that that function was too widely drawn. He would seem to be concerned that the Commission may in some way intrude itself into programs which were conducted by bodies other than the Commission. Senator Baume gave several examples. It seems to me that if one is drawing up a commission which is broadly representative of Aboriginal people from the whole of Australia, it is absolutely appropriate that that Commission should be able to look at programs conducted by other bodies. It may well be that there is a program being conducted by a State government, for instance, which is not in the best interests of Aboriginal people. What body other than ATSIC is the appropriate body to look at that function being conducted by that other body, that other program, and say, `Look, that program is not serving the interests of Aboriginal people' or `That program is inappropriate; or it may even be damaging to the interests of Aboriginal people'. Whether it is being conducted by a State government or a private organisation, it seems to me quite appropriate that the body that is democratically elected by the Aboriginal people throughout Australia is the appropriate body to look at those things. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, I would object to the amendment that the Opposition is putting because I do not think it really does what the Opposition is seeking from it. With those words deleted, the words would be:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission has the following functions:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . to monitor the effectiveness of programs for Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA>In a sense, that is even more general. It certainly leaves the way open for the Commission to look at all those programs which are conducted by anybody, and it therefore does not achieve the purpose for which the Opposition has sought to delete those words. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the second amendment, that is, amendment (3), to line 15, clause 7. At present clause 7 (c) reads:</PARA>
<PARA> (c) to develop policy proposals to meet national, State, Territory and regional needs and priorities of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders;</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition is seeking to insert in front of those words, `when requested by the Minister'. Earlier in the debate on the other Bills we heard a great deal from the Opposition as to the distribution of powers by the Minister and the powers of ATSIC and the other bodies which we have been debating-the Aboriginal Development Commission in transition, and the Institute. It seems to me that the Opposition, in moving this amendment, is seeking to do something quite different; in fact, it is diametrically opposed to what it attempted to do in the ADC Amendment Bill. It is a rhetorical question, but why should ATSIC be confined to developing policy proposals, which are not necessarily things which ATSIC would implement or would be able to implement? Surely, it should be in a position to look at various aspects of Aboriginal life and develop broadly drawn policy proposals which address national, State and Territory concerns. It should not be limited to being able to do those things only when requested by the Minister. I see that recommendation by the Opposition as quite severely restricting the ability of ATSIC to develop those policy proposals. This, of course, has implications further on when ATSIC is to make representations to the Minister in relation to Aboriginal policy. ATSIC clearly has to develop its policy proposals in its own mind before it can properly advise the Minister. I think that the insertion of those words is quite unacceptable, having regard to what I see ATSIC as being about. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now deal with Opposition amendment (4), that is, clause 7, lines 18 to 20, leave out paragraph (1) (d), and insert a paragraph. Clause 7 (d) at present reads:</PARA>
<PARA> (d) to assist, advise and co-operate with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, organisations and individuals at national, State, Territory and regional levels;</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Baume seemed to be arguing that that in some way conferred on ATSIC a hegemony over those other organisations; that somehow ATSIC could control and unfairly influence the functioning of the organisations with which it may cooperate or which it may choose to assist or advise. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems to me to be appropriate to insert that and to give it those sorts of powers to assist, advise and cooperate. I do not see any threat of hegemony-and I think that is the word that Senator Baume used-by ATSIC over those other organisations by the inclusion of that clause. Moreover, the words that the Opposition is seeking to include there are as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (d) in connection with matters that are functions of the Commission because of other provisions of this Act, but not in any other circumstances, to assist, advise and co-operate with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities . . . and individuals. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me, as I indicated earlier, that Senator Baume is seeking to restrict ATSIC in its ability to develop policy proposals, and he is then seeking to further limit its ability to assist and advise by way of that earlier limitation. It certainly seems to me that that argument there is unfounded. I do not see the element of danger to which Senator Baume has drawn attention. It seems to me appropriate that this major national representative body, having the appropriate power, as I have indicated earlier, to develop policy proposals should have the ability then to say to various groups dealing with the welfare of Aboriginal people `We support this program' or `We do not support it'; `We will offer assistance with that program' or `No, we will not offer assistance' or `We will cooperate in this or that program for the better management of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander affairs'. </PARA>
<PARA> The next amendment, No. (5), is to leave out paragraph (1) (e), which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>to establish, where desirable, extra consultative arrangements with the Aboriginal people or the Torres Strait Islander people;</PARA>
<PARA>Frankly, it does not worry me very much whether this paragraph is in or out. It does not seem to be a very significant amendment. If clause 7 (1) (d) is in there to assist, advise and cooperate, then of course that embraces the notion that it is possible to establish, where desirable, extra consultative arrangements because clearly one cannot assist, advise and cooperate without those arrangements. I am not sure why the Opposition wants to delete it. I see nothing of great danger in having it in there, but if it were left out the powers which are conferred on the Commission by that clause would be there anyway by reason of 7 (1) (d). I would like to hear from the Minister as to whether he has any other concerns in relation to that one. </PARA>
<PARA> In the sixth amendment the Opposition is seeking to leave out paragraph 1 (f), which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>to advise the Minister on:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, including the administration of legislation; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the co-ordination of the activities of other Commonwealth bodies that affect Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA>Again the Opposition is seeking here to put up front `when requested by the Minister' to advise the Minister on matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. I am surprised, in view of the arguments we heard earlier in relation to the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill, that the Opposition here is seeking to constrain ATSIC from offering advice to the Minister de novo and saying that it can offer advice to the Minister only when the Minister requests that advice. It seems to me that is a serious limitation on the ability of a body which, after all, is the peak body that will democratically represent the interests of Aboriginal people. </PARA>

As Senator Baume has rightly pointed out, the Minister could say no. I just see it as absolutely essential for ATSIC that it have the ability to go to the Minister and say, `Look, Minister, we think that in this area XYZ should be done'. Whether or not the Minister accepts that advice is left with the Minister, but ATSIC has the ability to go and give that advice, unwelcome as it may be. I deal now with the seventh amendment of the Opposition, which is to leave out paragraph 1 (h). That paragraph states:</PARA></TALK.START>

I was dealing before the dinner break with Opposition amendment (7), which seeks to omit paragraph 1 (h) of clause 7. That is the clause which Senator Peter Baume was saying in some way cuts across the role of the Institute in its protection of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural material and artefacts, et cetera-things that are sacred. As I read that paragraph, it allows the Commission to act as an adjunct to the work of the Institute and it in no way inhibits the Institute, or interferes or needs to interfere with its work. It seems to me that there may be instances in which broader action which could be taken by the Commission may well be necessary as a precursor or as an adjunct to some action which the Institute found necessary in the protection of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural material or information, et cetera. Therefore, I do not accept the Opposition's argument with respect to the deletion of that paragraph.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Baume. The next Opposition amendment, amendment (8), leaves out certain words and inserts alternative words. The words to be left out are, `without derogating from the functions or powers of the Australian Bureau of Statistics' and the insertion is `at the request or with the concurrence of the Australian Bureau of Statistics but not otherwise'. It seems to me that that amendment does not significantly change the meaning of that clause. For that reason, while I will listen with interest to what the Minister has to say, it would not matter too much which form of words was included.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Baume dealt with the remaining two amendments at some length, that is, the ability of the Prime Minister, by notice under clause 8, to confer other functions on the Commission, and clause 8 itself, which the Opposition is seeking totally to delete. Clause 8 reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister may, for the purpose of furthering the social, economic or cultural development of Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders, confer a departmental function on the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) That the power under subsection (1) shall be exercised by notice published in the Gazette. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Baume seemed to be arguing that in some way this got around the processes of parliamentary scrutiny. That seemed to be the main thrust of his argument here. I cannot quite see that, because there are other provisions within this Bill which set out the way in which budgets and plans and various other things shall be developed by regional councils and then by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission itself, and the way in which the Minister will have an overview of those budgets; and moreover, that if the Minister disagrees with any part of those draft budgets, he must make known to both Houses of Parliament the differences between what ATSIC has requested and what he is imposing upon ATSIC, and the reasons for those changes. With that degree of scrutiny, I have difficulty in seeing that there is any failure on the part of the Parliament to properly administer its responsibility in scrutinising the functions which may be transferred from other departments to ATSIC by way of the subclause of clause 7 and the whole of clause 8. For that reason I am not convinced by Senator Baume's argument. </PARA>
<PARA> The appropriateness of the actual transfer-leaving aside for the moment the question of scrutiny by the Parliament-is precisely the issue we have been dealing with throughout a number of these clauses. I come back to the point I made right at the beginning of my remarks, and that is that as ATSIC develops I would certainly see it as an organisation capable of taking on more and wider functions with respect to both Aboriginal welfare and Aboriginal economic and other development. For that reason it is appropriate to have a mechanism written into this legislation by which that transfer of powers can occur. I think the width of the potential here is defensible on the grounds of that implicit hope that ATSIC will develop along those lines and will become a properly representative body able to function in the interests of Aboriginal people. It is a hope I have expressed several times.In summing up this series of proposed amendments, it seems to me that, while there are two in there which I think are not particularly significant either way-and I would be prepared to be convinced either way on those-the remainder of them, are necessary for the purposes for which the Government is creating this body through this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had better indicate the Government's general approach to this package of amendments, which are known as group 2 in the Opposition's sequence of amendments. Generally speaking, the effect of carrying the various amendments, certainly cumulatively, would be to narrow the functions of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) and, quite paradoxically, given some of the statements made by the Opposition, to put in a form of ministerial control or veto over the exercise of some of the functions which, in any case, are to do mainly with the giving of advice and so on, and do not really amount to the exercise of real effective power in any case. So we find them rather strange, and I do not believe they sit all that well with some of the expressions of the Opposition in relation to the debates we have had up to this point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Coulter has done a remarkable job going through the various proposals within group 2, but I shall do the same for the sake of completeness. As to the first amendment to clause 7, this is simply a matter of enabling the Commission to monitor the effectiveness of programs for Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders in relation to certain matters. It seems to me that to keep an eye on the effectiveness of those sorts of programs would really be a necessary basis for that sort of advisory role. Even self-advice needs to be generated, if you like, by the Commission, and to have an understanding of the effectiveness of programs for Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders, by whomsoever they are conducted or made available, would be a very sensible element in the awareness necessary to the Commission if it is to devise the correct strategies available to it within its own functions and powers and to offer such assistance or advice as may be helpful to other bodies conducting programs on behalf of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. So it seems to me that that really is a very sensible function and I cannot quite see the peril that is thought to be there. I agree with Senator Coulter that to leave out the words `including programs conducted by bodies other than the Commission' would probably have no effect on the real scope of that clause. Nevertheless, the Government obviously would stand by 7 (1) (b) as it is presently drafted. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the third amendment put forward by the Opposition, here once again the Opposition appears to be putting a form of ministerial constraint on the operations of the Commission. After all, this is only a function to develop policy proposals, and to require that before that could be undertaken a request has to come from the Minister seems to put an unnecessary constraint and shackle on the Commission. I do not see why it should not have the confidence of this Parliament that it could at least develop policy proposals without having to be given the go-ahead by the Minister. It seems to me to be a perfectly sensible and proper arrangement that it should generate for itself the areas of concern and come up with proposals to deal with those matters. </PARA>
<PARA> As to amendment No. (4), this seems once again to be unnecessarily constraining the scope of the matters on which the Commission can assist, advise and cooperate with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, organisations and individuals at national, State, Territory and regional levels. There seems to be a sense of something untoward happening in the operations of the Commission that would lead it to go on frolics of its own around the Australian community if the sort of constraints that are suggested by Senator Peter Baume were not put in paragraph 7 (1) (d), but I believe that really it is unnecessary. I think we can rely on the commonsense and the sense of purpose, the overall composition of the Commission as it would be, to carry out this function in a way which allowed it at times-and I cannot necessarily foresee them-not merely to assist, advise or cooperate in relation to those matters where it already has another function conferred on it but to do other things. There may be matters outside its own list of functions where indeed its assistance would be extremely useful, its advice would be welcomed and its cooperation would possibly be sought by other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, communities, organisations and individuals at the various levels. </PARA>
<PARA> By the way, when we were talking about the various levels-national, State, Territory and regional-there seemed to be a bit of a suggestion from Senator Bishop in particular that this could lead to the undermining of State and local government provisions of services and responsibility for the provisions of services. I can point to Objects, clause 3 (d), and emphasise once again that the objects of the Act, amongst other things, are:</PARA>
<PARA> (d) to ensure coordination in the formulation and implementation of policies affecting Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders by the Commonwealth, State, Territory and local governments, without detracting from the responsibilities of State, Territory and local governments to provide services to their Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander residents. </PARA>

I do not believe that they are there and I believe it is an unjustified concern that explains the amendment put forward by the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Amendment No. (5) of the Opposition is designed to leave out paragraph 1 (e). To be quite frank, I do not care whether that stays in or goes out. I do not quite see that paragraph 1 (e) is essential to this list of functions. Maybe it is there out of an abundance of caution but I would have thought that if the Committee decided that paragraph 1 (e) were not to stay in the list then the consultative arrangements that would necessarily underpin the functions in at least paragraph 7 (1) (d) would be probably quite adequate to the necessary functions of the Commission. I would not go to the wall on that if Senator Coulter decided to support the Opposition. We would not protest. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was paragraph 7 (1) (e). As to amendment No. (6), once again the advice-according to the Opposition-could be provided only when requested by the Minister. It seems that to advise the Minister refers only to advice at his request. Once again, it does not do full justice to the composition, to the competence, to the self-motivation-not exactly the conferring of functions, because we are going to confer the functions-of the Commission. I think decisions on advising the Minister can be safely, properly and fairly left with the Commission. I do not see that the advice should be triggered at all times by requests by the Minister and I believe that in a sense the almost inherent veto in the sorts of advice which the Minister might ask for would diminish the usefulness of the Commission if that particular preambular requirement were made a part of paragraph 7 (1) (f).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to amendment No. (7), I have had a quick look during the dinner hour at recommendation 22 of the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. The recommendation was that the Minister consult the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies (AIAS) on this question and examine either the transfer of responsibility contained in paragraph 7 (1) (h) to AIAS or the amendment of paragraph 7 (1) (h) to require that the Commission be empowered to exercise that power only after consultation with AIAS. I am informed that indeed the Minister did consult with AIAS, that those consultations have occurred and that it did not see it as appropriate that this be its role. On that basis and on that advice I so inform the Senate. I believe that this particular clause ought to be allowed to stand on that basis, that the Institute, the organisation the integrity of whose collection was thought to be at some risk perhaps by Senator Peter Baume in moving his amendment, apparently does not see it that way. </PARA>
<PARA> As to amendment No. (8), on the ability of the Commission to collect statistical information, once again I am not particularly concerned one way or the other how this particular clause goes. If Senator Coulter decides to support the Opposition we could live with that. </PARA>
<PARA> As to amendments Nos (9) and (10), I found the argument put forward by Senator Peter Baume rather surprising because he suggested that if we moved a function from a department-let us say the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET)-to ATSIC, somehow this Parliament would lose control over the Estimates process. Of course, all the ATSIC estimates will come before this Parliament. Proposed section 55 (1) makes it clear:</PARA>
<PARA> There is payable to the Commission such money as appropriated from time to time by the Parliament for the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>We are dealing with parliamentary appropriations in respect of the operations of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and I am quite sure, much to my regret, that I will be sitting through several days of Estimates committees, as I have for the Aboriginal Development Commission and the Department, defending the estimates of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission-or at least if not defending them, allowing, should I say, the appropriate witnesses from ATSIC to explain their estimates to the Committee. That will go on for days and days. I am sure that that will be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Baume seemed to suggest that if we did have, say, a function transferred from DEET to this new Commission, somehow those public servants concerned would lose their Public Service status. That is what I heard Senator Baume say, and once again I do not think that is correct. Personnel in ATSIC will of course be public servants under the scheme of this particular Act. So I believe that the two matters which the honourable senator proposes in regard to these amendments Nos (9) and (10) on examination do not have the impact on parliamentary surveillance of the functions that might be brought into the scope of ATSIC's concerns, and for that reason the Government does not see any need to accept amendments Nos (9) and (10). </PARA>
<PARA> As I have I think heard Senator Baume say of our position, as far as the movement, for example, of the function from DEET is concerned I asked my advisers what they could give as an example. They said, `If you take the training for Aboriginal programs which are now in DEET, it may well be that at some future stage you might transfer that particular function across to ATSIC'. They were not indicating that that was on some hidden agenda-I would not want people to think that-but they gave that as an example where you could have it transferred, as does the Prime Minister by administrative arrangements transfer matters from one department to another for reasons of efficiency or such like. That would be the case under proposed section 8. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like the Minister to clarify some additional comments that he has made with regard to the Opposition's amendment No. (4) relating to paragraph 7 (1) (d) where we were talking about the conflicts that could arise at the various State, Territory and local government levels. The Minister did not feel that the Opposition's amendment was needed because of the concerns that we have expressed. I would like to draw to the Minister's attention, under `Powers of the Commission', to paragraph 10 (2) (a), which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The powers of the Commission . . . include, but are not limited to, the following powers:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to negotiate-</PARA>

<PARA>There appears to be a conflict inherent in the argument that the Minister has just presented, in which he invites defeat of our amendment No. (4). I therefore ask the Minister: Will he agree to our group 3 amendments, where we seek to leave out the words `negotiate and'? I think this would be most important in order to retain the integrity of what the Minister is saying. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am concerned about the Minister's statement. When we debated the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill we debated the fact that the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC), the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA) and Aboriginal Hostels Ltd would come under one banner, one mega-commission, which would be called ATSIC. Due to the good graces of Senator Coulter and the Opposition, we removed the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies from ATSIC. On page 7, under `Division 2-Functions of Commission', I believe the Minister is expanding way beyond what he enunciated when he said that ADC, DAA and Aboriginal Hostels would come under ATSIC. He is now widening the powers of the ATSIC Bill. I have some quite large concerns on a number of issues. For instance, I do not see why a State government which puts up its own money-I think in the case of my State, about $38m that it collects from State taxes-should be required to advise or assist ATSIC. This is purely a State matter and if a particular State government wants to develop--</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Peter Baume" NAMEID="ME4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The money is a State matter and ATSIC is a Commonwealth matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. If the elected members that constitute the government want to participate in some particular Aboriginal venture-whether it be an emu farm or a store, or whether they want to set up cattle properties or provide stock for cattle properties-that is the State government's decision, funded by State government taxes and made by a responsible, elected government. What the Minister is saying here, as I read it, is that ATSIC, which is a Commonwealth commission, will have to advise, cooperate, work, coordinate, negotiate, and anything else one likes to name, with the State bodies. I see that as a complete invasion of State rights. I know that States rights are not near and dear to Senator Coulter's heart, but we do have State governments. That is a fact of life under the Constitution and those State governments provide, particularly in Queensland and the Northern Territory, and probably in a lot of other States, significant funding for Aboriginal communities. They are very effective; in fact, in lots of ways they are closer to the Aboriginal people than we are here in Canberra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other area I want to debate is paragraph (d):</PARA>
<PARA> to assist, advise and co-operate with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, organisations and individuals at national, State, Territory and regional levels;</PARA>
<PARA>In Queensland these local communities have local government status. They are elected every three years under the Local Government Act; in fact, I believe they probably have a few more powers than an ordinary local government council. For instance, I believe they do have some control over Aboriginal police and a few other areas. If ATSIC is going to assist and advise and cooperate with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander regional communities, I think that is a complete invasion of the local government organisation that has been set up-and is working brilliantly in Queensland, I might add. Local governments get their funding from the State government and from the Commonwealth Government and then they make their own decisions as to what they are going to do with that funding. That is self-determination and self-management at the grass roots level. </PARA>
<PARA> To have ATSIC coming in to advise, to assist and, I suppose we could say, to negotiate and cooperate I do not think is appropriate. I would hope that we could leave those local communities that have their own local governments to make their own decisions on local government issues. We fought and lost the battle on ATSIC but now we are finding that not only is ATSIC encroaching on the Aboriginal Development Commission, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and Aboriginal Hostels Ltd but the Government is also trying to increase the power of ATSIC to take over local government communities. That is not going to be in the best interests of local government. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (h) states:</PARA>
<PARA>to take such reasonable action as it thinks necessary to protect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural material and information, being material or information that is considered sacred or otherwise significant by Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders;</PARA>
<PARA>That seems a clear intrusion into the area of the Aboriginal Institute. The Government has agreed, I think unwillingly but as a result of Senator Coulter's assistance and the Opposition's insistence, that the Institute be removed from the ATSIC Bill. Again, the Government is trying to provide the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission with a vehicle to intrude into the area of the Aboriginal Institute. Senator Tate tells us, and I believe him, that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) has talked to the Institute and it sees no objections to this. Again, I do not doubt what the Minister has told Senator Tate but I wonder whether the directors of the Institute realise what this clause will do. It will give the 20 commissioners of ATSIC the right to stampede right into the affairs of the Aboriginal Institute and the material that is there, which needs to be treated with the utmost secrecy. I am sure that it is not in the best interests of the Institute, given all the material that is held in that Institute. I again ask Senator Coulter to reconsider his stand on paragraph (h). I think Senator Coulter is well aware of the needs of the Institute, what material is held there and how that material should be treated. I want to put those remarks on the record. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the rest of Senator Baume's amendments. They are reasonable amendments. They are amendments that really define what we were initially told ATSIC would do-amalgamate the ADC, DAA and Aboriginal Hostels Ltd, be responsible for the workings of those previous commissions and departments and bring them under one banner. The clause giving the functions of the Commission exceeds what we debated at the second reading stage and what was mentioned in the Minister's speech. Therefore, I do not see that it accords with what has been laid down by the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems to me that there is a fundamental difference in our interpretations of the words right at the beginning of these several clauses. I draw the Minister's attention to the words at the beginning of clause 7:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commission has the following functions:</PARA>
<PARA>Opposition senators seem to be saying that the Commission shall exercise every one of those functions mentioned in the clause. In other words, if there is one local government somewhere in Australia that contains one Aboriginal person, the Commission shall exercise the `assist, advise, co-operate' et cetera, functions. That is not the way I read it. The opening words, `The Commission has the following functions', seem to me to have been deliberately chosen. I interpret their meaning-I would like the Minister's interpretation on this-that from time to time any one of those functions may be exercised with respect to any one of those matters but that there is no compunction on the part of the Commission to exercise any function continually with respect to all bodies in which that function can be exercised. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, Senator Tambling drew our attention to clause 10, `Powers of Commission'. It states that the Commission has power to do all those things. It does not state that the Commission shall exercise that power with respect to all those things. Again, it seems to me that those powers are provided if and when the Commission needs to use them for the fulfilment of its various functions. They do not in any sense obligate the Commission to impose its will on any of those bodies. After all, to `assist, advise, cooperate', and in clause 10 `negotiate', as the Minister has already pointed out, requires two parties to participate. So I would like the Minister's interpretation of, I suppose, the word `has' rather than `shall exercise', which would be the alternative, and his comments as to whether I am interpreting those powers and those functions in a liberal way, which is what is really meant, or whether they really mean what I think the Opposition is arguing and which is clearly raising a great deal of concern on its part. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee can look at various words, and I am happy to talk about those, but the overall purport and intention of clauses 7, 8, 9 and 10 need to be looked at as a whole. If one says that the Commission `has the following functions', all one means is that certain capacities are vested in it, are available to it. These are the sorts of things that it may undertake. Then again, of course, obviously, when one says that the Commission `has power to do all things', one merely asserts that the Parliament intends that it actually have the mechanisms available to it, the actual ability, to undertake those functions which are outlined in clause 7.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think what lies behind the Opposition's amendments in this area of our debate is some fear that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission can usurp or override or have some sort of paramount functions which displace the legitimately constituted State or local government organisations or voluntary bodies or associations constituted perhaps under State law or simply community groups that come together in a voluntary way. That is not the case at all. There is no intention in the words, certainly no intention on the part of the Government, but certainly not in the words, to have that sort of overriding displacing power which Senator Boswell, in particular, seems to fear. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already indicated that it is quite clear from the objects clause that the Bill is drafted in the intention that State and local government bodies retain their responsibilities and remain answerable to their electorates for the discharge of their proper responsibilities towards their citizens, including the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who fall within their boundaries. Given the fact that we have a federal system, quite clearly when we have a national body such as ATSIC established, it will be important that it work in harmony with-by way of assisting, advising and cooperating with-all those various bodies at the various levels peculiar to the federal system. </PARA>
<PARA> I would just reiterate that the power given in clause 10 (2) (a) is simply to negotiate and cooperate with other Commonwealth bodies and State, Territory and local government bodies. It is in no way an overriding power; it is one which depends on the ability to sit down and discuss with a view to securing the ends and objects which are set out in the functions of the Commission. The functions are, for example:</PARA>
<PARA>to assist, advise and co-operate with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, organisations and individuals at national, State, Territory and regional levels. </PARA>
<PARA>To carry out that function, it may require the power to negotiate and cooperate with governments at the State and local government level. As I say, the powers clause, clause 10, indicates the real effective capacity, the way in which the functions may be truly exercised for the ends which are set out there. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is not further persuaded by anything that it has heard and we will therefore vote against all the amendments except for the two which I have indicated we can live with if Senator Coulter so indicates. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept that explanation. I do, however, want to refer to a few of the amendments for which some response is necessary. The first amendment in this group-that is, amendment No. (2)-has been criticised by Senator Coulter, and Senator Tate has indicated that the Government will not agree. I have to say to the Committee that I have had the experience as a Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, when the same functions were departmental functions, of trying to deal with some of the States of Australia. It goes back a few years, but the three worst States with which I had to deal on these matters, quite apart from whatever provision they made at State level-and I would have to agree with Senator Boswell that Queensland actually provided well-in terms of negotiation, monitoring, assessment, and discussion were the States of Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia. When I was Minister one was under a National Party government, one was under a Labor Party government, and one was under a Liberal Party government. They were terrible. They would not make officers available to talk. They would not sit round the table. They were very very proud of their sovereignty. They resented any efforts by the Commonwealth to do the kinds of things which are proposed in this functions clause.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is all very well our laying these matters down, but I think my colleague Senator Boswell made the point that it is another thing bringing them to fruition. We actually believe that some of these amendments may smooth the way. </PARA>
<PARA> I say again, Mr Temporary Chairman, that the second reading debate is over; we are no longer arguing the principles. We have argued and lost that battle. We are concerned that we are all going to end up being very sorry at outcomes which are not going to be desirable. We think there is going to be a backlash if this Bill proceeds without some amendments being put into the clauses. We think the backlash may harm the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) as it tries to function. We think the backlash may affect the credibility of what ATSIC is and what it is trying to do. And it may actually harm the acceptance of the Corporation. That may not be a view that is shared by other members of the Committee-I accept that-but that is one of our concerns. Some of the amendments actually are well motivated by a desire to try to make it more acceptable and more likely to succeed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, that is a point of view. I think 7 (1) (b) was just my first point. I just want to make one other point about paragraph 7 (1) (b). As it is written, it would enable ATSIC to monitor the programs conducted by the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, because it would enable ATSIC to monitor the effectiveness of programs including programs conducted by bodies other than the Commission, of which the new Institute will be one such body. I just ask honourable senators to keep that in mind because I am going to mention in a moment my concerns about the heritage question again. There is no doubt that ATSIC could say, `We wish to monitor some of the programs as they may affect Aboriginal people and we depend upon clause 7 (1) (b) as the functional head of power because these are programs conducted by bodies other than the Commission'. That will be possible.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I put it to Senator Coulter that I understand that the courts these days can look at the debates as well as at the Bill and if this amendment were agreed to the courts would be aware of the fact that these words were taken out. That would assist the courts in the weight that they may wish to put on any case that was put before them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me move straight to clause 7 (1) (h) although it is out of sequence. I think I presented an incomplete case because-I take honourable senators back now to the arguments that we would have put when we were discussing the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies-honourable senators will recall that the Minister very graciously indicated that all our amendments were acceptable and so we did not, in fact, argue the amendments one by one. But one of the amendments to which the Committee agreed when we came to look at the Institute was an amendment which had to do with the way in which we deal with secret and sacred information, with culturally sensitive information. That amendment-I want to read it because it is a different provision from the one which is being written into this ATSIC Bill and this is the point I want to make-was:</PARA>
<PARA>Where information or other matter has been deposited with the Institute under conditions of restricted access, the Institute or the Council shall not disclose that information or other matter except in accordance with those conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>Those conditions would not apply to ATSIC. Part 2 of what was inserted reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The Institute or the Council shall not disclose-</PARA>
<PARA>shall not disclose-</PARA>
<PARA>information or other matter held by it (including information or other matters covered by subsection (1)) if that disclosure would be inconsistent with the views or sensitivities of relevant Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA>That amendment was derived by us from this similar provision which existed in the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) Act. So now I say to the Committee: there is a provision in the ADC Act which we have now transferred to the Institute of Aboriginal Studies Bill but we find in the ATSIC Bill, as it is written, an entirely different formulation of words. We believe at the very least that the protection afforded to culturally sensitive information should be no less. It may be that somewhere those same words have to go in to make sure that ATSIC, like the Institute and like the ADC, shall not disclose certain material. </PARA>

I would not like to see funding tied to the release of any information, but I would say to honourable senators that clause 7 (1) (h) provides much less protection. It puts the protection entirely within the judgment of the commissioners of ATSIC because clause 7 (1) (h) as proposed states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>to take such reasonable action as it thinks necessary . . . </PARA>

Paragraph 7 (1) (c) says that it is a function of the Commission to develop policy proposals to meet all of these needs. Let us refer, for example, to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. This subclause is really an invitation to ATSIC to say to another Commonwealth department of state, operating under the constitutional authority given to that Minister of state, that it wants the programs done in this way or that way. Our concern relates to our view of how the Constitution is drawn-we see it as a question of constitutional propriety-and what is meant by ministerial control of portfolio. I am thinking here of the Minister for Administrative Services, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, or whoever it might be. That is what was concerning us when we drew up this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the last two amendments, I foreshadow to the Committee, because I understand what Senator Coulter and Senator Tate have said, that we think that if our amendments are unsuccessful it is still necessary to try to amend the functions as written here. If that were the case, I would then move another amendment seeking to ensure that any instruments which were made to transfer functions under proposed clause 8 (2) should be disallowable instruments for the purposes of section 46 (a) of the Acts Interpretation Act. I foreshadow that to indicate to my colleagues the way in which we are intending to move. I commend the amendments. I say to you again, Mr Temporary Chairman, that in accordance with standing order 130 I will ask that the two I have mentioned be separated for the purpose of voting. I indicate to the Committee that we foreshadow another amendment, should that be necessary, after these amendments have been voted on. </PARA>

Using the reductio ad absurdum argument, the argument Senator Baume used was that a court later on could look at the words which were deleted and observe that, having deleted them, there must have been some intention in our deleting them and therefore would not look behind those words.

That is why I said in my initial remarks in speaking to this amendment that I do not think the deletion of those words achieves what the Opposition intends them to achieve. On the other hand, the inclusion of the words does make clear that the Commission can monitor-and `monitor' is the term that is used-the effectiveness of programs conducted by other bodies, and I think that is appropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Turning quickly to the 7 (1) (h) proposed alternative amendment, which I certainly would support, it seems to me absolutely appropriate to keep 7 (1) (h) in there, as I indicated earlier, because I see it as an adjunct to the function of the Institute. Contrary to the example Senator Baume has given in which he talked about sacred material which may be of a sensitive nature and information which should not be generally divulged or talked about, I would see this clause coming into operation in situations such as the one which has developed in relation to Aboriginal material kept in museums. Aboriginal people have said that much of this material was scavenged in the early days by anthropologists against the wishes or without even considering the wishes of Aboriginal people. There is a claim now by Aboriginal people that that material should be returned to them-in some cases for burial or in the case of sacred objects just simply returned. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument over whether or not that material should be returned is a legitimate function of the Commission and I would see that as a function which the Commission could more properly take on, rather than the Institute, because it is a more political-type body to take on that function. I totally accept Senator Baume's argument that, if we give the Commission that function, then if it does stray into this more sensitive area the sensitivity of that material needs to be protected and therefore I would support the alternative amendment which he has presaged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think I have anything new to add, except in relation to 7 (1) (h). If Senator Baume's intention was that, should the Commission come into possession lawfully of certain materials or information it ought to be aware of the sensitivities of Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders and ensure that no disclosure takes place if secrecy of an absolute kind is required by virtue of the nature of the material, then of course I utterly agree. I have asked the Clerks-maybe Senator Baume has also-to try to draft a clause to that effect, if that is his intention. I may say that I do not think his fear is well founded that the passage of 7 (1) (h) would derogate from those very particular and precise and express words which he inserted into the Institute Bill to ensure the secrecy of the collections of the Institute is maintained. Where there are words dealing expressly with the Institute and its obligations of secrecy, I do not believe a general clause such as this could override those particular secrecy provisions. But, as I say, if Senator Baume's intention is as Senator Coulter and I understand it now, a fall-back position admittedly on his part, and he wishes to exclude 7 (1) (h) in the vote en bloc to deal with that amendment, I would support it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Do I understand the Minister to be saying that the best way to proceed might be as follows: that we dispose of the amendments, except for 7 (1) (h), and that we agree to come back to that subclause a little late when the Clerks have had a chance to come back to us? I will just explain, Minister. We might agree to put those words in as a separate subclause somewhere. Then 7 (1) (h) would have to be modified to have somewhere the words `subject to'-whatever the proposed new subclause would be. I therefore suggest that what we do is put 7 (1) (h) aside for a short time and return to it when officers and the Clerks are ready for us.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before we do, Mr Chairman, I foreshadowed a little earlier that, in the event that our amendments (9) and (10) were unsuccessful, we would try to move that any determination made under clause 8 (2), that is, a power exercised by notice published in the Gazette, should be disallowable. That is simply to ensure that the Parliament should be aware of what is going on and should have at least the capacity to disallow. I therefore move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Page 8, after subclause 8 (3), add the following new subclause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(4) A notice under subsection (2) is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46 (a) of the Acts Interpretation 1901''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee will understand exactly what the effect of this amendment is. It will not prevent the Government's proceeding to do any of the things it proposes to do with the Bill as it is written. As the Government has not agreed to our amendments, those clauses will stand. But it will ensure that, should any power be exercised under subsection (1) of clause 8 and published in the Gazette, that would be disallowable by the Parliament. This would mean that the concerns that have been expressed to us by some people, that the power could be used improperly, would be allayed in that this would at least make it open to parliamentary scrutiny. Of course, that does not mean that an instrument would be disallowed. It does not mean that people would necessarily move for disallowance. There are thousands of instruments made each year that are potentially disallowable. Honourable senators will know how seldom we seek to exercise that power here. All we are saying is that, since the Government is determined to go this way, we ask that any such determination be a disallowable instrument. That would be the effect of the amendment that I have now moved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government cannot accept this amendment. I have already indicated that we see the way in which this clause would operate as being along the lines of the already existing capacity that the Prime Minister has to make administrative arrangements which can transfer a function from one department to another. The functions provision in section 8 of the current Aboriginal Development Commission Act, which I believe was drafted by the Opposition, says, amongst other things:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . such other functions in connection with the furtherance of the economic and social development of Aboriginals as the Minister determines by notice in writing given to the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>So the legislation drafted by the then Government, now the Opposition, provided a capacity for the Minister to confer further functions that would further the economic and social development of Aboriginals as he determined by writing to the Commission, just by simple notice. The provision that arouses such misgivings, apparently, in the minds of the Opposition is in fact very analogous to that which already exists in the Aboriginal Development Commission Act and which apparently gave no cause for alarm or misgivings at the time it was drafted or presumably in succeeding years to this moment. For that reason the Government cannot agree with this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support Senator Peter Baume's amendment. I am sure that Senator Coulter will see the common sense of allowing the Senate to review a regulation. It is part of our parliamentary procedures and part of the job of the Senate to review any legislation that comes before it. What Senator Peter Baume is seeking to do is to give the Senate the responsibility to monitor any functions the Prime Minister may wish to change, through his Minister's advice, under this clause. I can see absolutely nothing wrong with giving the Senate that responsibility; in effect, that is what we are here for. The Senate is a House of review, and we are here to review the legislation that comes before the House. I do not think we can support Senator Tate's argument that, because we did not do it when we were in government, therefore it must be wrong. Certainly, one would expect a little more from Senator Tate, who is leading the debate for the Government.

If that is exactly analogous, then of course that sort of thing goes on the whole time. I suppose, ultimately, the Prime Minister and the Government of which he is a part, are answerable at the following election. That is the mechanism which is used there. But if the process is exactly analogous to that-and that is what I understood his reply to mean-then I have some difficulty in seeing why we should object to this unless we are going to make the redistribution of functions always a process which is disallowable before Parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are several clauses to which I wish to refer very briefly, but to which I do not wish to move any amendments. They are clauses which have appeared as a result of action taken within the Committee, or action taken by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, but in any event action which has led to new clauses being included. I refer first to clause 11, which appears on page 9. I observe that clause 11, which is the clause concerning the corporate plan, did not appear in the 1988 Bill, the first Bill we saw. It has appeared subsequently as a result of Senate inquiries and other concerns, and I am grateful to the Government that this clause has been included as it will result in some improvement in accountability. In the same way clause 24 of the Bill concerns guidelines for the Commission. In the 1988 Bill there was no provision for the publication of guidelines and there is such a provision now; it has been corrected in the 1989 Bill. I note that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee in 1989 has reported on this proposed clause as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>This clause allows the Commission to formulate written guidelines relating to the making of loans to natural persons, and the giving of guarantees in respect of loans given to natural persons. </PARA>
<PARA> Subclause (5) requires the Chief Executive officer to give notice of the making of the guidelines in the Gazette. </PARA>
<PARA> The opinion of the Committee is that such guidelines should be tabled before Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the view which the Scrutiny of Bills Committee then put to the Minister. The Minister informed the Committee in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has sought an explanation as to why guidelines made pursuant to clause 24 are only required to be published in the Gazette, and not tabled in Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The primary reason is that these are the Commission's own guidelines, and not the Minister's. The Commission would not be able to make guidelines which are inconsistent with the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The Scrutiny of Bills Committee then thanks the Minister for his response. I have to say to the Committee that I believe the Scrutiny of Bills Committee made a reasonable suggestion, namely, that such guidelines should be tabled before the Parliament. I am disappointed in the response the Minister gave. I am disappointed that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee accepted that explanation but, having said that, it is not the intention of the Opposition to move any frivolous amendments and I do not intend to pursue the matter. However, I want to draw it to the attention of the Committee because it is a matter that gave us some concern. </PARA>
<PARA> The third matter to which I wish to refer is clause 25 of the Bill, concerning the review of operation of the Act. I refer honourable senators to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs and to recommendation 4 of that Committee's work, which dealt particularly with this matter of review of operation of the Act. I refer particularly to paragraphs 2.18, 2.52, 2.55 and 2.60. At 2.18 the Senate Select Committee states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee considers that the Commissioners of ATSIC will have a difficult and at times ambiguous role in seeking to reconcile their representative and executive responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate that it was this difficulty between representative and executive responsibility that did worry the Select Committee and to which we gave a unanimous statement in this paragraph. I go back to the report:</PARA>
<PARA>It is not difficult to envisage circumstances in which the Commissioners, as representatives of the Aboriginal and Islander communities, might find themselves in conflict with the Minister or in disagreement with Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA>At paragraph 2.52 the Committee said:</PARA>
<PARA>At the national level the link between the Aboriginal and Islander communities and Government will be provided by the twelve elected ATSIC Commissioners. The Commissioners-</PARA>
<PARA>and 12 was the figure at that stage-</PARA>
<PARA>will be required to fill two roles-those of elected representatives of the Aboriginal people and the executive board of a major statutory authority. </PARA>
<PARA>The succeeding paragraphs make the same point. Paragraph 2.55 states:</PARA>
<PARA>As elected representatives the Commissioners will be particularly subject to those pressures. The accountability of Commissioners is emphasised in clause 32 of the ATSIC Bill which provide for the possibility of their recall. </PARA>
<PARA>I just interpolate there that the clause numbers were the clause numbers then existing, so honourable senators should not worry if they do not match up now. Paragraph 2.60 is the recommendation of the Senate Select Committee. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that the ATSIC Bill be amended to require the Commission to report to the Minister and to Parliament within 18 months of ATSIC's establishment on:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the potential conflicts of purpose and responsibility identified in paragraphs 2.18 and 2.52-2.55; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) suggested legislative amendment to resolve these conflicts. </PARA>
<PARA>The first thing is to thank the Government for having responded to that recommendation, for the Select Committee does acknowledge that that was our recommendation. The Government has now put in a clause about review of operation of the Act. But I do notice that, where the recommendation of the Select Committee was that it should occur after 18 months, the Government has decided that it should occur after two years. It might be interesting to know why it did not simply accept the Select Committee's recommendation on that matter. I have to say the Minister has given no explanation at this stage why he changed that timing, and we would like to know. The proposal as it exists in clause 25 appears to be harmless, but really the amount of confusion there has been in the development of the legislation is amazing and this is another clause that has had to be added as a result of the scrutiny of the previous Bill by the Senate. I understand that Senator Coulter also agrees that this clause should be here. I do not wish to move any amendment to it, but I thought those observations were appropriate and should be made at this stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not going to delay the Committee's consideration of the most important amendments which we have before us, but I might just respond to the 18 months to two years business period for review by the Commission. In fact subclause 25 (4) reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Commission shall report to the Minister within 2 years after the appointment of the first elected Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that indicates that in fact it could happen in 18 months but it was thought that to put that as the necessary time might be a little too short. `Within 2 years' I think gives that simple flexibility, and that is the simple reason for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a little surprised that we are dealing with these things out of order. I thought we were going to deal with all these matters at the end of the debate in the committee stage. As the matter has now been raised, those Aboriginal people who have been contacting me in the last couple of weeks and opposing the passage of the ATSIC Bill have been saying things such as, `We oppose ATSIC. We think that the Government should set up a system wherein the Aboriginal people can decide for themselves how the administration of Aboriginal affairs is going to operate.' Clause 25 is, of course, a key clause in that respect. Senator Peter Baume has drawn attention to the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. The Committee was very concerned that ATSIC be the instrument by which Aboriginal people could review the Commission and cause its evolution towards something which was more appropriate to their needs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fears which are being expressed, I find, are expressed in some ignorance of the way in which I think clause 25 will operate, and I hope it will operate. As I said in the second reading stage of the debate of this Bill, in a sense it is quite inappropriate for this white Parliament to set up a structure which is non-Aboriginal for Aboriginal people. I see no other way round the dilemma but to set up a structure which is broadly representative and then hand that structure to Aboriginal people to make of it something which is more appropriate to their needs. Clause 25 is the clause which allows that evolutionary process to occur and allows for guidance by the Aboriginal people. It is the clause which gives effect essentially to the self-determination and self-management proposals of ATSIC. I appreciate Senator Baume raising that now because I think it is a clause which needs to be emphasised. </PARA>

<PARA> (13) Page 9, subclause 10 (3), lines 2 to 4, leave out the subclause. </PARA>
<PARA>These amendments all relate to clause 10 of the Bill. I accept Senator Coulter's point. I was not trying to move out of order but that earlier point seemed to be an appropriate place to mention the other matters I wanted to refer to. Clause 10 of the Bill concerns the powers of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). The three amendments which I have moved together all relate to those powers provided in clause 10. I note that we have already agreed to an amendment by the Government to subclause 10 (2)(a)-we did that last week-so when we are reading clause 10 we must remember that it has already been amended. Subclause (2) of clause 10 gives to the Commission the power to negotiate and cooperate with other Commonwealth bodies and to negotiate with and cooperate with State, Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory and local government bodies. I ask the Committee to note that that is the first power that is given. Secondly, clause 10 (2) confers a power on ATSIC:</PARA>
<PARA>to enter into an agreement for the payment of a grant to a State or the Northern Territory under section 18,</PARA>
<PARA>It gives a power to the Commission:</PARA>
<PARA>to enter into an agreement (other than an agreement referred to in paragraph (b)) with a State or Territory,</PARA>
<PARA>It also gives the Commission certain other powers. The Opposition believes-and I put this to the Committee-that it simply is not appropriate for a statutory body to have the power to negotiate directly with States and Territories about the payment of moneys under section 96 of the Constitution. Moneys that are paid to a State or Territory of the kind referred to here are what we in this place all call section 96 grants. Such activities should be and should remain the responsibility of a Minister who is directly answerable to the Parliament. Section 96 grants are made to the States on such terms and conditions as the Parliament specifies. We know that they are one of the main instruments by which money is transferred from the Federal Government in this country. I remember when I was Minister the States used to love the section 96 grants. They would say to me, `Leave the cheque under the door and go away'. I remember that when Senator Collins was in another legislature we used to discuss this matter sometimes. </PARA>
<PARA> The question the Committee has to answer is whether the Parliament is content, or should be content, to delegate to the commissioners of ATSIC the making of whatever arrangements with the States they wish, in the process delegating to the commissioners of ATSIC the power to set, in the name of the Parliament, whatever terms and conditions they like. On our reading of clause 10, as it is written, that is what is proposed. We believe that questions of constitutional propriety come up relating to the difficult interface between this particular Commission-and I accept what the Minister has said about his desire to enhance Aboriginal self-management-and the Parliament and the proper responsibilities of each body. We think that the Government's Bill, with a proposed power for the Commission to deal directly with State governments and to make grants to State governments-section 96 grants-typifies the Government's confusion about the proper role of a statutory authority, on the one hand, and of a department of state on the other. ATSIC is not a department of state. It cannot stand in the place of a department of state, and nor should the States accept such an arrangement. I do not think the States will accept such an arrangement-and then we are going to have a fine old brawl. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, this clause relates to the way in which the Commonwealth will deal with the States in matters related to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The Minister did not consult with the States or the Northern Territory on this clause, and at a meeting of the Aboriginal Affairs Ministers at the Australian Aboriginal Affairs Council perhaps a year ago, many of the Ministers made their unhappiness about this known. They are unhappy. The Bill appeared, but on a matter involving relationships between the Commonwealth and the States there was no prior consultation. They told the Minister that they were unhappy and they told him that the arrangement was no good, but there was no acknowledgment of any of that in the second reading speech and nor has there ever been any reasoned response to the concerns which were expressed by State Ministers about provisions like this one. </PARA>
<PARA> State Ministers want to deal with the Commonwealth Minister. They wish to deal government to government. Whatever the Minister may say about there being no intention-and he says there is no intention-to vary or even abolish States grants, there is no doubt from our reading of the Bill that the Commission would have the capacity to take action to achieve such a result if it was so minded. Honourable senators may say that it would not be so minded, but the capacity is there. That is what the Bill says. I have to ask the Minister: Is it not true that the fact is that, because there is no obligation on the part of the Commission to enter into agreements with States, it may decide not to do so? What are the States to think about the States grant funding which has been part of the funding of Aboriginal affairs for a long time now, a matter of hard negotiation and accountability? What are the States to think when they read this? As that is written, the States grants could disappear. Subclause 10 (3) is relevant here:</PARA>
<PARA>The power of the Commission to enter into agreements of the kind referred to in paragraph 2 (c) shall not be exercised without the written approval of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>But although that seems to provide some protection, it does not mean that the Minister has to approve the content of any agreement entered into by ATSIC. His approval needs to be obtained only at the threshold. It is approval to enter into an agreement. Read the words. That is what they say. The Commission will need the permission of the Minister to enter into an agreement of the kind referred to in paragraph 2 (c). Those are the words there in proposed clause 10 (3). Once that approval is obtained and once it is then possible for ATSIC to go ahead and carry out that negotiation for which agreement has now been sought and obtained from the Minister, the contents of the agreement will be then something for ATSIC to decide in consultation with the States, and if the Parliament did not like what was proposed, ATSIC could easily decide not to make any further States grants payments or could use the other powers which are conferred on it. Because of those concerns, and again because I genuinely wish to avoid any backlash-I genuinely do not want to provide the kinds of circumstances which will provoke and which will intensify a sense of threat at State level; I do not want to see made more easy a capacity for inflammatory reporting in some of the State and Territory newspapers-because of all that, we have proposed a set of amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 11 seeks to leave out the words `negotiate and' so that if that was done clause 10 (2) (a) would then read `to co-operate with other Commonwealth bodies and with State, Australian Capital Territory, Territory and other local government bodies'. Amendment (12) proposes to leave out paragraphs 2 (b) and 2 (c). We propose to leave those out for the reasons which I have made clear in the arguments I have advanced. We think they relate to States grants type agreements, States grants type functions. We think those are properly matters for government. I can say, perhaps, they are matters for government to undertake on the advice of ATSIC, but they are matters for government to government behaviour. Our amendment (13) proposes that subclause (3) be left out. Subclause (3) is really no protection at all, for reasons which I have already set out in the arguments I have advanced. I commend to the Senate amendments (11), (12) and (13) which have been circulated in my name. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the beginning of the debate on ATSIC, I made the point in one of my speeches that this ATSIC Bill was setting up a black parliament. When I read the powers of the Commission, which are:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) to negotiate and co-operate with other Commonwealth bodies and with State, Territory and local government bodies;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to enter into an agreement for the payment of a grant to a State or to the Northern Territory under section 18;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) to enter into an agreement (other than an agreement referred to in paragraph (b)) with a State or Territory-</PARA>
<PARA>I believe my worst fears are well founded. As ATSIC stands, under these clauses, this Government is abrogating its responsibility to deal with State governments and is passing that responsibility onto the mega-commission of ATSIC. This is clearly a responsibility of allocating funds to State and Territory governments; it is clearly the responsibility of a Commonwealth government to allocate those funds. I join with Senator Peter Baume in saying that what will happen ultimately-and maybe this is what the Government wants; maybe this is the hidden agenda that it is seeking-is that, if responsibility is taken away from the State governments and they have to come cap in hand to ATSIC to get funding, they will very quickly lose interest in Aboriginal affairs. I believe that this has happened in a number of States now; that they have completely withdrawn funding and are allocating only funding that is coming from the Federal Government. This is the inherent danger that this Government runs. If we take the government to government responsibility away and allocate it to a commission, the State or Territory government then has to rely on the Commission for its funding. It says quite clearly in the Bill that this could be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> My fear is that the Federal Government, through ATSIC, is going to remove-or is trying to remove-State governments' responsibility under State legislation. That will not be helpful at all to the Aboriginal communities. Quite a considerable amount of money in some States is put into Aboriginal communities and Aboriginal development, both in the communities and in urban towns such as Townsville, Cairns, and so forth. That money is providing things such as funds for fishing projects. As I mentioned before, about seven million acres have been allocated by the Queensland Government to Aboriginal communities. If the Federal Government wants that sort of cooperation withdrawn by State governments, if it wants State governments to just walk away from Aboriginal responsibilities, this is the right way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> I am fearful that this could be part of the Government's agenda-to remove State governments' responsibility for Aborigines. If that is the way it wants to go, it should be very careful, because the State governments have areas under the Constitution that they administer. I refer, for instance, to the allocation of land and so forth. If they walk away from their responsibilities because of the pressures the Government imposes on them with this legislation, it will do irreparable harm to the Aboriginal people, both in the communities and in urban situations. I certainly could not support this clause entitled `Powers of Commission'. It is totally irresponsible for the Federal Government to give responsibility to an Aboriginal community to negotiate with State governments. I know that the State governments have never entered into any agreement. In fact, many State government Ministers received fewer representations from the Minister than did many of the Aboriginal communities, and they received zero. This clause, in my opinion, will completely remove the reason for the States to have responsibility for Aboriginal affairs, and I think that must be opposed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to the first amendment, to delete the words `negotiate and', I cannot accept that amendment, and Senator Baume has not advanced any good reason why those words should be deleted. It seems to me that the deletion of those words leaves one with an impossible situation in that the Commission will have powers to cooperate with various bodies. The natural question, of course, is what happens if those bodies refuse to cooperate. The Commission has no powers whatsoever. It is quite appropriate to include the words `negotiate and cooperate' so that in the event that the body concerned refuses to cooperate, at least the Commission has the technical facility, the legal facility, to negotiate with that body and attempt to bring it into a more cooperative situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the other amendments, which are far more substantial, it seems to me that this is another example of the double-edged sword nature of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), to which Senator Baume drew attention earlier. He drew attention to the fact that the commissioners will be both a representative and an executive body. That creates a very difficult situation for them in relation to the discharge of both of those duties when one of them may be in conflict with the other. Indeed, both of them could be in conflict with the direction they are getting from the Minister, so one could really have a three-way problem emerging there. I think the Minister is aware of that and certainly the Senate Select Committee was aware of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The clauses in front of us now create another double-edged sword in that if ATSIC is going to discharge properly its responsibility with respect to getting the best administration of Aboriginal affairs, it is appropriate that, if it sees that money is being distributed unwisely, it have the potential ability to correct that. What I have just said anticipates a situation in which eventually one might see all money going into Aboriginal affairs flowing through ATSIC and part of that may, in the wisdom of the ATSIC be distributed through State bodies, be they government or whatever. The obverse of that, the downside of that, as Senator Boswell has pointed out, is that we may then finish up with a relatively small grant to ATSIC from an impecunious or tight Federal government, the States having washed their hands of Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The potential for self-management and self-determination is what lies behind these clauses and I would be very interested to hear from the Minister as to how he sees the balance between the upside and the downside of those clauses. I see that there is an upside and a downside; it could be quite disastrous, as indicated by the Opposition. On the other hand, it is a desirable power for ATSIC to have if it is going to direct properly the whole range of Aboriginal services in the way in which Aboriginal people themselves determine. The Senate Committee became aware of the large amount of money that currently flows through from the Commonwealth to the States into Aboriginal affairs and that totally avoids reviews, control or direction by Aboriginal people. I think the Committee saw that as an undesirable thing. I guess these clauses are in here to correct that, and if they are properly administered that would be to the advantage of Aboriginal people. I certainly would like to hear the Minister's comment on the flip side of that situation, which is the one to which Senator Boswell has drawn our attention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Confronted as we are by these amendments moved by the Opposition and sought to be given passage by the Committee, I still think I need to go back to a constantly reiterated claim by Senator Baume that the Opposition has lost the second reading debate and is merely trying to improve the Bill. I really think that part of the second reading principle, though, was that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the old Aboriginal Development Commission have been superseded by ATSIC and therefore it is not surprising that a clause like clause 10 is proposed. When one looks at the other amendment the Opposition intends to move within this group, one can see that really what it is attempting to do is to go back to the situation where the Minister makes these grants to the States, obviously on the advice of the Department. The whole scheme of ATSIC is to move beyond that old method and to vest certain powers in the Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to those particular powers, subclause 10 (2) (a) has been sufficiently commented on. As to subclause 2 (b), I found it surprising that Senator Peter Baume felt that that permitted the Commission to `make a grant for any purpose it likes', because it is somewhat limited, of course, by clause 18, which indicates:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Commission may, on such terms and conditions as it determines, make loans or grants of money to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the States and the Northern Territory;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) State, Territory and local government bodies;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporations or;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) any other incorporated bodies;</PARA>
<PARA>for the purpose of furthering the social, economic or cultural development of Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a particular ministerial veto, if you like, over 18 (1) (d) grants. But it is quite clear there that there is a specific purpose that has to be furthered by the agreements for the payment of a grant to a State or to the Northern Territory or to the Australian Capital Territory that is envisaged in subclause 2 (b). One has to recall that there will be a parliamentary supervision of the estimates and that, when moneys are appropriated to enable the Commission to make payments to a State or to the Northern Territory or to the Australian Capital Territory, that will appear in the estimates. </PARA>

That seems to me to be a perfectly sensible proposition. By the way, talking about entering into an agreement, and looking at 10 (2) (c) and combining that with 10 (3), I think Senator Baume made the remarkable proposition that all that was required was the written approval of the Minister to start the negotiations. That is how he read `enter into an agreement'. `Enter into an agreement' obviously means to agree, and encompasses the whole agreement, the whole process, the whole conclusion, the whole matter of agreeing. It is not just that preliminary or threshold matter, I think the honourable senator said, of entering into negotiations for an agreement. That is a significant power retained in the Minister, a sort of reserve power in 10 (3) in relation to 10 (2) (c).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that the Commission is vested with this power. Any payments under 10 (2) (b) will be subject to this Parliament's scrutiny. I think that helps lessen Senator Boswell's concern that a black parliament is emerging-I think that was the term he used-because quite clearly this Parliament retains the ultimate control over the appropriations of moneys out of our Treasury. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened very carefully to Senator Coulter and to the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), and I want to try to respond to some of the points Senator Coulter made. I hope I have understood him correctly. Senator Coulter says that he thinks it is desirable that the Commission should have the power to do some of these things, but he appreciates the concerns we have. He says that we are looking, as it were, at worst case scenarios at the very least.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What concerns us is that we read this clause-and we read the powers we are concerned about-as enabling States grants to be made other than through direct government to government negotiations; in fact, that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) would be taking the place of the Government. We did not write the Australian Constitution. As every honourable senator in the Committee knows, we have had enormous trouble trying to change it. We are simply required to work with it as it is and we are bound by it as it is. Honourable senators will know that it lays down the circumstances in which there shall be departments of state; it lays down the responsibilities of Ministers of state; and we believe that there are certain matters which are properly government to government matters. I think the making of States grants is one of those. </PARA>
<PARA> As I listened to Senator Coulter I wondered whether there was not some common ground here in this way: if the new Commission could make recommendations as to the content of agreements between the Commonwealth and the States and if the new Commission could make recommendations to the Minister for the amounts to be provided by money, I still think it is constitutionally desirable and necessary that the actual agreement should be made government to government and that the actual grants should be made Minister to Minister or government to government. </PARA>
<PARA> Our concern really is that, as the provision is written now, section 96 grants, as we have understood them-grants made to the States on such terms and conditions as the Parliament specifies-have been turned into something quite new. They will be, as it were, section 96 grants to be made by the Commission to governments on such terms and conditions as it specifies and sets out by agreement. If I have heard Senator Coulter correctly, he is saying to us, `I am not willing to get rid of those words.' But he understands our concern. Perhaps the powers of the Commission should be redrawn so that they are powers to recommend to the Minister that he enter into an agreement for the payment of a grant to a State or the Northern Territory or to recommend to the Minister that the Minister enter into an agreement with a State or Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> If that were the case, at least it would re-establish a more constitutionally proper relationship, government to government, and I believe it would still overcome the criticism that Senator Tate made. Having lost the principle, he says, `Why not let it operate?'. We are saying that it should not because it is constitutionally offensive as it is written at the present time. I use the word `offensive' in quite a technical sense. If I have heard both honourable senators correctly, that would be the other way to try to overcome the concern of the Opposition but I wonder what the response would be to that interpretation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the burden of the honourable senator's next two or three amendments, should they pass. It is already down here that the arrangements should operate through a Minister as far as making grants of money to the States is concerned. It is not inconsistent with section 96. Section 96 says that the Parliament may make such grants of financial assistance to the States on such terms and conditions as it thinks fit. It does not talk about agreements. That is the big difference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The particular provision that we are inserting into this Bill talks about the capacity of the Commission to enter into an agreement with a State for the payment of a grant to a State or to the Northern Territory. It is a two-way process. It requires consensus on both sides. It requires a meeting of minds of the State government negotiating and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. Senator Baume is looking up the actual words but I think he will find that it merely talks about a grant of financial assistance and it does not have this contractual-consensual agreement element in it. I believe that that is the heart of the matter-that if a State does not come to an agreement, then there is no meeting of minds, there is no fruitful negotiation and that is the major difference with section 96. Of course, this does not prevent the Commonwealth Government making a grant to a State government on such terms and conditions as it thinks fit under section 96; it does not affect that capacity at all. </PARA>

I believe there will be needless friction if the Commonwealth is determined to proceed this way, if it is determined to proceed with this clause simpliciter, unamended. I cannot understand why the Minister keeps saying that it is competent for the Commonwealth to make grants if it so wishes. We also know that it may be competent for the Commission, without any discussion with the States, simply to wind down State grants. That is quite clearly provided for.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has a meeting and suddenly says, `We decide, by vote of the Commission, not to attempt to enter into any State grants with the State of Tasmania'-if it was the Minister's State-it has that power as this clause is written. It does not have to take any action. I believe that that will cause immense trouble for almost every Commonwealth government that has to wear this arrangement. I would like Senator Coulter to re-explain his position. If he is saying that the provision should remain, I am saying if it is to remain, it should remain with the Minister actually making the grant, whether or not the actual work and negotiation by the Commission goes on; as a matter of constitutional propriety, it should be done by the Minister on a government to government basis-both the signing of the agreement and the passing over of the money. I would like to hear Senator Coulters's argument as to why he thinks, as this is written, it is an appropriate arrangement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say to the Committee that if this stands as it is there will be enormous trouble around Australia in the next few years. It is not necessary. My father used to say to me, `Never fight with someone unintentionally. Don't start a brawl unless you intend to do so'. Why pursue this clause unamended? It will simply start a brawl that will go on around Australia. I have never seen this kind of arrangement before. It may exist, but I do not know of it. It is a completely new approach to States grants in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am interested to hear the sort of metaphor that Senator Baume uses. One might say, `Never make love unintentionally', or something like that. It might be better than waging war or battles unintentionally. Senator Baume has not understood the point that I was making. Moreover, the Minister has not answered the question that I asked him. I agree with the Minister and with the drafters of the Bill that it is appropriate that these clauses should be included, but I was drawing attention to the fact that they do, however, contain a danger. I think Senator Boswell drew our attention to that danger.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister used this example: `What happens if, say, the State of Western Australia wants to put a sewer into an Aboriginal settlement?'. It might approach the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and say, `Could you provide us with some financial assistance to do this? It is, after all, going into an Aboriginal community.' It seems to me absolutely appropriate that ATSIC, as a representative body of the Aboriginal people, might say, `We don't agree with the way in which the Western Australian Government is distributing its funds. It is not in the best interests of Aboriginal people.' The Government, on the contrary, might say that it is in the interests of Aboriginal people to establish a mine in an area in which Aborigines do not want a mine. The Government might say that it was in Aboriginal interests. It might try to impose something the Aboriginal people did not want and it might use some of its State moneys for Aboriginal affairs in a way which was anathema to Aboriginal desires and not in Aboriginal interests. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is appropriate, if we have the courage of what this legislation is about, to give to ATSIC the ability not only to determine policy-that is one of the areas we debated earlier-but also to give effect to that policy by being able to administer money, to make grants and to enter into agreements. In this part that encompasses the ability to make agreements with the States, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> But Senator Boswell raised the issue-this is what concerns me somewhat-of what happens if we go down this desirable road, if most of the money into Aboriginal affairs flows through ATSIC and is being administered, perhaps quite wisely, by ATSIC, but an Aboriginal community in Western Australia requires a sewerage system or something of that nature and the Western Australian Government says, `Sorry, we are not going to provide that to you because that should come through ATSIC'. I understand that is the point Senator Boswell was making. The down side of what we are doing here, which I see as desirable, is that it may lead to State governments and other bodies withdrawing funds which would otherwise go into genuine Aboriginal welfare, but which may not be funded through ATSIC. So some Aboriginal people might fall through a hole, as it were, for that reason. I would like the Minister's comment on that because, while I see these clauses as desirable for the reasons that I have stated, we really are dependent upon the continuing goodwill of the States to continue their functions also in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the Minister responds to Senator Coulter, I want to use the analogy of a sewerage system in Western Australia. The Western Australian Government is responsible for land, local government and a number of areas that have been given to the States by the Australian Constitution. What I fear, Minister, is that if grant funding under section 96 were taken from the Federal Government and given direct to the State governments, great animosity would be created, whether we like it or not, and the people who would feel that animosity would be the Aboriginal people. They would feel it because State governments would lose interest. When that hypothetical sewerage system was proposed in Western Australia, the Western Australian Government could say, `Well, that's a Commonwealth responsibility. It has accepted all responsibility for Aboriginals and has just cut us out'. It probably would not be done intentionally but that is what would happen; the Government knows it and I know it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the best interests of Aboriginal people we have got to keep the State governments interested in Aboriginal development because of the responsibilities that they control-land, local government, harbours, marine, fishing, wildlife et cetera. If we treat State governments with contempt-that is what the Government is doing, downgrading all the State and Territory governments of Australia-we will downgrade the Ministers and there will not be Minister to Minister contact. There will be less ministerial council contact. Inevitably-it will happen as surely as night follows day-the State Aboriginal Department, or whatever they call themselves-Community Affairs in Queensland, Aboriginal Affairs, Department of Aboriginal Affairs or whatever they are called-will be downgraded and will be less of a department than they were when they had Minister to Minister contact, and the people who will get hurt are Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter has picked that up. I know Senator Coulter and I know the Democrats' policy on State governments. He is not one to support them. But the facts are that we have got them there; they are closest to the people, and they have all the equipment. They know what they are doing on the ground, and we are going to remove them by degree out of Aboriginal Affairs. That must be stopped at all costs. Senator Coulter, to his credit, has picked that up, and he deserves congratulations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition's amendments, what we have called group 3, or amendments 11, 12 and 13, relate to the powers of the Commission under clause 10. I would like to reinforce the points made by Senator Peter Baume as to the manner in which any of these agreements that would be structured between ATSIC and either State or Territory governments could be misused. This has to be very carefully read alongside the preamble to the Bill. Whilst I appreciate that will be subject to a later debate in the committee stage, it is important to recognise what the preamble states. Amongst a whole number of other things, it recognises that Aboriginal people were `the prior occupiers and original owners of this land'. It states, `whereas they were dispossessed' and `have no recognised rights over land yet recognised', and, further on, `whereas . . . to reach a lasting and equitable agreement with on the use of their land'. Further on it states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . it is the firm objective of the people of Australia that policies and programs be maintained and developed by the Governments of the Commonwealth, the States and Territories, that will overcome the economic and social disadvantages of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is appropriate to establish measures for the furtherance of the aforementioned objective. </PARA>
<PARA>Very clearly, then, the commissioners of ATSIC will see it in the terms of that preamble to the legislation that has been set down, that they will have a responsibility to hold, if necessary to ransom, other levels and forms of government in the negotiations for the financial arrangements which will have to be entered into. That has a direct relationship to national land rights policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has not come out and said there will be objectives, but in reading those two alongside each other, what is in the preamble, what are the commitments and the statements and what are the powers that the commissioners will feel that they have with which to direct and look at their own objectives, then it will be incumbent on them. That builds in again the point I was making earlier. That hits the different levels of government and the new Commission directly against the very purposes that we are all seeking to achieve-to improve the lot of Aboriginal people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address the Senate tonight on the question of the provision of living areas for Aboriginal people who are living in the direst of circumstances on cattle stations in the Northern Territory. So far as these people are concerned it has often been said, I think principally in the media, that these people were the people whom, `the lands rights Act forgot'. In fact, that is not true. These people were not forgotten by the people who drafted the 1976 Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. They were deliberately excluded from the operations of the Act because the Act specifically provided only for claims to be made on unalienated crown land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was the view of the politicians of the day that as prepared as they were to provide opportunities for Aboriginal people only in the Northern Territory to make claim on unalienated crown land, that is vacant crown land, they were not prepared to extend the ambit of that opportunity beyond unalienated land to land that was alienated. I must say that it would not be difficult to find Aboriginal people who could legitimately lay claim under the same criteria that are used in the land rights Act to almost every square inch in the Northern Territory. It is simply a question of trying to provide opportunities for Aboriginal people to get some redress and justice in this day and age, so late after all of the injustice that has been done to them, in a way that will not frighten the horses or break the bank or do any of those other things. It is the art of the possible, as is often said about politics. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason I canvass that is so that people do not forget that what we are talking about now is the provision of areas on land that indeed is alienated and is used for pastoral pursuits and raising cattle. The original position of the parties in this matter, so far as the majority of cattlemen in the Northern Territory was concerned, was that they just wished the whole issue would go away and, from their point of view, one could hardly blame them. Their primary concern was to run a viable cattle property. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as the Northern Territory Government was concerned, it was prepared to provide excisions of living areas under existing Northern Territory title for people who were living on cattle stations and no one else. So far as the Northern Territory land councils were concerned, their original position was that they wanted an open ended process applied, utilising Commonwealth procedures, with a Commonwealth tribunal acquiring the land, as it would have been necessary to have acquired it, by compulsory acquisition of the Commonwealth. The reality is that if the people who live in these appalling circumstances on cattle stations ever receive any justice at all, none of these positions can be sustained. </PARA>
<PARA> The current position is that after long negotiation a stage has been reached where 95 per cent of the ground between the Northern Territory Government and the Commonwealth Government is common ground. That is the reason I am rising to speak in this debate tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> Like most backbenchers speaking in the adjournment debate, I am not speaking on behalf of the Government, I am speaking as a senator for the Northern Territory and as a person who has a personal interest in resolving this problem. When I say that 95 per cent of the ground is common ground I do not want to detract from the seriousness of the issues that still remain to be resolved. The Commonwealth is currently proposing to schedule certain areas of land that are on stock routes and reserves as living areas. The Commonwealth Government wants to schedule these areas as a schedule to the 1976 Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. In other words, they become instantly by a declaration of this Parliament Aboriginal land. The Northern Territory Government wants to deal with these areas of land in the same way as the majority of the excisions, that is, the ones that will be heard by tribunals or simply negotiated directly by consent between the parties. </PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Territory Government's position is clear and has merit. The Northern Territory Government is saying, `If the Commonwealth is prepared to accept the amended form of title we are offering on what in effect will be 95 per cent of the cases involved as being sufficient protection for the interests of the Aboriginal people involved, then by inexorable logic the Commonwealth should be prepared to accept that amended form of title as being sufficient protection for all of them'. However, the position is that Aboriginal people, if they pursue the avenues that are still open to them by making land claims over these areas and follow that course to a successful conclusion, are currently in a position where they have a legal right to end up with Commonwealth title at the end of the day. The Commonwealth feels that it is not right to extinguish that position. So the Commonwealth is now determined upon a course, which I support, that says that some of these areas are going to be scheduled. </PARA>
<PARA> These areas have grown in number. At the time this matter was negotiated with the then Tuxworth Government there were 11 of these areas, and the number has now grown to 46. I understand that the Minister is currently considering something in excess of 20 of these areas being granted. These areas are subject to Aboriginal land claim, and by scheduling these to the Act the Commonwealth Government, as the Northern Territory Government has pointed out, is circumventing the land claim process. This is true, but I might add that considerable precedent exists for it. When the 1976 Act was enacted very substantial areas of land were simply scheduled, that is, that land involving all of the then existing reserves. However, I believe that there are a number of reasonable pre-conditions for scheduling this land that have to be satisfied by the Commonwealth. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is, that the pieces of land that are going to be provided as living areas are fit to live upon, and although that sounds obvious it may not be so obvious. I refer in particular to the existence of potable water supplies. There is very little surface water in most of these areas and in the country in which these areas are located it is often very difficult to find ground water. There is very little point in going through a process of drawing lines on a map and surveying boundaries for living areas if afterwards people are not able to live on them. So I think it is essential that the Commonwealth satisfy itself that these living areas are capable of sustaining life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth also has to be satisified that they do not detrimentally affect the economic viability of the cattle station as a cattle station. Thirdly, the Commonwealth has to satisfy itself, and indeed others, that people will live on them after they are declared. I say that because I believe that in respect of these scheduled areas the Minister has to be satisfied before the areas are scheduled that the same need criterion which is going to be applied to all of the other excisions that may be granted by the tribunal process is applied to these areas of land that are going to be scheduled as well. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of all of this I believe that once the Commonwealth is satisfied that all these conditions have been met-and, in response to Senator Tambling's earlier interjections, I would hope that these matters have already been resolved-the Commonwealth Government must be in a position to then provide to the Northern Territory Government precise detail of how many of these areas are going to be granted, where they are and what their boundaries are. Now there is a reason for this. The Commonwealth has placed upon the Northern Territory Government deadlines that have to be met in respect of a substantial number of excisions being successfully processed by the Northern Territory Government by a due date. I do not think that is an unreasonable expectation of the Federal Government. However, if the Federal Government is not in a position to provide the Northern Territory Government-and the cattlemen who are directly affected by this-with precise details of how many of these areas are to be scheduled, where they are and what their exact boundaries are, I believe that any deadlines that are placed on the Northern Territory Government to comply similarly are unreasonable from its point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> The much vexed question has been raised concerning the proclamation of section 50 of the land rights legislation. The section was inserted by a former Minister, Clyde Holding, and has never been proclaimed. That section of the Act prevents further claims on stock routes and reserves. The Northern Territory Government and indeed the cattlemen have always insisted that this commitment be honoured as a precondition of excisions proceeding. I believe that this matter can be resolved by negotiation and that the solution to the problem is to proclaim this section of the Act at the same time as the living areas that I have just spoken about are scheduled. There remains the far more difficult job of determining those areas of land that are to be set aside for Aboriginals by a process of hearings before a tribunal. The total number of potential excision applications as indicated by the land councils has exceeded 250. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once the process started I think that the actual number would be much higher. As far as I am concerned-and I have said this publicly on many occasions-the only viable way to proceed is to establish a Northern Territory tribunal to hear these claims. As I have also said publicly on a number of occasions, the basis on which this can be done already exists in the 1984 Aboriginal Community Living Areas Bill that was introduced into the Northern Territory Parliament by the then Chief Minister, Paul Everingham. I stress again that I am not suggesting that the Bill as it stands provides everything that is necessary and does not need to be amended. What I am saying is that it provides a substantial base on which to proceed. Just to indicate briefly to the chamber the sorts of processes that the Bill envisages, the establishment of the tribunal itself would consist of a person being the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court or his nominee, either another judge or a barrister of five years standing in the Northern Territory, and two other persons, one of whom shall be the nominee of the relevant land councils and the other who shall be a nominee of the relevant cattlemen's association. It could not, I think, be fairly said that that is an unreasonable proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I might add, for the benefit of the chamber-not that it is necessary to canvass in detail any more of this Bill-that the majority of the Bill is similarly reasonable and practicable and can be used as a basis on which to proceed with a ready-made framework for the Northern Territory tribunal-again, in response to the interjections from Senator Tambling-to expedite the process as much as we possibly can. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of eligibility as a criterion for claim is a very thorny one indeed. In my view these claims can be made only on the threshold eligibility of need. Attached to that should be the addition of the words `historical association'. Indeed the words `historical association' are also found in the 1984 Everingham Bill. I do not believe that it is necessary to include the word `traditional' in the definition of need as a criterion for making claims for two reasons: firstly, because `historical association' covers every possible contingency that I can think of that `traditional' would encompass; and, secondly, because by not using the word `traditional' it removes any emotive connotations of these claims being land claims. I think that in terms of resolving this long-running dispute the removal of any emotive connotations is necessary. </PARA>

If the question is going to be need, as I think there is general agreement now between the Northern Territory Government and the Commonwealth that it needs to be, then the people who are claiming it must be able to demonstrate to the tribunal that they actually intend to permanently reside on the land. If they do not, it will totally destroy the viability and credibility of the process that is entered upon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The importance of need is demonstrated-just to give one example-by the situation at Mount Doreen station. This pastoral property is completely surrounded on all of its boundaries by Aboriginal land, but at one time was, in addition, subjected to 15 claims for excisions. The tribunal must also have regard to the same conditions as apply to the areas that the Commonwealth proposes to schedule, and I have already mentioned these. Are the areas of land actually fit to live on? Are they capable of sustaining life? That includes such matters as the size of the block, the existence of potable water supplies, access to the block, and so on; and the detriment to the economic viability of the property concerned must also be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Territory Government has raised concerns about the land councils acting as agents for the claimants in this process. I do not believe these concerns are sustainable. The land councils are the obvious bodies to act for the claimants and this, in any case, was provided for in clause 15 of the Everingham Bill. Tribunal hearings should be as informal as it is possible to get them, but in full knowledge of the fact that many of them will not be informal-and, indeed, I imagine a number of them will be extremely litigious-I also believe that legal aid should be made available to pastoralists where they can demonstrate that they qualify for it. </PARA>
<PARA> After the process under this Northern Territory tribunal is completed, a grant of land should then follow, on a recommendation from the tribunal, by the Northern Territory Minister under the special title which is now being offered by the Northern Territory. That is a form of title which has been uniquely constructed for this particular situation. I believe that it should be possible to consider that, where the Minister has not followed the recommendations of the tribunal, his action should be subject to appeal to some kind of administrative appeals tribunal, or some other appeal process should be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other outstanding areas that need to be resolved is the question of public purpose land on living areas; that is, land that has to be acquired by the Northern Territory Government for public purposes. The Northern Territory Government wants unfettered ability to acquire permanent title under normal conditions under which that is granted. The land councils and, indeed, many Aboriginal people do not. Both sides, once again, have a good argument. The Northern Territory Government sees it as clear cut that where it wants to acquire land for what is often the benefit of the community itself, such as a school or a health clinic, there should be no bar to its simply going ahead and doing it. On the other side of the argument, the Aboriginal people concerned are rightly suspicious and distrustful-not, I hasten to say, because of any particular distrust or dislike they may have for the actions of this current Government. They have a very legitimate distrust for the generations of abuse and injustice that have been dealt out to them and their forebears. It is impossible to put that legitimate sense of grievance and distrust aside, and I do not think it should be put aside. Therefore, I believe that a middle course is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> Consent agreements between the land councils and the Northern Territory Government would provide for speedy resolution of 90 per cent or more of the cases for leases for schools, health clinics or other obvious public purposes that benefit the community directly. Where agreement cannot be reached the matter should be able to be referred by either party to the Northern Territory tribunal, the one that I just discussed. In this case, the tribunal would have to be provided, in my view, with a determinant, rather than a recommended, capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> The question then also goes to what kind of title is provided to the Northern Territory Government. The Territory Government wants a form of title which permanently alienates the land for the public purpose. I do not believe, having spoken to people who know far more about the legal complexities of title than I do, that this is required at all. In fact, I have been satisfied that a lesser form of title which did not provide for permanent alienation to the Northern Territory Government for public purpose land would be sufficient for the purposes for which land would ever be acquired for public purpose by the Northern Territory Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We move, finally, to what is a serious matter of issue between the Northern Territory Government and the Commonwealth Government, and that is the question of entrenchment in Commonwealth law of the conditions under which these titles will be granted, such entrenchment provisions being triggered by the perceived failure-or proven failure-of the Northern Territory Government to honour its undertakings. Once again, I can understand these entrenchment provisions being demanded in order for the Commonwealth to demonstrate to the Aboriginal people concerned and indeed to the world at large that it is very serious indeed about resolving this question quickly, which it is. However, the Northern Territory Government finds that this condition being held over its head prior to the detailed negotiations proceeding is highly offensive and in fact inimical to the proper process of negotiation. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I have no difficulty in supporting such a proposal I do believe that the proposal is very much an indication of the current stage of the negotiations between the Northern Territory Government and the Commonwealth and I hope that it will not be necessary to insist upon it. The reason I am speaking in the adjournment debate tonight, in fact, is that I have been advised today that the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory has been assisted in coming to Canberra this week, I understand on Wednesday, to have discussions with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in an attempt to get down to the nuts and bolts of resolving this issue in the interests of the people who have been so long neglected. I believe, Mr President, that if these negotiations are conducted in the spirit in which I hope they will be substantial agreement should be reached between the two governments on those small areas where conflict still exists. If that substantial agreement is reached, I do not believe it should be necessary to proceed with this entrenchment proposal by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The political reality, of course, is that if the Northern Territory reneges on any of the undertakings that it has given, which I personally do not believe it will, legislation to redress that situation could be very quickly introduced into this Parliament. I do not think the Australian Democrats would be too offended if I suggested that, if it were introduced because of a failure of the Northern Territory Government to honour its commitments to Aboriginal people, the Democrats would assist its being given speedy passage through both Houses of the Parliament. Therefore, I do not think that the necessity should exist for those provisions to be placed in the legislation now. I think that a far more appropriate proposal that should, in fact, be substituted in its place is a memorandum of understanding or heads of agreement detailing all of the agreed positions of the two governments and the obligations of the two governments and signed by both the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have to consider, I think, what the alternative is to such a negotiated agreement on the basis that I have suggested. I believe that what I have laid out-and I might add that I think it substantially complies with what both governments have already indicated they are prepared to do anyway-provides a fair and reasonable base for this matter to be finally resolved with justice for all of the parties concerned. The alternative to this negotiated process would be a process of compulsory acquisition by the Commonwealth Government of potentially hundreds of areas across the Northern Territory. I believe this would have horrendous consequences, including financially for the Commonwealth Government. It would have enormously beneficial effects for the legal fraternity, of course, once again. But of course millions of dollars would be spent on legal challenges both the claims themselves and to the compensation payments that would result-not to mention the political agenda that would be sparked off by what would be a prolonged and very bitter period of acrimony and legal dispute. But the major casualty in all of that exercise, Mr President, would be once again the Aboriginal people who are living on cattle stations and who have missed out for so long. I believe that under this process they would miss out again for perhaps another decade. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to say not as a senator of the Northern Territory, a member of the Government or of the Labor Party or anything else but simply as someone who has personally witnessed the appalling conditions under which these most deprived Australians live, that I hope that the discussions that will be held this week are held on the basis of mutual trust between the two governments concerned with a common desire to solve this problem to the benefit of the people who are most detrimentally affected by the existing situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One in five men responding to a survey commissioned by the Office of the Status of Women condoned the use of violence by a man against his partner. `It's okay to slap the little woman about a bit' must rank among the most pervasive of Australian myths, along with that other myth that domestic violence is a private matter. The shield of privacy must be stripped away from the perpetrators of actions which, if they occurred outside the home, would be condemned as criminal behaviour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The plight of any victim of domestic violence is great but for a woman of non-English speaking background married to an Australian it is appalling. A number of Filipino women, apparently perceived by some Australian men as compliant, acquiescent and subservient wife material, are brought to Australia as brides or fiances and find themselves in difficulties when their Australian husbands use violence against them. </PARA>
<PARA> These women are frequently isolated in society without family support: isolated by lack of language skills; by culture; by education; and occasionally by location in country or rural areas. However, many of these women are considerably better educated than their husbands and they speak English very well. Filipino-Australian marriages are likely to be as successful as marriages generally. They could well have a lower rate of breakdown, given that divorce or separation is not as acceptable to a Filipino woman because of her culture and religion. </PARA>
<PARA> When a marriage breakdown is precipitated by so-called domestic violence a Filipino woman experiences great personal and social trauma, especially if her Australian husband threatens her with divorce and deportation. The Philippine-Australian Council in Support of Filipino Women has raised a number of particular cases, two of which I will describe here. The first relates to a Filipino woman with a 15-month-old son, who has been in Australia for three years on a fiance visa. She is in a de facto relationship with the same man who nominated her and who refuses to marry her because he claims she cannot get along with his mother. He set the date for their wedding four times and four times he changed his mind. Every time she told him she would leave him, he told her he would have her deported. She is scared for herself and her baby's health because she cannot get a Medicare or health card from the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA> In the second case a Filipino woman in her early thirties was asked by her husband to leave him because he said that he would have more money as a single person on a pension-he is a handicapped person-than having a family to support, with a family pension. She left her husband after endless arguments and fights and went to live with a friend while waiting for her application for housing. In both cases the Council was able to help the women. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been many instances when Filipino women have returned to violent husbands because of these threats, because of their own isolation and because such husbands have had the protection of privacy. The same council-the Philippine-Australian Council in Support of Filipino Women-has identified some instances. In these cases two Filipino women with two children each were victims of domestic physical violence. Both left their homes with their children and were taken in at a women's refuge, but both went back to their husbands due to problems that they encountered in the refuge. In another case, a Filipino woman repeatedly abused by her husband left him to stay with a friend. She had to go back to him because of the lack of support from her friend, and also because she was afraid to live alone. </PARA>
<PARA> Few of these women avail themselves of services that may help and protect them. This could be because they are unaware that the services exist or because the husband has so isolated the woman socially that she is totally dependent on him. When a Filipino woman does approach the bureaucracy of our agencies and social services she often finds that the staff lack sensitivity to her own particular dilemma, not because they are unfeeling but because they have little or no appreciation of the utter dependency of these women on their husbands or of their difficulties with the language. Although they speak English and speak it well, many of them have difficulty understanding the Australian vernacular. It takes a woman of great resolve to make a break with what little security she has in her marriage and face almost inevitable deprivation, humiliation and possible deportation. I would like to outline the case of one such woman. </PARA>
<PARA> In August 1988 Willy Rohrbacher, aged 57, married Susana, aged 30, in the Catholic Church at Grafton. He had met his bride when she came to Australia to visit her sister, a friend of his adult daughter who is only four years younger than Susana. When Rohrbacher was introduced to Susana, and hearing that she was a registered midwife in the Philippines and therefore a professional and capable of earning money, he immediately bought an engagement and wedding ring and proposed on the spot. Susana was not on the bride market and was not prepared to grab what might have appeared to be an opportunity to set herself up in this country with house and husband. She put off the decision for three months. </PARA>
<PARA> After her marriage Susana became Rohrbacher's housekeeper, nurse and chauffeur since her husband was unable to drive. I believe she also tried to teach him English since he was not able to read or write English. She cleared land and mowed the lawns on his large block of land at Grafton while attending the technical and further education (TAFE) computer data processing advanced certificate course to prepare herself for employment. Her husband had made it clear to her that he expected to recover all the expenses that he had incurred since the wedding. Meanwhile he gave her sufficient money only to buy food. He then forced her to apply for a job as a cleaner at the Grafton Base Hospital, clearly a job that was considerably below her expectations and training. </PARA>
<PARA> A letter from Susana's godparents, Valma and Charles Burke, both justices of the peace, describes how Rohrbacher treated his newly wedded wife. In a letter to the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs they wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>She wasn't allowed to read her Bible which is very important to a catholic Filipina. He tried stopping her from going to church on Sunday mornings. Several times I-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Valma Burke-</PARA>
<PARA>had rang her and he would be shouting and abusing her in the background while I spoke to her. He would not allow her to come to the Filipina gatherings as they will all come together once a month as a family group and have a barbecue and have a lovely day, singing and talking and playing with the children. </PARA>
<PARA>Early this year Rohrbacher started beating Susana, hitting her repeatedly on the head. He threatened that if she kept answering him back he would make her a cripple. In May she received a serious beating and sustained severe head injuries. She was admitted to the Grafton Base Hospital on this occasion, complaining of severe headache, dizziness, nausea and vomiting and later was transferred to the neurosurgical ward for examination and kept there for three days. Whilst she was in the hospital she decided not to return home but to go to the Grafton women's refuge. When he discovered this, Rohrbacher harassed her in front of other patients and on the phone. Although a restraining order had been granted on 17 May, he went to the TAFE college and verbally abused her in front of her fellow students in the class. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the application for the restraining order had in itself caused Susana much distress because of her views on marriage, she decided nonetheless to leave her husband. She left without money, she left without the right to be employed in order to keep herself, and she left knowing that her husband's threat to have her deported could be realised. In response Rohrbacher withdrew his sponsorship for Susana's application for resident status. Had Rohrbacher been able to batter her into being a subservient, socially inept and isolated wife he might not have withdrawn his sponsorship. </PARA>
<PARA> I was told of Susana's dreadful situation after visiting the women's refuge at Grafton several weeks ago. I informed the social workers of the Filipino community and welfare services of her plight and they subsequently assisted her in finding accommodation out of Grafton and out of the reach of her violent husband. She now waits in Sydney in hope of a favourable consideration of her application for resident status. She does not want to violate restrictions on obtaining paid employment and so has no way of supporting herself. In the meantime she lives on special benefits of about $120 per week and pays $60 a week to share accommodation with another woman. She still requires medical care for the effects of her injuries but has no Medicare card and no money to pay for medical treatment. She had to discontinue her studies when she left Grafton but she has already commenced another computer course. She told me this evening she was the top student in her midwifery course in the Philippines but now her memory has been very badly affected by the beatings she has received. I believe that if she were to be allowed to stay in Australia she would make a valuable and positive contribution to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, however, for many women like Susana real difficulties if they contemplate returning to the Philippines. The Burkes describe the situation in the same letter to the immigration department. Filipinas will put up with more abuse and assault than Australian women to try to save the marriage and save face, as their marriage is very sacred. If this little Filipina is deported, she would rather end her life than go back to her country after getting married. She would be disgraced and would lose face and faith. She would rather die than go home and face her family disgraced. This is a well known fact. Please give her case very careful consideration as there are two sides to this story. Because of strong humanitarian and compassionate grounds, Susana should be allowed to stay. </PARA>
<PARA> The work of many women's refuges such as the well run, clean and happy place at Grafton is essential in providing women like Susana with the help she needs to get out of a marriage that has become a living nightmare. Had it not been for the assistance of Kay, Colette and Fay, Susana may have become discouraged by her prospects and returned to a life with Rohrbacher. As for Rohrbacher, he deserves to be not only charged with assault, as he has been, but also shamed publicly. He has not only abused a normal human relationship but also brutally assaulted someone who is particularly vulnerable as a newcomer to this country, someone who only months before he promised to cherish and care for. He deserves our condemnation. Perhaps he should seek therapy. </PARA>
<PARA> I would tonight also like to draw attention to the services considered necessary by the Philippine-Australian Council in Support of Filipino Women. The Council is calling for more information on employment, welfare, health, education, immigration, housing and legal aid. In particular, it recommends that more Filipino community centres should be set up to assist the settlement needs of Filipino immigrant women, particularly in areas where they are highly concentrated-Blacktown, Baulkham Hills, inner Sydney, Fairfield, Liverpool, central western Sydney, Canterbury-Bankstown, Wollongong and Newcastle. Furthermore, it is also calling for the employment of more Filipino community migrant workers who could give relevant information, support and settlement assistance in English as well as in the Filipino language. </PARA>
<PARA> The Council recommends that pamphlets and other materials relevant to immigrant assistance on employment, housing, health education, social security, et cetera, be translated into Filipino for the Filipino migrants. It recommends that there should be more Filipino interpreters. It recommends that there should be a more equitable process of overseas qualifications assessments for those Filipino migrants who have had eight to 10 years university training and several years of work experience and that appropriate bridging courses be offered to those whose qualifications do not meet the requirements for full recognition. It stresses the necessity for pre-departure counselling sessions in the Australian Embassy in the Philippines to cover the matters I have mentioned and for information seminars and sessions on cross-cultural values to be given and organised by specially trained officers of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs for Australian men and Filipino immigrant women who intend to marry in order to encourage understanding of their cultural differences. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Government and the Office of the Status of Women for the national education program to reduce domestic violence, but let us go further. Let us not abandon the victims of this violence, particularly because, through no fault of their own, they have not yet become Australian citizens. At the same time, let us remove the protection that the convention of domestic privacy gives to wife bashers like Willy Rohrbacher. Domestic violence is criminal behaviour and criminal behaviour should never be condoned as a private domestic matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise a matter that I think will be of concern to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson). I refer to the plight of Australian wetlands which are of international significance, especially those in the south-west of Western Australia. Wetlands are amongst the most productive of all biological systems. They support a diverse range of wildlife, including many species which are important for agriculture, tourism and fishing, in addition to their water and landscape values.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Western Australia has relatively few wetlands. Only the Kimberleys and the south-west provide reliable feeding and breeding sites for water birds. However, on the Swan coastal plain more than 80 per cent of the original wetlands have been destroyed by drainage, clearing and development. Those which remain are vital for the conservation of wildlife. The remaining 20 per cent of wetlands, including some of international importance, continue to be targeted for inappropriate developments. </PARA>
<PARA> International agreements to protect wetlands are supported because waterfowl do not observe national boundaries and they migrate annually between different parts of the world. Many water birds from Japan, China and Siberia visit Australia. For this reason, Australia has negotiated agreements on migratory birds with other countries. Thus, Australia has legal obligations to protect migratory water birds and their habitat. Australia is also a signatory to the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, the RAMSAR Convention. Australia was one of the original 12 countries which, in 1974, signed the Convention. The list of signatories has now grown to 52 countries and several other nations are negotiating to join the Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> The Convention includes general undertakings to protect important wetlands and specific undertakings to protect certain wetlands which are placed on the list. Each signatory must designate at least one wetland for inclusion on this list. At present there are more than 400 listed wetlands comprising 30 million hectares. Australia has 29 wetlands listed. So far no Queensland and Western Australian wetland has been listed, although both States have wetlands which qualify. Many developing countries have shown greater awareness and have listed wetlands. </PARA>
<PARA> Advantages of listing on the Convention include increased tourism, increased visitation by bird watchers and naturalist groups, and increased interest and input of resources from scientific and educational agencies. In Western Australia 12 wetlands have been identified as meeting the criteria for listing on the Convention. Australian States, other than Queensland and Western Australia, have successfully nominated wetlands. Most States are proud to have wetlands included on the list. Listing on the Convention helps to ensure that the roles of the listed wetlands in the network of transmigratory water bird habitats are recognised and protected. Wetlands under the Convention are managed by the relevant State government. However, the Commonwealth Government could show good faith and could allocate money to assist in the protection and management of the listed areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Western Australian Government has indicated on several occasions over the last four years that such nominations are being considered. Procrastination has allowed degradation to occur. As Minister Richardson said the other day, in Western Australia they are particularly slow. The degradation, which is now being used to justify wetland developments, is incompatible with wildlife habitat protection. In respect of Western Australian wetlands, I seek leave to table a photocopy of a leaflet titled The Vasse-Wonnerup Estuaries-A Vital Waterbird Refuge and Community Asset. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IH4">Senator JENKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. This brochure was produced by the Busselton Naturalists Club and the Royal Australasian Ornithologist Union. The Vasse-Wonnerup wetlands qualify for inclusion in the Convention list. I quote now from the leaflet:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The progressive loss of wetlands on the Swan Coastal Plain is well recognised. This places even move pressure on the remaining wetlands to provide sustainable resources for wildlife particularly waterbirds. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the significance of the Vasse-Wonnerup Estuaries the protection and maintenance of their conservation values is a matter of high priority. </PARA>
<PARA> Wetlands in the Dunsborough to Bunbury coastal strip have been reduced to the extent that many waterbirds in the region now have no summer refuge other than the Vasse-Wonnerup Estuaries. In their present condition, the Estuaries are of regional, national and international importance for waterbirds and therefore the community has a special responsibility to ensure that this asset is retained for this purpose and for future generations to enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA>The Vasse-Wonnerup area was proposed for conservation protection in 1974 and endorsed by the State government in 1976. The leaflet, which I have tabled, was published in 1987. Despite these expert recommendations no protective status has been accorded the Vasse-Wonnerup wetland system. Recent approvals by the Western Australian Government for construction of a marina and canal development on the Vasse-Wonnerup wetlands, not including further proposals yet to be approved, will inevitably destroy shallow wetland habitats. Photographs of these are featured in the leaflet which I have tabled. Another wetland of national significance on the south-west coast, the Peel Inlet, has already suffered such losses. The leaflet states:</PARA>
<PARA>Tens of thousands of waterbirds depend for their survival on the continued ability of the Vasse-Wonnerup system to provide much of their total requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>I raise this matter for the information of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism, and Territories because I believe that when other signatories to the Convention are informed of the degradation of the Vasse-Wonnerup wetlands they will express their concern to the Australian Government. I draw this to the attention of the Minister in the hope that he may act to prevent Australia's good international reputation for habitat protection being diminished as a result of the short-sighted decisions of State governments intent on development at any cost. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take up the time of the Senate for only a couple of moments. Last week I spoke regarding Senator Jenkins's wild and scurrilous allegations against 11 other Western Australian senators in this place. That was in reference to comments that she had made about the Child Migrant Friendship Society of Western Australia. Senator Cook, who is the Minister in the Senate this evening, is also from Western Australia. He is equally at risk over Senator Jenkins's allegations. I am just wondering when Senator Jenkins is going to make an apology to the Senate. I think this is very important, particularly in view of the position of Mrs Pearce, who has quite clearly laid it down that she would like Senator Jenkins to apologise to clear this matter once and for all. Subsequent to my address to the Senate last week, Mrs Pearce has quite categorically stated that she has not contacted other senators as Senator Jenkins has claimed, and there are a number of other issues that Senator Jenkins raised, in terms of million dollar writs and so forth, that Senator Jenkins still has not had the courage to come in here and either clarify or apologise about. I hope that Senator Jenkins will have that courage soon. She had no trouble in finding the courage to make the allegations in the first instance. It is just such a pity for the Senate and for the reputation of the Parliament that she is having an enormous amount of difficulty finding the courage to come in and clarify the issue forthwith.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Previous classification 39.03.900 (2%) was translated predominantly to the following HS classifications which are now dutiable as shown:</PARA>
<PARA>3916.90.90 (17.5% phasing to 15%)</PARA>
<PARA>3917.29.00 (17.5% phasing to 15%)</PARA>
<PARA>3917.32.90 (17.5% phasing to 15%)</PARA>

<PARA>5604.20.90 (24% phasing to 15%)</PARA>
<PARA>5604.90.90 (24% phasing to 15%)</PARA>
<PARA> As these tables indicate, it is possible for some goods of 39.03.900 (2%) to be now classified within HS 3921.14.00 (15%).</PARA>
<PARA> Question 2: Subheading 3921.40 includes certain plates, sheets, film, foil and strip of cellular regenerated cellulose.</PARA>
<PARA> Question 3: As far as I am aware there is no manufacture in Australia of regenerated cellulose.</PARA>
<PARA> Question 4: Industry assistance for the chemicals and plastics industries was reviewed by the Government following the IAC's inquiry into these industries in 1986. I understand that Marrick Pty Ltd of Unley, South Australia, subsequently sought to have the tariff treatment of these goods re-examined by the IAC, however, they were advised by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce that there was insufficient justification on industry policy grounds for such an examination.</PARA>
<PARA> Question 5: The assistance arrangements now in place for these industries followed public inquiry by the IAC and are based on a three-tiered tariff structure with rates of 0, 10 and 15 per cent. Regenerated cellulose of HS3921.14.00, being regarded as a final product of the industries concerned falls within the 15 per cent tier. These assistance arrangements are intended to promote the orderly development of efficient, internationally competitive companies, able to respond readily to new market and technology opportunities. The Government believes that its policies for the industries will provide, in the long term, a more stable framework within which manufacturers can exploit these opportunities.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Community Services and Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) My Department does not keep statistics on the frequency of such an occurrence. I am advised by the Health Insurance Commission, which administers Medicare, that it is aware of 12 instances Australia-wide over the last 18 months.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Medicare provides for the grouping of individual enrolments into convenient `family units' on Medicare cards to facilitate claiming. This allows for the nomination, for administrative purposes, of one person as the cardholder who is responsible for the card and to whom all correspondence is addressed. The cardholder status is not intended to imply any special status over any other person on the Medicare card.</PARA>
<PARA> In the majority of cases, the cardholder is also the claimant and the Medicare computer generates a cheque payable to the cardholder. Claims processing staff are aware that Medicare benefits must be paid to the person who incurs the expense and that claimant details must be keyed into the system when they are at variance with the cardholder's details. However, with approximately half a million claims processed daily, some errors have occurred.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Commission staff are aware that the unauthorised release of information is a breach of the legislation and of their terms of employment. All staff are signatories to an explanatory certificate on the provisions governing the release of information:</PARA>
<PARA>routine quality checks are made to ensure that claims are correctly processed;</PARA>
<PARA>access to enrolment system records is only given to Health Insurance Commission staff on a ``need to know'' basis; and</PARA>
<PARA>telephone information is provided on a ``call back'' basis only after procedures to establish the caller's bona fides.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) There is no correlation between the unique pin number allocated to an individual on enrolment and the card number. The Medicare card number may change if an individual requests a new card but the pin number is retained.</PARA>
<PARA> Where individuals are enrolled on a family card at the same time, they are allocated separate pin numbers.</PARA>
