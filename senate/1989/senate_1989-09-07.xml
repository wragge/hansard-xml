<TITLE>Vietnam: End of War List</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The members of the Australian Armed Forces who served in the Vietnam War from 1962 to 1973 did so with distinction, valour and professionalism, upholding the traditions of the Armed Forces.</PARA>
<PARA> After World War 2 and the Korean War the Australian Government approved an End of War List of Gallantry Medals for individual acts of bravery that were not rewarded during wartime.</PARA>
<PARA> The Whitlam Government refused to approve such an End of War List at the end of the Vietnam War.</PARA>
<PARA> Your humble petitioners pray that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government reverse the decision of the Whitlam Government and thus approve an End of War List for the Australian Armed Forces personnel that served in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA> Upon the approval of the End of War List, the case of the 2nd Lieutenant John Fraser, 3RAR be considered for the award of a posthumous military honour.</PARA>

<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and the senators in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The Humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That every abortion kills an unborn human baby.</PARA>
<PARA> That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life.</PARA>
<PARA> That the most defenceless and threatened lives are those of unborn babies for whom the Government is duty bound to take extra steps to protect.</PARA>
<PARA> That in 1987-88 taxpayers funds through Medicare provided Medical Benefits for 61,879 abortions totalling $6.4 million.</PARA>
<PARA> That in the same year Commonwealth grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will carry out its duty to protect the right to life of Australian babies by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare, restricting grants to the States and by all other means at its disposal.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Sporting, Cultural and Community Groups: Sponsorship</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> We, the undersigned.</PARA>
<PARA> (i) are alarmed that many sporting, cultural and community groups have been made to feel that they can attract sponsorship only from promoters of unhealthy products;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) call for a National Health Promotion Foundation to be established through an increase in tobacco excise of 10 cents per packet; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) urge that the National Health Promotion Foundation provide national sporting, cultural and community groups with alternative sponsorship funding so that these groups can flourish without the taint of accepting money from tobacco companies and assisting in the promotion of their unhealthy products.</PARA>

<TITLE>Home Ownership</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Hawke-Keating government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many Australians out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families.</PARA>

<TITLE>Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled, we the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's attack upon the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has cast grave doubts over the future viability of our community pharmacies and their ability to provide much-needed service to the community, including particularly those in rural areas;</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will further jeopardise the viability of pharmacists;</PARA>
<PARA> The latest decision to slash PBS payments to pharmacists by an average of $1.05 per script is simply unacceptable and will force the closure of many pharmacies.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners respectfully request that the Senate urge the Government to ensure adequate remuneration levels for pharmacists, so that they may be able to provide a high quality health care service which is the right of every citizen of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Private Member's Bill before the Senate relates to an unfinished chapter in Australian history; that is the Vietnam War. </PARA>
<PARA> The chapter relates to the failure of the Whitlam Government to establish an End of War List on the return home of the Australian troops from Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA> After every war which Australians have served in an End of War List has been drawn-up. </PARA>
<PARA> The Vietnam War stands as the exception. </PARA>
<PARA> End of War Lists are established for the purpose of recognizing individual acts of valour that were overlooked in the disruption of the war. The list itself consists of a quota of awards ranging, from a `Mention-in-Dispatches' to the highest honour of a Victoria Cross. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to create an End of War List for the Australian Defence Forces personnel who served in Vietnam from 1962 to 1973. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has the full support of the National Executive of the Returned Services League and the Vietnam Veterans Association. The RSL has written to all its branches in Australia requesting its members to sign a petition of support. </PARA>
<PARA> These petitions are being presented on a daily basis to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of an End of War List has much to do with maintaining a certain spirit of Australia, a spirit born out of the Gallipoli campaign. That spirit of pride and appreciation Australians have towards service men and women in times of war. </PARA>
<PARA> Regardless of the horror and evil of war, Australians have always had an appreciation of, and respect for, those who fought and died wearing the Australian uniform. That is what each ANZAC Day parade symbolises. </PARA>
<PARA> Not to recognize individual acts of valour in the Vietnam War would be to destroy that spirit passed on through time. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless the decision not to establish an End of War List is reversed, the Vietnam veterans can never be on a par with veterans from past campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody should doubt that, because of the decision not to establish an End of War List, there are now many unsung heroes of the Vietnam war. Two cases of young Australians who died in heroic service have been brought to my attention. </PARA>
<PARA> Documents released following a Freedom of Information Act request show that the three Defence Departments-the Army, Navy and Air-made two requests for the establishment of an End of War List. </PARA>
<PARA> The first request was made in 1972 to the Minister for Defence in the McMahon Government, Mr David Fairbairn and was rejected upon the grounds that hostilities were continuing in Vietnam and Australian troops were still in South East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that the future establishment of such a list was not ruled out by Mr Fairbairn. </PARA>
<PARA> The second request was made some nine months later when all of the Australian troops were home. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Whitlam Government's Minister for Defence, Mr Lance Barnard, rejected the request on the grounds that it would be seen to be celebrating the war. </PARA>
<PARA> That decision distinctly lacked an understanding of the Australian people and their history. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody at the time of Gallipoli or since could claim the campaign to be an event to celebrate. Indeed, Gallipoli was both a wartime and political disaster. Yet, what we do recognize and remember from that time are the individual acts of valour and those Australians who did not come home. </PARA>
<PARA> The real hang-over and shame of the lost Vietnam War comes from the fact that Parliament has been unwilling to accept this age-old tradition, for the single reason of fearing the revitalisation of the war debate. We have had to live with that mistake ever since, as we have had to live with defeat in the Vietnam War. </PARA>
<PARA> I am reminded of one story told to me by a veteran. He said that, while his attitude was against Australians being called up to fight, he believed that once in the battle zone, every soldier was duty bound to fight with every ounce of strength for those fellow Australians alongside him. If there was one weak link in the fighting chain, all his mates would be in danger. </PARA>
<PARA> That was the atmosphere and reality of the war zone in Vietnam regardless of the opinions and demonstrations at home. </PARA>
<PARA> It is to that spirit which those who served in Vietnam were so true. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not until the 1987 Coming Home Parade, organized by the Vietnam veterans themselves some 14 years after the soldiers left the battlefields of South East Asia, that the first step towards breaching the gap between the veterans and the Australian society was taken. </PARA>
<PARA> It was a very moving event for those who watched the thousands of Australian men and women march. The marchers had been given no victory, no glory and not even any pride in having done their duty until that day. </PARA>
<PARA> One could not help but believe Australia, on that day, had begun to heal the bitter divisions of the war, that the spirit of all that had made the Australian character so unique in the world had returned-that unique spirit of unconquerable determination of Australians against adversity. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, that spirit of mateship was present that day, when stories of bravery and loss were told. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Coming Home Parade was the first step taken, the second step must be the approval of an End of War List. </PARA>
<PARA> Many will say that time has passed and it is best to let such a controversial war be forgotten. `Besides', they will ask, `how could any investigation after so long reveal adequately the events of that war?'</PARA>
<PARA> To that I would reply that, in this Senate just before last Christmas, the War Crimes Amendment Bill was passed. That Bill sought justice some 50 years after World War II. The justice that was sought there was to seek out war criminals. The justice I seek is to seek our war heroes. </PARA>
<PARA> In my speech on the Bill I said:</PARA>
<PARA> As we fast approach a new century, the year 2001, we are being asked to look back to a time that for many was a time in history books, old film footage and, indeed, museums, and I am one such person who was not even born when the atrocities occurred in the Second World War. So it is significant for me to add that my generation has never been asked to go to war. We have been privileged with an era that has not challenged our beliefs to a point where we must take up arms and defend them in war. I rise to speak for that very reason. What my generation owes to past generations is due to the will and suffering of past generations of Australians and Europeans. My generation can say that they live in a free Australia. I believe that the past era should not be forgotten. A time should not be placed on justice, nor should there be a time to forget the dead. That is what every Shrine of Remembrance in this country asks of us-`Lest We Forget' the fallen soldier and civilian. </PARA>
<PARA> I hold the same belief in seeking the establishment of an End of War List. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now turn to individual aspects of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill would establish an End of War List Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal is to consist of 3 members from each of the three arms of the Australian Defence Force: the Navy; Army and Air Force. </PARA>
<PARA> The three members would be appointed by the Minister for Defence. </PARA>
<PARA> The function of the Tribunal is to prepare a list of Australian service personnel who served in the Vietnam War, being persons who did not receive awards for valour in respect of the relevant military conflict but who should, in the opinion of the Tribunal, receive awards. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal is also to recommend to the Minister the level of the awards that the Tribunal believes should be granted. </PARA>
<PARA> In keeping with the spirit of the original request by the defence force a quota of 30 awards can be recommended, although the Bill empowers the Minister to expand the list beyond the initial total of 30 awards. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal, in making its recommendations, is not to have regard to whether or not the rigid monthly quota of awards used by the defence forces during war time was filled. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also establishes the principle that such a tribunal would be established for future military conflicts. This aspect of the Bill would ensure that political considerations could never again prevent the creation of End of War Lists. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, at a time that we are commemorating World War II 50 years since it began and are preparing to commemorate Gallipoli 75 years since, let now be the time to put aside the arguments for and against the Vietnam war. </PARA>
<PARA> Let now be the time to turn to the question of finally bringing our troops home. </PARA>
<PARA> The answer will finally depend upon this Parliament. I seek the support of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Debate (on motion by Senator McKiernan) adjourned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, pursuant to section 2 of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act 1989, the Senate approves proposed new sections 3f, 3g, and 3h of the Health Insurance Act 1973 as contained in section 10 of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>The motion before the Senate will allow for the proclamation of section 10 of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act 1989, which provides for the vocational registration of general practitioners and related measures. When this matter was last before the Senate for debate, it was decided by the Senate that the legislation would be passed but that proclamation of it would be deferred until such time as the issues were considered by a Senate select committee. A Senate committee has now met. It has taken evidence, heard witnesses, considered the issues, and reported. The Government has responded to that report. It is noteworthy that the Government's response was tabled in this chamber last Thursday. The Senate committee is to be commended in that the members who served on it-the Chairperson, Senator Rosemary Crowley from South Australia, Senator Peter Baume from New South Wales, Senator John Coulter from South Australia, Senator John Faulkner from New South Wales, Senator Robert McMullan from the Australian Capital Territory and Senator Glenister Sheil from Queensland-brought down a unanimous report. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not propose today to go back over the entire history of this legislation, which has been the subject of substantial debate within both the Parliament and the medical profession. It has also been the subject of some misunderstandings, misinformation and, it can be said, malevolent intent by those who are opposed to it. Honourable senators will recall that section 10 of the legislation gives effect to an historic agreement between the Government and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP). The agreement, which has now been endorsed by the unanimous findings of the Senate Select Committee, provides the basis for an improvement in both the quality and the cost effectiveness of primary medical care in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The package agreed with the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners involves the establishment of a vocational register for general practitioners (GPs) who have appropriate training or experience and who agree to take part in quality assurance and continual medical education programs accredited by the college. Those who enrol on the register will be entitled to use a new set of content-based descriptors which will have higher Medicare fees and benefits. The standard time tiering items for GP consultations will remain in the schedule so that no-one will be disadvantaged or worse off. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has responded in detail to the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee, as I have said. That response was tabled last week and has been available for scrutiny by all interested parties. I will refer later to a number of issues in relation to the Government's response which have been raised by representations to us and by representations from across the chamber. Before I do that I would like to make some general comments about the Select Committee and its recommendations. First, I would like to congratulate the Committee on the way it went about its task and on the comprehensive nature of its inquiries. Given the relatively short time in which it had to report, the complex and contentious subject matter it had to investigate and the large number of submissions it had to consider, it is a credit to the Committee that it was able to produce a unanimous report which has gained widespread support outside the Parliament. It is a reflection of the skill and dedication all members of the Committee brought to their task and they have every reason to be satisfied with the outcome of their efforts and to be congratulated on that by this chamber. It is a shining example of the strength of the committee system in the Senate. Therefore the Senate is bound to take due consideration of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee consulted widely and heard evidence from a range of individuals and organisations. Some supported the proposals and some were opposed to them. In the end the Committee reached the agreement that I have referred to, endorsed the essential elements of the package and produced a unanimous report which should provide a basis for cross-party support in this chamber. The Government has responded quickly and positively to all of the recommendations of the Select Committee. The Government's detailed response accepts all the Committee's recommendations and sets out the draft regu-lations required to establish the Vocational Registration Eligibility Committee and the Vocational Registration Appeals Committee in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners also endorsed the Select Committee's report and agreed with its recommendations. Both the Government and the college have written to the Australian Medical Association (AMA), formally inviting the Association to participate in the implementation process and to accept full membership on the Standing Review Group on General Practice as recommended by the Committee. The AMA has responded positively to that, recognising the need for involvement as recommended by the Committee. A meeting between the college, the AMA and the Department of Community Services and Health has already been held and another meeting is scheduled to take place in Sydney tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that there is now widespread support within the medical profession for the Committee recommendations, there is no reason for the Senate to further delay the proclamation of this legislation. The President of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Bryce Phillips, has advised the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) that he has spoken to the Opposition spokesman on health and to the Australian Democrats' representative on the Select Committee. I am informed that he has advised them that, subject to minor amendments to the draft regulations, to which I will refer later, the AMA does not oppose the legislation and believes that it should receive the endorsement of the Senate today. </PARA>
<PARA> With the major medical associations, in the form of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Australian Medical Association, both supporting the legislation, it is somewhat disappointing that the Opposition has chosen to continue its negative, stalling campaign, to seek further delay and to frustrate this legislation. While it might be disappointing, I should observe that it is hardly surprising. The Opposition has, for many years, been out of step with mainstream thinking on health policy, and its continued opposition to an important initiative which will improve the quality and cost effectiveness of primary health care services is testimony of its irrelevance to the broader health debate in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> One could perhaps understand the Opposition's attitude to the legislation if the findings of the Senate Select Committee had not been unanimous, if its recommendations had not been acceptable to the medical profession or if the Government had not agreed to implement the recommendations in full; but none of these things happened. The findings were unanimous, the recommendations were accepted by the profession and the Government has not only agreed to implement the recommendations but also already commenced the process by drafting the necessary regulations and inviting the AMA to join the Standing Review Group on General Practice. </PARA>
<PARA> What, then, is the basis of the stand taken by the Opposition on this issue? Its continued rejection of a unanimous Senate Select Committee report can have little to do with the merits of the issue or the logic of the arguments. This issue has been rigorously examined by the Select Committee and overwhelmingly endorsed. It would seem that the logical position would be to accept what has been recommended and allow the doctors and patients of Australia to share the benefits of the new arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is one thing that can be said about the Opposition's attitude to health policy, it is that logic has no place in it. After 61/2 years on the Opposition benches, five different health spokesmen and at least as many attempts to formulate a coherent health poli-cy, the Opposition is still without anything constructive to contribute to the health debate in this country. The Opposition fails to understand that 70 per cent of Australians support Medicare-that is, seven out of 10 Australians now support our national health insurance arrangements. Yet, despite that overwhelming level of endorsement, the Opposition wants to dismantle Medicare. Exactly what it will replace it with is still unclear, as the latest version of the Opposition's health policy is still to appear. </PARA>
<PARA> We well remember the last disastrous attempt to cobble together a health policy just before the election in 1987. Even the usual allies of the Opposition could find few redeeming features in that effort and both the policy and the spokesman-I think it was Senator Michael Baume-have been consigned to obscurity since. I have no doubt that when it does appear, the Opposition's health policy will pander to the usual vested interests like private hospitals and health funds and promote an American-type market system which will inevitably lead to higher overall costs and a lower coverage of services. </PARA>

<PARA> With that background, it is hardly surprising that the Opposition, out of blind ideology, continues its attempt to obfuscate and delay this legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said `most informed people', and that includes most others. In this case the Opposition is denying greater financial rewards to general practitioners and, more importantly, higher quality care to patients. The more sensible approach-that adopted by both the Australian Democrats and the Australian Medical Association-is to negotiate with the Government on the issues which are still regarded as unsatisfactory. The fact that the Opposition has chosen not to adopt this approach is a clear indication that it has reduced this issue to nothing more than a cynical political exercise. The fact that it has rejected the unanimous findings of the Senate Select Committee, which included representatives of both the Liberal and National parties, can only be interpreted as complete indifference to both the financial well-being of general practitioners and the physical well-being of their patients.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am pleased to note that Senator Coulter, who has now joined us in the chamber, has adopted a constructive approach to the Government's response by seeking clarification and further commitments on those issues which still cause him some concern. He has raised three issues to which I would now like to refer. The Minister for Community Services and Health, Dr Blewett, has already written to Senator Coulter about these matters but I raise them formally today to advise other honourable senators of the commitments and to ensure that they are properly on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA> The first point relates to those doctors providing high quality primary care services but who are not general practitioners. It is the Government's intention to put into place mechanisms which will raise the standard of all primary care services. Recognition of the attainment and maintenance of agreed indications of this standard will be by way of registration. It must be recognised that the specialist primary care groups do not wish to be identified as GPs, nor do they want the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners to represent their interests or set their standards. In its report the Committee acknowledged that a small group of medical practitioners-those in special areas of general practice clearly outside the definition of general practice, for whom no parallel arrangement is made and those who are not involved in recognised vocational training-would not be eligible for the vocational register. Therefore, the Select Committee recommended in paragraph 3.14 that discussions be initiated between the Department, the Royal Australian College and those bodies representing primary care practitioners whose special interests excluded them from the definition of general practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee suggested that parallel arrangements for these groups be implemented to ensure that they satisfied adequate standards of vocational training, quality assurance and continued medical education. This process has already commenced with discussions between the Department and people representing family planning, sports medicine and muscular skeletal medicine. Negotiation with each of these groups is continuing. Provided they can meet adequate standards of vocational training, continuing medical education and quality assurance, they will be given equal treatment in relation to the Medicare benefits schedule; that is, they will be recognised in their special area of expertise and they will be eligible for fees and benefits equal to those available to vocationally registered GPs. I make it quite clear to honourable senators that this Government has no wish to exclude any group from a system which provides financial incentives to obtain appropriate vocational qualifications and to maintain high quality of services through involvement in quality assurance and continuing medical education programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point raised by Senator Coulter relates to evaluation. As a scientific man, Senator Coulter is rightly concerned that proper mechanisms be put in place to evaluate the outcome of the new arrangements. I confirm that sufficient funding will be made available to ensure that adequate evaluation programs are put into place. Honourable senators who followed the Senate Select Committee hearings will be aware that Dr J. Dickinson, from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Newcastle, gave evidence relating to the evaluation of health services. It is proposed that the Government will seek advice from Dr Dickinson on how to set up an evaluation program. This will involve the establishment of a pilot program as soon as practicable to determine how the evaluation can best be carried out. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter's final concern, and one which was raised by a number of people, is the availability of funding for the family medicine program. The issue of vocational training is central to the whole package. I confirm that the Government is committed to providing, and has available sufficient funding to ensure, places for all those who seek vocational training. While the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners is responsible for the accreditation of training courses, it does not necessarily mean that the family medicine program should be the only form of vocational training available. Approaches have already been made by two State governments for funding of vocational training courses for GPs. Should either of these receive accreditation from the college, the Government would need to consider the question of financial support. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, if doctors were to choose these options in preference to family medicine training, the financial requirements of the family medicine program would be reduced accordingly. It is hoped that over time other forms of vocational training for general practitioners would become available and would be accredited by the college. This will provide some level of choice for those doctors who for a variety of reasons do not wish to use the family medicine program as a vehicle for vocational training. </PARA>
<PARA> The President of the Australian Medical Association has also raised with the Government two matters which relate to the draft regulations. The first issue relates to the membership of the proposed vocational registration eligibility and appeals committees. The AMA's preferred position is that the membership consist of two nominees of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, two nominees of the AMA and one person appointed by the Minister. As currently drafted, the regulations give effect to the recommended membership of the committees as expressed in paragraph 2.16 of the Select Committee's report. The Government has no difficulty in accepting the revised membership if that is the wish of the Senate. I understand that the AMA has discussed this issue with the Democrats and the Opposition and that no concerns have been raised. The Government believes that it is important to ensure that the AMA's concerns are properly taken into account and in the absence of any objections the regulations will be redrafted to reflect the revised membership for the eligibility and appeals committees. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other issue raised by the AMA is the ability of the eligibility committees to make decisions independent of the criteria issued by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. Regulation 7 requires that eligibility committees must have regard to the criteria published by the RACGP relating to the eligibility for registration. This requirement is necessary for two reasons. First, as noted by the Senate Select Committee on page 11 of its report, the proper role for the RACGP as the professional body responsible is the development and maintenance of appropriate standards for general practice. In the same way as any other specialist colleges set standards for their disciplines, so too should the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners set standards for general practice. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, there must be some consistency in the different routes to vocational registration. However, regulation 19 allows an eligibility committee to inform itself on any matters in the manner it chooses. This allows the eligibility committees to take advice and to seek opinions in addition to the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners criteria. This supplementary advice would form part of the information on which a committee makes its decision so that it is not bound absolutely by the college criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> The AMA has requested that these two regulations be brought together to make it clearer that the eligibility committees would have some discretion to make independent decisions. It is therefore proposed to reword regulation 7 to give effect to the AMA's requirements. The exact wording will be a matter for the Attorney-General's Department but the drafting instructions will ask that the regulation allow for each case to be judged on its merits having regard to the RACGP's eligibility criteria and such other information as the committee believes is relevant. </PARA>
<PARA> With these two minor changes the AMA has agreed to support the legislation and has made this known to both the Democrats and the Opposition health spokesmen. As I said earlier, there is now no reason to delay further the proclamation of this legislation. The Senate has been given a report by a Select Committee which has won a great deal of praise in the medical profession. It would be quite improper in view of that for the Senate now to reject the unanimous report. The editorial of the 1 September issue of the Medical Observer magazine states:</PARA>
<PARA> The committee has handled a complete and politically sensitive task with great skill. The report succinctly summarises the issues under question and gives direct and readily achievable solutions to some of the more contentious issues. While pointing out that some of the opposition to the proposals stemmed from misleading and mischievous information supplied by opponents the committee generally refrained from direct attacks on any particular groups. It is encouraging to see that there are still some corners of our parliamentary system which can address themselves to the issue at hand without getting side-tracked by the political mileage they can gain. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the editorial of 1 September in the Medical Observer. I, too, congratulate the Senate Select Committee and, in particular, Senator Peter Baume and Senator Sheil, for not getting sidetracked by the political mileage they can gain, as the editorial says. It is unfortunate, albeit predictable, that the Opposition does not have a majority of like minds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commence this debate by saying how unhelpful it is to the Senate's discussion of complex legislation in this place for the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) to make a major statement which amounts, in effect, to a revised second reading speech dealing with very complicated matters arising from recommendations, from proposed changes to regulations, and from proposals which the Government will now advance, without extending to the Opposition the courtesy of having the opportunity to look at the details of the Minister's statement in advance. When the Minister comes in here and says that the Government proposes to make certain changes to regulations and certain alterations in Government recommendations, the very least that can be expected is the elementary courtesy that the Opposition would have been given the details which the Minister has now announced in advance of this debate commencing. I simply put on record that I believe that is typical of the way in which the Government believes that, once it has made some arrangement with the Australian Democrats, it is not necessary for similar courtesy to be extended to the Opposition or to other senators in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That having been said by way of introduction, I want to go now to the question of why the Opposition does not find itself in a position to support the Minister's motion, which, as he rightly says, will cause clause 10 of the legislation to be brought into effect. The first thing that I want to say to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, relates to the characterisation of the nature of the report of the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance. The terms of reference of the Senate Select Committee were, as honourable senators will recall, to do two things: first, to examine in the particular questions arising from clause 10 of the legislation and, secondly, to deal with questions of medical insurance, which it will be doing on an ongoing basis. The full terms of reference for part one of the Committee's inquiry were:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the meaning of clause 10 of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (b) the implications of clause 10 of the Bill for the medical profession in general, general practitioners in particular, and various categories of patients;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) whether the Senate should approve of clause 10 of the Bill, or whether the clause should be amended, and if so, in what respects it should be amended . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What the Senate Committee did not do, nor was required to, was conduct a comprehensive inquiry into the question of whether or not there should be a vocational register. That seems to me to be a question which has largely escaped the Minister and which has not been addressed substantially in the debates which have taken place so far. I propose to come back at a later stage in my address to the question of the vocational register per se. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing that the Minister said in his statement this morning was that this represents what he described as an historic agreement between the Government and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP). We are used to seeing these series of historic agreements from this Labor Government. This Government is a great one for entering into so-called historic arrangements between itself and various organisations and institutions. But what it does not do, and what is never comprehended in these historic agreements, is a fundamental analysis of what is in the best interests of the health care consumer or any other consumer at the end of the day. It is always a matter of what is the cosy relationship between the Government, the regulatory authority and some professional organisation, body, instrumentality, or institution. What is never addressed in these historic agreements is what is to the ultimate benefit of the health care consumer or indeed of the consumer in terms of any of these historic agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> The third matter that the Minister raises this morning is that the President of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) has said to various people, `Really, subject to minor amendments we are perfectly prepared to endorse this deal'. It is after all the philosophy of force majeure that, when it is explained to an organisation of people as intelligent as the AMA that the Government and the Australian Democrats have the numbers and they are asked whether they want to be part of the deal or want to be excluded from it, they are smart enough to say, `We understand the doctrine of force majeure and under those circumstances if we are going to be lumbered with this wretched thing, which we still oppose as a matter of principle, we would rather be in it than out of it'. That is perfectly understandable. </PARA>
<PARA> The next question which comes easily to the Minister's lips is the old hoary chestnut that the coalition parties propose to dismantle Medicare. On this matter, in relation to what our policy will be as far as Medicare is concerned, all I can say is that the Minister's proximity to the truth is roughly equivalent to his proximity to the truth on sandmining on Fraser Island. Ministers are supposed to be wedded to the truth, but every now and again they decide that the easiest thing is occasionally to live apart. On this particular occasion the Minister has decided once again, rather than to maintain the connubial arrangements, to live apart. He lives apart from the truth on this matter, as he lives apart from the truth on a number of others. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. We come next to the question of what are the arrangements which allegedly have been entered into with Senator Coulter arising from certain agreements, presumably made between Senator Coulter and the Minister, as far as potential changes to regulations are concerned. We are told in the first instance that there will be some new arrangements entered into based upon the recommendations in paragraph 3.14 of the Senate Committee report to provide for some allegedly alternative stream of vocational registration or of accreditation. I will come back to that point in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the questions of evaluation and of funding I say simply this: it is significant that, when Senator Patterson asked the Minister across the chamber for some specific guarantee in terms of funding for the family medicine program, no effective guarantees were forthcoming. We are entitled to take that at face value. We welcome the assurance that has been given that the Vocational Registration Eligibility Committee (VREC) mechanism will be changed so as to eliminate some of the closed shop attitude which was apparent in the original draft recommendations and that the Committee's proposal in paragraph 2.16 has been revised so that the VREC operation will encompass two members of the AMA, two members of the college and one ministerial nominee. We also welcome the assurance from the Minister that changes will be made to draft regulation 7, which will broaden the eligibility criteria beyond those established by the College, for the eligibility questions to be addressed without being narrowly confined to the definition put by only one of the relevant or interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore make a final comment about the overall approach that the Minister has established this morning-namely, that as soon as the Government, the college and the AMA get together, everybody else should bow out of it. In essence, that is what the Minister is saying. He is saying that health policy is fundamentally a matter to be determined between the Government, the vested interests and the established institutions within the health care delivery service. In effect, he is saying that, once we have done the deal, once we have made the arrangements with the bodies which we have picked out to be the appropriate and favoured bodies, the Parliament, as the representative of the public interest, should simply stand back and leave it to the experts to settle this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to tell the Minister that democrats the world over have not fought, bled and died to overthrow the divine right of kings simply in order to replace it with a divine right of experts. What actually happens in this Parliament is that from time to time we are asked to exercise our independent judgment on behalf of the people whom we represent. I do not represent the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners; I do not represent the Australian Medical Association; nor indeed do any senators on this side see themselves in that role. We see ourselves as representing the people who are consumers of health care and, if we are not satisfied that their interests are being properly accommodated, frankly, I do not give a continental what the Government or any other established institution thinks ought to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> I come now to the substance of a number of matters which relate to this overall debate. First, if the Government had really decided that it wanted to make significant improvements in the way in which health care services are delivered, it would not be necessary to pursue this particular road of formal amendment and new institutional structures. If it had been capable of being persuaded on the basis of evidence, as distinct from its set ideological prejudices, that it should move away from the provision of medical rebates and financing on a time-tiered basis and towards a system in which fee structures were based upon a content-based delivery of services, it would be doing much better and it would be able to do it without legislative interference and without further control of the profession. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we are expected to take on spec the Minister's assurances about what will be in the next series of regulations. I say to the Minister that the Government got the first draft regulations wrong. The regulations as provided in draft form in the document which was tabled on 30 August did not accord entirely with the recommendations made by the Senate Committee, no matter what the Government may say in that regard. We are entitled to say, `If you are going to amend these regulations further, we are entitled to withhold our judgment until we see those draft regulations on the second occasion. Let us see whether you get them right on this occasion because you manifestly did not get them right on the first occasion'. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that, when Senator Tate was in charge of the debate in this chamber on the copyright legislation, which Senator Hill and I were handling, we deferred clauses and the Minister produced changes to legislation as the debate was under way so that we could judge those not on the basis of some vague assurance given by a Minister who now is no longer in the chamber. I draw attention to the fact that there is no Minister in this chamber at the moment. That is the seriousness that the Government places on maintaining its responsibility in the Senate. Not a single Minister of the Crown is here in the Senate chamber today to take any responsibility on behalf of the Government for the conduct of this debate. That is the way in which the Senate is treated by the Government once it thinks it has the Australian Democrats locked into this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point that I make is that the majority of general practitioners are clearly still opposed to this proposal which the Government is putting forward. If one analyses the submissions that were made to the Senate Committee, one will find that 77 per cent of the submissions made to that Committee were opposed to the establishment of the vocational register. I draw attention in particular to a letter sent to the Committee Chairman, Senator Crowley, by the deans of the medical schools of the Universities of Adelaide, Melbourne, New South Wales, Sydney and Tasmania, Monash University and Flinders University in South Australia, which says that the Senate should not approve of clause 10. That letter says in part:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no evidence that those who graduate from current medical courses in Australia are less competent to function effectively, efficiently and safely as general practitioners following pre-registration training than medical practitioners who would qualify immediately for vocational registration under the proposed arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>The deans make a second point:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that women graduates who wish to work part-time will be disadvantaged by the proposed registration arrangements, if not significantly in the period up to 1995 then certainly affecting those current and future medical students who will complete internship after 1995. </PARA>
<PARA>They go on to say that, while they support the principle of continuing medical education:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is our firm view that the vocational registration process proposed in the above Bill, linked with different scales of remuneration and creating two classes of general practitioners on grounds that are open to objection, is an inappropriate means of achieving these ends. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that is a matter that needs to be drawn to attention. </PARA>
<PARA> I come next to the question of the discrimination which I believe this proposal continues to imply against particular classes of medical practitioners, and female general practitioners in particular. Those key regulations, which are not to be changed, fail to give an adequate definition of the word `predominantly'. In draft regulation 5 (1), it is provided that:</PARA>
<PARA>A medical practitioner is eligible for registration where an Eligibility Committee certifies:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) that the practitioners' medical practice is predominantly general practice . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Draft regulation 6 provides:</PARA>
<PARA>The name of a medical practitioner must be removed from the Register if the Appeals Committee, having dismissed the practitioner's appeal, gives the General Manager written notice that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the committee is satisfied that the medical practitioner's medical practice is no longer predominantly general practice . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The RACGP has said that doctors working predominantly in private practice means that more than 50 per cent of the practitioner's time or services as claimed against Medicare is spent in practice. Thus a general practitioner doing only two sessions a week in general practice would qualify. A doctor doing three sessions a week on a salary in a family planning clinic plus two sessions in an RACGP defined general practice would qualify. A doctor doing three sessions a week in a private sports medicine or breast cancer clinic plus two sessions in an RACGP defined practice would not qualify. A doctor of many years practice going into partial retirement and doing only one session a week in general practice would not qualify. </PARA>
<PARA> There are numerous similar anomalies. For instance, a member of the Royal Australian College of Physicians can choose to practise simply diabetic medicine, and there is no problem as far as that college is concerned, but a member of the College of General Practitioners cannot specialise in sports medicine, children's ailments or breast cancer and qualify in the same fashion. The discrimination which is practised against women who wish to leave the practice of medicine and to re-enter it at some later stage will be manifest. A large number of people have drawn this matter to the attention of the Committee and to the attention of honourable senators. The Opposition sees this as part and parcel of the general approach which this Government takes to the provision and control of health care services in Australia-its desires at the end of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing we can say about Dr Blewett is that he remains one of the most forthright socialists in a socialist party. He has never concealed his belief in a socialist approach to the practice and control of the medical profession. I commend Dr Blewett because he has a degree of honesty about his ideological position which is manifestly lacking in a large number of his colleagues, most of whom are making gurgling noises in the chamber at the moment. In exactly the same way as Mr Staples is now in the process of threatening the pharmacists that if they do not fall in with his line he will make sure the supermarkets take over their work, the medical profession is now being told that either it will fall into line with what the Government has as its overall desire to bring about an essentially salaried and government controlled profession or it will find itself financially excluded. It is quite clear, for example, that while the Doherty report made very cogent criticisms about the quality and nature of medical education in this country it was at pains to say that additional vocational training should not be made mandatory. Indeed, it is not made technically mandatory under this scheme; it is simply that the financial inducements are put there which have the effect of making it almost mandatory. Clearly, that is the Government's intention in this matter. Recommendation 8 (v) of the Doherty Committee states:</PARA>
<PARA>Mandatory vocational training and special registration of general practitioners not be introduced at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA>In the arguments that it uses to support that conclusion it says, in part:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee sees the mandatory concept as potentially inflexible for several groups of practitioners, including specialists reverting to general practice, graduates switching from other specialist training programs and for those returning to the workforce after career interruption. </PARA>
<PARA>That comes back to the role of female general practitioners in particular, which I have already mentioned. The Doherty Committee continues:</PARA>
<PARA>It also believes that the mandatory concept would present difficulties for many graduates, for example, in hospital positions, wishing to undertake part-time general practice such as locum tenens appointments. </PARA>
<PARA>This does not enforce a mandatory system. It is, however, a method of getting to a mandatory system through the back door. One of the things that I think will also happen as a consequence of this is that if the vocational register is introduced the RACGP and the family medicine program will set training requirements for RMOs. This is likely to mean that certain jobs, or terms, in hospitals will be accredited as providing experience necessary for GP training, and hence vocational registration, and some hospital terms will be considered as not contributing to such training. This, in turn, could lead to some hospital terms or jobs being unstaffed, for example, in nuclear medicine, oncology or radiotherapy, as young doctors choose GP-relevant terms rather than waste their time, as they see it, on those which do not contribute to their accreditation and potential future vocational registration. This has enormous implications for hospital staffing and work force management, particularly in the light of the Doherty report, which suggests that RMOs should also rotate to community based jobs and also recommends, as I said, against compulsory vocational registration. </PARA>
<PARA> Add to this the possibility and threat that RMOs may leave hospitals which cannot provide good general practice-accredited terms to get relevant community based experience and the problems of staffing mount further. This is particularly important in my State of New South Wales, where the New South Wales and Sydney universities are each reverting to a six-year course from a current five-year course. This will lead to fewer resident medical officers being available to the system over the next three years. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of continuing medical education would be better addressed if it were addressed in the medical schools and in a way which would allow it to work its way through the system rather than changing the rules which are currently understood by recent graduates or people who are about to graduate, who would find that the rules had been changed on them. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a letter which was sent to me on 5 September from the President of the Australian Medical Students Association in which the medical students make the point that they regard this as a quite unfair imposition. They deny that there is widespread support for the recommendations and for section 10 of the Act. They say that they have withheld support for the recommendations of the report because their full implications have yet to be evaluated in open discussion as the draft regulations in their final form, which is now to be amended, are not available for scrutiny; that groups affected by these regulations have not been consulted and their subsequent problems addressed; and that the RACGP specific eligibility criteria to be established have not been released for wide scrutiny by affected groups-and that now goes to the alternatives which may be introduced as a result of the Minister's announcement today. They say that until all of these matters have been addressed there should be a deferral of the final consideration of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to conclude, therefore, by simply reiterating the fundamental points, as I see them, of this debate. First, we do not believe that the overall outcome of the passage of section 10 will improve the quality of health care and health service deliveries for consumers. That is our fundamental point, our fundamental concern. It has nothing to do with whether a cosy deal has been struck between the college, the AMA, the Minister for Community Services and Health and the Australian Democrats; it is whether the health care consumers of Australia benefit. We believe that if that question were properly addressed we would be moving away from the time-tiered operation to an essentially content based nature of rebates for medical services. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we have been told by the Minister that he admits that the regulations need to be changed. We say to the Minister that we believe we are entitled to see his final proposals before we give them an endorsement. Thirdly, we believe that the long term nature of the Australian medical system is being undermined by the Government in a series of control mechanisms of which this is yet another. Fourthly, the legitimate questions raised by RMOs and medical graduates and undergraduates at the moment are not being properly addressed by the Government. We say that the question of continuing medical education needs to be addressed at a different level. It needs to be addressed fundamentally, in the first instance, at the training and medical school level. </PARA>
<PARA> We also say that the clear indication in the Doherty report that mandatory vocational registers should not be introduced, although it is not being pursued in those terms as a result of this legislation, is being pursued by the covert method of financial inducement. That will skew the medical system and the medical educational system in a way which we find to be unacceptable and undesirable. Finally, the issues addressed by the deans of the various medical schools and covered in the Senate Committee report have not been properly addressed either in the draft regulations or in the Minister's comments this morning. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for those reasons, and fundamentally for the reason that the enactment of section 10 in its present form will not be to the advantage of the consumers of health care in Australia, that the Opposition will not be supporting the motion which the Minister moved this morning. </PARA>

<PARA> I remind the Senate that when this proposal for a general practitioners register and the various elements that were associated with that was first announced, undoubtedly there was a great deal of division within the ranks of the medical profession. Indeed, I received and responded to 860 letters sent to me by doctors from both sides of this debate, a slight preponderance being in favour of what was being proposed. The doctors were aware that the Senate Select Committee was being set up, so a very large number of letters that were sent in a very short time came in. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Select Committee's report was made available and the Government has responded to it. I have received 14 letters relating to the Government's response. It seems to me to be quite clear that the majority of doctors are now happy with what is happening. Of the 14 letters I received, seven were for the proposal and seven were against it. The seven against have been against it all the time. They have some concerns which I believe have all been adequately answered. I will deal with those concerns in the course of my remarks. I will read some of the remarks from the seven in favour of the proposal. Dr Brian Hassett writes:</PARA>
<PARA>I believe the recommendations of the Committee are a reasonable compromise and address all the major issues. </PARA>
<PARA>These doctors are all quite unknown to me. Dr Ian Tulloch writes:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the committee should be congratulated on the thorough job it did in examining so closely the arguments on both sides. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Winterton states:</PARA>
<PARA>I feel the Committee deserves the highest praise for the effort it put into reaching their findings. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Rowe writes:</PARA>
<PARA>Thank you for following up your work on the Senate Select Committee on the General Practice Registration proposal by sending a report to me. </PARA>
<PARA> My partners and I are very impressed with the work of your committee and consider your final recommendations highly appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Downs writes:</PARA>
<PARA>Thank you for your letter and the attachments thereto. I have read the full report of your Senate Select Committee and would like to congratulate you on the quality and sagacity of its contents. As you say, it should meet nearly all the concerns expressed. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Peter Schattner comments:</PARA>
<PARA>I am writing now to say how satisfied I am with the committee's findings . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, I have received a small number of telephone calls in respect of which the level of support was also roughly evenly divided. I ask the Senate to consider the size of that response compared with the vast amount of correspondence which was received when this proposal was first announced. It is fair on the statistical evidence to say that most doctors, even those who were expressing considerable concern, are now happy with what the Committee has recommended and the Government's response to that. </PARA>
<PARA> When I first saw the Government's response, I was not happy with two aspects, in particular, of it. Senator Cook, in his opening remarks, mentioned those two things. There seemed to be legitimate concern in the area of an alternative pathway to registration for those doctors who were outside the strictly and narrowly defined limits of general practice but who, nonetheless, were able to satisfy equivalent standards with respect to vocational training, continuing medical education, quality assurance and evaluation. It seemed to me that while the Committee had expressed a concern that the alternative pathway be put in place, the Government's response initially was inadequate in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Blewett, in responding to my letter to him expressing concern about this, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The first point you raise relates to those doctors providing high quality primary care services but who are not general practitioners. You are quite correct in your understanding that the Government's intention is to raise the standard of all primary care services and that recognition of the attainment and maintenance of agreed indications of this standard will be by way of registration. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the key: to establish that the intention of this legislation is to guarantee a higher quality of delivery of primary care, most of which is in general practice but a small amount of which falls into other areas. That is clearly recognised by the Government. I accept its assurance that that is the intention and that the vocational registration eligibility committees, the VRECs, which were described in our Committee report, will be allowed to take on board consideration of qualifications which may be different in kind but equivalent in standards to those which deal specifically with general practice as narrowly defined. Senator Puplick totally missed, or perhaps totally misunderstood, the point that these VRECs will assess alternative qualifications held by people who want to get registration. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be that as this process develops different item numbers will be necessary in the schedule. That is something which clearly will evolve over time, as will the precision with which the VRECs will work. It is unrealistic to expect one to describe beforehand precisely how those bodies will operate and what the standards will be. But the Government has accepted that that recognition of the delivery of what is a professional service should be left with the profession. The VRECs will be composed, as I understand it, principally of members of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and members of the Australian Medical Association. As professional people they will be fully competent to make that assessment. It seems to me that, in the additional undertakings that the Government has given, that point is adequately addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I raised with the Minister for Community Services and Health, Dr Blewett, was in relation to evaluation. I was not happy with the initial response of the Government in this area. It was one of those matters that I pursued at some length with the Committee. I was surprised and disappointed to find that there was very little evidence of any sort in relation to the assessment of the quality of delivery of medical services. We on the Committee had the experience that one paper, by Dr Borgiel in Canada, was cited by both sides in the debate as support for and against the process of registration and accreditation of general practitioners. I have some experience in medical research and have the ability to assess such papers. I found it not particularly convincing, yet it was the best that could be produced by either side. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick said in his speech that there was no evidence of evaluation and that that had been drawn to attention by the deans of the medical schools. It reflects rather poorly on the medical schools in this country that they have been in a position for years to assess the quality of the graduates they turn out and of the services that those graduates provide to their patients but have ignored that responsibility. It is appropriate then that there should be a clear initiative from the Government to say, `Look, we are spending literally billions of dollars in this medical area; it is appropriate that evaluation be carried out and we will initiate studies to ensure that proper evaluation is carried out'. </PARA>
<PARA> It was most distressing that we had no clear indication as to whether the quality of provision of primary medical care in Australia is better or worse than in other countries, whether it is improving or getting worse, or whether this or that program will lead to improvement. At least out of the process of evaluation which I believe will now be put in place will come an ability to assess this proposal and other proposals. Five or so years down the track we will be in a better position to know whether this was the right course, whether some other course would have been more appropriate, or what modifications may be desirable. In the Minister's reply to me he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with your comment that there is a need to properly evaluate the outcome of the new arrangements and the government will ensure that sufficient funding is available to ensure adequate evaluation programs are put in place. It is intended that initially the Government will approach Dr J A Dickinson-</PARA>
<PARA>who gave evidence before the Committee-</PARA>
<PARA>from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Newcastle for advice about how to set up an evaluation program. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to describe a two-tier process in which initially a pilot evaluation scheme would be put in place from which a major study could be undertaken. That is absolutely appropriate because, as I think all honourable senators will recognise, it is extremely difficult to carry out robust and reliable research in this area. We are trying to assess things which are somewhat difficult to define. I believe that that aspect has also been adequately addressed by the Government. I also expressed a concern about the funding for the family medicine program. Again, Dr Blewett gives a clear undertaking when he says:</PARA>
<PARA> The issue of vocational training is essential to the whole package and I can confirm that the Government has sufficient funding and is committed to providing the funds necessary to ensure places for all those who seek vocational training. </PARA>
<PARA>The present draft regulations and the other draft document from the college look towards the first part, as it were, of the package-the establishment of the register of those who fall strictly within general practice, as narrowly defined. It is not appropriate, as Senator Puplick seems to be arguing, to look at this stage at other groups who fall outside that but who nonetheless may be able to establish appropriate standards of quality delivery of primary care. That process will be taken on through the VRECs. The relevant part of the regulations is the establishment of appropriate VRECs and an intention by Government that, through that process, the mechanism will be broadened and able to take on board those groups, which are not large in number but which are significant in terms of justice to the people in them. </PARA>
<PARA> Four doctors who are still opposed to the scheme have written me a letter expressing specific concerns. I would like to pick up each of those concerns in turn and indicate how I believe they are answered in the scheme. First, they say:</PARA>
<PARA> Our major concerns are:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The two tier system of rebates will create two classes of general practitioners, and doctors not eligible for the register will have problems with employment or viable practice. </PARA>
<PARA>It is perfectly true that some doctors will be registered and some will not. If that is regarded as two classes, there will be two classes. However, doctors are free to determine whether or not they register. Those on the register will, in a sense, have exposed themselves to further vocational training, quality assurance programs involving continuing medical education, and so on, and it is appropriate that that be recognised. That is what the scheme is about. If other doctors choose not to do that, that is their right and the item numbers which they use will remain within the system. Senator Puplick has characterised that as using a carrot. It is a carrot but it is an appropriate carrot under the circumstances. It seems to me that that point does not carry a great deal of weight. It is a matter of how one interprets what is happening-whether one sees it as something sinister or as something desirable. I see it as desirable and it is central to the whole thrust of this legislation. The next point in the letter is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>2. The legislation will discriminate against women by the unnecessary length of training and the requirement of eligibility for the register of having to be predominantly in general practice as defined by the R.A.C.G.P. </PARA>
<PARA>In terms of the first part of the package, it is true that the training for those who go into what is narrowly and strictly defined as general practice will have to be predominantly in general practice but, as I have already indicated, I believe that in relation to the alternative courses, qualifications and areas in which people may choose to work-specifically, family planning, sexually transmitted diseases, sports medicine and a number of others which were mentioned to the Committee-the VREC process will be able adequately to take on board consideration of the equivalence of qualification for those people, who can then be led on to registration. </PARA>
<PARA> That also picks up the point about the adequacy or otherwise of the length of training in particular areas. Over time, I believe, VRECs will be able very clearly to say, `Yes, this is in; this is out'. There will be evolution towards that sort of process. I reiterate that we are looking at the first part here. We may be dealing with 90 or 95 per cent of those in the delivery of primary health care, but the mechanisms which will be put in place will pick up those other doctors. Another objection is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>4. Doctors working exclusively, and many of those working predominantly, in the Special Interest areas of general practice such as Family Planning, Breast Clinics, Menopause Clinics, etc. will be excluded from this register. </PARA>
<PARA>That will certainly be true in the first instance where we are again dealing with general practice narrowly defined. The college draft document mentions several areas which have been quite specifically excluded. Again I reiterate that through the mechanism of the VREC, the ability of VRECs to take on an investigation and the establishment of equivalence of quality of vocational training, continuing medical education and so on, those things can and will be picked up. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>5. The legislation is restrictive. It virtually gives the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners a monopoly. The R.A.C.G.P. has to set all eligibility criteria, accredit all training and continuing medical education for general practice. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, for what is specifically general practice, as narrowly defined, and for those who choose to achieve registration through the college process, that is absolutely true. However, through the VRECs these alternative mechanisms are in place and will evolve to take that on board. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no guarantee in the legislation that there will be sufficient training positions available for all doctors who need them, and if training is not available, the R.A.C.G.P. will also control manpower into viable general practice. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, it seems to me that it is not appropriate to pick up that point by way of legislation, but clearly we will be looking closely at the implementation of this and holding the Government to the undertakings that it has given. It is a question of whether we accept what the Government has done by way of giving an undertaking in this respect. I do accept what the Government is saying in that there are adequate amounts of money available for the expansion of that program and that it will be done as it is central to the process. Accepting that, I think the argument which has been put forward by these doctors has no force. Finally, they say:</PARA>
<PARA> As the people who will be most disadvantaged by this legislation will be young people and women, we request the Democrats, our traditional allies, to defend us and oppose this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats have certainly traditionally defended young people and women but, in response to the concerns which this letter expresses-specifically with respect to those who are now medical students, those thinking of going into medical training and women who are in that position or who have already graduated-I believe those concerns have been picked up by the Committee and addressed. In time they will come to see that their concerns do not have a great deal of weight. </PARA>
<PARA> There was one point that was not picked up in this letter which has been mentioned to me several times on the telephone-and it particularly relates to women doctors. Will those who have already graduated, who get onto the register now because they have been predominantly in general practice but who then drop off the register-to have a family, or for some other reason-be required to do a lengthy period of training when they seek to go back on to the register post-1995? It seems to me that, in the context of this overall package, the situation of those people with respect to registration post-1995 has been adequately addressed through the establishment of the VRECs. It will be appropriate for the VRECs to look at the background of those people and the sort of training they have already undergone and make an assessment by comparing their training with the training required for registration de novo. They will be able to say whether the training is adequate. </PARA>
<PARA> While Senator Puplick was disparaging in talking about the divine right of experts, I should point out that the Committee-I believe, quite rightly-expressed the view that this is appropriately a professional job. It is not a job for government. It is appropriate for the VRECs to carry out that task. The VRECs will be composed of professional people. They will be composed of the peers of those people seeking registration. Again, I believe that the concerns expressed by these women do not have a great deal of weight. I do not think that their professional peers serving on these VRECs will be discriminatory when dealing with their applications. For those reasons we believe that the points-I was going to say `arguments', but that is elevating what was said to an unnecessary high level-which Senator Puplick made are without substantial foundation. His arguments did not take on board the breadth of this proposal and take into consideration an integration of all aspects of it. It is for those reasons that the Democrats are supporting the Government, and not because we have done a deal with the Government. We have independently assessed this report and we believe it is in the best interests of the delivery of high quality primary health care in Australia-and general practice. It will take on those broader aspects about which concern has been expressed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the report prepared by the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance on the vocational registration of general practitioners. I would like to join with other senators in thanking the Committee secretariat for all its efforts, particularly in the preparation of the Committee's report. Derek Abbott, the Committee secretary, Barry Jenkins, Laurie Swift and Christine McDonald have all done a tremendous job in very difficult circumstances, and they deserve great credit for their work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is the first Senate select committee that I have served on and the first parliamentary committee report, of any description, with which I have been associated. I say, as the newest senator, that working with the other Committee members was an enjoyable and worthwhile experience, and the unanimous report of the Committee is a significant achievement. The Committee inquired extensively into the meaning and implications of clause 10 of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. Clause 10 of that Bill contains a package of proposals which will provide a better level of health care and improved health outcomes for all Australians by the creation of a vocational register for general practitioners (GPs). Such a register will mean there will be a better quality and standard of health care delivered by better-trained doctors. </PARA>
<PARA> The Select Committee recommended broadening the process by which a medical practitioner can obtain vocational registration through the establishment of a Vocational Registration Eligibility Committee (VREC). The Committee has also recommended the establishment of a Vocational Registration Appeals Committee (VRAC), which will hear appeals from medical practitioners who have been refused certification and other practitioners whose names have been removed from the register under the provisions of proposed new section 3g in the Bill. The establishment of VREC and VRAC is a genuine attempt to come to grips with a major problem area that was identified not only by the medical community but also by the Opposition. Enrolment on the register is voluntary. The register will be nothing more than an annotation on the existing register of medical practitioners which will indicate the eligibility of general practitioners to use new item numbers of the medical benefits schedule which are available only to vocationally registered GPs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate now faces an absurd and regrettable situation. This Select Committee was established as a result of a motion moved by Senator Puplick on behalf of the Opposition. The Committee has heard evidence from 29 individuals and organisations, and examined 225 written submissions. The Committee comprised members from the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the National Party of Australia and the Australian Democrats. Through this process it has produced a unanimous report, but what is the Opposition's response? It is its usual negative, carping and destructive approach. It will now oppose this Committee's report, I believe, only from sheer bloody-mindedness. I suppose that is not an unusual response from the Opposition. After all, it changes its industrial relations policy on a daily basis. It even changes its leadership fairly regularly. But one would think that, with a report like this-which is responsive to issues that have been raised, and issues that the Opposition itself identified as being problem areas-the Opposition would follow the leadership provided by Senator Peter Baume and Senator Sheil. </PARA>
<PARA> After all, it was Senator Peter Baume and Senator Sheil who sat through and participated in the work of the Committee. It was those two senators who read all the submissions, heard all the evidence and participated in drawing up the report and its recommendations. I for one place on record my appreciation of their constructive approach. Unfortunately, we have seen some sort of backroom `get square' from some members of the Opposition, which will see all that good and productive work done by Senator Baume and Senator Sheil on behalf of the Opposition go down the drain. It is very disappointing that Senator Baume and Senator Sheil have been dudded by their colleagues in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition finds itself very isolated with its about-face on the issue of vocational registration for GPs. We have the remarkable situation where the Government, the college, the Australian Medical Association (AMA) and health consumers are all in agreement and support the Committee's report. Only the Opposition and a few extremist resident medical officers and medical students find themselves caught between a rock and a hard place in opposition to the Committee's unanimous report. Dr Graeme Miller, the Honorary Secretary of the RACGP, said on behalf of the college in a press release after the publication of the Committee's report:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's unanimous recommendations, with the support of all political parties-</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate here: at that stage he was not aware of the backsliding of the Opposition-</PARA>
<PARA>will put general practice back on the road to recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has acted as an expert referee and the College would be delighted if the AMA would now join with it as a partner in further improving the quality of patient care and the standards and status of general practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The College welcomes the Committee's recommendation that the AMA should return to the negotiating table on fees and rebates. </PARA>
<PARA>The AMA, whose role I criticised in the debate on the Bill previously, has also responded constructively to the Select Committee's report. Dr Bryce Phillips, the Federal President of the AMA, issued a press release on 16 August under the heading `AMA will respond positively to Senate inquiry into GP fees'. What a refreshing headline from the AMA! In that press release Dr Phillips stated that the Committee's inquiry provided the opportunity for concerned groups within the medical profession to put their views to the Government. Dr Phillips said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Select Committee has addressed most of these concerns in a well balanced way . . . The AMA will therefore adopt a constructive attitude to the recommendations of the Select Committee and will respond positively to proposals for its further involvement in implementing the general thrust of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said, this is a very refreshing approach from the AMA and one that stands in stark contrast to the one we heard from the Opposition and Senator Puplick today. </PARA>
<PARA> The Consumers Health Forum has also welcomed the Committee's report and has publicly encouraged the college and the AMA to respond constructively to the report's recommendations. It is in this very positive atmosphere that we have the Opposition's absolutely pathetic attempt to make political capital out of this report. It really is a very cynical exercise by the Opposition. Of course, Senator Peter Baume, who is sitting over there, knows that the Opposition's approach is wrong. Senator Puplick, who is sitting in front of him, also knows that the Opposition's approach is wrong. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Reynolds is right. I suppose it is a bit embarrassing for him. All Opposition members know that they are wrong on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to those main areas of the Bill which the Opposition and some significant sections of the medical community identified as the reason for establishing the Select Committee. In each case not only have these criticisms been dealt with properly-this is not only my opinion; it is the unanimous view of the whole Committee-but also satisfactory solutions have been found to them. Concerns were expressed that only the college would be able to determine eligibility for enrolment on the vocational register of any general practitioner. In most cases, the college will still determine eligibility, but with the establishment of the VREC, primary care medical practitioners who either do not apply for registration through the college or are referred by the college to VREC will have another avenue available to obtain registration.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has also addressed the need for an appeals mechanism for those who have been refused certification or whose removal from the register is sought by the college under 3g of clause 10 by the establishment of VRAC. The Committee has properly provided an appeals mechanism for any general practitioner affected by proposed new section 3g. The AMA and the college, as well as the Australian Medical Council and the National Specialists Qualifications Advisory Committee, will be represented on the VREC and the VRAC. This is exactly what the Opposition wanted and it is exactly what the Opposition got. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to another problem area-the question of the definition of general practice raised again today by Senator Puplick. Proposed new sections 3f and 3g refer to the terms `predominantly in general practice' and `general practice'. The words `predominantly in general practice' have resulted in a great deal of confusion within the profession. The Committee heard evidence that on occasions conflicting advice on the meaning of `predominantly in general practice' had been given to GPs by the college. This has now been clarified by the college, which has defined `predominantly in general practice' as meaning that `more than 50 per cent of the practitioner's time or services, as claimed against Medicare, is spent in general practice'. This has cleared the air. Again, it is what the Opposition wanted; again, it is what the Opposition got. Questions were raised about subspecialities of general practice such as women's health, sport medicine, family planning and so forth. The college indicated in its supplementary submission to the Committee that Aboriginal health clinics, women's health clinics and student health clinics, amongst others, would fall within the definition. The college said:</PARA>
<PARA>Practices which limit their services to a narrow range of disease states or treatment modalities would generally not meet the definition. </PARA>
<PARA> Specific non-recognised specialities such as sports medicine, sexual counselling, acupuncture, hypnotherapy, etc, where these constitute the predominant form of practice may not qualify. However each practice would be considered on its merits. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's three recommendations contained in paragraph 3.56 will allay any remaining fears regarding the special interest areas of general practice. Again, this was demanded by the Opposition, and it has been addressed and resolved-the Opposition got what it wanted. </PARA>
<PARA> Organisations representing women doctors and individual women doctors have been particularly vocal about clause 10 of the legislation. Their principal concerns are that if women doctors wish to work part time or to stop work altogether for a period to allow them to have a family, they will be disadvantaged by vocational registration. There is certainly some validity in those claims. The Committee has gone as far as it can to meet the needs of such doctors. The attitude of the Committee was that while some disadvantage will inevitably be suffered by these doctors, this should be minimised by making sure that training schemes are equally accessible to both part time workers and women returning to the medical work force after a temporary absence. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the standard set by the college for vocational registration in the transitional period prior to 1995 is not onerous. The college has accepted two sessions per week for five years as the acceptable minimum level for registrations. In setting the five-year period, it is saying that a continuity of experience gained over a longer period is more valuable than a shorter more concentrated amount of experience. For this reason it will not accept more sessions for fewer years. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a great deal of admiration for women who manage to combine a career with a family. I have had first-hand experience of the pressures and the expenses that this causes. However, it needs to be said that the dilemmas faced by women doctors-that is, family claims versus career claims-are no greater or smaller than those faced by other professional women or, indeed, by any working woman. Equally, whilst arguments put to the Committee about such issues as costs and availability of child-care are in my view legitimate, they are problems faced by working women with young children. They are not specifically matters for this Committee to make recommendations on in the context of vocational registration. I also say-I know Senator Crowley will approve-that I hold out the hope that men are concerned with these important issues as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has also considered a number of submissions put to it about problems facing rural doctors; however whilst recommending the legitimacy of a number of issues raised, the Committee felt that such matters as after hours fees and the differential between fees paid to GPs and specialists performing similar services did not fall within the terms of reference of the Committee. It recommended that these concerns be addressed urgently by the Australian Health Ministers Conference. As to the question of vocational registration the Committee came to the conclusion that rural doctors would not face any special discrimination under the proposed scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> More than any other aspect of this whole debate, the proposed Independent Peer Review Organisation (IPRO) has received a great deal of criticism. It is worth reinforcing the point that the IPRO draft proposal was no more than that-a draft. The independence of the proposed IPRO was never accepted by the profession. It was perceived, as the Committee heard and read on countless occasions, to be little more than a mechanism for the college or the Government-depending on who was the biggest bogy person-just to spy on general practitioners. The draft operating principles of IPRO said in paragraph 5:</PARA>
<PARA> The IPRO will be a statutory body, independent of government and the RACGP. </PARA>
<PARA>Somehow by the time we got to paragraph 26 in the IPRO draft proposal, the independence from the Government and the college seemed to have got a little lost. Paragraph 26 said:</PARA>
<PARA> Draft composition of the board of management will ensure that the IPRO . . . will be composed of three members nominated by the RACGP, a nominee from a separate, appropriate medical organisation chosen by the Minister in consultation with the RACGP, a nominee of the Department of Community Services and Health and a nominee of the Health Insurance Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>Whilst there was some cause for concern about the issue of independence-there was obviously genuine concern about the operation of random professional audits-a great deal of hysteria over the IPRO draft proposal was whipped up unnecessarily. The Committee's response was very constructive. IPRO will sink without trace although there will be a descriptor utilisation review committee, the DURC, which I think is an awful acronym. Even Senator Puplick agrees with me on that point. I knew that eventually in the Senate I would find something with which Senator Puplick and I agreed on. The DURC will be established to review the new descriptors. Senator Puplick thinks that DURCs do other things, I am sure. </PARA>
<PARA> The college, the Department and the AMA will all be involved in the process of finalising the proposal for descriptor utilisation review. The scuttling of IPRO and the recommendations contained in paragraph 3.105 represent, again, a positive response to the evidence provided to the Select Committee. This is precisely what the Opposition wanted; it is precisely what the Opposition got. All witnesses before the Committee accepted that the college was the appropriate body to set professional standards for general practice. The Committee was keen to see the college remove itself from the fee negotiation arena and concentrate solely on professional matters. While the AMA has previously withdrawn from the role of negotiating with the Government, the Committee identified clearly that this was the appropriate function for the AMA to undertake. The Federal President of the AMA, Dr Phillips, has accepted that the Committee proposed a major role for the AMA in dealing with all of the issues raised by the legislation and this report. </PARA>
<PARA> The college was also roundly criticised for inadequately consulting with the profession over the original proposals and the college accepted, to be fair, that some of those criticisms were justified. It is important to realise that the college and the Minister wrote to all GPs about the proposal but they received little feedback. Unfortunately, the atmosphere of the debate was such that little constructive discussion took place on the proposals at all. This action was carried out in good faith. The Committee accepted that consultation with the profession was inadequate and that this contributed to the raising of emotions over the question of vocational registration. This is another area where this Select Committee responded favourably to the concerns of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I would like to say that the Opposition really ought to examine its conscience-if it has one-on this whole issue. We find a unanimous Select Committee report dealing positively with a whole range of criticisms made by the Opposition being rejected by the Opposition without any rational basis at all. What a monumental waste of time, resources and taxpayers' money the whole exercise has been! The Opposition ought to reflect on the reason for setting up this Select Committee and as to whether there is any point in the Select Committee, which the Opposition wanted established and which it participated in, continuing its work. Senator Peter Baume and Senator Sheil deserve a great deal better than they are receiving from the Opposition on this issue. The Parliament deserves better than the Opposition's rejection of a unanimous report of a select committee. The people of Australia deserve better. I commend the Select Committee's report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to look at the history of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. If we look at the debate that ensued when this legislation came before the Senate we will find that the Opposition was very concerned about the sloppy legislation that the Government brought to this place. I can remember the debate when we were saying, `What about an appeals mechanism? There is no appeals mechanism in the legislation before us'. If a general practitioner wanted to appeal, because he had not been put on the register, that person had no formal method of doing so. The Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) assured us at that time that there was no need for an appeals mechanism in the legislation and that at a later stage one would be brought up by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. Therefore, the college would have its own appeals mechanism. I think Senator Puplick said at the time that that would be like adopting the Caesar unto Caesar principle.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, it was Senator Peter Baume. I knew that it was one of our better debaters in this place. Perhaps I have won just one little point with Senator Peter Baume today. The legislation suggests that two streams should be available to general practitioners who want to be put on the vocational register. One way was to go through the college-we all know what that entails-and the second was to go through an alternative stream, the guidelines of which would be given to us at a later stage through the regulations. We on this side of the House were not prepared to accept legislation whereby registration could be done through the college or through an alternative stream, which we had not seen because we had not seen the regulations that were to apply to the legislation. We had not seen the proposed guidelines; we just knew that there would be an alternative stream. We were not prepared to accept such sloppy legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> More importantly, if honourable senators look at proposed new section 3h of the Health Insurance Act, as contained in section 10 of the Community Services and Health Legislation Act, they will find that the Minister can do away entirely with the college and set up a preferred provider scheme. In other words, the Minister, through just making an announcement in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette, could say, `I am going to set up an entirely different body, perhaps a body of bureaucrats, and it will select the doctors who will become practitioners and be entitled to a higher schedule fee than those lesser mortals that we do not like the look of'. That is what proposed new section 3h is all about. Because the Opposition and the Australian Democrats were not prepared to accept this sloppy legislation, we insisted that the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance be set up to inquire into all the problems that we had brought forward. I congratulate the Senate Select Committee on dealing very speedily with the problems. It reported to the Senate right on the dot, which is most unusual for committees in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's recommendations dealt with the majority of my concerns. The Committee considered appeals and in the Government's draft regulations there is an appeals mechanism. I am not altogether happy with that because I think that appeals ought to be dealt with in the legislation. Although regulations are not the correct mechanism with which to deal with appeals, at least they are in the regulations. The Government claims that it would take too long to amend the legislation to put the appeals mechanism in the correct place, so it was accepted that the appeals mechanism would be in the regulations. Under the draft regulations, a general practitioner can appeal if he is not accepted for registration on the vocational register. He can also appeal if he is crossed off the register and does not believe that he should be. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was very keen to see an alternative stream. This is where the draft regulations have not abided by the Committee's recommendation. The Committee made it very clear that it wanted two streams: one through the college, and one through a committee. The draft regulations leave us with two streams each doing the same thing. They state that the committee must take the college's guidelines into consideration, and that is my concern. It is no use having two lots of people dancing to the same tune. I believe that is an area where the draft guidelines have let the Committee down considerably. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that proposed new section 3h represents a first step in the preferred provider scheme and gives the Minister far more power than he should have. It believes that this new section should be amended or taken out of the legislation as soon as possible. The Committee has said that if the Government promises publicly to take the proposed new section out of the legislation it would be willing to have the legislation proclaimed. I do not trust the Government as much as the Committee does. I believe that if the will is there, and if the Government is really prepared to take proposed new section 3h out of the legislation at the earliest opportunity, it could be done today. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been a member of this place for some time now and I have seen a government which has the will to do something amend legislation and get it through both Houses of the Parliament in one afternoon. Yet we are told that would be just too hard and too tricky. The Government believes that as long as it makes a public promise to amend the legislation at the earliest opportunity, we will accept it. I am not terribly keen on the legislation being proclaimed and the Government promising to amend it as soon as possible. I do not think that the regulations accommodate an alternative stream. We do not know about the negotiated position on the minor amendments that the Minister is talking about. We have nothing before us which indicates that these regulations, which are presently draft regulations, will have minor amendments made to them. We on this side have seen nothing which indicates what those minor amendments will be; yet we are asked to proclaim the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken to members of the Royal College and they agree that the regulations need amending. They have said that they will negotiate with the Government to have the regulations amended so that they will more accurately fit in with the recommendations of the Committee. It has to be realised that we are now being asked to condone those regulations because we said that unless the regulations came up to scratch we would not be seeking proclamation of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not satisfied with the regulations. The Government tells us that it will have to make minor amendments and the college tells us that it is negotiating to have amendments made. That is just not good enough for the Opposition. As I said, this matter could have been brought before the chamber in a sensible, rational manner. If the Government had had the will to do so the regulations could have been amended; indeed, regulations could have been brought down that did not need amending. We could amend the legislation to delete proposed new section 3h. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what the College wants from the students before they become, if you like, proper doctors, general practitioners. I give the example of 18-year-old students who have just left school. They face six years as a student-sometimes five years, depending on the State-two years in a hospital, two years of the family medicine program, and one year in which they do other general practice or a subspeciality such as the diploma of obstetrics. The College tells me that it is negotiating to give provisional registration on the vocational register to people who spend two years on the family medicine program. If the Government had brought forward legislation of that sort, perhaps we would not have the problem we have today. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition cannot possibly accept legislation that needs so much negotiation to take place before it is considered sensible and before it is acceptable to the College, to the students, to the Australian Medical Association and to us. We have to tidy up this legislation. The negotiations should already have taken place. We have a need for further negotiations to take place, for example, in the area of sports medicine, in the subspecialities of general practice. As the guidelines for the College stand, the people who are doing sports medicine or who are on the family planning program-that type of medicine-would not be able to join the vocational register. I am told that the general practitioners doing sports medicine are negotiating for a parallel course. They can then apply for specialist recognition. So negotiations are taking place over yet another area before this Bill is proclaimed. We are being asked to proclaim this legislation while all these negotiations are taking place. That is not the way we normally conduct the passage of legislation in this place. It is not the way that we go about tidying it up. We cannot proclaim legislation with about four or five streams of negotiations being conducted so that eventually the legislation will be efficient. It is for these reasons that the Opposition is not supporting the proclamation of clause 10 of the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief, as I know there is a lot of legislation before us. The reason I am speaking at all is that I have talked to a number of people about this legislation, and I felt that it was necessary for me to explain my position. I was originally opposed to it on the basis of the damage that it might do to women, particularly, in the profession. Several women doctors have made representations to me. I think that I have been satisfied that it will not unduly harm the women in the profession, if good sense prevails. What we have to count on or hope will happen is that people will be reasonable about it. Certainly women could be disadvantaged, especially in the family planning areas, if they were not allowed back on the register after taking courses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to make a few basic observations about the medical profession. I feel that it is not serving society any more in the way that it used to. In fact, there is a crisis of confidence in the medical profession. What is needed in medical courses is less technological training and more concentration perhaps on sensitivity training, personal growth courses--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1J4">Senator SANDERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose he will. I think that women general practitioners are far better than men general practitioners because they do have sensitivity and do operate out of a sense of feeling. We need more humility and common sense. This cannot be taught in a course; it comes from experience and from a basic feeling of well-being, I suppose, in the practitioner. The growth of alternative medicine in this country is an indication that people are turning away from traditional medicine because it is simply not answering their needs. I hope that this legislation will allow people to be trained in these areas. There is no provision for that in the legislation. I suggest that some training along the lines of personal growth should have been included.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not at all critical of the technological aspects of medicine. If I went around a corner too fast on my motorbike, hit some gravel and came off, I am sure that the doctors could stitch me together. I hope they could stitch me together. They could put in silicon here and there; they could put in titanium implants. I am sure they would be technologically qualified to do so. But what about the cold I have at this moment? What can the medical profession do about my cold? It can do nothing-zilch and zero. My cold is not solely a physical manifestation; it also has emotional aspects. I think the medical profession is too limited in its view. It looks at the human being as strictly a physical organism. It has to take in other things. I am sure that the medical practitioners in this chamber would agree. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel that the legislation is worth while. I am not in the business of opposing Government legislation simply for the sake of opposing it-and the Australian Democrats are not in general. I will be voting for it. On balance it is good legislation. I urge the medical profession to take a good look at itself and try to take a more holistic approach to its profession. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly to the motion moved by Senator Cook this morning relating to the vocational registration of general practitioners (GPs). I am very sorry that Senator Glen Sheil from our National Party, who was a member of the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance, is not here to speak on his own account. I think all honourable senators would agree with me that we in this chamber are very saddened for the reason that Senator Sheil is not here. He lost his wife, Dr Marjorie Sheil, who was herself a general practitioner. I am sure that all extend to him their sincerest sympathy in his very sad loss.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many letters and representations have been received in my office regarding the report on the vocational registration of general practitioners. There is much to commend in encouraging general practitioners to upgrade their skills and to lift the standard of medicine they practise and the quality of health care that they deliver to the Australian community. Let there be no doubt that I strongly support the principles behind that move. However, I do not and cannot support the way in which the Government is seeking to make these changes without first gaining the full support of all those who will be expected to put the new arrangements into operation. Health policy is a far too important issue and area to be used as a testing ground. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators are no doubt aware, when this proposal was first raised it was opposed on the grounds that it was discriminatory, that it placed too much power in the hands of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP), and that not enough was known about the details which could govern its implementation. The decision to refer this matter to a Senate select committee has been vindicated by the Committee finding a number of serious defects in the legislation. In order to address these concerns the Government has now presented to the Senate the regulations to control the operations of the vocational register. But these regulations do not address those original concerns, nor do they reflect, in my opinion, the intentions of the Senate Committee. The Committee envisaged that the regulations would provide for an alternative route for GPs to be admitted to the register other than through the RACGP. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, in its reaction to the Committee's report, acknowledged this. On page 10 of its formal response, it stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of these regulations is to establish; an alternative way for medical practitioners to become vocationally registered, other than via the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Yet it is clear that the Government was uttering only words and nothing else. It did not mean what it said because nowhere has this intention been reflected in the regulations which provide for the establishment of vocational registration eligibility committees and a Vocational Registration Appeals Committee. Members of these committees are to be medical practitioners with training and experience in general practice selected from panels of nominees put forward by the RACGP, the Australian Medical Association, the National Specialists Qualifications Advisory Committee and the Australian Medical Council. The requirement for these members to be experienced in general practice means that these bodies could either be dominated by, or completely made up of, RACGP members. People with an interest in the future of general practice, such as medical students, doctors in training, the deans and staff of medical schools and medical practitioners from fields other than general practice, will be excluded. </PARA>
<PARA> The creation of a vocational register of general practitioners has more to do with imposing controls on the medical profession than increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of overall medical services. It is an attempt to divide the medical profession and to get the members of that profession squabbling amongst themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> General practice is the backbone of our health care system. I am sure that Senator Crowley would agree with that. It must be treated with extreme caution or the fabric of the whole structure will simply fall apart. But, instead of acting with caution, the Government has pushed on and struck a deal which is not supported by the vast majority of general practitioners. We have to relate this to those people who go to general practitioners when they are not feeling well and are very glad to have a GP whom they know and to whom they can relate. The deal which the Government has struck is not supported by the people who will have to operate in any changed environment-the very people who will be charged with the responsibility of putting the new arrangements into operation. </PARA>
<PARA> The lack of extensive consultation with all parts of the medical profession and the way in which the Government's proposals place immense power over general practice in the hands of the bureaucracy and one section of the medical profession are matters with which I cannot agree. I can tell the Senate that these objections are shared by the majority of the existing members of the medical profession; indeed, even those studying for entry into that profession. I am sure that many honourable senators have received, just as I have, hundreds of letters objecting to what is being foisted onto the medical profession. Those letters spell out in detail how the Government's plans serve only to discriminate against many general practitioners, in particular, women general practitioners; rural doctors; part time general practitioners; those working in fields such as sports medicine, student health clinics and women's health clinics; and current and future medical students. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for reasons such as these that I believe it is essential to oppose the proposals which give the RACGP monopoly power over entry to the vocational register which could result in a system of manpower, or womanpower, control by way of a closed shop arrangement. Any attempt to apply to the largest group in the medical profession a system of registration which does not have adequate safeguards, assurances and safety valves and which gives some members of that group the ability to advantage themselves at the expense of others should be resisted. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this proposal has more to do with the regulation and control of general practitioners than with raising the standard and quality of patient care. The principle that general practitioners should be encouraged to further their education and training and be rewarded for doing so should be encouraged and supported, but these regulations do not accurately reflect the intentions of the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance. I am sorry that Senator Sheil, who served on this Committee, is not here to speak about this matter. I believe that these regulations do not address the concerns of the interested parties about the discriminatory nature of the register and the monopoly power being placed in the hands of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. These are some of the reasons why the Opposition has taken the stance that it has. I certainly will be supporting the Opposition's position on this matter and not the motion moved by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I rise to speak to the motion moved by Senator Cook, in effect, to approve of proposed new sections 3f, 3g, and 3h of the Health Insurance Act 1973, as contained in clause 10 of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. Basically, these proposed new sections would introduce a vocational register for general practitioners and a two-tier system of rebate. This whole scheme is really typical of much of what is done by this Labor Government. It is a typical case of closing the door after the horse has bolted. What is entailed in the proposals put forward is prolonged training after graduation, to ensure, as far as the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) is concerned, that we have newly registered practitioners prepared for general practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last year, the report of the Doherty Inquiry into Medical Education and Medical Workforce-a long and detailed report-outlined a number of concerns about general practice. All of us here today would admit that there is a lot to be done in terms of general practice and continuing medical education in general practice. But let me assure the Senate that this is not a discussion about continuing medical education. I believe that continuing medical education is a process that goes on for the life of a general practitioner. This legislation is about the immediate post-registration years; it is not about doing a lifelong course. I believe that continuing medical education is important. The Opposition has said over and over again in this chamber that it supports continuing medical education, but I cannot support this legislation and I will outline some of the reasons why. The Doherty Committee of Inquiry into Medical Education and Medical Workforce said in its report that a number of things needed to be done, especially with respect to medical education at an undergraduate level and in the first and second years out of medical school. It recommended:</PARA>
<PARA>Medical schools aim to provide exposure to general practice, early in the course as well as providing at least a month's block experience in general practices or community health centres late in the course. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommended that medical schools increase the exposure to general practice. The Committee also recommended that the Commonwealth Government should have more money for recruiting suitably qualified staff and increased opportunities for practical training for general practice in resident medical years. The Government seems to have ignored this. Senator Cook has guaranteed places in the family medicine program. But he did not guarantee today that there will be those sorts of facilities for undergraduate training. Seven deans of Australasian medical schools, who were not even interviewed by the Committee-and I commend the Committee for its effort in reporting as quickly as it did-are referred to in a letter sent to Senator Crowley. Professor Graeme Ryan said in that letter:</PARA>
<PARA> As Chairman of the Committee of Deans of Australasian Medical Schools, I submit to you the view of the Deans of the seven Australian Medical Schools listed below that the Senate should not approve of clause 10 of the above Bill-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989-</PARA>
<PARA>on the basis that it is ill-conceived, discriminatory and inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The Deans of the Australian Medical Schools support the principles first, that graduates entering medical practice in any discipline should have opportunities to experience an appropriate preparatory period of supervised training and, secondly, that graduates should be encouraged to maintain their knowledge and skills through participation in continuing education programs. However, it is our firm view that the vocational registration process proposed in the above Bill, linked with different scales of remuneration and creating two classes of medical practitioner on grounds that are open to objection, is an inappropriate means of achieving these ends. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The Deans recommend that the Senate Select Committee advise the Minister for Community Services and Health of the urgent need to address constructively this issue of the resource constraints currently affecting medical undergraduate programmes in the universities, including general practice placements and supervision, as identified by the Doherty Committee. Furthermore, the Deans wish to indicate the capacity and willingness of the medical schools to develop and deliver comprehensive, high quality, continuing medical education programmes, subject to the provision of appropriate additional funding. </PARA>
<PARA>The Doherty report recommends that measures be taken to improve general practitioner experience in undergraduate programs. The deans of seven Australasian medical schools are recommending the same thing. But we did not see the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health address that issue today. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the coalition is supportive of continuing medical education. But this legislation is not really about continuing medical education. I will tell the Senate why a real effort at continuing medical education is not addressed. If current general practitioners who will be admitted to the vocational register under the grandfather clause had been asked or expected to upgrade their qualifications to prove that they were engaging in appropriate standards of general practice, there would have been an outcry, just as there has been an outcry from the young medical students, graduates, young women in our universities and our resident medical officers (RMOs). </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the protestations of the Government and the RACGP, the proposals will discriminate against women. I do not accept the arguments that the Australian Democrats have put forward that the concerns have been adequately answered. Currently, approximately 50 per cent of our young undergraduates in medicine are females. I believe that is a tremendous achievement in a profession which in the past did not attract that percentage of young women. As Senator Walters said, when young women or young men of 18 years of age are faced with the prospect of 11 years training in some States and 10 years in others before they are fully fledged and can attract the top rebate, many will be discouraged from entering the medical profession. I believe that we will see a decline in the number of young women choosing medicine as a profession. By combining a career and child bearing and rearing, many women will take much longer to complete their fellowship examinations and training. Those who have to train part-time will take a lot longer than 11 years to complete their courses. Senator Coulter says that women will be able to use the alternative route for accreditation. But we do not have the details about this alternative. I am sure that some of the young women doctors who will be facing this problem will be interested in them. </PARA>
<PARA> As has already been mentioned today, doctors working exclusively or predominantly in a specialist area of general practice, such as family planning, menopausal or breast clinics, may not find themselves eligible to be placed on the register. Not much comfort can be found in the draft RACGP Guidelines for the Vocational Registration of General Practitioners which take into account those people who want to direct their attention to a specialist area. The draft says:</PARA>
<PARA> Restriction of the practice population to a particular social or ethnic group should not take the practice outside the definition if other criteria are met. Therefore, Aboriginal health clinics, women's health clinics and student health clinics amongst others could fall within the RACGP definition. </PARA>
<PARA>They only `could' fall within the definition. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Practices which limit their services, however, to a narrow range of disease states or treatment modalities, would generally not meet that definition. Specific non-recognised specialities such as sports medicine, sexual counselling, acupuncture, hypnotherapy, where these constitute the predominant form of practice, may not qualify. Practitioners will, nevertheless, be considered on their own merits. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think this is satisfactory. I think we should have seen more specific guidelines for entry to the vocational register. I am sure that a number of the women and men who specialise in sports medicine would have liked to have seen more details. </PARA>
<PARA> I have other concerns about this legislation. Despite what the Minister says, there is no guarantee that there will be sufficient training positions available for all doctors who require them to qualify for inclusion in the vocational register. The RACGP will have, in effect, a monopoly on the accreditation of training. Also, there are still some questions that need to be answered. I was discussing with the RACGP the other day what happens to people who go off the register for reasons of, for example, child caring or caring for an aged parent. I wanted to know whether people who are eligible to be on the register will be able to go back on the register if they go back into general practice as defined. A medical friend of mine rang the RACGP yesterday to ask what would happen if she qualified under the grandfather clause, was not engaging in general practice after 1995 for a period of time and wanted to go back on to the register. She was told by a senior administrative officer of the RACGP that if she returned to work after a break after 1995 she would have to train again. I presume by that that she would have to do the Fellowship of the Royal College of General Practitioners examination or get on to the vocational register again through the other stream. She may or may not have been misinformed, but that is the level of misinformation that seems to be around. It is difficult to evaluate if, on the one hand, I get one answer and, on the other hand, a general practitioner gets another. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook said in his speech that the Australian Medical Association (AMA) does not oppose the legislation and recommends its endorsement. After he said that, I left the chamber and spoke to the President of the AMA, because I wanted to be sure about what he was saying. He said to me that the AMA does not accept the concept of a two-tier system and believes that a number of groups will be disadvantaged. What the AMA has agreed to is cooperating if this legislation goes through. That is a very different picture from the picture that Senator Cook put before us. </PARA>
<PARA> We are being asked to pass legislation which, I believe, is not about continuing medical education. It does not address the recommendations of the Doherty report. It discriminates against those people currently in training, particularly women. We have not got all the details of the alternative stream. The appeals mechanisms are not in the legislation. If some of these issues had been placed in the legislation and not in regulations, we would have been able to discuss them at the committee stage in order to iron out some of the problems that we believe exist. The legislation does not really address the issue of long term continuing medical education. </PARA>
<PARA> If this legislation goes through, it will be because the Australian Democrats and the Independents in this place have voted with the Government. If they do, I hope that they will be able to justify their actions. The Victoria President of the Democrats failed to convince a large gathering of Monash and Melbourne University students and RMOs which had gathered outside 400 Flinders Street in Melbourne only last Tuesday that the Democrats were representing their interests. I hope they will be able to do so after today. I call on my Democrat and Independent colleagues not to support this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are talking about the regulations proposed for the vocational register of general practitioners. The coalition opposes these regulations for the operation of the vocational register of general practitioners on the grounds that they simply do not reflect the intentions of a Senate select committee that unanimously set out recommendations designed to remedy some of the major defects of the original Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. It is clear that the Government has made no attempt to understand the concerns of responsible members of the medical profession as to the monopoly power that the original clause 10, and now these regulations, give to one section of the profession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not impugn the integrity or intentions of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP). It is a fact that the problem arose in part because the RACGP found itself negotiating with the Labor Government on behalf of the medical profession, a situation that the Government considered was to its advantage at the time. For this reason the report of the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance recommends the participation of the Australian Medical Association (AMA), and urges the establishment of both the Vocational Registration Eligibility Committee and the Vocational Registration Appeals Committee, with membership drawn from not only the RACGP but also the AMA, the Australian Medical Council (AMC) and the National Specialist Qualifications Advisory Committee (NSQAC). These essential committees would obviously enjoy the input of the RACGP, but would also reflect the broader aspects of the medical profession. That sounds particularly reasonable on the surface. The RACGP has a valuable role to play as a certifying body, but this does not mean that it should enjoy what could be an effective monopoly of registrations within the government controlled health system. </PARA>
<PARA> In these regulations the Labor Government perpetuates its unsatisfactory legislative proposals and fails to implement the intention of the Select Committee by giving the RACGP monopoly power over entry to the vocational register. That is really what we are on about today. It is all very well to set up committees for eligibility and appeal and deficiencies in the original legislation that the coalition firmly pointed out and then negate their independent discretion by the insistence of regulation 7 that they `must have regard to the criteria published by the RACGP' regarding eligibility. That is purely and simply contradictory. So much for the supposed intention of the regulations to establish an alternative for vocational registration, other than via the RACGP. </PARA>
<PARA> The scope of the Vocational Registration Eligibility Committee and the Vocational Registration Appeals Committee is severely narrowed by regulation 11 (1) that specifies that their committee members must be doctors with experience and training in general practice. Quite frankly, it does not take a doctor of philosophy to work out that the AMA, the AMC and the NSQAC will be severely circumscribed as to who they may nominate to serve on the committees that will govern vocational registration. </PARA>

The Australian Medical Association would be confined to nominating those of its members who are also members of the RACGP, while a specialist body, such as the NSQAC, would be hard put to nominate anyone from its own ranks. The personnel of the committees will be dominated yet again by the RACGP which just further reduces their independence. That was the reason for the Opposition in the first instance referring this matter to a committee. It was believed by the Opposition and the Australian Democrats that there must be independence on this Committee. Altogether the NSQAC and the AMC, with only one eligible member between them as defined in regulation 11, will through regulations 9 and 10 be required to submit 48 nominations for the Vocational Registration Eligibility Committee and a further three for the Vocational Registration Appeals Committee.

<PARA> Once more the coalition expresses its concern that while regulation 6 (a) specifies removal from the register once a doctor is no longer in general practice, there is absolutely no mechanism for his readmission to the register. Thus doctors who leave general practice for sports medicine, and female general practitioners taking time off for child rearing, still remain at risk from later being excluded from the register. The fact remains that the guidelines issued by the RACGP largely retain their force under these regulations and responsible members of the medical profession regard them as too restrictive. It would be a great mistake at this stage for the Senate to approve a supposedly impartial mechanism for their administration that by accident or intent will exclude the participation of even the deans and staff of medical schools besides medical practitioners from fields other than general practice. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only return to the criticism that I made against the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill, that these regulations point to a Labor government more concerned with controlling doctors than with raising the standards of general practice. It is an exercise in double talk to claim to implement the recommendations of the Select Committee, but to effectively deny its intention to allow for vocational registration independent of the RACGP, which continues to have an inappropriate role forced upon it. It is questionable that these regulations should proceed when extensive consultation is required with those groups in the medical profession who voiced the strongest concerns as to vocational registration in accord with RACGP guidelines, namely, women doctors and resident medical officers. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph 3.62 of the Select Committee's report acknowledged the anomalies in the registration of female doctors returning to the work force after child-bearing, a problem that was strongly raised by the coalition in debate. The Government must recognise that this essential facet of the medical work force has continued concerns regarding a vocational register and consultations should not be left to an unspecified time when the legislative and regulatory machinery is already in place. The objections of resident medical officers, working outside the family medicine program, have been acknowledged in the Committee's report. More attention has to be paid to the requirements of these dedicated young men and women who form both the next generation of specialists and general practitioners, and whose current long hours are the mainstay of our overstrained public hospital system. The `conscripted foot soldiers of the Medicare system' would be the best way to describe them. Both these groups consider that the report of the Select Committee is the beginning rather than the end of the process of consultation that must now take place if a vocational register is to be established on the grounds of medical excellence and equity rather than sectional or bureaucratic convenience. </PARA>
<PARA> We certainly agree with paragraph 5.30 of the Select Committee's report and its reference to inadequate consultation between the RACGP and the remainder of the profession in respect of the vocational register. This was exactly what the coalition was pointing out in the last session. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, which was formed as an academic body, through the actions of this Labor Government has been thrust into a position of undue dominance over an administrative process. This Government, through these regulations, seeks to evade the spirit of the Select Committee's recommendations. The regulations do not accurately reflect the Committee's findings. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise that the Committee did a lot of hard work, that it consulted and spoke to many people. There is no doubt that many members of the Committee were highly qualified to comment. My good friend and colleague Senator Peter Baume sitting beside me was a member of that Committee. He is a very highly qualified person. Nonetheless, the Government seeks to evade the recommendations of that Select Committee. The regulations are simply inadequate and contradictory and I believe they should not be passed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the approval of clause 10 of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill and the motion before the chamber. When the legislation was first introduced there was extensive debate in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. We have had an inquiry with some 225 submissions submitted to it. The Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance heard 27 witnesses over four days of hearings. They were not gentle, leisurely days of hearings, but very tightly scheduled, exacting days. We have canvassed the issues very thoroughly. We have had a unanimous report. We have had tabling speeches. We have had time for the parties to consider the reports. We have had a Government response with draft regulations and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners' definitions. We have had time to consider that. The issues have been thoroughly canvassed. They have been canvassed near to death by now. What more can the Opposition want? With particular capacity to nitpick, however, the Opposition found something that might do. It supported it with out-of-date, insufficient information. I am shocked at Senator Patterson. I thought she had more perspicacity. One of the points led for the Opposition by Senator Puplick was that the deans of colleges-the date was not mentioned, but I know when it was; it was in a submission to the Committee way back in July and it is out of date-were urging us not to vote for the clause. I suppose that comment could have been picked out, as could various comments by the Australian Medical Association (AMA) and a whole number of others. But on 28 August 1989, I received a letter which states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The Committee handled a complex and politically sensitive task with great skill. The report succinctly summarises the issues under question and gives direction and readily achievable solutions to some of the more contentious issues. </PARA>
<PARA>We earlier heard another quote from this editorial which highlighted the fact that the Committee resisted the temptation to put the boot in one place or another; that we produced a restrained and useful report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is encouraging to see that there are still corners of our parliamentary system which can address themselves to the issue at hand without getting sidetracked by the political mileage they can gain. </PARA>
<PARA>I cite those comments to say that we should put to rest forever the comprehensiveness or otherwise of the canvassing of these issues. They have certainly been comprehensively dealt with.

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much, Madam Acting Deputy President. There are a few points that I want to make. I think we have heard in this place today some extraordinary arguments and some quite remarkable evidence led by the Opposition by way of justifying its opposition to this. Let me make it clear that we have had an excellent inquiry and it has produced a very good report. It was a unanimous decision and the issues have been conducted and properly canvassed. We know that is the case. All sorts of people will report it. But we come in here and find the Opposition is opposing it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose it is true that the Opposition has a right to reject a unanimous report, that Senator Puplick, on behalf of the Opposition, can properly claim the rights of the Opposition caucus to know better. He can properly claim the right of his caucus to ignore the recommendations of his colleagues Senators Peter Baume and Glen Sheil. He can claim to maintain his proper right to political and parliamentary ineptitude of such extraordinary proportions. In fact, I think Senator Puplick's performance in here today was sufficient almost to justify Senator Bishop's campaign on recent activities in New South Wales. In fact if Senator Puplick is not judged inept, then he has to stand judged as totally disregarding of parliamentary procedures and Senate committee procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> Why establish committees at all? What is the point of coming back here with a comprehensive, well-covered, canvassing of the issues-the report was unanimously supported-and then saying, `Yes, we ignore that'. I might say that the Australian Democrats gave us a model of why we should establish committees. The Democrats agreed to the establishment of the Committee. They were concerned about the issues not being thoroughly canvassed; they have seen them canvassed; they feel that the complaints have been addressed and dealt with. Senator Coulter and his Democrat colleagues now see the right of that case and are going to support the clause; but not so the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> What support did Senator Baume have when he reported to the Liberal Party? I would love to have been there to hear the debate. Was it that Senator Peter Baume's canvassing of the issues was so derelict in comprehensiveness, so insufficient that Opposition members have had to say that he did not do the job?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Baume was part of a unanimous committee finding and the Opposition thinks that it can overrule it. Senator Puplick led a case against the finding. Senator Puplick picked out one submission that proposed a back dating to 1 July. Why did he pick that submission? Why not pick some others? He actually ran through the issues that Senator Peter Baume and others on the Committee had all dealt with. Senator Puplick should blush. It is an appalling process from him. In fact, I think Senator Puplick's performance is disgraceful. It is no longer amazing; it is pathetically predictable. He gives evidence in what he has done of what the Opposition is: a leaderless, rudderless rabble. The AMA supported the outcome, the College supports the outcome, the Government supports it and the Opposition claimed vindication. I cannot understand how the Opposition can claim vindication in that report and then change its mind. It is a stunning example of shining self-deception.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is the issue? The issue is whether general practice should be acknowledged as a significant and special area of medicine worthy of recognition. The Government achieves the most far-reaching advances which have ever been achieved in general practice in this country and yet the Opposition wants to oppose them. Are Opposition members going to say to the general practitioners of this country, `We think you should all be dudded of something like $15,000 per annum increase in income.'? That is what they are saying to the doctors of this country. `Liberal Party opposes increase in doctors fees' would make a very good headline. That is what honourable senators opposite have been saying in here. That is what they are going to vote on. Let us make no mistake about it: it is not about VREC or VRAC or whether somebody can or cannot do something. It is about whether the Opposition supports general practice, whether it is supporting an increase in fees for general practitioners. Let this be on Senator Puplick's head during the election. It is a quite amazing performance. After all this canvassing of the issues he has picked up the hair splitting exercise that he has picked up to cover his opposition to adequate remuneration and an acknowledgment of general practitioners and their contribution to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick actually said some daft nonsense about never supporting special interest groups but preferring to support the community at large. I ask him to tell me how the community at large will be advantaged by having its general practitioners set back like this. Can he tell me how that Opposition over there could come to the conclusions it did, in the face of the evidence which Senator Baume and Senator Glen Sheil gave when they reported on that Committee? I would like to ask Senator Bjelke-Petersen, although she is no longer here, how she expected Senator Sheil was going to cope. He was going to speak in this place, she said, but then he was apparently going to speak against his own recommendations and his own Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Patterson can keep saying no, but it is entirely unpersuasive. Those opposite did not convince us of anything. They have gone to one small point that they might want to make about VRECs and subcommittees. Senator Walters was talking about problems with regulations. Senator Puplick spoke about problems with regulations. They are not actually for debate today. They are not at issue today; they never have been. But apparently all this is too complex for them to follow. Are they for general practice? Are they for acknowledging the improvement of health care that is being designed under this legislation, or are they against it? By their vote they are against it. `Cop it! Cop those consequences'-that is what they are saying to the general practitioners and the people of this country: `We oppose improvements in general practice the way this legislation is proposed'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The thing that absolutely fascinates me is this: I am delighted to discover, when talking to the AMA, that there are now changes in the views of the AMA, let alone our understandings. But the Opposition has discovered women. Women, do you mind! This is the party that has produced a document called Back towards the past in which the place for women, if they had a place at all, is said to be totally dependent behind picket fences; they rated hardly a mention in the document. Now they are being held up by way of justification for and defence of this extraordinary posturing they have about opposing general practice. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate very much that there are enormous time constraints and I also acknowledge the cooperation of the Opposition in trying to finish this matter this morning so as to allow us to proceed to other things. I would have to say that we have the opportunity here, in voting on this legislation, to stop the nonsense, the delaying tactics, the stupid arguments and the obfuscation of the Opposition that we have seen in this matter. If ever an issue has been thoroughly canvassed, it is this one. In fact, as we now can support this legislation, we will allow the Government to get on with the business of setting in place all the procedures and processes necessary to allow general practitioners to be properly remunerated for all those things the legislation is putting in place: the importance of good quality continuing medical education and an acknowledgment of the importance of general practice. I had thought that I might have to come in here and speak more in sorrow than in anger. I then thought it might have to be more anger than sorrow. Finally, I see that we have been rescued by humour-the Opposition is just a laughing stock. We can happily support this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I take the opportunity afforded to me by this matters of public interest debate to bring to the attention of the chamber the situation that is faced by Bruny Island, one of Australia's smallest municipalities or shires. The situation of Bruny Island is typical of the situation being faced by small councils in Australia because of the Government's outdated and out-of-touch funding policy for local government. The population based guidelines for financial assistance grants are severely affecting small councils.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that the honourable member for Denison in Tasmania, Mr Duncan Kerr, made a belated attempt to blame the State Grants Commission for the lack of funds, which has been widely criticised by the Municipal Association of Tasmania and small councils around Australia. In reply the Chairman of the State Grants Commission, Mr Robert Mather, quite rightly made the point that the Commonwealth Government made no changes to the allocation recommendations made by the State Grants Commission. The allocations were based largely on population which, of course, favoured the cities and large population areas to the detriment of small councils. </PARA>
<PARA> For those people who are not familiar with Bruny Island, I can say that it is a very beautiful island in the south-east of Tasmania. It is separated by about a kilometre from the mainland of Tasmania by the D'Entrecasteaux Channel, an area which is regarded by many as one of the most picturesque waterways in Australia and which in the early days was world renowned for the harvesting of scallops. Unfortunately, due to overfishing it does not supply scallops these days but it is still a favourite spot for the countless number of pleasure cruises that ply the area. </PARA>
<PARA> The only access to Bruny Island is by way of a vehicular ferry, the Harry O'May, which was brought to Tasmania during the time of the Tasman Bridge disaster. It is now being used to ferry tourists and locals backwards and forwards between Kettering and Bruny Island. The return journey costs $10. I am pleased to say that an agreement has been reached to build a new vessel to service Bruny Island. The advent of that vessel will certainly increase the number of people who are able to visit the island. It is being built in Launceston by the Launceston Shipbuilders and is expected to be commissioned in the next two years. But the problems faced by Bruny Island are exacerbated by its low permanent population. It has only 400 residents. But during the summer months the population of Bruny Island swells to around about 6,000. This places a tremendous burden on the island's roads and services. Because the population is dispersed fairly evenly throughout the island, the road network on Bruny Island comes under severe wear and tear during the summer months. I think it would be fair to say that Bruny Island relies very heavily on tourist-based industries and they are the mainstays of those people who live there. </PARA>
<PARA> It has also become recognised as one of the major areas of the Tasmanian aquiculture industry. Intensive fish farming, trout, salmon, mussels, oysters and scallops are all being cultivated in waters around Bruny Island and they are sent directly to gourmet food markets around the world. In 1988-89 the municipality of Bruny received $69,079 by way of general purpose financial assistance grants, but for 1989-90 it will receive $68,407. To maintain its 1988-89 funds in real terms, Bruny should receive $74,398; so in real terms it has received a cut of some $5,991 or a percentage decrease of 8.05 per cent. And that is typical of the decreases that have been suffered over the last year or two by this outdated local government policy that this Government has put in place. It is sometimes very easy for us here in Canberra to fail to appreciate the difficulties that are being faced by those smaller councils in meeting their obligations. In this case it is clearly obvious that the Federal Government's cutbacks have seriously affected the ability of Bruny Council to operate. The cut of 8 per cent amongst the permanent population of around 400 is a significant decrease. </PARA>
<PARA> I am aware that the Council feels that in order to attract tourism, which it sees as being important to the future of the island's economy, it must provide the necessary infrastructure services. These cannot be provided unless the Federal Government is prepared to maintain realistic funding levels. For such a small population, Bruny Island has a limited ability to raise its own funds and as an island it suffers a very similar penalty to that faced by Tasmania itself. Every item transported to the island invokes a toll on the ferry and the small and intimate freight levels prevent growth of transport services and competition. Because of the difficulties in providing infrastructure to meet the island's growth tasks and services that would be routine elsewhere, everything becomes a major logistic exercise for the Municipality of Bruny. Bruny Island itself has 220 kilometres of roads, less than half of which are sealed, and there is a general concern among the island's residents that the increasing number of accidents on the roads is directly attributable to their poor condition. This is a typical case of what is happening all over Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as a previously mentioned cut in general purpose financial assistance grants, Bruny has also been hurt by the general decrease in the Federal Government's road funding. In 1988-89, the total amount that Bruny Island received from ABRD, and ACTP funding was something in the order of $54,100. This represents a mere $492 for each kilometre of unsealed road on the island or $246 for each kilometre of road as a total. Because of the limited road funds available to the Bruny Council it has been forced to carry out only a patch up program of up-grading and maintenance, whilst there is an urgent need to up-grade existing services to cater for an increased vehicular movement when the new ferry comes into operation in the next two years. It is expected that traffic volumes on the island will increase by 15 and 25 per cent when that happens. </PARA>
<PARA> For some time the Commonwealth has maintained the road on the island which provides access to the Cape Bruny lighthouse. The road runs for approximately 18 kilometres across Bruny Island. In recent times, though, it has been decided to declare the previously Commonwealth maintained road a public road and, accordingly, responsibility for the maintenance of the road will become that of the Council. I am very disappointed, Madam Acting Deputy President, that in these circumstances the Federal Government has not been prepared to transfer the road over to the Council in a satisfactory condition. This is certainly going to again place further pressure on the Council's limited resources. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, the problems of Bruny Island are not unique, but I believe that importantly they provide for the Senate a general overview of the real dilemma which small rural councils must deal with on a daily basis. I believe that not only for the sake of Bruny Island but also for the sake of other similarly affected councils the Federal Government has an obligation to urgently review its commitment to local government and to provide funding at a realistic real terms level which will allow for the satisfactory provision of infrastructure services where it is so clearly evident that councils do not possess the fund raising capacity themselves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 26 May last year, well over a year ago now, the Liberal, Labor and National parties combined in this chamber in a vote against the introduction of the citizens initiative process in Australia. At that time we were debating the Government's four referendum proposals and on behalf of the Australian Democrats I moved that the Constitutional Alteration (Electors' Initiative) Bill 1987 be voted on together with other proposals. Senator Puplick, for the Opposition, moved for the adjournment of the debate of my Bill at that time. The motion he moved acknowledged that the initiative process `is worthy of careful and detailed consideration by both the people and the Parliament', and that to `unreasonably pre-empt such consideration may jeopardise the right of the people to make an informed decision on the most appropriate mechanism for achieving the concept'. Ironically enough, the result of that particular motion, which incorporated those words, was in fact to kill off any further parliamentary or public debate on the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What has happened then in the last year with regard to this? I think it is interesting that there has been a dearth of initiatives on the part of any of those parties who voted for that particular motion. In fact, the only item that has actually occurred since that stage with regard to this matter in the parliamentary forum is my introduction in April this year of two private members' Bills, that is, the Constitution Alteration (Electors' Initiative) Bill 1989 and the Legislative Initiative Bill 1989, which were looking at 5 per cent and 2 1/2 per cent respectively to petition for a referendum on specific legislative proposals put forward by the people. </PARA>
<PARA> I am speaking in this matters of public interest debate today to illustrate my determination and that of my Party to continue to have this particular issue as part of the political agenda. At the moment we do not have coming from the Opposition or the Government any contribution to this debate. They have contributed to stalling the debate in this place, but not to the public debate outside on what may or may not be a sensible way of proceeding with this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile, there have been in the United States several important developments in the initiative process which I think warrant discussion and which again help to show that it is working successfully in that country. As honourable senators will be aware, the United States of America has enjoyed a long history of initiative and referenda. The first referendum, in fact, took place in Massachusetts in 1778 when the State legislature passed a Constitution and submitted it to the voters. South Dakota was the first State to establish an initiative process, in 1898. Unlike Switzerland, America does not have the initiative at the federal level. Nevertheless, more than 20 states in the United States now have citizens initiative law making rights guaranteed within their Constitutions. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988 Americans voted on a total of 230 such propositions. Most of these were put forward by state legislatures. However, 54 propositions were put on the ballot paper by voters' initiative. Most of these issues concerned the power of state and local governments to impose new taxes, increased rates of existing taxes or the incurring of debt by government bodies. Some of the other recent proposals included a measure mandating closure of two nuclear power stations in Massachusetts and a proposal for a 25 per cent tax on cigarettes to fund medical research and authorising a weed killing program in Alabama. Despite the high electoral workload for voters, recent surveys show a very high approval rating for the initiative process. Some 73 per cent of respondents in California found the process a good thing against a meagre 7 per cent who found it a bad thing. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, one of the major reasons for the continuing opposition of conservatives in the Government to my Bill has been their alleged fear that citizens initiative would somehow spark unrest and divide the nation on controversial issues. I think the recent experience in the United States clearly refutes this proposition. In fact, political scientists point to the ideologically neutral outcome of the initiative process in total. </PARA>
<PARA> The following data come from a survey conducted by Mr Austin Ranney, Chairman of the Department of Political Science at the University of California in Berkeley, on the 1988 election results. Of some 35 proposals that could be classified on a conservative liberal spectrum in the 1988 round the result split 18 to 17, narrowly in favour of the conservatives. These proposals were initiatives of the population and the items referred to voters by state legislatures. Twenty-four of these total proposals were direct from the people via the petitioning mechanism. Of these, there was an even break-down. Twelve proposals were voted on along conservative lines, 12 on liberal lines. Surely this is proof of the type which the conservatives in the Opposition were looking for when they adjourned the debate on my legislation last year. It certainly supports my argument at that time that the initiatives process does not favour any side in politics. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the types of questions which were put to the people. Fifty-two per cent of Arkansans voted in approval of a ban on the use of state funds for abortion-to use an issue that is alive in this Parliament at the moment. That is, they approved a ban on the use of state funds for abortion except to save the mother's life. At the same time, on the same day, 40 per cent of Colorado voters said the state should be prohibited from using public funds. In other words, 60 per cent were opposed to the item that 52 per cent of another state voted for. While 58 per cent of Maryland voters agreed to prohibit the manufacture and sale of certain hand guns, 64 per cent of Nebraskan voters supported an issue guaranteeing people's rights to keep arms. In Massachusetts an initiative to impose regulations to protect farm animals from inhumane treatment was rejected. In California an initiative to raise cigarette taxes by 25c a pack was supported. </PARA>
<PARA> These types of questions of public policy, I believe, should be part of the public debate. We in this country are of the belief that, unless the outcomes happen to correspond with what we believe is correct, the people should not have a say in the matter. In other words, I believe that the opposition to my proposal comes essentially from anti-democratic feeling within the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I have constantly challenged government and opposition spokespeople to appear in a public debate before an audience on such matters and to explain to the people precisely why politicians do not think that they should be trusted to make decisions on these matters. It would be a fascinating debate. No-one has bothered to take it up yet. Since I have been a member of this place-since 1981-I have been asking politicians to explain to people why they should not be trusted in making decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1988 exercise was not a fluke. In a 1986 exercise Ranney found similar results. Of 26 measures that could be placed on the conservative-liberal scorecard, the conservatives won 14 while the liberals won 12. Seventeen of the 26 measures were initiatives put forward by people's petitioning and they split nine to eight in favour of the conservatives against the liberals. It is quite clear, therefore, that the evidence over time points to the fact that the initiative process does not favour one side against another. Ranney, in summing up his research on this matter, concludes that the failure of either ideology to win clear and consistent victories is `probably the result of the fact that voters are less concerned whether a particular measure is liberal or conservative, rather whether it is right or wrong'. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely it is time for the Government and Opposition parties to come clean with the people on this issue and state where they stand, rather than hiding behind the types of motions that we have had to date. We have gone out of our way to try to show precisely how these matters can be implemented within our particular structure. We have put forward Bills which show very clearly the mechanisms that are necessary for the operation of such a system within our democratic structure. We have argued consistently that it would enhance parliamentary activity in Australia because it would provide an avenue for citizens to involve themselves in individual political debates. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have mentioned previously, and I think most senators in this place would have to agree, when one attends a meeting which can determine a subject it is a far more exciting and pointed meeting than one which can only discuss a matter because it has no power to determine it. Hence, when we in this place complain about voter apathy in this country we have got it the wrong way round. If people have no power why should they be interested? However, if people have power they will be interested and take a far greater interest in each matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sorry but I cannot guarantee that the outcome of the votes will happen to agree with what one would want. In a democratic institution, surely the best we can hope for is that citizens are informed on all matters concerned with a debate, there is a period in which that debate takes place and then a democratic vote is taken. That is what is being frustrated at this time. I believe that eventually such a process will be incorporated in our democratic structures in this country. We do need further development of democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I go back to an occurrence in my State of Queensland in 1899 when a considerable body of opinion sought to oppose Queensland going into the Commonwealth of Australia. It is interesting to note two planks of that. One is that our Federal Constitution did not guarantee universal suffrage-of course it does not-and, secondly, it did not guarantee citizens initiative, which it does not. I am a very strong believer that at some stage our Federal Constitution will have to incorporate both of those democratic ideals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring two matters concerning Aboriginal affairs to the attention of the Senate. Before I do so, I make the observation to the previous speaker, Senator Macklin, about the extraordinary support the League of Rights, an infamous organisation in Australia, gives to the proposition for citizens initiated referenda. If there are any merits for such a process within Australia I suggest it be tested at a local government level before it is imposed at either a State or Commonwealth level of citizen participation in the democratic processes of Australia. I would be interested some time to talk with Senator Macklin further on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to matters of Aboriginal affairs-my reason for rising here this afternoon. One matter involves extraordinary good news and the other matter, unfortunately, reflects very poorly on my own State of Western Australia. The good news first though, Mr Acting Deputy President: our good friends in Australian Associated Press brought this matter to my attention. It is the quite extraordinary story of the reunification of a mother who is reputed to be aged 104 with her son who is aged either 82 or 84. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite extraordinary when one considers the longevity of Aboriginal people: they are not noted, because of the deprivation that Aboriginal people have suffered in this country, for living to ripe old ages. But here we have a situation in which a woman has actually become a centenarian and her son is well on the way as well. It is also quite extraordinary because when the son was only two or three years of age he was actually taken from his mother, reportedly for his own good-a sorry reflection on the thinking of Australia as a whole and a reflection on the parliamentarians and politicians of this country in years gone by. But some stories do have a happy ending and I am glad to bring this one to the attention of the Senate. I was particularly interested in it because it is nice when one is giving some bad news also to have some good news to give at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA> The bad news and the reflection on my own State was brought back to my mind yesterday when I attended the launching of a book at the National Library here in Canberra by the noted Australian historian, Manning Clark. The book is called Noonkanbah. It is written by Steve Hawke with photographs by Michael Gallagher. It is a chronicle of events that occurred in Australia and, indeed, centred on Western Australia in 1979-1980. </PARA>
<PARA> Noonkanbah stands for, I think, everything that is bad and constitutes racist hatred in this country. It is only 10 years since the events happened. It shows that some progress has been made in Australia in the area of Aboriginal affairs since that time. I doubt whether a Noonkanbah could happen now. There are many notable names mentioned in the index to the book: two senators serving in this place get mentioned quite a number of times-Senator Chaney, who was then Commonwealth Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, and Senator Peter Cook, who at that time was secretary of the Western Australia Trades and Labour Council. I put on record the role that Senator Cook played in defending the democratic rights of the Aboriginal people from that area of the State and also in defending the democratic rights of all citizens-all nationals-of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The book chronicles an indictment of affairs in my State because, at that time, the State government actually led the crusade to invade a sacred site, a site held sacred to the local Aboriginal people of the Noonkanbah Station in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. The State Government under the then leadership of Charles Court actually owned the rig that drilled the hole in that sacred site near Pea Hill on Noonkanbah Station. The Government went to extraordinary lengths in organising a convoy. It assembled in Perth and travelled well over 2,000 miles from Perth to the north of the State to undertake the obligations the Government felt at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope many people read the book, reflect on it and point the finger at those people who brought this slur on not only Western Australian history and the history of Aboriginal people but also the history of Australia as a whole. I hope when they do read the book they will, in turn, take lessons from it. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be confident to say that a similar situation to that which occurred at Noonkanbah 10 years ago and nine years ago would not happen in Australia today. I doubt whether the Australian people would stand for it and I put on the record that many, many Australian people did oppose the actions of the then Western Australian State Government in doing what it was seeking to do. Many other names are mentioned in the book, some of whom have faded from the scene. I do not want to reflect on any but I am pleased to note that one particular name gets quite a deal of mention. That is Gil Barr, who at that time was the state secretary of the Australian Workers Union. Senator Cook would know, probably more than anybody else, just what a role Gil Barr had to play at that time. It is fair to say that the Western Australian branch of the union of which he was secretary-he later became the national secretary of the union-is noted as a conservative union. It would have been quite easy for Gil, as secretary of the union, to fold his arms and let events take place. But because he had the interests of human beings at heart he actually took action to assist. He did whatever he possibly could to inform his members of how they were being used up by the State Government, by Amax Exploration (Aust) Inc., the exploration company which was seeking to get the oil out of the area, and by CSR Ltd, another company involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Many other individuals are deserving of mention. I expect I will do so at a later time when I have had time to read the book. I have not at this stage read it; all I have done is look at the magnificent photographs taken by Michael Gallagher. Michael is a good friend of mine who was actually the photographer at my wedding just a few years ago. I must say that the photographs in the book do not bring back as many happy memories as the photographs Michael took of my wife and my wedding just a few years ago. It is a long time since I was united with my wife and I must say I am looking forward to the plane trip home to Perth tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA> Michael and the author, Steve Hawke, are still working with the Aboriginal people. I stress the word `with', although there are people around who say nasty things about advisers, and I dare say there have been problems with some white advisers who have gone into Aboriginal communities and sought to direct the activities of various Aboriginal communities throughout Australia. Steve Hawke cannot be mentioned as being one of those people who sought to direct Aborigines. I have been with Steve in communities in the Kimberleys and know that he does not initiate actions. He responds to requests from the community and he is still to this day working in the Kimberley region on behalf of and with Aboriginal people in that region. Michael is assisting in a similar, but slightly different, way as well. I think the launching of the book by Professor Manning Clark yesterday will be good for Australia in the long term. I do not think it matters which political party individuals belong to; all of us can learn lessons from those very sad events, events we would like to forget, because they do reflect on us. I think we all can learn lessons from this very sorrowful period of Western Australian history. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to draw to the attention of the Senate a number of matters. Firstly, I wish to draw attention to the press conference that was conducted a short while ago by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. It related to an agreement that has been reached between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory governments for excisions and the provision of land on associated and neighbouring pastoral properties in the Northern Territory. This very historic agreement has been negotiated between the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister after tortuous and very extensive consultations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that on 15 August I moved a motion in this place which drew attention to the problem in this area and the fact that legislation relating to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act had remained unproclaimed for quite some time, causing a stalemate in the negotiations. It is a pity that, after many years of seeking to get resolution in this area, particularly in the last two years, this whole matter had been stalled, very obviously by the interests of the land councils and Minister Hand, and it has taken the intervention of the Prime Minister to have the matter satisfactorily resolved. But I am pleased that that resolution was reached and was recorded today. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter that needs the attention of the Senate is the tabling yesterday of the Auditor-General's report relating to the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio, in particular the administration of the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account (ABTA). This report is very concerning. A whole range of issues have been raised by the Auditor-General for the second consecutive year, and he makes the point that there has been no attempt to adequately address the issues that have been raised. Again the Auditor-General brings up the points of royalty overpayments, the lack of an investment strategy, payments without delegated authority, deficiencies in the control of assets and the application of grant assessments, and a failure to review the grant program to ensure the objective of benefiting Aborigines in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account in effect acts as the vehicle for the transfer of funds from the royalty payments through to the Aboriginal communities and the land councils is most concerning. I have mentioned in a number of other debates and in the Estimates committees my concern that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, has in effect been fiddling with the books of the ABTA by transferring funds that should be going to community grants for administrative purposes to the land councils. That is seriously depleting the capital funds of the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account and could result in very serious difficulties in the future. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I withdraw the word `fiddling'. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has transferred very significant amounts of funds for the administrative purposes of the land councils in the Northern Territory, at the expense of grants that could otherwise be made for community purposes to the benefit of Aboriginal people. There has recently been a report by Mr Greg Crough with regard to the future of the ABTA. It now concerns me that the Minister has called for a review of that report and has engaged consultants, I believe involving funding of the order of $500 a day, to conduct the review, which will basically say that the same thing has happened-that the capital provisions of this fund are being depleted because of the very actions in this regard. This really worries me. I suggest that all senators have a good look at this report and come to the Estimates committees because I am sure there is a wealth of information that we will have to ascertain to ensure that these funds are being properly restored and used for the purposes for which they were intended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am also concerned that the accounting of the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account has not been satisfactory over the past few years. The fact that there are very marked differences between the cash accounting and accrual accounting systems and how they are operated and the fact that the ledger of the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account has been reconstructed will need to be very carefully considered this year in the Estimates discussions and debates. I think we will see a lot of information in that particular regard. I am, of course, concerned that Minister Hand seems to be constantly at the centre of controversial attention in this portfolio and constantly being called into question because it would appear that he is diverting attention away from the real needs of Aborigines. The sooner the Prime Minister wakes up to the option of replacing Mr Hand, the better off many Aboriginal people will be. </PARA>
<PARA> The other report that I would like to refer to is the Auditor-General's report into the Office of the Supervising Scientist (OSS) for the Alligator Rivers Region of the Northern Territory. The Auditor-General's report has highlighted a number of irregularities with regard to the professional and monitoring projects, particularly with administrative procedures to make sure that the assets, personnel and administrative procedures are all in order. What the Auditor has highlighted is the fact that there were instances when it was not possible to verify satisfactorily the submission consideration and, where applicable, approval of the research projects because of inadequacies in the formal documentation. He has also recommended that the OSS formalise the development and approval processes for internal research projects and issue guidelines and procedures for the use of staff. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the Auditor has been so critical with regard to these very important evaluative projects in the uranium region of the Northern Territory is a matter of great concern. Honourable senators will be well aware that the Opposition has put forward the policy that the Office of the Supervising Scientist ought more properly to be a function of the Northern Territory Government, where it should be very closely looked at through the Mines and Energy portfolio and the Education portfolio for the research aspects, and perhaps be attached to the Northern Territory University. I will certainly be drawing this Audit report to the attention of the Northern Territory Ministers, the Hon. Barry Coulter and the Hon. Tom Harris, in the respective Mines and Energy and Education portfolios, to ensure that they could have in place the correct procedures that would pick up the errors that are obviously being exposed where the Commonwealth administration is not satisfactory in this regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to continue speaking on the issue of banking. Honourable senators are aware of the fact that I have been pursuing this issue as a matter of public interest for almost a year and in doing so have tabled now approaching 50 affidavits from people who make very serious allegations about the nature of banking practices in this country. Over the period of that year, of course, the issue has developed quite dramatically as a matter of public interest. I think everybody is aware of the fact that there is a great deal of debate and concern in the community over many aspects of banking. Certainly, honourable senators and many members of the public are aware of the fact that my entry point into this debate focused on very serious allegations concerning malpractice and corrupt practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would just like to advise the Senate of actions on my part recently because I know that honourable senators are increasingly turning their attention to the issue as the public awareness and interest have escalated. I would also like to table further documents, and will shortly seek leave to do so, but I will explain what those documents are. It has been my practice to place on the table of the Senate affidavits which illustrate the types of allegations which are being brought to me. I have attempted to table a sampling of affidavits which range across the three broad areas of allegation, namely, asset stripping, the problem of foreign loans borrowings, which caught out approximately 1,400 small business people in this country and sent the majority of them into bankruptcy, and premature foreclosures on rural holdings. Today I seek leave of the Senate to table four further affidavits, namely, those relating to a Mr Blake, who is in disagreement with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia; to a Mr and Mrs Correy, who are in dispute with the National Australia Bank Ltd; to three members of the Carroll family, who are in dispute with the National Australia Bank; and to a Mr and Mrs Bayes, who are in dispute with the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. I seek leave of the Senate to table those as further examples of the serious allegations which are being placed before me. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A further document I seek to table is a letter from Mr Don Sanders, who is the Managing Director of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and who has been corresponding with me about some of these serious allegations. It might be recalled that in earlier debates Senator Stone tabled five letters from Mr Sanders to me. It was not my choice that they be placed before the Senate, but they were placed before the Senate and incorporated in Hansard. As a result of that incorporation, there were further reactions from those who were making the allegations. Mr Sanders has subsequently responded to those reactions and I have undertaken, with the permission of the Senate, to table his correspondence so that honourable senators are fully informed as to how he has further reacted. I seek leave of the Senate to table that letter from Mr Sanders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to advise the Senate of other actions that I have taken in relation to these matters in recent weeks. I think honourable senators are aware of the fact that possibly one of the most controversial aspects of this debate has related to a series of documents which were sought by the then Director of the 60 Minutes program under freedom of information and which were denied him. I previously have tabled in the Senate the correspondence between the 60 Minutes program and the Australian Federal Police wherein the Australian Federal Police admitted that they had assembled 140-odd pages of documents relating to 34 serious allegations of corrupt practices within the Commonwealth Bank but had refused to release those documents, with the exception of one page.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was about two years ago that those documents were sought under freedom of information. I would contend, and I have contended, that in that two years the public's attitude towards the issue has dramatically changed and that in the public interest, which is allowed for under the freedom of informa- tion legislation, it is perhaps now timely that those documents be released. I have in fact sought those documents under the Freedom of Information Act, with a view to reviewing them responsibly and, if necessary, allowing access to what portion of them would be appropriate to the Senate. I have received a standard reply letter from the officer responsible for the freedom of information branch of the Australian Federal Police in which I was requested to pay the necessary fees and to fund the necessary searches involved. That would be a considerable expense. Therefore, I have sought release from those fees, once again under that section of the Act which provides for release from the fees if a matter is in the public interest. So I advise the Senate that I am seeking access to those documents in the belief that they are relevant to the very serious allegations which I have been pursuing, I believe, in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing I have done is approach Sir Ninian Stephen as the newly appointed Chairman of the new forming Australian Bank Council. The Australian Bankers Association, in response to my actions in the Senate and in response to the public clamour concerning aspects of banking, undertook to form an Australian Bank Council which will be responsible for the appointment and administration of a bank ombudsman. I have written to Sir Ninian asking that I be permitted to appear before the Bank Council. It is my intention to place before the Council all the material which I have tabled in the Senate and seek its cooperation in pursuing the matters I have raised in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I will be watching, with a great deal of interest, as will the public, obviously, the effectiveness of the Bank Council and the subsequent appointment of an ombudsman. There has been some concern that banks could be looking at banks and some suggestion that that may not be the most effective and appropriate mechanism to explore these very serious allegations. However, I think that we should take it on its merit and allow the Council the opportunity of proving its credibility and effectiveness. I have sought, therefore, to appear before it; perhaps as the first one to appear before the Bank Council when it is formed. </PARA>
<PARA> So, by way of updating the Senate as to where this issue stands and my actions in relation to it, I advise it of four things: I will continue to table affidavits; I will seek to place those affidavits simultaneously before the newly formed Bank Council of Australia; I will be seeking access to what I consider to be critical documents under the Freedom of Information Act; and I have sought the cooperation of the Minister for Justice, Senator Michael Tate, in obtaining those documents. In earlier debate, he indicated an interest in the serious allegations which I have tabled before the Senate and I seek his cooperation in obtaining those documents in the public interest. Therefore, I will continue with the process that I initiated almost 12 months ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take the last few remaining minutes of this debate to speak about the mining industry and its importance to my State of Tasmania. Even though Tasmania is the smallest and least populous State in the Commonwealth, it is mineral resources rich and it makes a significant contribution to Australian mining exports. The industry has an annual production worth nearly $1,000m and produces more than 50 per cent of the State's export earnings. In addition, the mining industry employs more than 7,000 Tasmanians and, indirectly, employs 14,000 people in ancillary industries. For more than a century mining and mineral processing have been the mainstay of the Tasmanian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As early as 1642 the presence of mineral riches on the west coast was indicated by the swinging compass on Abel Tasman's ship, the Heemskirk. The first mine in Tasmania was a convict coalmine which was opened in 1834 on the Tasman Peninsula. Alluvial gold workings began on a small scale in the north in about 1851. However, it was not until 1871, when a huge tin deposit was discovered at Mount Bischoff, that the mining industry really started to boom. Some of the minerals mined in Tasmania today and in the past include sheelite, gold, tin, copper, zinc, coal, clay, silver, lead, silica and tungsten. Of the 19 major mines and mining fields that have operated in the State, nine are still operating today. </PARA>
<PARA> The mining industry today consists of three sectors: mining, mineral processing and exploration. The future of all three sectors is currently facing uncertainty due to the Labor-Greens alliance and the World Heritage boundary nominations that are being sought. Whilst the nominations proposed by Tasmania's Premier, Michael Field, earlier this week do not encroach upon the State's west coast mineral rich belt, should the Greens have the boundaries further extended, thanks to Senator Richardson, then the mining industry faces a very insecure future. The Director of the National Key Centre for Ore Deposit and Exploration Studies at the University of Tasmania has joined the Tasmanian Chamber of Mines in expressing concern about the push by the conservation movement for additional areas to be added to the World Heritage nomination. </PARA>
<PARA> The additional areas being pushed for nomination included parts of the resource rich Mount Read volcanic belt and adjacent Dundas Trough. The Mount Read volcanic belt and Dundas sequences form a unique mineralised geological terrain that has produced some of the major mines in the world. New deposits remain to be discovered, but only if this ground remains available for future research and exploration. Even without the nomination being pushed for by the Green Independents, the mining industry stands to lose mining resources in the Denison Range and the Lemonthyme areas with moderate to high mineral potential. </PARA>
<PARA> When the accord was signed between the Labor Party and the Green Independents in May this year, the mining industry expressed a hope that the alliance would maintain the climate necessary for the sustenance and growth of the State's major industry. The mining industry was referring then to $860m worth of mining investments on the drawing board for the period 1990 to 1996. These investments would be in addition to the $800m worth of projects in process or about to begin in 1989. Mr Deputy President, these are significant figures. </PARA>
<PARA> An economy as small as Tasmania's and so dependent on the mining industry cannot afford to have these potential investments curtailed. What is completely incongruous about this whole matter is that the mining industry occupies less than one per cent of the State's land area and that this amount is to be reduced even further, thus jeopardising the jobs of some 21,000 Tasmanians and 50 per cent of the State's export earnings, to increase the area of the State locked up for eternity from a staggering 20 per cent. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator McKiernan for his question. After having given very careful consideration to all the issues involved, I have made a decision on this case. Imam Hilaly has been in Australia as a temporary resident for a number of years. He recently applied for permanent residence under the employer-nominated scheme. The correct forms and fees have been lodged. Key issues in considering the application involve allegations against Imam Hilaly that, first, he was a divisive influence in the Lebanese community; second, he made a racist and inflammatory attack on Jews; and, third, he is an agent of or associated with the Libyan regime. I concluded that there was some evidence to support the first contention, overwhelming evidence to support the second contention, and insubstantial evidence to support the third contention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Factors or arguments to be considered in favour of the imam were his major involvement in social work in the community; his constructive role in the Salman Rushdie affair and in a recent fracas at Arncliffe Mosque; his determination-lately got, I admit-to learn English; a stated commitment to multiculturalism; and a willingness to enter into dialogue with divergent groups in Australian society. I was also cognisant of the fact that the imam's spouse and four children, two of whom are Australian citizens, have resided in Australia for a number of years.</PARA>
<PARA> When considering the imam's disgraceful attack on Jews, consideration was also given to his subsequent statement in which he retracted those remarks. That retraction was in a letter to the Prime Minister dated 23 June and I intend to have it published, to constitute a public apology on behalf of the imam. The attack on the Jewish people certainly disqualified, in my own mind, any application from the imam for permanent residency in this country at this time.</PARA>
<PARA> I have decided that further evidence is required regarding the Imam's commitment to play a positive role in promoting harmony between religious groups in this country. In order to test this commitment I have decided to offer the Imam a further 12 months temporary entry permit, at the end of which time any application for permanent residence will be measured against the role he plays over the next year. Applications for permanent residency by his spouse and two of his children will be considered separately and are expected to be finalised shortly.</PARA>
<PARA> While I have received a great deal of correspondence from individuals and groups both for and against the imam, the case has been determined solely on its merits and not as a result of any lobbying. This case and others like it-and I stress the words `others like it'-have highlighted the need to establish new guidelines for the issue of visas for religious leaders. Such guidelines will be issued before the end of this year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you: the Builders Labourers Federation-while it was being deregistered. There is another precedent from 1980, when the Fraser Government imposed Claytons sanctions on trade with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics following the Russian invasion of Afghanistan. I used the term `Claytons sanctions' quite advisedly because the Fraser Government took good care to see that it did not impose any quantitatively serious impediments on trade with the Soviet Union. In particular, it did nothing about wool. As we know, eventually Nareen wool was photographed being loaded on to a ship at Portland for dispatch to the Soviet Union. The Nareen wool may well have been protecting the Red Army from the Afghan chill ultimately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Fraser Government also decided that we would not export any more wheat to the Soviet Union in 1980 than we had exported in the previous year. It just so happened that in the previous year exports to the Soviet Union were the highest ever recorded-by a significant margin. The National Party, or the Country Party, or whatever it called itself in those days, would not have allowed anything to impede the wheat or wool trade with the Soviet Union-or any high volume trade at all. But some firms were disadvantaged. I do not remember the total amount of money but it was not a great deal, probably several million. Firms that were disadvantaged because of the Claytons sanctions were paid compensation by the Fraser Government. So there are precedents for governments paying compensation, but I repeat that no decision has been made by this Government in this instance to compensate anybody.</PARA>

I ask whether the Minister is saying that this Government will consider paying compensation, in money or some other form, to airline industries which are not standing down employees, but will not consider paying compensation to people in the tourist industry who have taken the same action.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The voting results most recently to hand this morning for the white House of the South African Parliament indicate that the Afrikaner National Party, under the leadership of De Klerk, has suffered electoral losses to the left and right wing parties, but will retain government in its own right. In any comment on the South African election it is crucially important to remember that it was a democratic election in name only. To determine a national government of a country with a franchise of only 15 per cent of the population is, on any view, to embark on a travesty of the democratic process. That travesty is no less when one takes into account the so-called coloured and Indian chambers, which lack any significant power and have an esteem to match, and for which the voting turnout, not unexpectedly in those circumstances, was extremely low.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The preliminary counting for the white chamber indicates that the National Party may have suffered a loss of some 32 seats, representing a swing of 15 per cent against it. That would leave it with about 90 of the 166 seats in the new Parliament-a fairly slim majority, but one which would, as I have said, be sufficient for it to retain government in its own right without the need to enter into a coalition with either the Conservative Party or the reformist Democratic Party. The right wing Conservative Party appears likely to win 38 to 40 seats, which is a gain of some 16, although representing an increase of only about 4 per cent in its vote. The Democratic Party is expected to obtain a total of 36 to 38 seats, a gain of about 20, representing an increase of fully 11 per cent in its vote.</PARA>
<PARA> The preliminary election results that I have described have been regarded by commentators in South Africa as indicating a thrust towards reform, since the Democratic Party is regarded in South Africa as the big winner. There is some point in that to the extent that it has gained an increase in its vote of some 11 per cent, with the Conservatives gaining only 4 per cent and failing to break out of the Conservative Party's farming heartland-having, it seems, won only one seat outside the Transvaal. We have all noted that Mr De Klerk, who seems assured of shortly being elected President by members of the ruling National Party, has met recently with leaders of the frontline states to discuss South Africa's future. I note also, as we all have, that he has made a number of comments in recent months which suggest at least some disposition towards reform.</PARA>
<PARA> The onus is now on the South African Government to act to bring blacks back into the mainstream of South Africa's political and economic life, and there must remain some real, considerable doubt as to whether the newly elected Government is genuinely committed to this. The reality, as we all have to appreciate, is that none of the white political parties in South Africa is yet prepared to grant full political democratic rights to blacks. The Conservatives, of course, want a return to full-blooded apartheid, but even a majority of the Democratic Party, together with the National Party, argue for that vague concept of group rights as an alternative to the concept of equal individual rights, which we would uphold and which are generally sought by non-white South Africans. I conclude by saying that there is a long way to go yet before we can talk of South Africa and democracy in the same breath.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this opportunity to put it on the public record that there is no intention to close the Tasmanian Women's Information Service.

<PARA> In order to answer this question I need to remind honourable senators that it was the Federal Government which established the Tasmanian Women's Information Service, because the State governments in two States had avoided their responsibilities and failed to provide women's policy units in Premiers' departments. Therefore, in 1984 in Queensland, and 1985 in Tasmania, the Federal Government set up the women's information services to fill the gap in those two States. However, it has always been the intention-and I am sure that many Tasmanian women appreciate this-that those services would eventually be provided by State Labor governments.</PARA>
<PARA> Now that there is a Labor-Independent Government in Tasmania, obviously the time has come to start talking about the future of the Tasmanian Women's Information Service. I have spoken with the Minister responsible, Ms Fran Bladel. She has assured me that the Tasmanian Government is looking forward to fulfilling its responsibilities to Tasmanian women and, as a first step, Premier Field has established a women's policy unit in his department. For the time being there is absolutely no intention to change the operation of the Women's Information Service. However, in the longer term there will be a smooth transition from Federal to State responsibility. I am confident that Tasmanian women will notice a difference. They will have not only the Women's Information Service but also the benefits of a Labor Government committed to a women's policy, a women's policy unit and an adviser in the Premier's Department. A whole range of strategies will be implemented. I can assure Senator Coates that there will be no sudden transfer and no diminution of service.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. What is the nature of South Africa's current international financial transactions of an official nature? In the Australian Government's view, what are the implications of those transactions for domestic policies in South Africa including apartheid?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1186" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;South Africa is in a parlous financial situation. Its reserves of foreign currency in gold are barely sufficient to cover five weeks imports and the country has virtually no access to international loans. As Finance Minister Du Plessis has said, South Africa has been operating abroad on a cash basis for the last four years. Four years ago South Africa defaulted on its repayments on overseas loans and it remains in default. When foreign banks responded in 1985 to the revulsion to apartheid shown by their customers and shareholders by ceasing new lending, the Reserve Bank of South Africa and the Government concluded that the country could not repay its debts. They unilaterally declared a moratorium on debt repayment and imposed a rescheduling arrangement on foreign bank loans totalling $US13 billion. When the current rescheduling agreement expires on 30 June next year, some $US12 billion will still be owing and overdue for repayment. At the same time, bond repayments of over $2 billion are also due. South Africa simply will not be able to meet these repayment obligations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The South African economy is being strangled by its lack of access to foreign capital, so-called financial sanctions, and the flight of domestic capital. Recent history shows that if the economy is allowed to grow at much more than 2 per cent a current account deficit results, but the country cannot fund a current account deficit. Indeed, it has to run a current account surplus if it is to make any progress in repaying its overdue debt. South Africa has a rapidly growing population and work force. It needs growth of 4 per cent or more to create the jobs to stop unemployment rising further from the current level of around 30 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> Foreign banks will not lend to South Africa to get it out of this hole because apartheid and political unrest associated with it make the country a poor credit risk and because dealing with South Africa puts at risk other business. So many of their customers react negatively as they do to apartheid. There is no prospect whatever of the international financial community resuming any normal relations with South Africa while the Republic refuses to go down the path of genuine reform. That financial pressure will get tighter and tighter. That is the subject and substance of the effort that Australia has been making to draw international attention to the phenomenon of financial sanctions. It is important that it be appreciated. The final point I make, without labouring the point any further, is that the only way out of that dilemma for South Africa is genuine political reform. The sooner the newly elected government appreciates that and goes down that path, the better it will be for everyone.</PARA>

If so, how many Australian troops were involved, what were they doing there and why were they there, given that Australia is supposed to be developing a strategy of self-reliance and Korea is hardly within Australia's sphere of strategic interest as outlined in the Dibb report and the White Paper on the Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities? I also ask whether Australian troops or observers have been involved in earlier Team Spirit exercises and, if so, when. Finally, I ask the Minister whether he is aware of remarks made by the commander of the 43,000 United States forces in South Korea last month that there will be no military need for an American troop presence in South Korea after the mid-1990s if current trends continue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australian involvement in Exercise Team Spirit in March of this year consisted of seven officers and was as follows: one major and three captains were attached to the command post of the exercise at the invitation of the US Army. Three captains, attached to US units based in Hawaii, participated in the exercise as part of their normal duties as exchange officers with the US Army. The attachment of the four Australian-based officers to the exercise headquarters provided an opportunity for them to observe the operation of a higher level headquarters involved in commanding and controlling a large scale exercise. This experience was directly relevant to Exercise Kangaroo 89 as the skills involved are the same for large scale exercises, whatever the scenario. The participation of the three exchange officers enables them to carry out duties of their exchange postings which are designed to enhance Australian Defence Force (ADF) training opportunities and knowledge. It also increases their inter-operability with the US forces.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that previous ADF involvement in the Exercise Team Spirit has comprised a participation by ADF officers on exchange with US units. The question of any withdrawal of US forces from South Korea is a matter entirely for the Governments of the United States and South Korea to determine. They will determine that issue, one assumes, in the light of their own judgments as to what is occurring on the peninsula. Obviously, the Australian Government would welcome any reduction in tension in the area and any development that would lead to that would be welcomed by us.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of claims that pharmacists will be unable to stock insulin because of the recent decision by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. I am disappointed that some people are seeking to create what can only be regarded as totally unnecessary concerns among diabetics on this issue. The claim is that pharmacists will not be able to stock insulin and other high cost drugs because the mark-up is to be abolished and because wholesalers apply a surcharge. The Department of Community Services and Health has discussed this issue with wholesalers and manufacturers. I can inform Senator Childs that the claims are spurious.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Wholesalers apply surcharges and discounts to the price of products from the manufacturer to encourage efficient ordering and payment practices. The National Distributors Association advises that on average it is providing more discounts in dollar terms than surcharges; that is, chemists are, in fact, gaining an advantage. In the case of insulin the price to the manufacturer of five ampoules of human insulin is $88.50. Wholesalers advise that they supply to chemists with a surcharge of $3.54 but with a discount of 7.5 per cent if payment is made within the normal settlement period of 25 to 30 days. A chemist who pays his or her bill on time gets the insulin at a discounted price of $85.14. Pharmacists using the automated claims transmission system get paid by the Health Insurance Commission within 15 days.</PARA>
<PARA> Peter Staples, the Minister responsible for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, has assured the Diabetics Foundation that the Government will not let supplies of insulin be disrupted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been a matter of very great satisfaction, I know, to the Prime Minister that during Question Time in the House of Representatives he has already been able to inform that House that a most significant agreement on the matter raised by Senator Collins has been signed by him on behalf of the Commonwealth Government and by Chief Minister Marshall Perron on behalf of the Northern Territory Government. In fact, it might suit the convenience of Senator Collins and honourable senators if I were to table the joint press release by the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, together with the memorandum of agreement between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory on the granting of community living areas in Northern Territory pastoral leases. I now do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The agreement is a complex and detailed one and I shall here only summarise its main provisions. They are as follows. The agreement constitutes a package of cooperative and coordinated actions by the two governments which, taken together, address the issue comprehensively. The Commonwealth will provide land for relevant groups of Aboriginal people on stock-routes and reserves under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. We will then proclaim amendments passed in 1987 which will mean that claims not scheduled will lapse. The Northern Territory, for its part, will legislate to provide living areas on pastoral leases under special freehold title which will provide a number of particular protections on matters of concern to Aboriginal people. These protections relate to such matters as protection against alienation of land, the question of compulsory acquisition, mining, and access to the land.</PARA>
<PARA> A detailed procedure has been agreed for processing of applications and this provides for referral, if necessary, to a special tribunal and the right of appeal to the Northern Territory Supreme Court. The land councils will be empowered, under Northern Territory legislation, to act for Aboriginals seeking excisions if the Aboriginals concerned so request this. The Commonwealth will provide the necessary approval under the land rights Act. Agreed criteria have been established for consideration of applications. Both governments are pledged to seek passage of relevant legislation as early as next month. A joint review group will be established to monitor progress and will report regularly to the Prime Minister, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Chief Minister.</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister sincerely commends the attitude of give and take shown by Mr Perron in the negotiations in a joint effort with the Commonwealth Government to arrive at a practical and acceptable package. That attitude was reciprocated on the Commonwealth side. Without this approach by both governments, agreement could never have been achieved on such a highly complex and contentious matter. The Prime Minister also pays tribute to the tenacity, determination and dedication of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, in the process which has culminated in this agreement. It will stand as an enduring achievement of truly historic importance.</PARA>
<PARA> In this agreement none of the parties with interests in the issue have achieved everything they would ideally have wanted. But what we have is a basis for moving ahead rapidly to meet the urgent practical requirement of land for those Australians who, for too long, have been the most disadvantaged in our community. We have the means at last of removing what has been, for far too long, a stain on Australia's international reputation and a source of social and economic injustice for Aboriginals in the Northern Territory. The Prime Minister and this chamber trust that this agreement and the legislation required under it will receive prompt and unqualified bipartisan support.</PARA>

The first charge was dropped on the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions, but that leaves the second charge extant. Further internal investigations are being undertaken into allegations which follow from the matters currently before the courts-and there are matters currently before the courts-and those investigations have not yet been completed.</PARA>
<PARA> I recall the question asked by Senator Chaney. Senator Robert Hill, who was then the shadow Minister for justice, took an interest in this matter also. I recall that during the Australian Police Ministers Council meeting in Adelaide in mid-May this year-it may have been a Friday-we had a working breakfast with Senator Hill and the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories seen reports that the New South Wales Minister for Environment, Mr Tim Moore, has claimed that the Federal Government has barred New South Wales authorities from conducting a full pollution study of Sydney's airport despite serious claims that airport fuel is fouling Botany Bay? Is it true that 27 fuel spills have leaked into Botany Bay? Is there any environmental threat to Botany Bay? Further, has the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) prevented State Pollution Control Commission (SPCC) officials from inspecting any facilities at Kingsford-Smith Airport?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1192" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="ARTS, SPORT, THE ENVIRONMENT, TOURISM AND TERRITORIES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly am aware of some criticisms that have been made by Mr Moore about the airport. I think this is the third occasion over the last month or so that he has accused the Commonwealth of perpetrating some environmental disasters. He got the previous two wrong and he got this one wrong as well. It is wrong in a number of ways. It is disappointing that the facts could be so distorted. First, it is claimed that the FAC has prevented officials of the State Pollution Control Commission from visiting the airport. In fact, the opposite is the case. The FAC has informed the State Pollution Control Commission that it can visit the airport any time it likes. All that is required is that it notify the FAC first. Obviously, vehicles and personnel cannot be roaming around the perimeters of a busy airport-I must admit that in the last few days it might not have been quite so busy-such as Kingsford-Smith, which is by far the busiest in the country, without some proper regard to safety and security. There is no impediment to the officials making those visits. All they have to do is let the FAC know first. The FAC has advised the Pollution Control Commission of this. I am at a loss to know why Mr Moore would continue with these claims.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At a meeting on 1 September the FAC sought cooperation with the Pollution Control Commission. The Commission was invited to send a representative on the next quarterly water sampling inspection, which will be held some time this month. A copy of the drainage proposals for Kingsford-Smith, prepared by Sinclair Knight and Partners Pty Ltd, was sent to the State Pollution Control Commission on 17 August. At the meeting on 1 September the SPCC requested the drainage plans of the airport and they were handed over a few days later, on 5 September. Every request from the State Pollution Control Commission so far made to the Federal Airports Corporation has been met.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator asked about the number of spills. I think he cited 27 spills. Spills are commonplace at Kingsford-Smith. They are usually caused by overfilling. My understanding is that there were something like 40 over the last 12 months. Most of these spills are in the 10- to 20-litre range. They are very small indeed. It is not true to think that those spills immediately waft into Botany Bay and cause a problem. In fact, again, the opposite applies. At Kingsford-Smith there is protection on both sides of the international and the domestic terminals. They are protected by oil traps. The traps ensure that the spills on the apron area do not pollute Botany Bay. They are regularly checked, as of course is the water in Botany Bay. Australian Construction Services currently clean these oil traps, these flame traps, on a 12 monthly basis. As well, they clean them as required, which means after each spill. Waste from these affected flame traps or receptor pits is collected by an authorised disposal contractor and is disposed of in an authorised area, as approved by the Trade Waste Authority.</PARA>
<PARA> When one goes right through this exercise one will realise that all of the claims Mr Moore has made are false. One has to wonder why he would make them and why he made that claim only last week about Garden Island when he wrongly accused the Department of Defence of a breach of State laws, whereas it turned out to be a subcontractor, and he wrongly accused the Commonwealth of attempting to claim Crown immunity for that subcontractor-all of which was wrong. This goes back to the difficulty that Mr Moore and his colleague Senator Puplick have in never having an environmental win. Rather than debate forests, rather than debate coastal destruction in New South Wales, they have to come up with a series of untruths like these. It is disappointing but we, of course, have to get used to it. The great thing is that everybody in the real world knows just how pathetic the Liberal Party is on the environment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did announce the formation of that independent authority. At present I am exploring with the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories just how we will go about permanently setting it up. It already exists in the sense that the unit which was attached to the Australian Sports Commission will now form the core of the new body. Its chief officer, Steve Haynes, will be going to Moscow for the conference to which the honourable senator has referred. We have to decide whether we will give this new body a legislative base.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The great complaint people in the sports community have about drug testing in sport is that often there is a suspicion or a suggestion that athletes involved may have been tipped off by sporting officials about the fact that they were going to be tested. We have to have a body that in some way can guarantee that that will not occur. At present my intention would be to give this new body a legislative base and have it report directly to the Minister, and the Minister would then report to Parliament. In that way, no sporting official, no doctor attached to a national sporting organisation, would have a role in the selection of athletes. It is only by that method that we can absolutely guarantee that our testing program will be carried out in a thorough manner and will be proper. I think that an announcement can be made very shortly on the names of the people who will be in the council that will oversee that drug agency. I think in a very short space of time that will have been done.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia has noted with a great deal of interest the major changes in Soviet foreign policy under President Gorbachev as articulated elsewhere in those two speeches, in particular the prior- ity attached to developing a greater role in the Asia-Pacific region. Our own response has been guided by a commitment to promoting a broader and more constructive bilateral relationship with the Soviet Union within the framework, of course, of our alliance commitments and consistent with maintaining stable and predictable relations in the region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We share the view that it is important and timely to develop a dialogue on security issues in this region and begin to examine systematically the scope for measures that would reduce the risk of conflict and allow undiminished security at lower levels of armaments. At the same time we consider some of the other ideas in Mr Gorbachev's strategic agenda in the Vladivostok and Krasnojarsk speeches to be impractical and others to be unduly biased in favour of Soviet interests-for example, the asymmetric proposal that the Soviet give up Cam Ranh Bay in return for the United States of America giving up its bases in the Philippines.</PARA>
<PARA> An important element of the Asia-Pacific policy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is to enlist the participation of regional countries in the economic development of the Soviet Far East. We have signalled our strong interest in participating in that process, given the importance of the Soviet Far East as a region with major development potential and one which would make a natural trading partner for Australia. It offers very considerable opportunities for trade, technology transfer and joint ventures in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA> In pursuance of that kind of perspective and in response to a Soviet invitation, my Department and Austrade are currently planning an Australian trade exhibition in Vladivostok in July next year. It is also proposed to organise information and cultural activities to promote a better understanding in the region of Australia and its people. Australian companies have been strongly supportive of that exhibition, with some 25 to 30 expected to participate. We believe that that will further demonstrate both Australian Government commitment to, and Australian business interest in, the development of bilateral, political and economic relations.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) My Department estimates that it spent approximately $140,000 on paper and paper products during 1988-89. This would represent in quantity approximately 19,000 reams. It does not include paper used by printers in producing publications commissioned by the Department.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) to (5) As I announced in my Statement on the Environment on 20 July 1989, the Ministers for Administrative Services and the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories have been investigating the possible use of recycled and unbleached paper in Commonwealth Government offices. A comprehensive review of the potential for using products made from recycled and unbleached paper has now been initiated. As announced by the two Ministers on 5 September 1989, the review will look at such issues as the qualities of recycled paper products, the costs involved, the positive and negative aspects of using recycled paper and what suitable uses can be identified. The review is being guided by a steering committee of senior officers from the Department of Administrative Services, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. The review is in addition to a pilot study operating in the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA> Also, Commonwealth and State Environment Ministers recently agreed to set up a working group to develop standards for recycled paper for government use and to examine further used for low grade recycled paper.

<PARA> I firstly acknowledge some of the information raised by the Honourable Senator in the introduction to his Question. The figures she quotes demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of the Home and Community Care Program introduced by this Government in 1985-86 in helping people with disabilities stay at home where they generally prefer to be.</PARA>
<PARA> Following budgetary decisions by the Victorian Government to reduce indexation of the program for 1989-90 to 12%, there is little scope for funding new services or expanding existing services in Victoria this year given current commitments.</PARA>
<PARA> The Extended Hours Home Care demonstration project run by the City of Hawthorn was running well over budget and the bridging funding it sought to 31 December 1989 represented a 100% increase over and above its previous funding level.</PARA>
<PARA> The project's bid was considered on the same basis as other projects in similar circumstances. Bridging funding of $45,050, representing extension of funding at the previously approved level plus 6% general cost indexation, was recommended for his joint approval to the Minister for Housing and Aged Care by the Victorian Minister for Community Services. The Minister for Housing and Aged Care gave his approval on 22 June 1989.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr President, I wish to make a personal explanation on the grounds of having been misrepresented. I refer to an article in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald written by Milton Cockburn headed `Stone adds confusion to air debate'. Mr Cockburn begins his article by saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Confusion within the Opposition ranks over its attitude towards the pilots' dispute continued yesterday when it spokesman on finance, Senator Stone, called on the airlines to negotiate directly with the pilots' federation. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> In doing so, he put himself in conflict with the former Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, who has consistently encouraged the settlement of the dispute by means of the airlines reaching individual contracts with their pilots, free of union interference. </PARA>
<PARA> In Parliament on Tuesday night, Mr Howard said: `We believe in allowing employers and employees to bargain at an enterprise level because we believe that those bargains are more likely to produce productivity outcomes.'</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Cockburn concludes his article with the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> To add further confusion, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Peacock, yesterday supported the idea of voluntary contracts between the airlines and pilots, bypassing the pilots' federation. </PARA>
<PARA>First of all, may I put on the record what I actually said in my address to the National Press Club yesterday on which this totally mischievous article by Mr Cockburn is based. I said:</PARA>
<PARA> Why, above all, has Mr Hawke seemingly not been prepared to countenance-indeed, why has he not encouraged-the airlines entering into negotiations with their ex-employees, including-</PARA>
<PARA>note the word `including'-</PARA>
<PARA>through the body (the Australian Federation of Air Pilots) which these people clearly and overwhelmingly still seem to wish to represent them?</PARA>
<PARA>That is what I actually said. Let me now go on to point out what Mr Peacock said in the House of Representatives yesterday when he is supposed to have been at odds with what I said. Mr Peacock said-and I quote two passages from his speaking notes:</PARA>
<PARA>Under our industrial relations system the pilots and the airlines would have faced two choices . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Leaving aside the first choice, the second one is:</PARA>
<PARA>or they . . . negotiated a voluntary agreement, either on an individual basis or through a union, which binding on both parties. </PARA>
<PARA>At a later point in his remarks, the Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, the Government, as the owner of Australian Airlines, should encourage the management of Australian Airlines to begin negotiations with the pilots, either individually or through their union. </PARA>
<PARA>I put it to the Senate that this article of Mr Cockburn's in the Sydney Morning Herald this morning simply seeks a mischievous end-it is attempting to create divisions where no divisions exist. I put it on the public record that, from the outset of this debate, our spokesman on these matters, Senator Chaney, and other Opposition spokesmen have consistently said that, in the end, this dispute will be settled only by getting the parties to it around the table. The question of how they get around the table-whether the employers meet with the employees individually or whether the employees wish to be represented, as surely it is their natural right to be if they so desire, by an association-is entirely irrelevant. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today the Senate has had two parliamentary delegations visit it-one from the Soviet Union and one from the United Kingdom. Those delegations come from very different countries and represent very different parliaments. A delegation from any part of the world that visited Australia at this time would be shocked to find what is supposed to be a modern country without an airline system. It would find that it had to come to a country which, in terms of its capacity to move people around, has Third World status. It is not just with respect to the airline service that this country has a Third World status. This afternoon the Opposition is debating the following matter of public importance:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failures and inconsistencies of the Government's industrial relations policy as demonstrated by the pilots dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason we are not debating the pilots dispute alone is that the pilots dispute is symptomatic of why this country is on the slide. </PARA>
<PARA> We should look at what this Government, its industrial relations system and the accord have delivered to the Australian people since Bob Hawke, the people's Prime Minister, was elected to power. This is what has happened to wages and salaries, to the income of Australians, under the famous accord: in the first year of the Hawke Government, incomes in real terms fell by 2 1/2 per cent. That was this Government's first gift to the nation in the year after the drought had broken and we got the salvation of Bob Hawke. The following year we appeared to have turned a corner. That year real incomes in Australia went up by 0.8 per cent but, in the following year, they went down again by minus 1.9 per cent. The following year they went down by minus 1.4 per cent; the following year by minus 0.4 per cent; and last year, at least, they went up by one per cent. We might have thought that, after all this sacrifice and all this effort under the accord, this brilliant Government and its brilliant industrial relations system, we had turned the corner. But look at what the Government's Budget tells us we are going to get this year. The people of Australia will get a 7 per cent income increase-that is the Government's figure-and inflation will be 7 1/2 per cent. So, once again, we continue down the track. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My caterwauling little opponent, Senator Button, who is not prepared to take part in this debate-he is prepared to sit in this chamber and shout-ignores the fact that the Government has delivered declining real wages to Australia. He keeps telling us that this is because of good economic management and because the Government is saving Australia. Look at what has been achieved at the same time: this country owed about $30 billion overseas and now it owes $110 billion. At the same time as our living standards have declined, this Government has put us into hock by another $80 billion. In other words, this country has Third World status under this Government and it is steadily getting worse. That is why the Opposition is contemptuous of the failure of the accord and the failure of this Government's industrial relations policy. The key reason why the people of Australia are feeling poorer, why their living standards are declining and, at the same time, why they are getting deeper into debt, is that there is no productivity increase in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we look at the official figures-not some figures brought out by the Liberal Party of Australia or by the National Party of Australia-published by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) we find that, while other countries have increased their productivity, ours is declining. The figure given by the OECD for total factor productivity for Australia over the three years 1987 to 1990 is minus 0.2 per cent. Each Australian is producing less instead of producing more and that is why we say the accord is a straitjacket. This country is going down the tube because it cannot lift its productivity under the regime which has been imposed by this Government. Look at the figures of the Australian Bureau of Statistics brought out in the Australian national accounts in just this year:</PARA>
<PARA>Labour productivity estimates continue to show very little change from 1984-85 base year, with the trend estimate of GDP per hour worked declining by 0.1 per cent for the March quarter 1989 and GDP per employed person declining by 0.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what is happening in Australia. We are going backwards, not forwards. Principally, that is because of the industrial relations system and the working of the blessed accord, which we are continually being told is such a marvellous addition to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In this morning's Australian Financial Review there is an excellent article about the impact of the Government's superannuation and savings policies. On the editorial page, one finds a description of what is happening to productivity. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Chamber of Manufactures predicts labour productivity will barely improve at all over the next two fiscal years. </PARA>
<PARA> By contrast, Japanese labour productivity has soared, climbing at 4.8 per cent a year in the decade up to 1985. It is still rising by more than 3 per cent a year. </PARA>
<PARA>The article finishes by saying this:</PARA>
<PARA> If Australia's labour productivity curve doesn't make an amazing change for the better, before long Australian industry will be back to where it was before the last devaluation: out of the race and stumbling. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian industry will be stumbling like the Minister at the table, Senator Button, who raises his hands in the air and says, `I don't know what to do'. That is Senator Button's contribution to getting Australia out of its present difficulties. </PARA>

This difficulty we have with our airlines is just one symptom of the malaise, one of the reasons why Australians have turned against the accord, and why an article in the Sydney Morning Herald this week is headlined `The Accord gets the thumbs down'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The unions themselves doubt the system. The trade union movement has not yet accepted the national wage case. Week after week the unions beaver away trying to work out whether they can get rises they believe are necessary under the national wage case. There is no commitment as yet from the trade union movement to the Industrial Relations Commission and its decision on the national wage case. </PARA>
<PARA> This whole dispute exemplifies the bureaucratic approach of the Government, the typically Australian gun-at-the-head approach which has been adopted by the airline pilots and which is totally rejected by the Opposition, but which flows from the bureaucratic straitjacket that the Australian work force finds itself in. We find a hindering of sensible negotiations by the Government and behaviour by the Prime Minister which is quite extraordinary-his abuse of the participants and his discouragement of effective negotiations; and, of course, his holding out the offer of Government money, taxpayers' money, to his mates in the airlines so that they can follow the Government's wishes in this matter and prolong the negotiating process. We have seen the Ministers, including Senator Button, squirming in the Senate during the course of this week. They know that it is unconscionable that only the airlines should be given compensation in a dispute which is smashing the tourism industry of Australia, large and small business alike; yet this bunch of bandits is prepared to say that the only people who will get consideration in this matter are the airlines and to hell with those Australians who are suffering from its failure of policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The ultimate irony coming from the Australian Labor Party, from the people who supposedly defend the centralised wage fixing system, is that when this dispute commenced and we said, `If you want the system to work, go back to what Mr Willis said in 1987: you cannot have an effective system without effective compliance provisions', once again the Government was not prepared to give the centralised system teeth. There is no consistency in the Government's approach. On the one hand, it will not give the centralised system the teeth which would give the Industrial Relations Commission some authority. The only authority it offers it is the bully-boy tactics of the trade union movement. It refused that, and yet it goes ahead now and adopts one element of our policy and says that it will embrace sanctions outside the centralised wage fixing system. This dispute is typical of what is wrong with Australia-gun-at-the-head industrial negotiation, huge damage being done to the Australian economy and the Government offering no reasonable way out. The Government's handling of this is completely wrong: abusive, prolonging the negotiation process and grossly inconsistent. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Minister and the next speaker of the inconsistencies of the Government: support for the centralised system, but no support for effective compliance provisions; years of rejection of the use of the common law; and years of rejection of the Trade Practices Act. How many times in this Senate have we had to vote to defend the provisions of the Trade Practices Act against the Labor Party's attempt to repeal it? How many times has the Labor Party come out and said that the worst thing for trying to settle an industrial dispute is the use of sanctions and penalties? In a debate in this chamber a few weeks ago, Senator Aulich, in one of the few things he has said in this chamber that have ever been quoted, reaffirmed Labor Party policy in that respect. What did the Government do a few days later? It turned around and embraced the whole proposal that there should be the use of sanctions in the common law and the Trade Practices Act. Of course, when we said that it would be a valuable addition to the industrial relations system of Australia that we move to a system of direct contracts, what did the Labor Party say? Year after year it rejected that as an approach to industrial relations; now it is embracing one other shred of our policy to try to find its way out of the dilemma in which it finds itself. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is patently clear. Our approach is to change the framework so that employers and employees are encouraged to work together. But our framework is not in place. The framework in place is the Government's legal framework which was legislated last year over our objections, with the Government rejecting all our amendments. This dispute is taking place under its legal framework, under the accord. None of that has been changed or can be changed by the Opposition, and the travail that Australia is going through at the moment with this airline dispute is a travail that is completely within the framework of the Government's administration and industrial relations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the airline pilots were still within the centralised system, what was our suggestion? We offered the Government the capacity to change the law to put some genuine compliance into the system; the Government refused. When they went outside the system, what was our response? We said yes, legal sanctions could be used. We supported that, as we always have at Mudginberri, at Dollar Sweets and all these great disputes. The Government suddenly changed its mind. We said weeks ago that what the Government should be doing is encouraging constructive discussions between the airlines and the pilots on the basis of gaining productivity increases which would enable the pilots to get a sizeable rise and the airlines to share in the benefits of that productivity increase. It has taken weeks for that move to get any support from the Government, and even then the Government has done nothing to encourage its own airline, Australian Airlines, to move to the forefront of this dispute. The Government is terrified that its own accord will be threatened and is terrified of a wages breakout. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat: the positive outcome for Australia and the positive option for this dispute is not a wages breakout but a productivity breakout. It is clear that there is a capacity for the pilots to greatly increase their productivity. It is clear that there is a capacity for some of that productivity gain to be shared with the pilots and still leave the airlines in a more competitive position. </PARA>
<PARA> There are lots of red herrings in this debate. What is the role of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots? We say that it is no business of the Government's what the role of the Federation is. It is no business of anybody except the airline pilots. We have said that there should be negotiations between the pilots and their employers. We say that that is the central fact and that whether the pilots choose to use agents or choose to have a union is for the pilots and not for the Government or politicians. That is a matter which the Government should leave alone. We think the pilots should be free to decide who, if anyone, represents them. The airlines, in their turn, should be free to deal with the pilots or the Federation, as they wish. We do not believe there should be a restriction on the freedom to enter into contracts. We believe that those restrictions are properly imposed by the competitive pressures that are going to be and must be applied to the airlines. The Opposition has made it clear that not only does it support the deregulation of the airlines but also it supports the consideration of continued interlining so that there will be continuous economic pressures and non-economic decisions can be made. </PARA>
<PARA> By agreement between the parties, the speaking time in this one-hour debate in which four people wish to participate will be restricted. Let me make clear what I see as the essentials of the Opposition's position. We do not support the pilots and their gun-at-the-head tactics. We do not support the Government's inflammation of this dispute. Most of all, we do not support the system which has led to both the conflict and the impasse. We reject the failures of the accord and the failures of the Government's whole approach to industrial relations. What we do support is negotiation on a win-win basis-the productivity breakout which will enable pilots to be better off and which will demonstrate to the whole of the Australian work force that there is a constructive alternative to Labor's declining living standards. We do support sanctions. If rules are broken inside or outside the system there should be proper sanctions and penalties. I hope that, in light of his Prime Minister's change of mind, Senator Aulich might recant his rejection of sanctions in the last debate in which he participated. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we support the full use of all available strike-breaking methods. We congratulate the Government for accepting that strike-breaking is legitimate, even by using the armed forces as they are being used in this case. We think the stifling of an essential service such as an airline service is properly met by the use of the full force of government to try to ease the pain of the Australian people. It is time we threw out the accord and the industrial relations approach of the Government and adopted the approach that is advocated by the Opposition. </PARA>

Nicholls Society have performed so badly in this debate that I thought it was appropriate to fly my H.R. Nicholls Society tie at half-mast. I think this is the fifth attempt that Senator Chaney has had to put on record the Opposition's position in this airline pilots dispute and the current action being taken by the Australian federation of air pirates. He has failed again to do so. He has called on Senator Aulich to recant his rejection of sanctions. A good place for Senator Chaney to start would be to call upon the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) to recant his rejection of sanctions because the Leader of the Opposition has specifically done so. We have to give Senator Chaney full marks for his cheek in raising this matter of public importance. He has certainly decided to be brazen in terms of the wording of this matter of public importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the subject of inconsistency, I would like to quote-and very little of this has been canvassed in the Parliament to date-what Senator Chaney's Leader, the Leader of the Opposition, has said on the question of the Opposition's industrial relations policy in respect of the actions currently being taken by the Australian federation of air pirates. Before doing so, I will read a couple of other quotes of what has been said by the Leader of the Opposition. On 23 August this year Mr Peacock said:</PARA>
<PARA>The pilots campaign is completely unjustified, a powerful trade union holding a loaded gun at the head of employers. </PARA>
<PARA>That is true; I agree with that. On 25 August he said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is a classic case where you've got to go beyond the employer-employee fight and look after the national interest and the Government is correct. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps Senator Chaney should refer to that. On 31 August-this is from the first of two separate interviews given on the same day-he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . now and the national interest demands that the Prime Minister work to get those parties together and the Opposition has been calling upon him to do just that . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In a second interview on the same day he said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is not a role in this dispute for the Government. In fact this is one of the requirements that Australia needs for governments to stay out of disputes.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Chaney has the hide to come in here and talk about consistency. The Leader of the Opposition gave a most extraordinary major press conference on where the Opposition stood on this airline pilots dispute and what its industrial relations policy was. If Senator Chaney is looking for consistency, he should not look there. At that press conference a journalist asked Mr Peacock the following final question:</PARA>
<PARA>In 3/4 of an hour you have not yet given us one specific answer on how the dispute . . . can be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Peacock replied:</PARA>
<PARA>I'll wait . . . we have spent the majority of the time interestingly enough and if I might say it is an interesting example of some of you at work of questioning me of what we would do if we were in government. That is fair enough and I think I'm reasonable in answering and I've indicated the way we would handle the matter in government. But the reality is we are not in government. Something you seem to overlook. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think anyone would overlook that. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>But when you say to me you've not given me a plausible answer as to how you would settle this dispute today. To settle that dispute today operating in the system that belongs to the Government I have said to you there should be a sanctions power there. </PARA>
<PARA>At the conclusion of the press conference he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I would have been operating in a system where there was a sanctions power to compel them to stop the dispute but this government has walked away from each and every element of that . . . That is succinct and to the point and very different to the Government. I really must go to the next meeting. Thank you. </PARA>
<PARA>I would have gone to the next meeting too if I had delivered a performance as bad as that. I refer to pages 10 and 11 of the transcript of that same press conference where, in respect of sanctions, Mr Peacock is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . you don't fix some artificial limit in negotiation between politician and representatives of the union movement, you leave this to the enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA>The transcript continues:</PARA>
<PARA> JOURNALIST: So you're saying that's the only sanction, the market forces are the only sanction?</PARA>
<PARA> PEACOCK: Well, it's a pretty real sanction. </PARA>
<PARA> JOURNALIST: But are you saying that you wouldn't impose any other sanction?</PARA>
<PARA> PEACOCK: No, I wouldn't be imposing sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA>I give people the right to go before the Commission or a court and argue this is right, this is wrong, if they can establish their locus standi. But, the reality is, the real constraint on them is the economy itself and . . . the market. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All right, let Mr Peacock clarify this misrepresentation. In order to put this confusion to bed, let me quote Mr Peacock again. In terms of the Opposition's policy, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Well, the Act spells out a whole variety of interested persons and well, any other registered organisation could state a case, it may well not be accepted. But the reality is the legislation gives you the power to enter into these voluntary arrangements provided the wage increases are offset by increases in productivity. Now what will, in fact, happen, I mean, the real determinant is not whether someone will state a case and seek to argue that they have some right under the legislation. You know what'll happen, the company will go broke. That company will go broke if it enters into some wage arrangement that is not offset by productivity and that's its decision. I mean, if it wants to commit economic suicide, I mean, the real constraint is not some party seeking to go before the Commission, albeit that others could, albeit that others could. I mean, you can always seek to, some form of locus standi. Whether the Commission or a court will give it to you, whether you designate people to have that right, at the end of the day, the real constraint on the company that enters into some arrangement is not offset by productivity is that it walks over the cliff. </PARA>
<PARA>That clarifies entirely the position of the Opposition on this question. Senator Alston has an absolute hide to suggest that anyone could possibly misrepresent this collection of absolute gibberish which purports to be, courtesy of his Leader, the position of the Opposition on its industrial relations policy and how it would solve the airline pilots dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same press conference his Leader says first of all that he will have sanctions and then he says that he will not have them. Then we get a statement from the Leader of the Opposition about whether he is going to have some sort of central system. He then goes on to say that he will have a system but even if people opt out of the system the sanctions will follow them. He absolutely confirms that to the disbelief of the journalists present. He says that the sanctions will still operate even when people opt out of the system. He says further in the same press conference-and time prevents me from quoting more of it, unfortunately-that, in fact, the sanctions will not follow people if they opt out of the system. He was completely unable to give anyone a sensible answer as to what determined whether people opted in or out of the system. The fact is that the Opposition has performed absolutely abysmally in its contribution to what is potentially one of the most serious industrial disputes that this nation has seen. Almost every member on the Opposition front bench adopts a different position when speaking on the subject. They have absolutely confused this issue with respect to their policies to the extent that their Leader in a single press conference contradicted himself about 50 times on the major elements that underlie this dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps I was a bit hard on the Leader of the Opposition the other day when I accused him of not being able to follow a consistent position publicly, because he really does have his work cut out for him in having the job at the end of the day of coordinating and explaining away all the contradictory statements on any policy, including this one, that are issued by the various members of his front bench. I think it was very apt to quote Bonar Law the other day. I said then that he had the same trouble with his colleagues when he uttered these immortal words in 1912, `Of course, I must follow them; I am their leader'. In that sense, Mr Peacock certainly has problems. Mr Peacock does not need the collection he has on the front bench to contradict each other to cause himself a problem: he does a pretty good job by himself. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that in respect of the current dispute the Government always wanted the Australian Federation of Air Pilots to negotiate for its increase within the centralised wage fixing system. The reality is that the Federation could have done that in precisely the same way Senator Chaney put forward when he concluded his speech. The pilots would have had the opportunity within that system to negotiate for productivity increases. The fact is that they chose not to do that. They chose to behave like the industrial thugs they have always behaved like since 1959. As I said before, the then President of their Federation, when introducing the Minister for Civil Aviation to the Federation's conference in 1966, said, `This Federation is unique; we can do anything we like'. That has consistently been the attitude of the Federation. We should not forget-as people seem to be forgetting-the major agenda item. It is not simply the 30 per cent wage increase. It is, as it has always been, to get out of the system-not just the government system; any system, including the Opposition's system. The Opposition, of course, chooses to ignore that. </PARA>
<PARA> The airline pilots have always considered themselves to be a law unto themselves, a special elite group that can hold this country to ransom. As I pointed out the other day, the difficulty is that the major difference between the airline pilots disputes of the 1950s, the 1960s and now is that the aviation industry in this country has reached such a point of pre-eminence-in the exercise of commerce, our balance of trade and our export earnings, with tourism now being our major export earner-that the realities of the aviation industry in terms of 1,600 people being able to hold this country to ransom can no longer be ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> As a senator for the Northern Territory, I say again that perhaps it is time that this Government, or any future government, had a very close look at its future relationship with that small group of people who have a technological stranglehold on their industry and a capacity to bring this country very quickly to its knees. It is no good ignoring the fact that they have a capacity that is not possessed by any other group of workers of their size. They have the capacity to cause major economic damage to Australia because of their bloody-minded pursuit of absolutely intolerable wage claims. There is nothing new about that. They have always behaved in that way. Therefore, what is different about the current dispute? It is not the inconsistencies of the Government's position that have caused the problem. The problem for the Australian Federation of Air Pilots is that this Government has been far too consistent for it, as have the airlines. The standover and blackmail tactics that the Federation has always used in the past have not worked to this point. The Government will not cave in to the totally outrageous demands of this small group of blackmailers- and that is what they are-in the way the Opposition wants the Government to do. I am glad to say that to this point in time neither have the airlines. As I said before, the history of this union is the reason that its members behave like bloody-minded bastards. There are two good reasons for that. The first is that they have always behaved like that and the second is that they have always won. </PARA>

Despite the fact that it has already said that, it could go back to that system and negotiate a further increase based on productivity. That is precisely what the Government urges it to do and it is precisely what I am urging it to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are speaking today on a matter of public importance put forward by Senator Chaney, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failures and inconsistencies of the Government's industrial relations policy as demonstrated by the pilots' dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>I begin by noting the apparent readiness expressed by Senator Collins, who has just ceased speaking, to shed every last drop of the Australian tourism industry's blood in the interests of maintaining the dogmatic position taken up by his Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and by the Government in this matter. The position just stated by Senator Collins is that it does not matter how long this dispute goes on, the Government will stick to the same position that it began with, namely that the Australian Federation of Air Pilots is to be crushed. Senator Collins also said or implied that it does not matter if the tourist industry bleeds to death in the process. </PARA>
<PARA> I will consider first the failures of the Government's industrial relations policy as demonstrated by the pilots dispute. There is no doubt about the failures. Even before the pilots dispute, we had the air traffic controllers in Sydney holding the country to ransom as a result of the total incapacity under the rigid guidelines of the accord to do anything different. Now we understand-because of press reports published in the last few days-that a shonky deal is being cooked up between the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) and the air traffic controllers in Sydney, whereby they will get an increase in their emoluments which goes well beyond what one had understood to be the guidelines laid down in the recent Industrial Relations Commission judgment. I make no comment about that other than point out the total failure of the accord, as demonstrated in that instance. </PARA>
<PARA> At about the same time a disgraceful situation was developing with Qantas Airways Ltd aircraft maintenance engineers. I remind the Senate that for some years Qantas maintenance engineers, who are extremely well- qualified technical people, had serviced foreign aircraft in this country. But under the rigid guidelines of the accord-within this procrustean bed into which the accord has chained the wages system of this country-Qantas was unable to pay its aircraft maintenance engineers the wages that were required to be paid to keep them in the jobs. What is the result of that? It is twofold. First of all, Qantas is no longer able to service foreign aircraft in this country because it no longer has enough aircraft maintenance engineers to do so. Secondly, Qantas aircraft themselves are now being serviced overseas in Hong Kong and Singapore. As a matter of fact, in both places they are being serviced in some cases by the very same people who previously serviced them here because they are now working in Hong Kong and Singapore. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Another victory for the accord, as Senator Chaney quite rightly says. In the last few days baggage handlers in Sydney-I think they belong to the Transport Workers Union-went out to demonstrate that under this accord they are not satisfied either. They will make a little trouble in due course and they will give the accord a bit of a flick across the wrist in the process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look now at the pilots themselves. About 10 days ago the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Peter Morris, said that if the pilots would only be reasonable they too could get more than they could under the accord. They too could get 12 per cent, he said, compared with the 6 per cent they are supposed to get under the accord. Mr Morris was inviting these people to do a shonky deal-in his terms, that is the only way one could describe it because, after all, he is supposed to be supporting the accord-and to get twice the amount laid down under this arrangement. The pilots did not accept that position, and I do not blame them. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go on to the more general point about the Government's failures. The failures of this Government's industrial relations policy constitute one of the two major reasons why Mr Hawke has flung himself into this dispute so violently and in such an inflammatory manner from the very outset. The other major reason-but I do not propose to take time on it-is to support his friend Sir Peter Abeles and Ansett Airlines of Australia, but we will pass that by. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hawke has flung himself into this dispute in a frantic attempt to prop up his failed accord and to prop up the personal standing and position of Mr Bill Kelty, the Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, who used to be known as the sorcerer's apprentice. I think today Mr Hawke is Mr Kelty's apprentice and that role reversal is evident for all to see. We all know who is running the country: it is Mr Kelty. If ever there was an apprentice, it is our present Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Have a look at what Mr Padraic McGuinness said in a sparkling article in this morning's Australian newspaper. In writing about the extraordinary conduct of the Prime Minister in this matter, Mr McGuinness said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in the last couple of weeks the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, has done himself immense political harm, and may well be mortally wounded. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr McGuinness went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . never has the Prime Minister looked so bad. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that Bob Hawke has handled this crisis appallingly badly. </PARA>
<PARA> From his initial abuse of the pilots, to the aggressive and increasingly irrational way in which he has defended government policy, to the total abandonment of any semblance of principle with respect to the rights of associations of employees, he has shown himself to be totally rattled and out of control of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> He has made it quite clear that when it comes to a crunch he does not believe that any limits should be placed on the disciplinary measures that can be taken against unions. </PARA>
<PARA> There is disturbing evidence in all this that Mr Hawke is out of control. </PARA>
<PARA> His abusiveness and hysteria have made any careful consideration of the issues impossible. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr McGuinness concluded this aspect of his remarks by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>It seems impossible that Mr Hawke can emerge from the pilots' dispute with his reputation for responsibility and reasonably sensible behaviour in his job untarnished. </PARA>
<PARA>Amen to that! Let us come to the second part of the matter of public importance raised by Senator Chaney-the question of the inconsistencies within the Government's present policies. If the failures are obvious, that is nothing compared to the obviousness of the inconsistencies demonstrated in the pilots dispute. Let us look at just a few of these inconsistencies; I probably will not have time to talk about all of them. </PARA>
<PARA> First of all, we have a Prime Minister who only three years ago described the H. R. Nicholls Society as being made up of, I think he said, economic troglodytes and political illiterates. I am going to ask Senator Collins to send the Prime Minister the H. R. Nicholls Society tie that he has been good enough to wear here today so that the Prime Minister can put it on. I am very glad to see that the Prime Minister has taken on a great many of the Society's policies. We will hold him to them in due course when we are in office. When disputes of this or other kinds take place when we are in government we will hold Mr Hawke and the Australian Labor Party to the policies that he is now so busily espousing. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the first little bit of inconsistency on Mr Hawke's part. However, I am bound to say that I welcome that aspect. But what is Mr Hawke doing now? He is supporting use of the common law in industrial disputes. I welcome that. But do honourable senators remember what Mr Hawke said about the use of the common law when it was being invoked in, for example, the Dollar Sweets case? He regarded it as outrageous. Indeed, this Government, when it brought forward its Industrial Relations Bill only nine months or so ago, actually wanted to outlaw the use of the common law in industrial relations disputes. Now the Government is busy encouraging its use. What an extraordinary flip-flop in policy on the part of your Prime Minister. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator STONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, not my Prime Minister. I will take a lot, but I will not take that. The Prime Minister also supports the use of sections 45d and 45e of the Trade Practices Act. Do honourable senators remember what he said about that when those sections were being so successfully invoked in the famous Mudginberri case? They remember what he said about that. The Prime Minister has moved with lightning speed to have the Industrial Relations Commission cancel the air pilots award. Compare that with the snail's pace of his action in relation to the Builders Labourers Federation. Indeed, compare the snail's pace of the action-indeed, there was no action at all-to clean up the restrictive practices, overmanning and general featherbedding on our waterfront.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another inconsistency, on past performance, is the Prime Minister inviting international airlines to carry domestic passengers between Australian capital cities. I welcome that very much. At least a few passengers are being carried around the country. But this is totally inconsistent with anything the Government has said previously-with what Senator Evans used to say when he was Minister for Transport and Communications, for example. The Prime Minister has enthusiastically applauded the bringing in of charter aircraft from abroad and foreign pilots to break the dispute. Let me make it quite clear that I do not object to any of those measures; I am just talking about the inconsistencies of this Government's policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Compare these attitudes with the Government's attitude to our coastal shipping or trans-Tasman shipping shambles. When are we going to hear the Prime Minister talk about the need to bring in foreign ships to operate along our coastlines or across the Tasman? When will the Government propose bringing in foreign crews to crew Australian ships on the Australian coast? That situation is exactly comparable with that in the airlines today. We would welcome that just as much as we welcome what has been done in respect of the airlines. Hurry on the day! Let us be quite clear about the inconsistencies which the actions of the Prime Minister-to the dismay of his colleagues and his own party room-are bringing about. We have seen the Prime Minister bring in the troops-the Royal Australian Air Force-to break the strike. Now that is okay too. When the Prime Minister, as we look forward to him doing, actually does something about the waterfront and provokes a strike on the wharves, I trust he will bring in the troops to deal with the Waterside Workers Federation in just the same way. </PARA>
<PARA> This is to say nothing about the total confusion and inconsistencies which have arisen over the matter of so-called compensation-or, as I see the Prime Minister prefers to call it, recompense. The Macquarie Dictionary defines compensation as meaning recompense, and recompense as meaning compensation, but the Prime Minister appears to find them totally different. He says we must not talk about them being the same thing; it is quite wrong to do that. Madam Acting Deputy President, you would be defying the Prime Minister if you said that. You would not do a thing like that. It is hard to follow the Prime Minister's logic in this matter, so I will be very careful to get it straight. The fact of the matter is that the Prime Minister has been trying to draw what Michelle Grattan in this morning's Age called a `nonsense distinction'-she could have used a harsher word, but she is a gentle woman and I understand her restraint in this matter-between giving recompense to the airlines for not standing people down, because Bill Kelty says they cannot, and not giving recompense to the tourist industry, where many people have actually been stood down. Those people, and many others who might be stood down but have not been yet, will not be recompensed. I find it a little difficult to follow that, but I have no doubt that at some stage the Prime Minister will explain it to his party room. I hope his party room will find it more intelligible than I do. </PARA>
<PARA> I have one final question. I have noticed throughout this dispute that Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd (TNT) shares on the market have not fallen. Why is that? Why do our share markets not assume that TNT will make a large loss out of this matter-Ansett Airlines of Australia being a subsidiary of TNT-and that the value of TNT shares will depreciate? Why have our financial markets not assumed that? What do they know that we do not? What has Ansett Airlines told the markets that we have not been told publicly?</PARA>

I cannot believe it. He should wait until I have finished my speech, from which he will be able to learn something.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate is once again debating a motion by Senator Chaney criticising the Government for its handling of industrial relations in this country and, in this particular case, the airline pilots dispute. This has not been a good fortnight for Senator Chaney. He has had more kicks from this side of the House over this issue than Peter Hudson on a good day. In the last week in his own party room he has been given the boot on a number of occasions by people such as Senator Knowles and others, who have accused him of being muddled and confused in his thinking about industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> We feel sympathetic. We know that Senator Chaney has a problem in this area in that he has to keep rolling up the same old policy that was proved to be a failure even before the Opposition parties managed to make it to government. In addition, he has had the problem on his hands of spokespersons on behalf of his party, from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) to the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Blunt), making statements which have been totally contradictory on this issue. I know it is difficult because, on the one hand, the Opposition has a policy which is inadequate to deal with this issue and, on the other hand, its members are trying to interpret it in various ways. </PARA>
<PARA> The contradictory statements have come, first, from Senator Chaney's Leader, Mr Peacock; secondly, from his trusted former Leader, John Howard; and thirdly, from his very close friend and admirer, Senator Stone. Senator Chaney has been in the middle of contradictory statements made by people who probably cannot hold a candle to him in terms of competency. At the same time, Senator Chaney has proved, on any number of occasions in this chamber, that his theoretical views on industrial relations are not bad. But when it comes down to practicalities-to trying to work out what to do in the middle of a massive industrial dispute which is destroying this nation's economy, which is destroying its tourist industry, which is leaving ordinary travellers stranded around the country, and which will leave 21,000 people unemployed if something is not done soon-Senator Chaney is not in the picture. </PARA>
<PARA> To a large extent it is because his Party is moving towards solving industrial relations problems in this country through an almost total reliance upon the notion of collective bargaining-free enterprise bargaining, letting the marketplace decide and allowing employers and employees to sort things out between themselves. Unfortunately, what has happened is that the airline industry and the pilots have done just that, and we have seen the results. We have a policy put forward by the Liberal Party which says, `Go and sort it out yourselves. We would like to see voluntary agreements made in the marketplace between employers and employees'. But when they do it Senator Chaney panics, because he knows, like everyone else, that collective bargaining does not work. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has told Senator Chaney in this chamber on any number of occasions, the employers in the community have told him, the unions have told him and people within his own party such as Ian Macphee, who was a very good Minister for Industrial Relations, have told him that collective bargaining will not work. Yet what has happened? He has looked at the overseas examples. He has seen just how collective bargaining has failed in the United States of America and the United Kingdom-seven-month strikes in the coal industry, transport industry problems and airline employees taken away in chains in the United States. That has been the product of people moving outside a system such as we have in this country; a controlled, centralised wage fixing system which has served this country well for the last 90 years or so. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet what does Senator Chaney do? He wants to borrow a fantastic idea straight from the American and British systems and try to apply it to Australian conditions. The airline pilots are applying it for Senator Chaney, and they are showing how badly off his policy is in dealing with the practicalities of solving industrial disputes in this country. We have told him once, and we have told him before, and the whole of the industrial relations community has given him that message, yet he still has not learned. He must be punch drunk. He would be out on a technical knockout if he were in the boxing ring. He would be taken away. He will not learn. He comes in here for the fifth time in two weeks proposing collective bargaining as a solution for Australia's industrial relations problems. What a farce. Yet he has Senator Stone, Andrew Peacock, Ian Macphee and John Howard all contradicting him. What is this man to do to make the industrial relations policy of the Opposition credible? He cannot. That is why he may be moving to the House of Representatives some time after the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> I will quote some examples to show where those in the leadership of the Liberal Party are totally at odds with each other. The people of Australia have a right to know where the Liberal Party stands on industrial relations, where it stands on this issue. Let me quote what Andrew Peacock said on the AM program on 25 August 1989. I cannot put on his voice; nobody can. That takes years of practising before a mirror, but--</PARA>

<PARA>It's a classic case where you've got to go beyond the employer-employee fight and look after the national interest. And the Government is correct. </PARA>
<PARA>On the 7.30 Report on 22 August 1989 Senator Chaney totally contradicted his Leader when he said:</PARA>

<PARA>Ian Macphee, the former industrial relations Minister, in a major speech to the Victorian employers on 29 August, said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is hard to see room for collective bargaining in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I have given three examples of leaders of the Opposition, in some forum or another, contradicting themselves over this major issue. Where does the Government stand on this issue? Let us make it quite clear: we do not believe that industrial relations will be solved totally in the courts. We accept that common law action in the courts--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JE4">Senator AULICH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listen carefully, Senator Chaney, because you are a slow learner. I will repeat it: first, we do not believe that access to the courts, constant running to the courts to solve industrial disputes, should be the rule of the day in industrial relations. In exceptional cases, recourse to the courts may be necessary. But an industrial relations system cannot be run on that basis. Secondly, industrial relations is not just about what goes on in the Industrial Relations Commission with the lawyers and the official representatives. It is about relationships created in the community between employers, employees, organisations representing them, and the government of the day. That special relationship has basically been the accord, which symbolises that special relationship that has grown over the last eight years or so. It has been improved upon and it has been made flexible to deal with changes in the economic situation to try to improve Australia's competitiveness in the world situation after 20 years or so of hiding behind the walls of tariff barriers and so on that Australia has built around itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What must be acknowledged in this House and has been acknowledged out in the community at large is that the trade union movement has lifted its game tremendously. It has worked with the Government and with employers. In a sense, the accord has paid the unions back for the responsible approach that they have taken. No-one elsewhere in the world, with a few exceptions of people so used to the collective bargaining principles of their countries, who has studied the improvement of industrial relations in this country could criticise the operations of the accord. The only people who so criticise it are people such as Senator Alston on the other side, who was employed by employers in the bad old days when they lost time after time, when they gave in to the toughest unions, the most strategically placed unions, the standover unions. It was people such as Senator Alston who in the end went to water and who gave us the Builders Labourers Federation (BLF), the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP) and those standover merchants who have used their political and industrial muscle to strangle this country. </PARA>
<PARA> It was this Government-not those opposite-that deregistered the BLF, a union, because it was not operating properly within the system. It is this Government that has taken on the Air Pilots Federation-the air pirates, as my colleague Senator Collins has called them. This Government has said, `Enough is enough. You are a strong union. You are a union strategically placed to bring this country to its knees but you are not going to bring this country to its knees. You will be stood up to for the first time in 20 or 30 years'. And this Government did it. It was long overdue and we do not apologise for the tactics that this Government has used or that the employers in this airline industry have used to bring that union into line. We did it-a government that those opposite accuse of being soft on the union movement. We have said, `We will run a centralised, orderly industrial relations system'. And we have insisted that it be run in an orderly way. Those that step outside it, in the way that the Federation pilots have done, supported by the Liberal Party of Australia, will get their comeuppance not only in the marketplace but also in other places. </PARA>
<PARA> They have gone out into the marketplace to improve conditions and wages that are already some of the best in the world. In fact, they were described by one of the pilots' key officers as `the' best in the world. They have gone out into the marketplace-and boy, have they gone into the marketplace! They have kicked the barrows over, kicked the owners of the barrows out, driven the customers away, knocked the vegetables around the marketplace; they have destroyed the marketplace not only for us and the tourist industry but also for themselves. This Government has said, `Enough is enough'. We have had the courage to take them on. We do not resile from any of the tactics that have been used with this recalcitrant, arrogant union. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable members want to know about their arrogance, they ought to go back to the very early days when Mr Swartz became Minister for Civil Aviation. To indicate the arrogance of that union I will once again read what Captain R. Holt, President of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots-the very organisation holding this country to ransom-said when welcoming the then Liberal Minister for Civil Aviation, Mr Swartz, to the AFAP convention in 1967. Not much has changed with the Air Pilots Federation since then. In front of the press and his members he said:</PARA>
<PARA>This Federation has an industrial strength that is unique. We can do anything that we like-we can do anything lawful that we like. </PARA>
<PARA>He gave that message to the people of Australia and the government of the day in front of the Minister. It has taken until now to get a government in office that would take on the Builders Labourers Federation, that would restructure industrial relations to benefit the economy and everyone and future generations, and that has now taken on the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. Those opposite have stood back tacitly supporting them; we have taken them on. This is the fifth occasion on which those opposite have come into this place to defend the notion of collective bargaining and the pirates of the Federation of Air Pilots. Those opposite have fallen down in such a way that Senator Chaney, who has had so many kicks this week, ought to retire to the party room and make peace with those that have tried to stand over him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Madam Deputy President, I claim to have been misrepresented. During the heat of the debate on the matter of public importance, Senator Collins claimed that I had used the same unacceptable phrase that he used-`bloody-minded bastards'. I have certainly never used that phrase in this Parliament. In fact, the phrase that Senator Collins may have been alluding to was in the debate on the Aboriginal Development Commission Bill on 1 September, when I said the following:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate that the Opposition will oppose this motion. I thank the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) for moving it because had he not done so by leave now I think we would have been debating the motion retrospectively after the adjournment. I assume he would have had to negative the adjournment question and we would have been in something of a shambles. I acknowledge the Minister's sense in bringing the matter on now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The motion actually proposes that instead of the Senate adjourning at 6.30 p.m., as has been proposed since the sitting commenced before the Budget, we sit again after dinner between 8 p.m. and 10.30 p.m. It is my understanding that that in part gives rise to the possibility that we might sit beyond that time with a view to completing the passage of major legislation which is currently before the Senate, namely, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I indicate to the Manager of Government Business in the Senate and to the Senate the two reasons why we do not believe what is being proposed is reasonable. The first-I suppose in one sense it is the lesser reason-is that as far as possible the Senate should proceed in a predictable way so that people can make arrangements with some satisfaction and hope that they can meet them. That is less weighty today than usual because a large number of senators are stranded here until tomorrow in any event. A number of senators will be inconvenienced in the sense that the plans they have made in contemplation of the Senate rising at 6.30 p.m. will be destroyed. More importantly, a number of senators have to get to Sydney to catch aircraft early tomorrow morning and their travel arrangements will be significantly hindered. </PARA>
<PARA> At this early stage of the session-I remind the Senate that we are only in the third week of sitting-we have been making orderly progress with the Government's program. It is most unusual to require additional periods of sitting at this stage. For all those reasons I think the arrangements which have been before us for some considerable time should be left in place. I say to the Manager of Government Business that as is usual we would expect late in the session to have the customary negotiations about extended periods of sittings to meet the program. I think it is very early in the day to be calling upon us to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> The more significant reason why I suggest that we should not do what is proposed is the significance of the particular legislation that we have in front of us at the moment. The Senate is debating the ATSIC legislation which has been the subject of an extensive parliamentary committee inquiry and of an extensive parliamentary debate. It is legislation which will have a major impact on Aboriginal affairs in Australia and it is extremely contentious. We have gone beyond the second reading debate, which was an orderly debate of a high standard. We are now into the committee stage. I have asked Senator Peter Baume to support me in this debate because he has the conduct of this Bill for the Opposition. He is therefore more closely across the detail of what the Senate is doing in committee than I am. </PARA>
<PARA> I think what Senator Peter Baume will tell us will illustrate that not only is the Opposition raising matters of considerable significance but it is also raising matters which, in a large number of cases, are finding favour with the Government and which are leading to the amendment of this important legislation. I have not been able to be involved in the committee debate in the way in which I would have liked but it is my understanding that the National Party of Australia, the Liberal Party of Australia, the Australian Democrats and the Government are engaged in a very serious but also very fruitful debate which is achieving significant changes to the legislation. Many of those changes are being made virtually on a consensual basis after hearing argument. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose it is only a couple of times a year that we take a major piece of legislation and give it what I would regard as major consideration. That is not novel. That has been the case for the 15 or so years that I have been here. Senator Gareth Evans would remember some of the debates in the mid-70s on matters like the Trade Practices Act. But I recall-if I might raise the name without reminding the Senate of very divisive matters-the then Attorney-General, Senator Murphy, saying at the end of the debate on the Trade Practices Bill that he was satisfied that we had a very significantly improved Bill as a result of the Senate's consideration. </PARA>

<PARA> My fundamental point-I make this very seriously to the Australian Democrats and to the Government-is that we are not engaged in some short term political exercise. I very much doubt that there is enormous political significance in the detailed consideration which is being given to the ATSIC legislation; but I suggest that there is major substantive significance. In an area where everyone would agree there are great difficulties, I believe it would be tragic if the consideration of the large remaining number of amendments were to be conducted under the pressure of an extended and, subsequently, a late sitting. I think that that would be completely contrary to the careful consideration at the Select Committee level, then in the second reading debate and so far in the Committee of the Whole debate which I think has been a classically proper and appropriate parliamentary effort. I would therefore hope that there would be no extension of Senate sittings in the way in which it is proposed by this motion. I would certainly be quite bitterly opposed to any suggestion that we should sit late into the night-the early hours-to force-feed a most sensitive and difficult piece of legislation and thereby to trade off for the gain of a few hours of parliamentary time some significant advantage which might apply. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a great deal of political argy-bargying in this chamber. I am well aware that the two Ministers that I have already mentioned seem to get most irate when I sound at all serious about a matter. I suggest that these are matters of substance which are worthy of consideration by the Government and by the Australian Democrats. I would welcome Senator Reid, if that is her wish, and Senator Peter Baume, if it is his wish, indicating in a little more detail to the Senate the significance of the remaining matters which we have before us. </PARA>

<PARA> I cannot recall a legislative package of this complexity, certainly not in the area of Aboriginal affairs and I doubt in very many other areas. It therefore requires from the Senate proper consideration. It does not require any kind of unduly long consideration but it requires proper consideration. That includes an adequate committee stage debate. The Senate has proceeded with care and without undue delay to this stage. For a start there is not just one Bill; there are three Bills in this package. With the modern communications available to honourable senators now and with the help of the Table Office I have obtained a print-out relating to the other two Bills in the package. I note that the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Bill 1989 was passed by this place on 1 September very quickly. That committee stage was not prolonged; it was very brief indeed. The Government indicated that it would accept all of the Opposition's amendments. There were 17 amendments put into that legislation. The Opposition's view would be that the legislation was thereby improved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill 1989 was debated in committee for a day or so. We moved 16 amendments and the debate continued. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill, which is the main piece of legislation, brings together a number of different legislative matters. I just indicate for a start that we have yet to consider the proposed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Development Commission which could have been the subject of a Bill on its own. It is a major legislative offering and will have to be examined. We have 11 pages of amendments covering it. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not taken this debate lightly, but we have not prolonged it unduly. When people have agreed with our amendments, we have stopped the debate straight away and proceeded to the next. When the debate resumes I hope that we can dispose of three or four amendments-they have been the subject of discussion off-stage-in just a couple of moments. There is no point in prolonging the discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> I have just pulled out for my own interest a list of the amendments which so far have been inserted into the package. I advise honourable senators that by proceeding with care we have so far inserted 83 amendments in the package of three Bills, and more amendments are proposed. If the agreement holds, two or three more will go in straight away. It is a very substantial group of amendments. I seek leave to incorporate the print-out of the clauses in Hansard. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. What remains in the legislation is vital. I have taken the time to look at our schedule of amendments. I am aware that there are several Australian Democrat amendments. I do not imagine that they will take a lot of time to consider because again I am certain that they will succeed, since we have amendments in the same form. Therefore they will have support from a majority of senators. We still have to deal with questions such as the continued role of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the right to privacy, the regional council structure under the proposed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, electoral processes-I interpolate here that I think Senator Coulter will recall that the Senate Select Committee into the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs looked at the question of electoral processes at some length, and there are many loose ends there which have to be clarified-the Corporation, which as I said earlier is an enormous subject in itself, the reports of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, Queensland community councils, the interim Commission and the entry into force of the Act and transitional proposals, after which the Committee has to direct its attention to the preamble. I do not want to say much about that, except that I think it is a very significant part of the Bill and may take some time. If we do sit, we will not prolong debate. We will not take any more time over any amendment or clause than we have to. We will certainly try to deal with them in good order. When they are disposed of, we will go on to the next one. Even so, if we do sit, it will take considerable time to deal with the rest of this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to echo what Senator Chaney has said. It has been a pleasure to be a senator while this debate has been going on because it has been possible-by examining each clause, negotiating and getting the support of excellent officers and the parliamentary counsel-to improve the legislation as we have gone along. I hoped that we could do this. I wish the debate to continue in that kind of spirit. It is all right to be threatened with sitting all night; that is a legitimate tactic. Senator Robert Ray often tells us that in politics these things ebb and flow. I understand that and I do not mind. We will sit for as long as the Senate says that we should sit. All I am saying is that the task I have been given is to try to deal with the amendments in good order and not to take an unduly long time. That is what we intend to do. If it is the Senate's view to sit all night, how long will we sit? Will we sit until 10.30 p.m., 2 a.m. or sunrise? It does not matter. I do not welcome the prospect for a number of reasons, but if that is what we have to do, we will do it. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Senate to have regard to what has been done so far in the ATSIC Bill, which has been quite creditable. I think that it has reflected credit on the Government, the Australian Democrats and the Opposition. We would like to see it continue that way. I do not like the idea of being put under pressure to hurry the Bill through. I hope that we can continue to deal with it in an orderly fashion. That is the way the Opposition would prefer to proceed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief in supporting the motion that the Senate sit until 10.30 tonight. I support it for the reasons given by Senator Chaney and Senator Peter Baume. This has been an excellent, first class and fascinating debate. It has been conducted in a way which suggests that rationality has struck with a vengeance. The amendments that have already been passed show that it has been an effective debate. Fairly obviously it will take a great deal of time to consider the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Bill and we have to provide for that in the timetable. Because it is a very good debate, we need more time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Chaney mentioned that some honourable senators have to leave tonight. I am sure that the Whips will accommodate those people by arranging pairs and whatever. The number of people who have engaged in the debate is quite small, but they have been effective. Quite frankly, the Australian Democrats have to agree with the Government's motion-as we have agreed with the motions of other governments-to provide time for good debates. We have had plenty of debates in this place about the need for more Committee time. We have to find it. Unfortunately, that means sitting longer, not only in this ad hoc way but also, as I have said many time in the past, for extra weeks. No-one likes that idea, least of all the electorate. Unless we find the time we will not have the types of debate that we are having at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The pressure of business, if anybody has bothered to notice, is pushing the amount of time for legislation into a small hole. We have to open it up. Unfortunately, the only time we can open up debates on legislation-Senator Peter Baume certainly knows this, as does Senator Chaney, having been Whips-is at the end of the day. That is unfortunate, but everything comes before legislation. If we want to sit down and be rational about it, we might arrange it in another way, but it will take more time than we have between now and December to get some change to the sessional orders or Standing Orders. It is obvious that we have to open up some time towards the end of the day. Honourable senators may be aware that we used to sit very long hours. When I became a member of this Parliament we sat into the early morning many times. </PARA>

Senator Chipp, quite properly-after a wrestle with his heart-decided that there were far saner ways of living and that we ought to have set hours. We have been more rational than the other place and I hope that will continue. The debate that we have had so far on the ATSIC Bill has demonstrated that if we can open up some more time we will get better legislation. I am surprised that we are trying to prevent this. I think that we can accommodate those people who will be inconvenienced. The rest of us will be here until tomorrow anyhow because there are no planes. It seems to me that this is an ideal opportunity to get a couple more hours for a very good debate.</PARA></TALK.START>

It will be harder for us to carry on the debate without the advice of those two people. Of course, Senator Tate will have four or five Government advisers assisting him, which will put him at a decided advantage. This debate is not only interesting but has been carried out in good spirit, with everyone working in harmony to try to reach a compromise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Stone rightly points out, it will affect not only black Australians but all Australians. There is no way in the world that the Opposition has tried to filibuster. We did not bring on a matter of public importance on Tuesday. We could have stacked the speakers list, but only two people have participated in the debate. Senator Tambling has been coming in on the odd occasion to participate in the debate, but Senator Peter Baume is carrying the main load. There can be no suggestion that we are trying to extend the debate. We want to get the answers right regarding the legislation. I will find it more difficult to proceed with this legislation without a person to advise me in the chamber. Our researchers have spent, I would say, hundreds of hours going through the legislation in order to get the amendments correct. If those people are out of the game, we run the grave risk of not making the correct decisions. I cannot see how debating this legislation today for an extra couple of hours will make any difference. We should finish debating it the next time we sit. We will not come up with the right results by pushing this legislation through like meat through a sausage machine. If the legislation were not so important I would not mind, but this legislation requires concentration, and it requires advice, which the Opposition does not now have. Senator Coulter seems to be able to bat on on his own and does it quite well. It will not make any difference whether we debate this legislation for an extra couple of hours today. If debating this legislation for an extra couple of hours will mean that we get it right, then let us take a couple of hours when the Senate comes back in a couple of weeks. We will then know that we are going to have the right answers. If we do it in an ad hoc way, anything could happen.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will reflect briefly upon the words of Senator Peter Baume and Senator Macklin. The debate so far has been excellent. It has been a real debate. I have really enjoyed the way in which Senator Peter Baume has put his amendments. So far, we have been debating his amendments. He has explained them well. The quality of the argument has been excellent and we have got exactly the same from Senator Tate. As Senator Baume has pointed out, a number of amendments have been accepted and we have been able to abstract the principles from others which have been debated and to come up with a form of words that better suits both sides of the chamber. A number of changes have been made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is clear that that process takes quite a lot of time. It is precisely for that reason we should not be seeking to cut this debate off. Therefore, I support the motion that we go through until 10.30 p.m. It is a reasonable time; it is not excessive. The only proviso I make is that, if we are debating a particular group, we should finish that group and finish the debate at a suitable time. At least it will give us another couple of hours, as Senator Macklin has said. That is what we need in this debate-more time. It is clear that we will not finish the debate tonight. We will need time beyond that, but at least we will get in another couple of hours. We should have that time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To bring on an extra sitting at night at this stage when the pilots strike is on is very thoughtless. I know people who have made arrangements for tomorrow, and in order to meet those commitments they have to leave Canberra by car tonight. That normally would not be the case. They would normally catch the early plane out tomorrow morning. Some of them are driving themselves and some are being driven. Either way, with the highways as clogged as they are at present, I think it is a very foolish way to be doing our business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is only the third week of the session and people normally make arrangements for the end of the sitting weeks. They are entitled to do so. All of us know that at the end of a session we sit later and that our sitting pattern may be altered; we take that into account when we make arrangements. We could talk about the impact of this proposal on health. We certainly can talk about the debate. The Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) cannot suggest that there has been any delay in this debate. I have heard enough of it to be able to say that unequivocally. </PARA>
<PARA> So far some 83 amendments have been carried. If those amendments had taken only 15 minutes each, it would have taken about 21 hours of committee debate. In addition, there are clauses to which no amendments have been made. This clearly indicates that all those participating in the debate have been extremely diligent, especially Senator Peter Baume, Senator Coulter and the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate). There have been a few others who have participated from time to time. From the number of amendments that have been put, I think it almost comes into the category of being historic that so much has been done in the time. Anybody listening would know that it has been done expeditiously and with goodwill. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of reasons why sitting on tonight is foolish. If we sit until 10.30 p.m., that is bad enough, but we do not know whether there is the threat of some arrangements to negate the adjournment at that time. That hangs over our heads as well, which makes my argument about the arrangements for people travelling and the like even more pertinent. I suggest that the Manager of Government Business reconsider the proposal and make arrangements for the scheduling of this debate for some other time. He knows how many amendments there have been and to suddenly bring this proposal on, when people have had no opportunity to make other arrangements, is not in the best interests of the operation of this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be quite brief because many of the points I was going to make have been made by others and I see no point in repeating them, although I think it fair to underline one or two of them. The point about predictability of our schedules has already been made by others, most recently by Senator Reid. It is intolerable that we were told yesterday that the change in our programs would occur today at this stage in the session. I have to say honestly that it does not personally affect me if we sit here tonight until 10.30 p.m. I am stranded here tonight because of the airline dispute and I have not made engagements here in Canberra as many other people have. So it will not affect me. I will sit here tonight and I will take part in the debate, which otherwise I perhaps would not have had time to do.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator STONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I assure the Minister that that was not in my mind. I simply make the point that I am not in the position that many honourable senators who have been referred to are in. They have made arrangements either to drive to Sydney or to drive elsewhere in New South Wales. If they are stranded here in Canberra and have made arrangements here they are now faced with the prospect of cancelling them. I am not in that situation, so I am not pleading those things. As I have said, because of that I will be able to take part in the debate, so I shall. But that is predictability for you.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point which has been the centre of the debate, which I also want to underline is that, although I have not taken much part in the debate personally, I have certainly been watching it and listening to it a good deal in my room on our communication system. I would just like to underline what Senator Macklin, Senator Coulter and everybody else have said. This has been an extraordinary debate. It has probably been the highest quality debate I have witnessed, in the two years that I have been in the Senate at any rate. Perhaps the quality of the debate cannot be more succinctly expressed than by noting that, as Senator Peter Baume said, so far 83 amendments to these three Bills have already been accepted by the Government. To my mind, that is enough to suggest that the last thing we should be trying to do is truncate the debate or conduct a debate when people are bleary-eyed and tired out of their minds. I am not suggesting that they would be by 10.30 tonight, but I am certainly suggesting that they would be if the debate were to go beyond that time. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) responds to this debate-as I assume he will do-I would like him to indicate quite clearly to the Senate his intention as far as the adjournment tonight is concerned. We will then know much more clearly where we stand. Senator Coulter indicated that he had a view about that, but it was not altogether crystal clear. Anyway, I would like to know what Senator Ray's view is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-The first point made by Senator Chaney was that he wanted predictability. I guess that it is for that reason that I gave notice of this motion yesterday. I was under pressure earlier in the week to sit Wednesday and Thursday nights, but I made the decision not to press for Wednesday night because we had had two late night sittings. But I gave notice of this motion yesterday to put people on notice in case they had other functions to attend or had made other arrangements. I could have deferred the matter we dealt with this morning, brought the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) legislation on this morning, waited until the adjournment tonight and simply negated the adjournment, having stitched up some sort of deal. Then no-one would have had any notice at all and no-one would have had a dinner break. It is for that reason that I gave notice of this motion yesterday, at least to try to establish a dinner break and further consideration of these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A point raised by Senator Reid and Senator Chaney, with some validity, is that some people may have to leave here a little earlier than normal tonight. Certainly, from the Government's point of view we raise no objection to the extension of pairs if that will facilitate that operation. I accept the point that there has been no filibuster in the ATSIC debate. I also hope that honourable senators will accept that a lot of other time has been absorbed in the last 12 sitting days that probably has not left us the normal percentage of time to deal with government business. I might say that that is a normal function at the start of a parliament. The percentage tends to ease up as the sittings go on. I am not alleging that there has been some subversive filibuster in other matters in order to delay the ATSIC legislation, but we are 12 sitting days into the program. We have got no legislation through yet and we are not likely to do so tonight, no matter what we do. </PARA>
<PARA> I should make the point that once we finish this sitting period, we go into Estimates committees for two weeks. So we will have only four full sitting days in the next sitting period, on each of which a matter of public importance will be put forward-I do not quibble about that because honourable senators opposite must have at least two a week-which means that in September we will have very little time to debate the ATSIC legislation. One other piece of legislation will be brought into the Senate in that period because it has a 1 October start-up date. That has been put off for quite a while. It was considered last session--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Are we? That is very encouraging. Even if my motion is carried in five minutes' time, we will be dealing with General Business for 2 1/2 hours and I guess it will be about 9 o'clock tonight before we get to ATSIC; so it will not be a long debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Coulter indicated what I think is the general feeling in terms of the 10.30 adjournment; that is, if we are very close to getting a set of clauses through, we will probably proceed to 11.00 or 11.15. If the debate looks like going on until midnight or beyond we will pack up our bags and go at 10.30. I do not think we have contemplated a sunrise sitting at this stage. I admit that, quite clearly, we threatened Opposition senators with that over the war crimes legislation to bomb them to the negotiating table. If honourable senators remember, we all came together, agreed on a four-day debate, and came in on time. Again, I thought it took a lot of the steam out of the debate. People could concentrate on the actual issues rather than the pressure of time-whether they should deliberately delay it or speed it up. </PARA>
<PARA> I still support the motion. If we have caused anyone any inconvenience tonight, I regret that. I take it that some people are embarking on international travel and have to travel to Sydney tonight to facilitate that process. But we make the offer of extra pairs. As it is, having just spent 45 minutes debating this matter it looks as though we will spend a maximum of one or 1 1/2 hours debating the ATSIC legislation this evening, depending on how we go with General Business. I do not imagine that that will take too much less than 2 1/2 hours. </PARA>
<PARA> I put all honourable senators on notice so that no-one can accuse me of intolerable activity that, if the debate on ATSIC slows down too much-already we are sitting an extra week in September-we might have to sit an extra week starting 16 October, which means that we will be sitting three weeks in a row, followed by a break, another three weeks in a row, another break and then probably four weeks in a row. It is a very intensive schedule. There are another 72 Bills listed essential for passage. In reality that means that at least 50 of them will be absolutely essential. Twenty-two absolutely essential items for passage always at the last minute become not so essential. That does not take account of any other Bills that may come up in between. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to speak today on the report of the Defence Force Discipline Legislation Board of Review. Twenty years of work went into the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 and a further three years were spent on drafting regulations. Rules of procedure, a law manual for use by the services, training courses for people who would need to work in the system and further amendments to the 1982 Act were needed before the Act was finally able to come into force on 3 July 1985. The disciplinary codes of the defence forces have been brought into one single uniform code. But at that time it was recognised that a review would be needed of the Act. Therefore, it was decided that this review should take place three years after the Act came into operation. In fact, that is what has happened and the report of that review is now before us. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to congratulate Mr Justice Connor and the other members of the board of review for doing a very thorough job which took a year to complete. They travelled virtually all around Australia, studied 79 submissions and talked to servicemen at bases all around the country. I, for one, am very pleased to have received this report. I think it will go quite a long way to making sure that the new disciplinary code of the defence forces works to its optimum effectiveness and efficiency. One should not forget the importance of discipline to the defence forces. It is a vital element in the effectiveness and efficiency of the Force. </PARA>
<PARA> The report concludes that the new code is operating reasonably satisfactorily and that it has been generally accepted by the forces. I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that the board of review says that service members want a disciplinary system that is well-founded and works efficiently and effectively not only in peacetime but also in respect of active service. That is a very important criterion for a discipline code for the defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> As I read the report, I was impressed with the 53 recommendations which have been made. Obviously, time does not allow me to canvass them all. However, we should be alert to the fact that a number of the recommendations relate to matters which were raised by the Judge Advocate-General in his report for the period 1 January to 31 December 1987. A number of the matters that he raised in that report have, rightly, been adopted. For example, it was felt that certain minor service convictions should not carry over as convictions in civilian life. The view was expressed that, in some cases, the penalties for use or possession of cannabis where the amount involved is over 25 grams were not sufficient. This has now been remedied. Also the question of whether people, while they are suspended from duty awaiting trial, should receive salary and allowances has been dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> The board of review had to resolve a difficult problem about the right to hold general searches of personnel, premises and vehicles at random and at will, especially of personnel and vehicles leaving defence establishments. That recommendation has been accepted and implemented. On the matter of the procedure of service tribunals, there has been a limited acceptance of the situation where lawyers appear in summary trials. This has been a matter of concern to the Royal Australian Navy and the Army. To some extent, that has been dealt with in the recommendations. There has also been a response to the need for a less cumbersome procedure for dealing with minor summary offences. </PARA>
<PARA> One matter which has been addressed but not resolved according to the recommendation of the Judge Advocate-General relates to the question of the binding effect of the Judge Advocate-General's rulings. A question was raised about consistency in rulings, but the review board had decided that this has not proved to be a problem and did not need action. I commend the report of the Defence Force Discipline Legislation Board of Review. It is an excellent report which will serve the defence forces well. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This paper relates to a proposal to upgrade and refurbish the southern entry to the administrative building. I do not know whether the Senate has any views on this or whether individual senators wish to express a view. My concern is the manner in which this matter is being dealt with. The Joint Committee on the New Parliament House has as its responsibility the building or alteration of those structures within the Parliamentary Triangle. It is contemptuous of the Senate for that Committee not to have had this matter referred to it. I can assure the Senate as a member of that Committee, which seems to sit once every pancake day, if that, that this matter has not been referred to the Committee. As I may wish to move a substantive motion on this matter at a future time, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I draw the attention of the Senate to some very interesting remarks in the 1988-89 annual report of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) which I think will no doubt be the subject of comment by other senators and members in the weeks ahead. At the outset the Bureau notes:</PARA>
<PARA> During the year the Commonwealth Ombudsman undertook an investigation into the administration by the ABS of the 1988-89 household expenditure survey. In his report of 1 May 1989, the Ombudsman said, inter alia, that he did `not consider that the Statistician was wrong to implement the original 1988 HES without tabling it' in Parliament under section 6 of the Australian Bureau of Statistics Act 1975 and `that the HES is not oppressive or unreasonably intrusive, bearing in mind the public interest in collection of the information and the protections for privacy'. </PARA>
<PARA>I draw attention to that because the question of whether or not the ABS has been following the correct procedures for tabling survey questions before the Parliament for its perusal has been followed. That question has wider implications for parliamentary scrutiny of government and privacy concerns of members of the community. The ABS statement I have just quoted does not adequately reflect the disquiet of the Ombudsman on a number of points. For the record I will detail just one example. On page 2 of its annual report the Bureau states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Ombudsman made 5 recommendations in his report. The first 3, which were about internal administrative matters, have been implemented by the ABS. The fourth and fifth recommendations were concerned with, respectively, consideration of financial compensation and amendment to statistics legislation. With respect to these, the Minister Assisting the Treasurer decided to defer considering whether financial compensation should be paid to persons directed to participate in the household expenditure survey until the next such survey in 3 or 4 years' time, and-</PARA>
<PARA>this is the significant part-</PARA>
<PARA>having regard to advice from the Attorney-General's Department, did not see any need to amend statistics legislation to clarify the powers and responsibilities of the Statistician, particularly with respect to tabling new proposals. </PARA>
<PARA>What did the Ombudsman actually have to say about this? In a letter to the Australian Statistician, Mr Castles, dated 28 August last the Ombudsman noted:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Minister Assisting the Treasurer has decided that, having regard to the advice of the Attorney-General's Department dated 16 June 1989, he does not see the need for amendment to statistics legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I do not feel that the Attorney-General's Department advice is really an adequate response to my recommendation, in the light of the underlying reasoning set out in my report. I do not, for example, consider that the fact that the Department-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Attorney-General's Department-</PARA>
<PARA>considers a particular legal interpretation to be correct meets my observation that a number of experienced lawyers-</PARA>
<PARA>I understand there are seven such experienced lawyers-</PARA>
<PARA>have reached other conclusions as to the meaning of the legislation. Whilst I have great respect for the Department's skills, it is not infallible-</PARA>
<PARA>I think we can say that again-</PARA>
<PARA>and it is such doubt which I think should be resolved by amendment of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>I would have to say that the treatment of that view expressed by the Ombudsman-he is not a man who expresses views on such matters lightly-by the Bureau in its report is somewhat less than adequate. I understand that others may have similar points to make about this report and I therefore conclude my remarks at this point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to speak to the 1988-89 annual report of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). I am extremely concerned about the report. It contains a considerable amount of information about the household expenditure survey, as Senator Stone has already indicated. I believe that the Bureau of Statistics has misled the Senate. It is because of that that I am extremely concerned. As Senator Stone said when he quoted from page 2, the Commonwealth Ombudsman has said, inter alia, that he does not consider that the Australian Statistician was wrong to implement the original 1988 survey without tabling it and that the household expenditure survey was not oppressive or unreasonably intrusive, bearing in mind the public interest in the collection of information and the protections for privacy. I will quote directly from the Ombudsman's report in answering a question as to whether the survey was unreasonably intrusive and burdensome. The Ombudsman stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>There seems little doubt that there are aspects of the survey which are intrusive and burdensome. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet the Statistician's report tells us that the Ombudsman did not find the survey intrusive and burdensome. It depends on how we read that report. It is misleading for the chief Statistician to release an annual report and not give the full picture. The chief Statistician also said that the Ombudsman did not consider that it was wrong to implement the original survey without tabling it. Yet the Ombudsman said that it would be in the best interests of the ABS to table that survey. That was done. Perhaps even more importantly, or just as importantly, the Assistant Statistician, in a minute that I have before me, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Household Expenditure Survey is the most burdensome household expenditure survey undertaken by the ABS and is also considered to be highly intrusive by some members of the community. As a consequence, the survey tends to generate Ministerials arising from complaints by constituents to their Local Members of Parliament. Being able to say that the survey had been tabled and subject to parliamentary scrutiny then becomes a very useful ABS tactic. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore seek your approval to table the 1988/89 Household Expenditure Survey. </PARA>
<PARA>That was signed by Mr Giles, the Assistant Statistician. It was written to Mr W. McLennan, the Deputy Statistician. The fact that Mr Castles has claimed that the survey was not burdensome and intrusive when the Assistant Statistician, Social Branch, in a minute to the Deputy Statistician claims that it is the worst they have ever had, and the Ombudsman says there is no doubt that it is-yet according to the annual report Mr Castles blithely claims that the Ombudsman found that it was not intrusive-I believe is of great concern to this chamber and it is of great concern that the ABS would mislead the chamber in that way. As honourable senators know, we have only five minutes to speak on this report. Because of the very short time I have, I will speak also on the next paper to come before us, the annual report of the Australian Statistics Advisory Council, because that paper also makes reference to whether it should be compulsory or voluntary for these surveys to be conducted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the 1988-89 annual report of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). Last year there was a whole chapter on privacy and this year there is a whole appendix on the household expenditure survey. The ABS has devoted many pages of its 20-page appendix to defending itself against a charge that was never made. Opponents of the household expenditure survey have not questioned the need for such a survey, but have questioned the necessity for it to be compulsory and, as Senator Walters said, its burdensome nature. We have objected to the number of questions; there are many more than in previous years. There has been little justification of how these relate to the ostensible purpose of the survey, namely, to update the basket of goods and services in the consumer price index. Perhaps ABS can explain why investment expenditures are included in consumption expenditure?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The survey is burdensome and intrusive. I said, when we were debating whether it was legal when it had not been tabled, that the Bureau had not put forward an adequate explanation as to why it was compulsory. There is no sound social or scientific evidence to suggest that any better data is obtained from a compulsory survey than from a voluntary survey. The Bureau put up some spurious study from Germany which failed to convince me, as I am sure it failed to convince anyone on this side of politics, that it was necessary that it be compulsory. </PARA>
<PARA> The other criticism that was levelled was not about whether the survey should be conducted, but about the shabby conduct of the ABS in making a mistake about the need for tabling and then pulling a number of swifties to cover up the mistake: claims that the 1983 tabling document covered the 1988-89 survey; the tabling of the proposal among 45 other proposals with effect from a date two days subsequent to tabling; the misleading advice sent to the Attorney-General's Department; and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA> The appendix on household expenditure surveys gives a most selective history. It is quite fascinating to see on page 173 the jump from point 82 to point 83, taking us from 20 April 1988 to 21 June 1988. Nothing is said in between about the debate that went on about the compulsory versus voluntary nature of the survey and the fact that the ABS had not tabled it. It is the most selective and appalling dot point history of expenditure surveys in Australia I have ever seen. </PARA>
<PARA> I finish my comments by saying that the other day-I hope the Australian Labor Party takes note-I had a call from a lifetime Labor voter. She said that she had discovered the difference between the Labor and Liberal parties. She said, `I now know that the Labor Party wants to know how often I pick my nose every day. It wants to know that sort of detail'. She had had an exchange with the ABS which was totally inappropriate. I object to any citizen, especially a constituent, being treated in the way she was treated by the ABS. Over the telephone she was asked how tall she was and what her weight was. When she answered the question about her weight, the person told her that she ought to go on a diet and that she would be sent a form to fill in. The form had apparently been lost. It was a disgusting performance. This woman was concerned and upset when she rang me. She is right about the difference between the Labor and Liberal parties. For people who do not know the difference, it is that the Labor Party wants to interfere in people's business and the Liberal Party wants to stay out of it. These surveys should be voluntary and not compulsory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Walters has already foreshadowed that she wishes to speak also to the annual report of the Australian Statistics Advisory Council so that she can follow up on her remarks on the national health survey. I will therefore not speak about that aspect of this paper, but about a quite different aspect. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter I wish to refer to in the report is referred to on pages 12 and 13. It relates to the treatment of mortgage interest charges in the consumer price index (CPI). Honourable senators will recall that during the last major review of the calculation of the CPI it was decided to incorporate price changes for home mortgage interest payments. The statisticians have two principal ways of making those measurements, known respectively as the debt profile approach and the simple revaluation method. At the time of inclusion of mortgage interest charges in the CPI, the two methods, which are both in their own ways equally valid measurements, were producing practically identical results and it did not appear to anybody, therefore, that the choice of one or the other would affect very much the development of the index. Without going into technicalities, it was decided at that time by the Australian Bureau of Statistics to adopt the simple revaluation method. </PARA>
<PARA> It is ironic that subsequently the Statistician decided to change that and that that apparently technical and, in a way, rather esoteric issue should blow up into a major political issue. We all know that after the disastrous December quarter CPI result of 2.1 per cent, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) sought to put pressure on the Bureau of Statistics to change to the alternative method of calculation because that was by that time producing lower figures for the CPI. Subsequently, the ABS did indeed change its methodology, stating when it did so for the record that no political pressure had been involved in the decision. With respect to the matter, the annual report of the Australian Statistics Advisory Council on page 13 states:</PARA>
<PARA>During Council's consideration of the matter many members expressed concern-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, before the change was made-</PARA>
<PARA>at the prospect of changing the measurement method for mortgage interest charges between the major five to six yearly reviews. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a review every five or six years and changes are often made at those times. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> While accepting the technical arguments for making the change, they pointed out that to do so in mid-stream, so soon after public criticism by Government leaders, could be widely interpreted as succumbing to political pressure. It was felt that such a perception could seriously damage the credibility of the ABS as an independent provider of impartial and reliable official statistics. Council recognised that the Statistician was responsible for decisions on how the CPI should be measured, but, in view of the importance it attached to maintaining public confidence in the integrity of the ABS, Council suggested that the Statistician give strong consideration to deferring any adjustments until the time of the next major review of the index. </PARA>
<PARA> Council notes that in the event the Statistician considered that he should not accept its recommendation and the change to the `debt profile' method was made for the March quarter CPI calculation. The criticism predicted by Council eventuated but, possibly because of the technical nature of the issues involved, was not sustained for a long period and the Bureau emerged relatively unscathed. Council accepts that the Statistician's decision was made after his careful consideration of its views and in the genuine belief that it would produce the most reliable figures. </PARA>
<PARA>The Council is here saying that in the end the Government got away with it. In the end, because of the technical nature of the change, the criticism was not sustained. I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that the Council, a very high level body, has put on the record its serious disquiet that this major change in methodology was made between the normal five to six yearly changes and that by doing so the Bureau's integrity was put at risk. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also want to speak on the Australian Statistics Advisory Council. I am concerned about the methods adopted in its 1988-89 annual report. On page 10 it criticises the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) household surveys. The report says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Throughout the year the ABS has had to contend with an unprecedented level of adverse publicity and Council was anxious to assist and support the Bureau in this difficult period. </PARA>
<PARA>The task was made difficult because the ABS refused to table the household expenditure survey before it implemented it. That was totally different from what had occurred with any previous survey. Previous surveys had been voluntary; this one was compulsory. That indicates to me that the difference was quite considerable. </PARA>
<PARA> Because members of the Opposition were very concerned that the ABS had taken an illegal stance they sought and received legal opinions from very prominent queen's counsel. All were to the effect that the ABS had acted illegally in not tabling the survey in the Parliament. The ABS sought legal opinion only from the Attorney-General's Department. In requesting that opinion, it did not tell the Department that one survey was voluntary while the other was compulsory. It was established during the Estimates hearings that the Attorney-General's Department did not receive that information. That explains why the Attorney-General's Department gave a different opinion. We asked the Bureau of Statistics to seek alternative legal opinion, which of course, it refused to do because it was sure that the opinion would not uphold the legality of its action. The Ombudsman also reported as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>All published legal opinions other than those of the Attorney-General's Department came down on the side of the 1988 HES being a new proposal and therefore falling within s.6(3) of the ABS Act . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That meant, of course, that it should be voluntary. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that the Department saw these other opinions and maintained its own view. Nevertheless, insofar as they identify problems in the interpretation of the Act, the views of the other legal experts cannot lightly be dismissed. </PARA>
<PARA>In answer to the question as to whether the original 1988 household expenditure survey was a new proposal, the Ombudsman said:</PARA>
<PARA>If a definitive answer is required, then it would seem necessary for the matter to be tested in court . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This was not possible because at no stage did the Bureau inform people who refused to complete the survey that it was compulsory. Those conducting the survey told people it was compulsory but the Bureau, because it refused to have the matter tested before the court, refused to direct those people who would not complete the survey to fulfil their survey obligations. As I said earlier, I believe that the Bureau of Statistics has misled the Parliament in its annual report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the reports and papers. </PARA>
<PARA>The report of the Auditor-General on the Australian Customs Service (ACS) in relation to passenger and crew processing, presented earlier this afternoon, is quite interesting. It relates to an audit done at Sydney and Hobart international airports, representing the two extremes of airports in Australia. Sydney takes over 50 per cent of the seven million-odd passengers coming into and out of the country each year and Hobart deals with only 0.3 per cent. The customs audit by the Auditor-General found that by and large the processing of inward and outward passengers and aircrew was satisfactory within the legislative and resource framework in which customs has to operate. That is a very important qualification. Some of the failings brought up in the Auditor-General's report stem from both the legislative restrictions in relation to body searches, which I will come to later, and the resource framework. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has cut back severely on the Australian Customs Service. It is only small, with about 5,000 employees, but it is very productive from the point of view of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth raises through the activities of the Australian Customs Service in excess of $12 billion or $14 billion per year in tariff and excise levies. Its productivity works out at in excess of $2m per employee for Consolidated Revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> Customs has a number of functions. One is the control of narcotics and prohibited goods entering this country through the customs barrier. It seems to me an incredibly foolish policy to deny Customs $1m or $2m to implement its duties more fully so that these dangerous and lethal substances are denied entry to Australia-to deny the Service the resource on the one hand and then, on the other hand, through social services and the police and security functions, try to clean up the mess after the products have come into the country. </PARA>
<PARA> To allow the importation of narcotic drugs without doing all we can to stop it means a very big increase in costs associated with the welfare program; the health bill; hospitalisation; looking after broken families; detection services of the Australian Federal Police-a big amount-and the State police; and putting people through the courts and then locking them up and feeding them at taxpayers' expense. A dollar spent on increasing the customs barrier control would be paid back tenfold or twentyfold by subsequent avoidance of costs to the community. But that is a matter for this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is not terribly keen to put all its resources into preventing the ingress of narcotics into this country. While I am sure that the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), who is at the table, is extraordinarily conscientious in what he is doing with the Australian Federal Police in trying on the one hand to detect the source of drugs in the producing countries and the pathways by which they enter Australia and, on the other, to track them within this country, I am quite sure that if he were able to speak frankly he would say that he is very severely limited by the resources that the Government has allocated to the Federal Police through his Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning back to the report itself, the Auditor-General found that passengers were being processed efficiently. It is worth noting that in Australia Customs performs a range of duties which in some countries are a function of other departments. It is a one-stop service when one enters an Australian airport. The primary customs barrier provides the identification of the passenger first of all and thereby carries out an immigration check. There is also a security check carried out in respect of Australian or international police requirements. There is a quarantine check carried out to see whether people are carrying prohibited or proscribed plant life. There is, of course, a narcotics and prohibited imports check-a true Customs function. All of those checks are carried out by one Customs officer at the primary barrier. Given the range of tests that have to be run through, and the fact that there may be 1,500 passengers trying to get through Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport in one batch, it really is a considerable administrative load, and some degree of delay is inevitable. Nevertheless, Customs has a target for processing passengers through the primary barrier within a certain period of time, and usually it reaches that target. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to turn now to the weaknesses exposed in the Auditor-General's report. The first one deals with general security arrangements in relation to Sydney Airport. Sydney Airport suffers from two security faults. I do not want to go into those in detail but they relate to the inadequate design of the international terminal which does not allow for crowd control, surveillance of passenger movement and all the other things which are needed in an ideal case and which, in Australia, are best served in the new Perth International Airport. </PARA>
<PARA> The other failure that relates to security in Sydney Airport, that the Auditor-General's report draws attention to, is the number of agencies at the airport, ranging from the Federal Airports Corporation to four or five other bodies which issue security passes. Wherever there are a number of authorities issuing identification cards and security clearances for people to work in secure areas, there are difficulties in coordination. One of the things that surprise me is that Customs has no knowledge of, control over or liaison with the authorities issuing security passes. There is quite a large section in the report concerning general security matters at Sydney. Of course, some of those can be remedied, but the design of Sydney's international airport terminal is inadequate and, while it is being extended at considerable expense, it will still be a long way short of an ideal international terminal, and I think that is rather sad for Australia's tourist trade. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point that is raised is the insufficient use of frisk searches. At the present time Customs officers have no authority to do anything other than a body search of a passenger entering Australia, and for them to carry that out certain stringent tests are required. The Customs officer who orders a body search-and by `body search' I mean the passenger's clothing is removed, in suitable secure circumstances, and it may, and almost always does, involve an X-ray examination to ensure that drugs or other contraband are not concealed in any of the internal body cavities-is ordering a major undertaking. Passengers do not like it. In fact, they object very strongly when a Customs officer suggests that this should be done. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the requirement that a Customs officer who orders a search must stand before a court, or his peers, and give good reason why he ordered the search, it is not used as often as it should be. When one recognises that, at the end of the day, it is really intuition that leads a Customs officer to demand a search-he obviously cannot see secreted packets of heroin in the large bowel, or wherever they might be hidden-he really has to stand up and say, `It was my intuition that led me to believe that this passenger was a suspect'. Of course, that statement can be attacked very readily by lawyers in courts of laws. They may ask, `Why did you have that suspicion?', and all the rest of it. It places a very great restriction on Customs officers. </PARA>
<PARA> There is undoubtedly a lot of smuggling going on where passengers conceal narcotics outside their body but under their clothing. If this is done carefully there is no way of detecting it without being able to frisk down a passenger. I am pleased that the Government has agreed to amend the regulations in the near future to allow Customs officers, again with suitable provisos of having reasonable suspicions, to pat down passengers-give them a frisk to see that there is nothing concealed under their shirts or blouses, or anywhere else under their clothing. I believe that will be both a deterrent to and detection of smugglers who, at the present time, are getting through the primary barrier. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point that the Auditor-General's report raises is the lack of sufficient data on the extent and nature of prohibited goods carried by passengers and crew to assess the effectiveness of the subprogram. I do not quite follow that. Unless a Customs officer knows what is coming into the country-and it is quite impossible to know what is being imported illegally in the way of prohibited goods and narcotics-there really cannot be a performance indicator. I find that part of the report less than convincing. However, it relates to what is driving Customs officers at the present time, and that is their risk assessment philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole Customs operation is based on the risk assessment philosophy. It means that, in the light of what intelligence Customs officers have and their intuition through dealing with passengers, they decide where they should concentrate their efforts, and where they should look. This has developed a great deal in recent years and it is a very valid procedure that Customs officers are following. It is also true to say that Customs officers have developed and expanded the risk assessment philosophy purely as a consequence of the restrictions on resources as a consequence of the Government cutting funds to the Australian Customs Service. The Australian Customs Service, for example, can no longer maintain 24-hour barrier controls with a Customs officer on the wharves in many ports of Australia. In Wollongong, Geelong and Newcastle, for example, it cannot be done because there is not the money to pay staffing costs. It costs money to keep people on the dockside for 24 hours a day. They have to be paid extra between 5 o'clock in the evening and 9 o'clock in the morning. They have to be paid double time and treble time at weekends and during public holidays. Because the Government has cut back funds to the ACS it has had to reduce the permanent dockside officers at the barrier controls and develop this risk assessment philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not make any secret of the fact that I think the Department has been put in a very invidious position by the Government's actions. It is quite wrong just to cut funds to all departments without assessing the consequences of cutting those funds and the real needs of the departments. The argument, in my book, is not whether risk assessment philosophy should replace round-the-clock surveillance at the barrier; it is a matter of a blend of both. People have to be there on the docks 24 hours a day. The number may be reduced, but they have to be there and used together with the risk assessment philosophy. But if the risk assessment philosophy is to be run, it turns on having good intelligence and getting good intelligence turns on having more money put into it. This cannot be done on the cheap in the way the Government thinks it can. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government takes a lot of pride in the risk assessment philosophy and the contraband enforcement teams (CETs)-the flying squads that have replaced the permanent officers on the wharves. It points to the fact that the CETs are having good successes, and that the permanent officers on the wharves rarely make drug apprehensions. That is to misunderstand the situation completely. The fact that an officer who is on the wharf 24 hours a day does not make an arrest does not mean he is not doing his job. His very presence there acts as a deterrent. If a seaman knows that for 24 hours a day, seven days a week there is a Customs officer lurking around the dockside and looking at his ship, when he comes down the gangway, he is far less inclined to come down with a couple of kilograms of heroin or buddha sticks under his arm than if he knows the dockside is completely clear and all he has to do is run the balance of probabilities against a CET team. The risk assessment philosophy is one of the Government's weaknesses in discharging its Customs duties. </PARA>
<PARA> The next criticism by the Auditor-General's Office relates to domestic passengers. This is particularly relevant at present because international airline carriers are operating in the capitals of Australia. They are picking up interline passengers; in other words, domestic passengers. I have put out some press releases on this because I believe that there is an increased risk of penetration of drugs into the Australian community through this system. The Government has given Customs no extra resources to cope with the extra load. If one puts aside the totally irrational statements by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) when he was challenged on this in the other place last week, when he just went out of his mind and said that we were trying to smear him and debase the Government and all the rest of it-the usual nonsense and rantings of the Prime Minister-one sees that opportunities are provided for domestic passengers to mix with international passengers. I have no doubt at all that this is being exploited by international drug couriers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's answer is that it really does not matter now because all passengers travelling on those services have to clear customs when they reach the airport to which they are travelling. Domestic passengers are not screened off at one level with international passengers going through the Customs area. That might be the sort of excuse that satisfies the Australian press but it is a long way short of the truth. An international passenger or someone arriving from overseas who goes through a Customs barrier has to present a passport. When a passport is examined by a Customs officer, the relevant details are typed in and the officer knows whether the passenger has a police record or something like that; there is no secret about it. An assessment is made on the risk of the passenger entering the country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible to do that with domestic passengers who do not carry a passport and are not identified by anything other than their boarding card. There is simply no way that Customs can carry out a risk assessment of a domestic passenger arriving in Sydney, Brisbane, Perth or wherever. While the Auditor-General's report was written long before the pilots strike, it is concerned about this matter. It takes up a full page of its short, 15-page report. It draws attention to the risks involved of mixing domestic passengers with international ones. </PARA>
<PARA> The second last matter I wish to raise is aircrew processing procedures. The Auditor-General finds fault with the fact that Customs does not check overseas aircrew entering and leaving the country. Although the report does not say so, that is absolutely inexcusable. There is no reason at all for Customs to go soft on overseas aircrew. I agree with the Customs assessment that they are a low risk group. By and large they are a high income group and have a great deal invested in their professional careers. Captains of aircraft and flightcrew will not risk a good lifestyle by trying to smuggle drugs, but there are always exceptions. If one studies what goes on in the Customs world one knows that in the past stewards have been apprehended for trying to evade Customs procedures. It is wrong that the check is not made because the processing of aircrews is simple and quick. It should not be treated with the levity that the Auditor-General found was being applied at both Hobart Airport and Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. </PARA>
<PARA> The final matter I want to raise is the dog detector unit. The Australian Customs Service is using dogs quite extensively at present. The dogs are very successful in detecting drugs through their sense of smell. The Auditor-General commented that dogs were not being used to sniff passengers' hand luggage. I find that proposition quite alarming. I have always had doubts about the practicality of some of the tests that the Auditor-General's Office applies in some of its audits, particularly in the Department of Defence. Sometimes it really does not know how things are done. I do not think it has seen dog teams working. When a dog finds even a letter with some cannabis in it, the dog really carries on. Screening all passengers coming to Australia by having dogs run past them so their hand luggage, clothing or personal smells set off the dogs would create the most enormous reaction from passengers. If a dog took to them, having smelled a bit of cannabis, I do not think they would do it again. It is not a practical thing to do: it is not practical even to talk about it. </PARA>
<PARA> We ought to have more dogs. Again, if Customs had more resources, it could train more dog teams. A team consists of a handler, a Customs officer and the dog. They are matched one to the other. They do their individual training. It takes many months to train them and there is a cost involved. Compared with electronic sniffers and some of the huge machines built around the world that cost up to $5m each which try to detect drugs in luggage or letters-at the end of the day they do not work-the dog teams provide a very cheap and effective way of going about it. But it takes time and money to train them. The answer is for Customs to have more resources so that it can do more in the way of training dog teams. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I start with an expression of concern about the manner in which these reports are being presented to the Senate. I hope that the President takes on board the fact that it is difficult to deal with these matters with any coherence when in fact it is impossible for us to see these reports before they are tabled by the President. Fortunately, the reports we are considering were tabled at an earlier hour this day in the House of Representatives and, as a result, became available to us.

<PARA> I hope that the Clerk will refer this to the President and that the President will take it on board. It is quite wrong that this situation should obtain. For example, Auditor-General's reports presented I think yesterday or the day before which we did not have the opportunity to speak to were deferred and went on the Notice Paper, with the result that one is now listed as item No. 110-presumably it will never come up-and one is listed as item No. 120 on the Notice Paper. The whole purpose of these Auditor-General's reports is to improve the accountability of government bodies to this Parliament. While it is true that we will have the opportunity to pursue them in the Senate Estimates committees and to ask questions of the public servants involved, the opportunity should be available to us when these reports are brought down to raise matters of very great significance, as Senator MacGibbon has just done. </PARA>

That is the only moment that we are given the opportunity of debating these matters, otherwise they get put on the bottom of the general Notice Paper such as item No. 120. One of the reports is of major significance. It is entitled Accountability, Independence and Objectivity: A response to Report 296 of the Parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts. This report's recommendations are aimed at ending the tyranny of this Government's control over the Auditor-General. That tyranny has been expressed in grossly unsatisfactory funding and other arrangements of the Auditor-General, as outlined in the Parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts report No. 296 which is termed The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament. The Auditor-General responds to the report of the Joint Committee favourably. He states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . a strong Australian Audit Office is essential for maintenance of the accountability of Federal Government organisations and officials of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>I apologise for reading some of these points into the Hansard but I think they are absolutely vital. The Auditor-General's response continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Accountability is the essence of our democratic form of government. It is the liability assumed by all of those who exercise authority to account for the manner in which they have fulfilled the responsibilities entrusted to them, a liability ultimately to the Australian people owed by Parliament, by the Government and, thus, by every government agency. </PARA>
<PARA> Accountability is the fundamental prerequisite for preventing the abuse of delegated power, and for ensuring, instead, that power is directed to the achievement of broadly accepted national goals with the greatest possible degree of efficiency, effectiveness, probity and prudence. A key component of accountability is a strong and viable Audit Office. </PARA>
<PARA>And I add: not an Audit Office under the thumb of an authoritarian Minister for Finance which, I would submit to this chamber, has been happening in recent times. I stress that the conclusion of the Auditor-General's response is of major significance. The conclusion states:</PARA>
<PARA> Report 296 represents the first fundamental appraisal of AAO since its establishment in 1901. It says that the AAO at a minimum could be described `as having major problems' and `at a maximum was in a state of crisis'. The AAO is doing all it can to `trade its way out of problems' by increasing productivity, improving training, adopting more appropriate organisational arrangements, liaising with and using the private sector and so on. But it is clear that Government help is needed also. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's Report and the actions that might flow from it are profoundly important-</PARA>
<PARA>according to the Auditor-General-</PARA>
<PARA>to the viability of the AAO. A generally favourable response on the part of the Government, and hence a reformed AAO, can be of great assistance in achieving the Government's goals for the public sector of greater emphasis on results, a commercial approach where appropriate, improved efficiency, effectiveness and accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> The broad directions proposed in the Report are consistent with equivalent steps already taken in the United Kingdom (1983), New Zealand (1989) and Canada (1977). The Report has also been favourably received internationally, by Australian State Auditors-General, the Australian Society of Accountants, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and by the accounting and auditing profession. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's Report indicates bi-partisan support from the Parliament for a substantially strengthened AAO. But it is not only the Parliament which needs an effective AAO. Such a body is essential also to provide unbiased assessments to governments, so that the Executive will be better informed in making decisions on its allocation of resources among the many competing programs and activities; and so that the Executive will know more about its component parts, including government business enterprises and companies, are doing. </PARA>
<PARA>This then is a warning from Mr Taylor, the Auditor-General. He concludes:</PARA>
<PARA>On the other hand, if it should be decided that the AAO will continue under present arrangements and general funding levels, I believe it must inevitably fall further and further behind which will be in no-one's interests. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, this Government must respond to this cri de coeur from the Auditor-General, strongly supported by the bi-partisan report of the Public Accounts Committee. The recommendations made by that Public Accounts Committee are basically supported by the Auditor-General. For example, recommendation 1 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Audit Act 1901 be repealed, and replaced by two new laws; a Financial Administration Act and an Audit Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General responds:</PARA>
<PARA>This recommendation is supported. The new Audit Act should not simply be a replica of the audit provisions of the old Act, but a rewritten Act taking into account the legislative amendments proposed throughout Report 296. The development of the new Act should be given high priority in the Government's legislative calendar. An Audit Bill could be introduced ahead of a Financial Administration Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope the Government takes on board that it should be given a high priority. I do not know what that priority is under this Government. The second recommendation which is also endorsed and supported by the Auditor-General states:</PARA>
<PARA>A Parliamentary Committee be established to advise the Auditor-General on Parliament's audit priority and to consider the Australian Audit Office's finances in detail. The Committee will report to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>This recommendation also deals with a lot of other matters relating to its membership of the proposed Audit Committee of Parliament. This is absolutely vital. The response from the Auditor-General in supporting recommendation 2 is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . The ultimate decision on the amount to be provided in the budget for the AAO is, of course, a matter the Government will decide. The essence of the Committee recommendation, however, is that there should be some special machinery in place to give the Parliament greater input into the consideration of the AAO's finances. This is supported. In time, when a new funding basis for the AAO has been established, a convention may emerge whereby, as in some other comparable countries the Government generally accepts the annual funding levels recommended by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>I stress that point. The funding levels would not be dictated by the Minister for Finance. It seems to me that in some instances the Minister for Finance may even have a vested interest in not providing adequate funding if a detailed Auditor-General's report would embarrass the Government or would embarrass some mandarins who may well be close to their respective Ministers. Certainly, some Ministers have been embarrassed by the revelations of the Auditor-General. In this chamber we have seen what the Auditor-General's view was of this Government's administration of the building of this new Parliament House and the lack of cost control which added multimillions of dollars to its cost. The Auditor-General continues:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the financing of a national audit office is new to Australia, but it is by no means unusual in other countries, including the United Kingdom and Canada. In both Canada and the United Kingdom, a committee of the Parliament reviews the national audit office budget, and this provides a better-based approach while preserving the ultimate responsibility of the Government for the budget it put to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>The next recommendation which the Auditor-General supports is:</PARA>
<PARA>Future audit legislation state unequivocally that the Auditor-General is an officer of the Parliament in order to emphasise the Auditor-General's relationship with Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>I add: rather than with the Executive. I strongly support that recommendation. The Auditor-General said:</PARA>
<PARA>The new Audit Act should reaffirm that the Auditor-General is the independent external auditor of the executive and has a statutory responsibility to report to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>There are many other recommendations and I will not take the Senate through them all but recommendation 5, which the Auditor-General also supports, is:</PARA>
<PARA>Auditors-General be appointed by the Governor-General in Council and shall not be removed except by the Governor-General in Council, on an address from both Houses of the Parliament in the same session, praying for such removal on the grounds of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. </PARA>
<PARA>One final recommendation I want to stress states:</PARA>
<PARA>Legislation be introduced to establish the Australian Audit Office as a statutory authority, and to permit the Auditor-General to determine the terms and conditions of employment of Australian Audit Office staff. </PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General responds:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . The principle underlying the Committee's recommendation was the extent of executive control of the resources available to the AAO and how they can be deployed. The Committee considered that executive Government controls over the Auditor-General's staff are inconsistent with the role of the Auditor-General being independent of the executive. </PARA>
<PARA>I must say that I say amen to all that. This is a very significant report. No doubt Senator Watson, when he has the opportunity, would like to speak further on that report. </PARA>
<PARA> I will deal now very speedily with some of the many other reports which have been thrust on us. I regret that matters of such moment have to be dealt with so quickly when there are very serious matters involved in them. For example, the Auditor-General's report into the Public Broadcasting Foundation Ltd is quite damning. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Financial management of the company was of a low standard and the systems and controls in place were inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The AAO was unable to reconcile the grants received by the company for administration with reported expenditure. Total administrative expenses of $174232 were incurred by the PBF in 1987-88. </PARA>
<PARA> The AAO review was hampered by the absence of any person within the company with any detailed knowledge of the operations. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The financial statements of the company were considered inadequate in terms of the Companies Act and normal disclosure of the Company's total operations. In particular, the disclosure of grant receipts and disbursements was incomplete. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> From the foregoing the AAO concluded that the company was inadequately managed and that the systems and controls in place were inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA>This is another of this Government's great organisations about which, no doubt, the Minister is monumentally proud. There is another report into the Department of Administrative Services' leasing expenditure. Unfortunately, I now have to deal very briefly with the Auditor-General's view. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . control over leased property required further improvement to ensure continued economy and cost effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . a need to monitor the level of dead rent as a performance indicator and to discharge the estate management responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA>The report, in fact, detailed the volumes of dead rent. For example, the amount of dead rent paid in 1987-88 in Queensland was $395,000. The dead rent paid for the first four months in 1988-89 was $220,000. The amount of dead rent paid in 1987-88 in Western Australia was approximately $410,000. The Auditor-General stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In Queensland and Western Australia, though noting that the percentage of dead rent was not significant in 1987-88, AAO recommended the establishment of a level/rate of dead rent which APG considers acceptable, against which APG could assess its performance in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>The quite proper response from the Department of Administrative Services was that no level of dead rent is acceptable. I think the taxpayers would accept that view. I hope that, as a result of the Auditor-General's inquiries, this matter is massively improved. </PARA>
<PARA> Many other matters relating to the Administrative Services portfolio I intend to take up in the Senate Estimates committees, but there is no doubt that these matters involving clear wastes of Government money have to be fixed up. For example, in the Procurement and Stores Division of the Administrative Services portfolio in Townsville it was found that, after introducing a microcomputer based purchasing and stores control system, testing indicated a 30 per cent error rate between stock balances recorded on the system and physical stocks. So these reports go on. In view of their importance, I am sure that other senators will wish to raise many matters. For example, in the report on the Department of Defence the Auditor-General stated:</PARA>
<PARA> a proliferation of documents and reports and poorly co-ordinated document processing which were leading to delays and lack of control indicated streamlining was needed. </PARA>
<PARA> Mainframe computer and support systems were not capturing relevant operation data . . . </PARA>
<PARA>As there are so many of these reports, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted; debate adjourned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr Acting Deputy President, may I say at the outset that it is a pleasure to see you for the first time, on my part at least, occupying that position. I understand that you have done so earlier, but I could not have been in the Senate at the time. Because there are time constraints upon us and because I am aware that we particularly wish to move on to discussion of order of the day No. 116, the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits Determination Revocation and Tribunal Membership) Amendment Bill 1989, I wish to make four very quick points relating to the motion moved by Senator Michael Baume that the Senate should take note of the remaining papers tabled by the President this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First, I want to add my support to the remarks made by Senator Michael Baume in his opening comments on these reports; namely, the procedures that are now being adopted in relation to the tabling of these papers. I want to say without elaboration that the points made by Senator Baume in that regard are extremely pertinent and that the manner in which these reports are now being handled represents a significant constraint upon the effectiveness and the efficiency of the Senate in handling them. I trust that these comments and those of Senator Baume will be taken into full consideration by the President and by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> My remaining comments will now relate to the report by the Auditor-General to which Senator Baume directed the bulk of his remarks, which is a response to report 296 of the parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts, entitled Accountability, Independence and Objectivity. That was a most significant report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and by definition, therefore, the comments by the Auditor-General on that report are also likely to be highly significant. I want to quote merely three paragraphs from the foreword to that report. The Auditor-General states:</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the most significant recommendations require decisions by the Government, including decisions on future funding levels. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Audit Office is at a crossroads. It has introduced a variety of changes aimed at increasing productivity significantly and improving its service to the Parliament, the Government, its other clients and the community generally. </PARA>
<PARA> Other changes are now required if it is to sustain this momentum-otherwise it will continue to fall further and further behind because its operational base is insufficient to sustain momentum. </PARA>
<PARA>I think those last words in the foreword to the Auditor-General's report are also contained in paragraph 5.5 of the report, which constitutes part of the Auditor-General's conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA> My third comment arising out of this report is simply to note paragraph 5.4 in chapter 5. I think this paragraph may already have been quoted by Senator Baume, but I regard it of such importance that I think it worth quoting again. The Auditor-General states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's Report indicates bi-partisan support from the Parliament for a substantially strengthened AAO. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the Australian Audit Office. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA>But it is not only the Parliament which needs an effective AAO. Such a body is essential also to provide unbiased assessments to governments, so that the Executive will be better informed in making decisions on its allocation of resources among the many competing programs and activities; and so that the Executive will know more about what its component parts, including government business enterprises and companies, are doing. </PARA>
<PARA>I stress the dichotomy there between the Parliament on the one hand and the Executive on the other. The office of the Auditor-General-and I will come to this as my final point in one moment-is and certainly should be seen as an office responsible to the Parliament. But it is entirely false and, I think, entirely deplorable that under this Government there appears to have grown up the view that, because the Auditor-General's office is a creature-and I do not use that word in any pejorative sense-of the Parliament, in some sense it is an enemy of the Executive. That ought not to be the case. In any case, I pick up the key point made by the Auditor-General that the Executive itself needs the resources and the services of the AAO in order better to carry out its own responsibilities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Baume says, a temporary embarrassment to the Executive may lead to a longer term benefit not merely for the Executive but certainly for the Parliament and the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My final point simply is to take particular note of recommendation 3 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and of the Auditor-General's response to it which are set out on page 36 of the appendix to the report. The recommendation is that `future audit legislation state unequivocally that the Auditor-General is an officer of the Parliament in order to emphasise the Auditor-General's relationship with Parliament'. There is no constitution in the United Kingdom from which these structures are basically derived under the Westminster system. But, certainly, in the unwritten constitution, if you like, that prevails in the United Kingdom, one could say it is a constitutional fundamental that the office of the Auditor-General is an office of the Parliament. To the extent that there is any doubt about that matter in this country, there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that that doubt should certainly be resolved in the manner which has been suggested. I close on that point not because one could not say a great deal more arising from this report and, indeed, the other reports to which Senator Michael Baume has referred in his motion but because we have time constraints upon us. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an important delegation which has an important task to perform. This year's delegation will shortly visit the European parliamentary institutions to seek to ram home and reinforce the messages that have been presented so strongly by delegations from this Parliament in Europe in recent years. There can be no more crucial time than now for these delegations to spread that message. Right now Europe is in the process-particularly in the Common Market area-of becoming a closer, tighter unit. In 1992 there is to be a dramatic reduction in the barriers between members of the European Community. The expansion of the European Community to include countries such as Portugal, Spain and, of course, Greece raises additional questions and problems. It also raises the possibility of additional threats and challenges to Australia. Is this to be a fortress Europe, or is it to be a place where Australia will have greater opportunities because it will be a bigger, better and bouncier market for our goods?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I came back from the visit by this delegation with very little confidence that Australia would substantially benefit from Europe in 1992. A recent private visit to the United Kingdom to discuss this matter with industrialists, bureaucrats and politicians has simply underlined my concerns. While I do not fear the development of a fortress Europe in 1992, I fear that there will be a more introspective Europe, that there will be a greater prospect of European investment finding appropriate niches and greater opportunities within Europe and that the volume left over which can be taken up by countries such as Australia may well be diminished. </PARA>
<PARA> We will be a less attractive home for European investment when countries such as Portugal and Spain join the European Community. I believe that these countries are about to undergo an industrial revolution. Their ancient agricultural practices will be reformed. The rural communities will be urbanised, thus providing a large pool of labour-perhaps cheap and unskilled-which will be available to those entrepreneurs who might prefer to invest in Europe rather than risk investing their money far away from home. Already we have seen evidence of Japanese car manufacturers, for example, wanting to build car plants in Spain. Some of the entrepreneurs I spoke to in Britain talked about increasing their interest and involvement in Portugal where they considered there were great opportunities, particularly for an upgrading and a sophistication of agricultural production which at the moment in so many instances seems to be little more than at a subsistence level in many parts of that country. There is a problem and I can only encourage the current delegation to read the report which we are now debating and to press with great vigour the matters that we have raised and are concerned about with the politicians and bureaucrats they will meet in Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank the people we met in Europe who provided us with great hospitality and immense assistance. In particular, I would like to thank the Italian Government of which we were guests for a week or so. It was most hospitable. One must remember that so many Australians are of Italian descent. There is clearly a strong link between our two countries. I hope our visit underlined, confirmed and assisted the strength of that link. One should also give special thanks to the Australian Ambassador in Brussels, Mr Peter Curtis, and his special assistant, Jean Page, for their help and dedication in ensuring that the delegation had every opportunity to put Australia's case to our European colleagues. We should also thank the many European parliamentarians and officials who gave us a very good hearing. They went out of their way to be hospitable and to devote a considerable amount of time to listening to our complaints and seeking to answer many of them, even though their answers in many instances seemed to me to be inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that it is all very well talking about a richer, more effective, more united, stronger Europe making itself a better market. But has Europe become a better market for Australia since Britain joined the Common Market? The answer is that Australian exports to Europe-when we include Britain-are still suffering as the result of the loss of our special relationship with the United Kingdom. It may well be that that loss will be picked up in the event of Europe not turning into a fortress Europe, being more outward looking and being prepared to undo some of the disgraceful-and I use that word advisedly-agricultural policies which are deliberately aimed at blocking more efficient, more effective Australian exports from entering the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA> I was glad to have the opportunity to address the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on this very matter. I stressed that what Europe was doing was disadvantaging not only Australia but also the Europeans themselves, particularly in terms of employment. The evidence of the adverse employment effects of the current agricultural policies in Europe-conversely, the beneficial macro-economic consequences of a genuine reform of farm support policies-is growing all the time. It points to the fact that the domestic agricultural policies pursued in most Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries have been failures. They have sought to achieve social and other objectives by inappropriate mechanisms in agricultural policy. They impose costs that go well beyond the direct and obvious budgetary costs and beyond the transfers from consumers to subsidised producers. They reduce growth rates and they increase employment. This is a dramatic fact. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the estimates of the unemployment effects are astonishing. For example, a recent study in Germany suggested that agricultural liberalisation could lead to as many as 850,000 extra jobs. Current agricultural support policies have been responsible, according to some estimates, for increasing European Community unemployment by as many as three million. So there is clearly a mutual interest in the Europeans stopping these politically attractive devices they have for blocking our agricultural trade and adopting the same sorts of policies of relaxation of trade barriers that they find so attractive in manufactured goods but so unattractive in primary products, where the political implications are so serious. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to express some concern about the nature of these delegations. There was a debate on the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. In that debate, Mr Mountford, the leader of the Australian delegation, made a speech strongly supporting a recommendation that the United States of America (USA), the United Kingdom (UK) and Singapore consider adopting an urgent timetable for their return to membership of UNESCO. They had withdrawn from UNESCO because that body had become a political ramp using funding, largely from the United States, for the purposes of political propagandising in so many of the developing countries of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, the Opposition has some difficulty with that proposition. I was particularly annoyed that Mr Mountford, in his speech to the Assembly, said that the call for the USA, the UK and Singapore to consider adopting an urgent timetable to return to UNESCO was not simply the Government's policy but also was the Parliament's view. That is simply not so. No delegation leader has the right, in my view, to say that that is the Parliament's view about a matter as contentious as this when it has not been before this chamber. In fact, it is the strong view of many of us in the Opposition that the United States acted quite properly in withdrawing from UNESCO. Until there is clear, unequivocal evidence that the ramps have been corrected-and I must say that the new head of UNESCO was a very impressive person, and I acknowledge that he gave us clear indications of his intention to fix those things up-I do not think it is proper that Australia should be seen as supporting the urgent return of these countries to UNESCO. </PARA>
<PARA> Even worse, when I sought to put the Opposition's view in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, I was gagged and prevented from doing so by a majority vote of the delegation. This was done by the simple procedure of telling me that the head of the delegation was the person who indicated to the President of the Assembly what the Australian speaking list was to be and I would not be on that list, with the result that, if I stood, I would not be recognised by the Chair. That is a disgrace. It was put to that Assembly that it was the view of the Australian Parliament that the US and the UK should urgently consider returning to UNESCO. That is false, and I was prevented from being given the opportunity of stressing that there was a contrary view in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that there is a need for this Parliament to indicate to the leaders of such delegations that they have no right, firstly, to bind the Parliament and, secondly, to censor members of the Opposition who seek to ensure that an honest and proper view is given about a division of opinion in Australia as to the correct course. I was told by the majority of this delegation that it was improper to suggest that there was any view other than a Government view in these matters. In fact, that is not so. This was a parliamentary delegation, not a Government delegation. For members of the Australian Labor Party to ride roughshod, with their normal arrogance, over members of the Opposition in this way is an absolute disgrace. I hope that the President-and I intend to draw this matter to his attention-and the Speaker will ensure that guidelines are brought down to make certain that, if there is an opposite view on a contentious matter, the Opposition will not be censored in this disgraceful and jack-booted way. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from that matter, I wish to commend all those involved with this visit. It was a very worthwhile one both for the members of the delegation and, I hope, for those people to whom we had the opportunity to outline our concerns. I hope that those concerns have been taken on board. There is no doubt that, within the communities themselves, there are specific worries. For example, we had the opportunity of talking to some people in Italy who are deeply concerned about the implications of the pasta decision. Around Europe we were well and truly favourably welcomed and we had the opportunity, which was appropriate indeed in view of the recent fiftieth anniversary of the outbreak of World War II, to visit the war graves in Flanders and to place a wreath at the Menin Gate. I thank the Senate for giving me the opportunity to make this statement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this evening the President of the Senate tabled a letter from the Auditor-General over the signature of the First Assistant Auditor-General, J. S. O'Neill, with regard to the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). Of course, this relates to the ongoing financial saga in this area. I find the letter from the Australian Audit Office (AAO) tabled this evening most concerning, because it relates to the 1989-90 Budget Papers for estimates coming up which include a review of the figures in the ADC annual report of 1987-88. What has been highlighted by this most concerning letter is that a number of statements made in the Estimates papers which have been presented to the Senate for consideration are now said by the Auditor-General, in very plain English and a number of times through the letter, to be incorrect. For example, at page 133 the ADC says that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) requested the Auditor-General to conduct an efficiency audit of the ADC's systems, et cetera, and that the Auditor-General agreed. The Auditor-General states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>That is incorrect. The special audit was an audit of accounts and records and conducted under provisions of the Audit Act different from those concerning efficiency audits. </PARA>
<PARA>There are four instances where these differences of opinion have arisen and the ADC says that the Audit Office significantly widened the scope of its audit. This is countered by the Auditor-General. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>That is incorrect. In accordance with normal auditing practice, the scope of the audit was not restricted at the start of the audit, and AAO made it clear to ADC in November 1988 that the audit would not be confined to Canberra or to projects mentioned in Senate Estimates Committee E in October 1988 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Further, at page 134 the ADC says that the recommendations contained in the special audit report generally had already been implemented. The Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA>That is incorrect. Later work by AAO and by ADC's internal auditors, Price Waterhouse, indicates that the defects in ADC's administration identified in the special audit had not been corrected. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The ADC says that the internal auditors produced two reports in April 1989 which found that the ADC's procedures were adequate. The Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA>That is incorrect. The internal auditors' report dated 3 April 1989 states clearly that ADC's procedures are still unsatisfactory. . .</PARA>
<PARA>I believe it is an unprecedented move by the Auditor-General to write to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives and say, in effect, that the documentation that has been presented for the Senate's consideration of Estimates is totally incorrect; therefore, it is false. Who must accept responsibility for this? It must be sheeted home wholly and solely to the Minister responsible-the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, who we have said over and over again has shown scant regard for the proper administration of his portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the Auditor-General, in an unprecedented move, wrote direct to the President and to the Speaker has highlighted once again total inefficiency, inadequacies and, I would suggest, a major oversight in ministerial control. It is again a matter that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) must have regard to. It is a matter for the Prime Minister to again review Mr Hand's appointment as a Minister of the Crown. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 2 May 1989 Federal Ministers Button, Kerin and Richardson announced that the Australian Federal Government wished to ensure that pulp mills built in Australia be developed using the best available technology and environmental standards, and that provision be made for periodic upgrading of key technology consistent with the best international practices. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) was requested to review relevant technical issues in Sweden, Finland and Canada and to advise the Government on technical and environmental issues. This report, Pulp Mills: Modern Technology and Environmental Protection, is the result of that investigation. It is relevant at this time because of proposals to build pulp mills in Australia, including the one at Wesley Vale and one in the south-west of Western Australia. The power for the proposed mill in the south-west of Western Australia-that is, the Western Australian chip and pulp mill-is likely to come from a proposed new open cut coal mine and proposed new power station which are scheduled to be sited in the beautiful Western Australian national park area of Mount Lesueur. I refer briefly to a leaflet entitled `National Park to Mine to Pulp Mill', which has been put out by the Friends of Lesueur, the Conservation Council and the Australian Conservation Foundation in Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The CSIRO report under debate highlights the environmental problems of the pulp mill, dwelling on the poisonous effects of by-products. It does not say much about the consumption of timber. The proposed Western Australian pulp mill would use 1.15 million tonnes of wood chips per year. Currently, the Western Australian Chip and Pulp Corporation is licensed to export 900,000 tonnes per annum. This is a potential disaster for existing trees and a big boost to the greenhouse effect. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the Australian Democrats' well broadcast concern for a sustainable environment, I would make some comments on the potential toxicity of pulp mill effluent, especially as it affects aquatic life. I quote from page 4 in the opening summary of the report:</PARA>
<PARA>The most environmentally sound, economically achievable way of disposing of effluents is to discharge them into the ocean. Effluents from a number of older mills in the northern hemisphere have created some environmental problems. In considering the key question of the impact of the effluents on the flora and fauna of the receiving waters it is concluded that: A mill, when efficiently operated, will result in no significant short term ecological impact. </PARA>
<PARA>However, on page 14 a description is given of some of the things that happen as a result of chronic toxicity when chlorate and other pulp mill by-products are discharged into water containing living plants and animals. Under the heading `Toxic Effects of Effluent on Aquatic Life', it says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . pollution-induced habitat destruction . . . can gradually destroy whole populations of animals indirectly through the poisoning of plants that provide their food, shelter, nursery or breeding sites. . . . But chronic toxicity remains a concern. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The days are gone when we can simply ignore the long term impact of chemical pollution. </PARA>
<PARA> An interesting section of the report appears on page 53 under the heading `Decision Making Processes'. In Western Australia we are not happy with the decision-making process, because the Government makes all the decisions seemingly on criteria of profitability-that is, to itself and its well-known mates-and enormous efforts are made by citizens to change some decisions, usually without success. I cite the Kwinana petrochemical plant, which is an exception, because there is a very public quarrel going on about that at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> I also refer briefly to the fact that the report dismisses the wood efficient, thermo-mechanical pulping process and also distorts the facts on future needs for unbleached paper. Unbleached paper is the fastest growing section of the paper industry and the demand for it is burgeoning. In fact, in Western Australia Coles supermarkets sold out of their supply of unbleached toilet paper very quickly. I also draw to the attention of the Senate the fact that in Western Australia a firm called Ethical and Recycled Products sells non-kraft chlorine bleached recycled paper and envelopes which are sold at the same price as bleached envelopes. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government opposes the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits Determination Revocation and Tribunal Membership) Amendment Bill 1989. It opposes it in the Senate and if it is carried in the Senate will oppose it in the House of Representatives, where it will be defeated. This Bill deserves to be defeated. As a Bill it is a fraud, a travesty and a sham. I assert that it reflects no credit on the sponsors of it. It reveals a depth of hypocrisy which is mind-boggling and it reveals the Opposition at its most cynical. I assert that this Bill is an unprincipled attempt to grandstand and to chase populist votes with no attention to substance. They are strong words. They are what some people might regard as the common rhetorical flourish of a government. I want to establish them as measured and considered words in this debate and to do so by giving a clear exposition of what the record reveals about this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first thing one must say of this Bill is that it does essentially three things. Termed `A Bill for an Act to amend the National Health Act 1953 to revoke a determination of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal', it is designed to revoke a determination of an independent tribunal made after sitting for 2 1/2 years and after hearing 160 or so submissions and representations, and to do so in a way which calls the democratic process itself into question. Secondly, it proposes to `provide qualified membership of the Tribunal, and for related purposes'. That is its euphemistic description of how it proposes to stack the Tribunal so that the appellants in this case can have their representatives on the Board and bring down the decision they seek. If one were to put it in colloquial terms this Bill takes the whistle from the umpire and overrules him. Then it sacks him. Then, in a move that would make a follower of Tammany Hall blush, it replaces the umpire with representatives of the people who claim to be offended so that then, it would assert, justice can be done. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this type of process, if it were allowed to pass in this Parliament, would attack what is a fundamental foundation of democracy in that the Parliament should not interfere with the role of the judiciary. In this case the people that it is proposed to interfere with are people of judicial standing. They are people who sit impartially on an independent body to make a determination based on the evidence before them. They have done that. Whether or not pharmacists have properly conducted themselves before that inquiry is a matter for people to make observations about. I make this observation about the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. I believe that it has behaved incompetently and not in the best interests of its membership. It has not addressed itself to the issues in the way in which it sought to cooperate with an inquiry about pharmacists' remuneration. </PARA>
<PARA> But that is the problem for pharmacists and for the Guild. It is not a problem for the independent inquiry and it is not a reason why Parliament should interfere with an independent decision. I think that it touches on the very foundation of the separation of powers for this Bill even to be contemplated. It throws up the question: why would anyone want to do that? I am afraid the horrible answer to that question is that some people think there are a few votes in it. The Government is involved in the question of pharmaceutical benefits for the reason that Australian taxpayers contribute massively to the income of pharmacists. Therefore, every Australian taxpayer has a vested interest in knowing that his tax dollar is wisely spent. In 1988-89 Australian taxpayers paid $580m in subsidies to pharmacists. </PARA>
<PARA> The other reason why the Government is involved is that in the past there have been proven examples of abuse and overcharging which all parties in this chamber have accepted. Therefore, there is a role for the Government, given this level of public expenditure for which we have a role in any case and given the track record of this industry, which is a reason for even closer scrutiny. I come to my third reason as to why the Government has an interest in having regulation in this industry properly and independently determined. One of the reasons why there is such an expenditure of public moneys is that the Government needs, in the benevolent and compassionate society that in Australia we aspire to, to ensure that the chronically ill, those who cannot afford it, and the underprivileged in this country have access to medication and drugs which enable them to start back on the road to good health. </PARA>
<PARA> If the cost of drugs is determined on the basis of who can afford to buy them, the country that enables that type of operation to proceed discriminates positively against the poor, the chronically ill and the underprivileged. This country aspires to a more compassionate approach. Because it therefore interferes in the free market of pharmaceutical trade, because it subsidises that trade to the tune of $580m and because this industry has a proven track record of overcharging and maladministration, there is a clear public role. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said that the industry has a clear record of overcharging. What is that record? The record is best picked up if one goes back to September 1980 when the Fraser Government was in office. In September of that year a committee of the House of Representatives reported after it conducted an inquiry into alleged overpayments to pharmacists in which it was alleged that overpayments from the public purse amounted to $253m. This was a committee of the House. It was a committee that involved representatives from all the political parties in the other chamber. It came down with a unanimous report. It reported errors in pharmaceutical subsidies totalling $175m. That was a bipartisan finding. The break-up of how those errors occurred was: $126m in overpayments in the allocation of labour costs; $62m in an analysis of the cost of goods sold; and $47m in updating the structural index. As I said, those overpayments totalled $175m. </PARA>
<PARA> This was a committee involving all parties. All the parties agreed to that report. On the basis of that report, and this question goes to the credibility of the industry when it makes its claims now-I repeat that it found that level of misallocation of public funds-the then Liberal Government in the guise of Mr MacKellar, Fraser's Minister for Health, introduced legislation into the Parliament to put above the political conflict the issue of the setting of pharmaceutical fees. It would be very instructive for honourable senators to read in Hansard the debates surrounding the introduction of the MacKellar Bill to render an independent tribunal in charge of the setting of these fees. Many of the things that are being said out of the mouths of members of the Liberal Party, the National Party and, I am sorry to have to say, the Australian Democrats, in this debate are in direct contradistinction to what was said at the time following the Public Accounts Committee's findings. </PARA>
<PARA> The MacKellar legislation enshrined the status quo. Since coming to power, we have not interfered with it. We have accepted the veracity of the Public Accounts Committee's findings. Indeed, in 1981 the Labor Party supported the MacKellar legislation. The National Party supported it and, in the Senate, Senator Don Chipp made a very direct and informative speech in support of the independence of the setting of these charges. He made a very good speech saying why that was necessary and why it should be fenced off and be beyond the interference of the Parliament. Because Senator Coulter has now joined us in the chamber, I say that in 1981 both Senator Chipp and Senator Mason made quite important speeches-and I ask the Democrats to examine those speeches-in support of the principle which now obtains and which the Bill before the chamber would overturn. It is passing strange to me that the Democrats would contemplate overturning two of their founding fathers' most impressive speeches in this chamber by voting for this Bill tonight. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept the Democrats-style amendment to my remark. What those former senators sought to do at that time is encapsulated in a slogan which I sometimes find offensive when applied to us, but it is one the Democrats made their own. Senator Mason and Senator Chipp in that debate sought `to keep the bastards honest'. The `bastards' at that time were the pharmacists. The Democrats at the time believed that the way to keep them honest was by having an independent tribunal, which we now have, a tribunal made up of representatives of business and economics and chaired by someone nominated by the President of what was then the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Importantly, the Tribunal was to be a layman's court-perhaps I should change my expression to a layperson's court-so that individuals not skilled in legal presentation and legal argument could come before it, make representations and be heard on their merits without recourse to legal form and substance. It was to be a court that would operate on that basis. The Democrats supported it then. The Liberal Party introduced it, the National Party supported it, but this legislation would overturn it. One should ask oneself why. As I have said, the only conclusion we can come to is that it is a blatant chase after a populist vote. </PARA>
<PARA> What would the legislation do if it were carried? It would put pharmacists in charge of determining what they would receive in remuneration because the legislation proposes to stack a three-person bench with two representatives of pharmacists. In a vote, the pharmacists would have a two to one majority. It proposes to set up this chamber as a court of appeal from an independent body. What will we be interfering with next? Shall we decide to invite ourselves into arguments that the High Court might have settled? Is that a proper area for political interference? This is an independent body with judicial status and it remains statutorily independent. This legislation proposes to interfere with its judicial status. It might be that honourable senators would argue that the decision was wrong. It might be that that is the case. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not concede that argument for one minute, but it may also be that on other occasions independent judicial bodies have made decisions which people regard as wrong. Is that a basis for the Parliament to interfere in that process? Would Senator Coulter set himself up as a jury or a special court of appeal on decisions made by the High Court, the Federal Court, the Supreme Courts in the States or the Industrial Relations Commission? If he would, on what basis would he do it in our democratic system and how would he come to that conclusion? Would it be because people complained or because they said they would vote for him if he did? Would it mean that, if the air pilots came in here and said they wanted the Parliament to legislate their salaries, a majority on the other side would do so because a few airline pilots might vote for them?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the interests of constructive and rational debate, I ask honourable senators to pause, wait, examine and think in terms of the importance of what they are doing if they want to vote for this Bill, because it touches directly on the foundations of our democratic system with respect to the separation of powers and the way in which governments should have their hands off the tiller when it comes to the settlement of issues as complex and complicated as this. I remind honourable senators that this independent Tribunal has sat for over 2 1/2 years. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a disgusting slur in the way in which Senator Walters intended to inflict those words, and she should be reprimanded for that. The choice of who chaired this Tribunal rested with the President of the Industrial Relations Commission, President Maddern. If we want to go into the background of people in the arbitration system, we would see that they have all come from one of three areas-government, employers or unions. Justice Maddern made his reputation as an advocate over many years for the employers. Would Senator Walters say that this man now on the Bench properly discharging the weighty responsibilities of being a president, a man regarded in the community by people on all sides with respect, has somehow breached the oath of his commission and has chosen a Labor person to do Labor's business? That is a ridiculous, disgusting allegation and one that is rejected entirely by the Government. Those who have made it should be dealt with accordingly. As I said in Question Time the other day, it is a pity that there is not in the existing Act a provision for contempt. I would guess that Senator Walters would not be game to repeat those words in public if there was, because she would be in contempt of the Tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Now I turn to the subject. This decision has been commonly portrayed by people opposed to it as a Government decision. It is not a Government decision; it is an independent decision. Pharmacists may find the decision not to their taste, but all of us who have been in the work force and at some time have gone through the arbitration process may have found the decisions made by independent arbitrators not to our taste. However, we have worn them and accepted them because those are the rules. This Bill attempts to change the rules, bias the game, and deliver to the appellants the right to decide their futures. That is totally unconscionable. If the precedent were set, workers would be elected to sit directly on the board of the Industrial Relations Commission to make decisions about their own wages; and that is a ridiculous proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The other comment I make is that the Minister for Housing and Aged Care, Mr Peter Staples, made overtures to the Pharmacy Guild of Australia during the course of the hearings and sought to find common ground with it. He made generous offers to get a common front so that the arbitration process would be either unnecessary or related to the margins of the pharmacists' claim. The Pharmacy Guild-I believe incompetently led-rejected those propositions. The Pharmacy Guild tried to sully and put a slur on the independence of the database that the Tribunal used. It did so by calling upon its members not to cooperate in the survey that was being conducted to compile the database. When it believed it had succeeded in not getting sufficient cooperation, it then said that the database was inadequate because an insufficient number of people had responded. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that the database methodology was advised by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. I do not think anyone here wants to sully the reputation of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. It approved the methodology, and at completion said that the methodology was sound. At one stage during the course of the compilation of the database it also said that there were not sufficient samples. Then sufficient samples were taken by telephone in order to get a critical mass of input from which there could be a reasonable extrapolation of results. That is what has occurred. There has been no cooperation from the pharmacists to compile an accurate database-none at all. The database is essential to determine what the pharmacists' rates of remuneration should be. I reject the claim of an inadequate database too. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time that I have left there are many other things that I could say but I conclude my remarks at this juncture by saying that Mr Staples has sought further talks with the Pharmacy Guild to discuss with pharmacists their involvement in the establishment of an essential pharmacy allowance so that remote and isolated communities can be properly served and, if necessary, supported by public subsidies to keep their doors open to render a service in remote areas or areas where there is underservicing. The Minister has sought the Guild's involvement in an inquiry into the restructuring of pharmacies and has suggested that the allowance of $50,000 over three years to help accommodate that restructuring is still on the negotiating table and should be explored, and he has proposed that there be further discussion over the professional practice allowance as well. If the Guild wants to pursue negotiations there are ways on the table in which some of what the Guild sees as problems with the decision can be ameliorated. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I conclude by making those observations in the context of what I regard as a quite fantastic position-in the extraordinary sense of that word-taken in Western Australia by the Guild. I am advised that today it has decided that its pharmacists will charge above the legal limit. They will not just pick up what they believe the decision will take from them but will make a windfall profit as well. It is not a matter of recovering the ground that they argue they are losing; they want to make a profit on top of that. In doing so, they breach the rules of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme itself. The Guild is urging its members to commit a breach of the National Health Act. This illegal act by pharmacists can only penalise people who are chronically ill, who are in need of medication, who cannot afford to pay the higher rates or who are pensioners. This is consistent with the pilots' approach-thumb your nose at society, do not obey the rules, charge what you want, create a free market, and take the public subsidy as well. On last year's figures the public subsidy was $580m. As I said, this is a quite fantastic position taken by the Guild in Western Australia. If this Bill were to pass it would give succour to that type of approach. For that reason, along with all the others I have put, this Bill should be defeated. If it passes here, it will be defeated in the other chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me first of all disabuse the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) in relation to some of the things that he said. He implied in his remarks that, no matter what judgment a tribunal makes or how damaging the results of its deliberations, we should slavishly accept its determinations. I cannot accept that position. In this case it is clear that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal decision is not only wrong but also extremely damaging. Moreover, I point Senator Cook to the Remuneration Tribunal's decisions in relation to parliamentary salaries in which quite clearly for reasons of public popularity the Government has sought to interfere. There is certainly an adequate precedent for the Government to interfere with tribunal decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The figures do not stack up. The determination, as I will show, is totally wrong. It will not succeed in doing what the Government says it hopes to do. Let us begin by accepting that some months ago the Government announced that it wanted to pull $20m to $30m out of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS). That is the basis from which this whole program has proceeded. The result of the determination of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal is that many pharmacists will just close their doors. It may be that we have too many pharmacists, but this is not the way to cause their pharmacies to close and, as I will show, it is not a way by which the Government will be able to reduce the amount that it pays out under the PBS. Unfortunately many pharmacies which close will be those which provide the most needed services such as those in small towns and isolated suburban areas. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true, although Senator Cook tries to interject, that provision is offered for special payment in those cases. It means that those pharmacies will be dependent upon largess and an arbitrary determination of to whom and for how long those extra payments will be made. The present determination, if implemented, will be a severe penalty to pharmacists. It will cause a real reduction of more than 20 per cent-23 per cent or so according to one estimate-in PBS income to pharmacists. Senator Cook has said that in times past pharmacists have made an illegitimate gain from the sale of pharmaceuticals. Even if that were true, does he imply that somehow or other the Government should get back at pharmacists? Is this a reprisal? Surely that is not the way to run a government pharmaceutical benefits scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Cook" NAMEID="RF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not what I implied either.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was certainly the implication of the Minister's remarks. The 20-odd per cent reduction in real income to pharmacists through the PBS is in addition to a 12 per cent real reduction in income which has been suffered by pharmacists over the last 12 months. The 28 August decision of $1.05 per prescription and the total elimination of the mark-up component is the basis of this very substantial reduction in the remuneration of pharmacists under the PBS. The pharmacies which will survive will do so by cutting costs. The only way they can do that is by reducing staff. That will result in a drastic reduction in service to the public and the lowering of standards of pharmacy practice in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Staples was reported today as saying-and again holding this out as a threat-that he will be prepared to open supermarket pharmacies. I do not want to see pharmacies run as they are in South-East Asia, where one goes to the local corner store and buys antibiotics or whatever without any control or supervision and without any professional competence in the provision of those pharmaceuticals. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of concern that the costs of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme are increasing. The Government has said that it anticipates an increase from $1 billion to about $1.2 billion-the American billion: 1.2 thousand million-in just one year. But this piecemeal approach of taking $92m over two years out of the pockets of pharmacists is not the way to go. Let me illustrate that by way of a question which was asked of Senator Cook today in this chamber by a member of his own Party. In relation to the supply of insulin he was asked whether it was likely that pharmacists would not stock insulin on the shelves. Insulin costs some $80, I think. Of that $80, when the fee which the patient pays goes from $11 to $12, the Government will pick up $68. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Cook" NAMEID="RF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The taxpayer picks it up.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All right, the taxpayer will pick it up through the Government. The way in which that $68 is split between the pharmaceutical chemical company which makes the insulin and the pharmacist who dispenses it does not make any difference. The taxpayer will still be picking up $68 of that $80 cost, and that is the essential point in the fallacy that the Government is proposing. The cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is determined by prescriptions written by doctors. It is not determined by the pharmacists who dispense those pharmaceuticals; it is determined by the numbers and kinds of prescriptions which are written and the cost of those prescriptions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has determined which drugs will be put on the PBS and, accordingly, a certain amount of money must be picked up by the Government. The majority goes to the pharmaceutical manufacturing companies and the minority goes to the pharmacists. The Government is seeking to change that split, but this will not alter by one dollar the overall cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. A review of the whole pharmaceutical benefits scheme would be needed to do that. There would need to be a change in the nature of the drugs that are put on the list, an instruction to doctors to change their prescribing habits or a change in the pattern of the use of pharmaceuticals by the community. Those are the things which will change the total cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to the taxpayer via the Government; not the amount that is paid to pharmacists. Presumably, the same number of prescriptions will be dispensed and the same cost will be borne, but drugs will simply be distributed by fewer pharmacies. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, it may be desirable for there to be fewer pharmacies, but that is a different argument and this is not the way to tackle that problem, if it be a problem. Even if we accept that we should reduce the number of pharmacies, surely it might be better to control the number of pharmacists by simply training fewer pharmacists in our universities. It does not make a great deal of sense to put pharmacists through tertiary training in universities or institutes and then have them unemployed at the other end-thrown on the scrap heap. That does not make any sense at all; it is absolutely crazy. This Government has introduced a tertiary fee structure under which a graduate repays those fees to the Government once his income reaches a certain level. But there is no way that people who finish up on the scrap heap because they cannot find employment will be able to repay their tertiary fees. If we really have too many pharmacies, let us look at that problem and address it in other ways. But do not spend tens of thousands of dollars putting students through a tertiary course and then throw them on the scrap heap. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the question of services which pharmacists provide, for which they are not reimbursed and which will be seriously affected as a consequence of what this Government is doing. Many pharmacists provide home delivery services for pensioners and people who cannot get to a pharmacy. The costs of those services are borne by the pharmacists. Pharmacies also employ high school children to make deliveries on pushbikes out of school hours. So these services involve a redistribution of income and part-time employment for a large number of people. If we are really going to reduce the benefits to pharmacists in this way, those services will simply disappear or a lesser service will be provided to the public. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said that it was inappropriate for people who are supporting this legislation to speak in any derogatory or critical way about the data on which this Tribunal decision was based. It may be true that the pharmacists discouraged people from contributing to the survey. But let us have a look at that survey. There are 5,600 pharmacists in Australia and there were 53 replies to the survey. Less than one per cent replied. I have a certain background in statistics and epidemiology and, from my own knowledge, I would say that is a totally inappropriate sample on which to base a decision that affects the other 99-plus per cent of pharmacists, particularly when one recognises--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One should recognise that that data collection was done at a time when substantial changes to the PBS were already in train-changes which had not worked themselves through the PBS system. I think the data is certainly challengeable. Mr Lee, the Director of the Statistical Methods Section, appeared before the Tribunal on 29 April and said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The issue of non-response to the survey is particularly important, as any substantial amount of non-response can throw serious doubts on the validity of the survey results. If non-response appears to be a significant problem-</PARA>
<PARA>and the Minister has admitted that non-response was a significant problem-</PARA>
<PARA>the value of proceeding with the survey should be re-examined closely. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister has said, quite rightly, that there was an additional survey by way of the telephone. That is a very unsatisfactory basis on which to proceed with this sort of determination. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the two basic points. Firstly, we should not slavishly accept a Tribunal decision when that decision is wrong and when it is very damaging. Of course, we have the precedent of the Government itself interfering with a tribunal decision, so it ill behoves the Government to say we should not make some comment upon those decisions. Secondly, the cost of the PBS to the taxpayer is a function of the number and types of prescriptions which are totally determined by the prescribing doctor against the range of drugs which are supplied under the PBS by government decision. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the amount of the reimbursement which goes to the pharmacist-the split between the pharmacist and the pharmaceutical manufacturing company. </PARA>
<PARA> My final point is that the Minister reflected on our honesty and integrity. He clearly reflected on the second part of Senator Puplick's Bill, which seeks to change the composition of the Tribunal. The Australian Democrats agree with Senator Cook on this. We do find that an inappropriate way to proceed and, accordingly, in the committee stage we will seek to separate this Bill into two parts. We will support the first part, namely, the non-acceptance of the Tribunal's determination in this instance, but we will be voting against the second part. So, presumably, on that occasion we will be voting with the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My impression of the debate over the last few weeks on the changes that have now been announced by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal is that there is an enormous amount of confusion, very little light and a great deal of heat in respect of this issue. On checking with my office today I found that the situation is exactly as I had suspected. Members of the Australian Pharmaceutical Guild are not only angry and puzzled by the decisions of the Tribunal, but also feel let down by the Guild. Their level of knowledge and understanding of the procedure and of the decision is very low. Whether this is simply as a result of ineptitude, the difficulties of communication or deliberate misinformation I am not in a position to say. However, instead of holding public meetings, shutting their shops, spending a great deal of time collecting signatures and putting out a lot of very misleading information, the Guild could certainly be using its time a great deal more effectively by informing and instructing its members about the processes and giving them some guidance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Throughout this process the Government has been very happy to negotiate. Prior to the matter going to the Tribunal a series of offers was made to the Guild which, once again, very few of the Guild members were properly informed about. At that stage we were talking about a package that could be taken as a joint submission between the Government and the Guild. This package included a 10 per cent mark-up, a $50,000 amalgamation offer, limited control over new pharmacies, an essential pharmacy allowance, and differential fees for low volume pharmacies. Despite our best efforts, these offers, which would have been highly acceptable to a vast proportion of pharmacists, were rejected. The Tribunal therefore made a decision on the basis of the information before it. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard criticisms about the size of the sample actually studied. That in itself is a misleading criticism. The Tribunal's data base inquiry final report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal has not determined this level of fee as a result of a simple arithmetical exercise-</PARA>
<PARA>as some people would have us believe-</PARA>
<PARA>but has made a judgment based on the evidence in its totality and after having regard to all of the submissions which were made by each of the principal parties, the various associations and bodies and the very many individuals who responded to the advertisements published in the major daily newspapers and circulated in each of the States. </PARA>
<PARA>There were 628 submissions before the inquiry. As a proportion of the total number of pharmacists in Australia, that is 12 per cent-a not insignificant sample of people who were concerned enough to make the effort to make a submission to the Tribunal. This is a considerably wider response from the industry than some would have us believe. I reiterate what was said by the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook): The sample itself was determined on a totally valid basis. I will read this for the benefit of those who simply do not know what the decision was, because for some reason or other they have not taken the trouble to read it. The decision states:</PARA>
<PARA> The total fee will be constituted by the two elements stated earlier and will be separately adjusted on a regular basis in accordance with criteria laid down in this decision. In accordance with the statutory provisions there will also be an annual review . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is not saying that this is the full stop for the end of time. There will be an annual review with a public hearing for the purpose of generally reviewing the fees to ensure they remain fair and reasonable and to hear any submissions and/or to review any material submitted by a party, organisation or interested person relating to any suggested inequities or other relevant consideration. Additional reviews to consider any special circumstances will be considered as appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not the decision of a tribunal which is shutting the door to any submissions from any quarter. In fact, it looks like a very wide open tribunal. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The first element in the new base fee will be an amount of $2.45 which is to cover the cost of labour in supplying an item covered by the NHS. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the national health scheme. Senator Coulter would have us believe that there are to be no savings whatsoever from the changes announced by the Tribunal within the last week or so. Added to this $2.45 is the second element in the new fee concerned with non-labour costs, which has been fixed at $1.05 per item dispensed. The base fee will be reduced from $4.55 to $3.50. This is exactly what the chemists are complaining about-a reduction of $1.05c on every prescription. I would be very surprised if that did not add up to a significant saving for the Government. I am not a mathematical genius but I do know that $3.50 is considerably less than $4.55. If it is not, what is all the fuss about? The new rate represents the maximum amount, which is justified as a matter of equity and fairness having regard to all the available evidence, not just the result of that one survey which Senator Coulter has problems with. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>It represents a significant reduction in pharmacists remuneration . . . should be phased in by making three adjustments each equal to 35 cents per RP item; the first effective on and from 1 October 1989, a second reduction of 35 cents effective on and from 1 May 1990 and the third reduction of 35 cents effective on and from November 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>This has been done on the basis that the studies done by the Tribunal have shown very clearly that over the last decade there has been quite an outstanding increase in the profitability of pharmacists because principally they have been depending quite heavily on the Government mark-up and dispensing fee, though as we know only about 30 per cent of the profits of pharmacies come from their dispensing of pharmaceutical benefits. However, the Commonwealth provided estimates to the Tribunal of gross pharmacy profits over the last decade and compared the movement over the previous five years to the movement in two general indicators. These are commonly used indicators, ones with which we are all familiar. Gross pharmacy profits rose by 85 per cent in those five years, the consumer price index rose by 43 per cent and average weekly earnings rose by 39 per cent. On the basis of these findings, and of all the different positions in those 628 submissions put before the Tribunal, it was decided that the time had come when there should be a cap placed on the dispensing fee and that it should be done in such a way as to leave it open to the industry and to the Government to make further submissions as the situation changed. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the great increase in profits over this time-as we understand it much of that occurred between 1984 and 1986-it seems probable that many people have gone into the industry believing that the level of profits would continue to increase. This has meant that in many cases there are far too many pharmacies. It has been acknowledged by Senator Coulter and many other people that it is an overpopulated industry, to say the least. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we heard some very disturbing news from Western Australia as a result of the meeting held there by pharmacists this afternoon. They shut up shop for a couple of hours and then issued a communique. As far as I know this is unique in the nation-I certainly hope so anyway. This indicates once again what I said earlier-they simply do not understand the decision; they have no idea of how it will be implemented. Honourable senators opposite will be interested to hear that they have decided that a strategy committee will be appointed to quantify reductions to pharmacists caused by the recent decision and that all Western Australian pharmacists commence recouping from the public the Government's subsidy reduction of $1.05 for each pharmaceutical benefits scheme item dispensed according to a timetable. </PARA>
<PARA> I have just read what the Tribunal's plan is-it is not an immediate reduction of $1.05; it is a reduction of $1.05 over the next 15 months, the first reduction of 35c to take place on 1 October. They are not just recouping the loss of that 35c. They are intending to recoup the whole $1.05-a windfall profit-from 1 October from the general public, from 1 November from concession card holders, from 1 December from pensioners and from 1 January from repatriation patients. I find it absolutely unbelievable that such a level of irresponsibility could exist in an industry which purports to be one of providing the community with an essential service and one that the community simply cannot do without. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, having taken this decision and having put themselves out completely on a limb, I am afraid the chemists will look very foolish when eventually-if they ever get around to it-they look closely at the decision that has been made. The chemists will also find that in addition to the determination in relation to the dispensing fee there are other elements which will be of enormous importance to many of them. Where a pharmacy is classified as an essential pharmacy the Tribunal says that there is a convincing argument for a factor to be included in the fee to meet the cost of a replacement pharmacist during a pharmacist's annual leave. Otherwise, it is possible that there may be no pharmaceutical services available in that locality. So essential pharmacies-pharmacies in outer urban areas, pharmacies where there are people with very little mobility, pharmacies in rural areas where there are no others within some distance-will have the capacity to attract an essential fee. There will also be an extra fee for essential pharmacies of $5.40 payable on and from 1 October 1989 to be adjusted in the same manner as is prescribed for other prescriptions. In addition, there will also be a dangerous drug fee. It has been decided that $2 be that initial prescription fee payable on and from 1 October 1989. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XG4">Senator GILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I base my statement on the Tribunal's operations in the past. For eight years we have had Tribunal decisions. The Tribunal in that time has brought down 12 determinations on remuneration of pharmacists under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The Government of the day has not always agreed with the determinations but has always respected and abided by the decisions. That does not mean that decisions are slavishly accepted; it means that the Tribunal, having been set up by Senator Coulter's honoured colleague Senator Chipp and others some years ago, is respected and that its findings are accepted as the findings of those independent people who have made their decisions on the basis of the best information available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I observe that the foresight that was shown by the Government in 1981 and the words of Senator Chipp at that time do not seem to be echoed these days. In fact, I might almost be tempted to say that the shoes left by Senator Chipp have not necessarily been very well filled in the intervening years. There is no doubt whatsoever that the density of pharmacies in some areas has grown to quite ludicrous levels. I am quite stunned to discover that out of roughly 5,600 pharmacies in Australia about 1,300 are in Western Australia. That means that Western Australia is very oversupplied with pharmacies. That may well be the reason for this extraordinary decision this afternoon: the competition is just far too much for many of them. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is very well aware that the pharmaceutical industry represents a very wide range of businesses-businesses which in some cases are more like the American drug store and sell absolutely everything from newspapers to jewellery and perfumery; take the dry cleaning; process photographs; are open 24 hours a day and are doing very nicely indeed. At the other end of the scale we have a country pharmacy which is depended upon by people in a particular town. The fact that it exists is absolutely essential to the well-being of those people. We believe it is essential that the interests of all of these pharmacies are taken into account. In that case, blanket decisions in relation to areas other than dispensing cannot be made. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, the door is open for negotiations with the pharmacists and their representatives. It has always been the case. We are very happy to see arrangements made which secure the existence of central pharmacies. We are not very happy to go on subsidising pharmacies that are struggling along in areas where there are far too many pharmacies and where this subsidy is of no advantage to anybody, let alone the consumers and certainly not to the taxpayers. There is very little point at this stage in trying to overturn the decision of the Tribunal, which was made on the basis of the best information available. In addition to that, the reasons for which the Tribunal was established in 1981 are as valid today as they were then. There is no doubt in my mind that there is no justification whatsoever for these amendments. </PARA>

No effective pharmacy and no action by the Government to maintain reliable and substantial services to the community. Instead we see crisis after crisis in the delivery of good pharmaceutical services.

We are all aware of recent reports that, as a result of current Government plans to slash pharmacists' dispensing fees by 23 per cent, many services provided by these chemists will disappear.

Changes which involve the freezing of gross margins and the redistribution of the current pool of $503m among pharmacies take no account of the impact of operating in a climate of high inflation, high rents, high interest rates and other high overheads, including staff wage rises flowing from the tax-wage trade-off. And who is responsible for those costs? This present Labor Government, no less.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Pharmacies in Kingaroy have drawn my attention to the fact that past governments and Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal decisions have already caused pharmacists to lose about 14 per cent in income over the past 12 months. The Tribunal's statement that the result has not been reached without regard to the consequences which are likely to follow raises serious questions as to just what its intention might be. Perhaps the clue lies in its final recommendation that there should be an inquiry to consider an appropriate restructure of pharmacy outlets. </PARA>

Quite clearly, the likely consequences of the Tribunal's latest attack on pharmacies will be the curtailment of many of the services which pharmacists currently offer and the closure of even more pharmacies, leaving pensioners and families with children without ready access to the professional services of a local pharmacy. We have heard on the news and read in the newspapers talk about having supermarket pharmacies. I do not believe that any of these moves would be in the best interests of the health care of the community, which has an extremely high regard for the front-line role pharmacists play in delivering that care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These are just some of the problems, as I see it. I have received mail from pharmacists. They say: `Why should I accept no mark-up? Do you know any retailer who sells goods at cost? It costs me money to get it on the shelf. It costs me money to keep it there'-with an overdraft, as honourable senators can imagine and, `it costs me money when a doctor orders a part pack and the rest may be wasted. It costs me money when stock goes out of date and has to be thrown out. It costs me money because I cannot return some indate stock, for example, flu vaccines'. These are some of the problems that have been drawn to my attention by pharmacists in our area, and I think that we ought to consider them tonight. Many honourable senators will have received, as I have, hundreds of letters, from pharmacists pleading with us to help them in their predicament. </PARA>
<PARA> While there may be some grounds for rationalisation in terms of the overall number of pharmacies, I am concerned that the Government's current actions may result in closures of pharmacies in areas which can least afford them. Country towns where there is only one pharmacy will be particularly disadvantaged and unfairly penalised. That will happen in a number of small towns in our home area. In fact, I read in the Courier-Mail, our Queensland newspaper, that up to one-third of country pharmacies will be forced to close because of cutbacks proposed to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. This will bring undue medical hardship to the residents of these towns as well as severe financial and social loss to local communities. </PARA>
<PARA> During the past few weeks I thought that surely there must be some action that the Government can take to ensure that so many pharmacies will not be forced to close. However, because of what appears to be a total abrogation by the Government of its responsibilities in this area, we now have to propose such changes as are before us today. An article in the Courier-Mail headed, `Many chemists facing ruin, guild predicts', states:</PARA>
<PARA> Pharmaceutical Society of Australia national director, Dr Beresford Scott, yesterday predicted the PB scheme would show signs of collapse as early as next week. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Scott said he did not accept the tribunal's decision could not be waived. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government says that it cannot be waived. What about the Remuneration Tribunal's decision in relation to the salary of members of parliament? What about its decision in relation to providing stamps for members of the House of Representatives? These are some of the reasons why I cannot see why it is not possible to change the Tribunal's decision. Pharmacists have a vital role to play in the delivery of health care to the community. The value of pharmacists' professional skills in providing counselling aimed at ensuring that patients follow appropriate medication usage regimes cannot be underestimated. </PARA>
<PARA> I can assure all honourable senators that I will work to overcome inequities in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and the changed remuneration package for pharmacists to ensure that the community, wherever it is-in the country, in provincial towns or in the major cities-continues to have ready access to pharmaceuticals and the services of professional pharmacists. That is why I support the Bill that Senator Puplick has introduced into the Senate on behalf of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again we are debating the results of this Government's disastrous health policy. Because of the ridiculous philosophy of this Government we find that the cost of Dr Blewett's health policy has blown out of all proportion and the Government is trying to save money by attacking the pharmacists and forcing them to pay some of this blow-out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the history of the behaviour of this Government towards the pharmacists over the last couple of years. First, the Government demanded that the pharmacists change their payment system to a computer-based system. Pharmacists were under threat of a delay in Government payments if they did not comply. The Government insisted that the pharmacists bear the cost of this new system; otherwise their cash flow would be severely disrupted. Last September the Government removed 53 drugs from the pharmaceutical benefits list and replaced them with cheaper generic drugs. According to the Minister for Housing and Aged Care, Mr Staples, the Government hoped to save $40m over three years. Expensive drugs were allowed to be issued only with special permission. Can the Government pretend that this was in the best interests of the patients? That had nothing to do with it. It was to save money and save money only, and in the process it reduced the pharmacists' incomes once again. Patients, primarily pensioners, were told that the drug they had become used to, which they knew suited them and which they had no reaction to, would no longer be available and they must accept a cheaper drug as a substitute. </PARA>
<PARA> We are all aware that this did not work. The Government was forced to put many of those drugs back on the list. As a result, we had dreadful confusion. Not to be defeated, the Government then doubled the number of drugs allowed to be put on each prescription. Again, this was not for the benefit of the patient or in the interests of good medicine; it was purely and simply to save money, mainly because the Government did not want its precious Medicare philosophy to be acknowledged as a failure. </PARA>
<PARA> We then move to the present situation. The Government has set up the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal to rule on fees payable to pharmacists to supply drugs under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Who are the members of this committee? First, the Chairman is Mr Joseph Riordan, a former Australian Labor Party member for Phillip and Federal Minister for Housing and Construction between 1972 and 1975. When I interjected about this the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) said that this was a dreadful slur on this gentleman. My comment is only that I do not believe he knows a lot about the pharmaceutical profession. There are two other members of the Tribunal: Margaret Jackson, an accountant; and Professor Jeffrey Richardson, an economist. They are hardly a trio of experts in this area even though they have undoubted expertise in other areas. Hence, the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits Determination Revocation and Tribunal Membership) Amendment Bill would add to that Tribunal an additional two members with the necessary knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook has told the Senate that the Tribunal, having made its decision to cut 23 per cent from pharmacy dispensing fees, cannot be ignored: the Government has no option; it must accept the Tribunal's decision. This is a lot of rubbish. Of course the Government has the power to refuse to accept the Tribunal's recommendations. The decision cuts $1.05 from each prescription and abolishes the present 25 per cent mark-up on the wholesale price of drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us see what this is likely to do to Australian pharmacies and to the patients if the Minister persists in this way. Let us look at the No. 1 priority; that is, the best interests of the Australian people's health. What will this do for patients? I can assure the Senate that it will do immeasurable harm to the patients. One thousand pharmacies-and that is a conservative estimate-will close if this decision goes ahead. How can the pharmacies be expected to absorb this cost? The Government expects to save $20m for the remainder of this year. How much will it save in the full year? In all, the Government expects to save $31m from its Budget. Let me quote a member of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Lamb, who is one of the two pharmacists in this Parliament. He is reported to have said that the decision showed that the Tribunal was out of touch. He called for the Government to work out a new system of remuneration. I note that Senator Aulich is not speaking in this debate. An article in the Examiner today describes a phone link conversation that Senator Aulich had with the pharmacists. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Aulich was sympathetic to the current situation and showed a good understanding of the ramifications of the decisions in Northern Tasmanian pharmacies. </PARA>
<PARA> He indicated to us that he would be talking to the Minister for Community Services, Mr Staples, to put to him some of the points raised by us. </PARA>
<PARA>But Senator Aulich does not have the courage to come in here and say those things. He says it to the pharmacists back home, but at no stage will he say those things in the Senate. We will see how Senator Aulich votes on this Bill. Back home he tells the pharmacists that he is in sympathy with them, that they have made valid points, and that he agrees, but we will see how he votes on this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken in this place before about how this Government works. We have seen its methods time and again, particularly those of the Minister for Community Services and Health, Dr Blewett. When his precious Medicare scheme is threatened he immediately attacks a member of the medical profession. Honourable senators will remember the doctor bashing that went on a few years ago when Dr Blewett accused doctors of fraud and overservicing to the tune of $120m. At that stage he was preparing the Australian community for a bit of doctor bashing. He was attempting to convince people that they could not trust their family doctors. He implied that they were all crooks. He then took action to cut doctors' incomes. His grossly inaccurate claims were finally dispelled by the Department of Community Services and Health, which said that those figures were a mistake, that there was no fraud to the tune of $120m, that there was no tag at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Then the pathologists were abused. Their individual incomes-not the taxable incomes but the gross incomes-were leaked to the media. Pathologists, who traditionally employ large numbers of staff, had their gross incomes leaked as though the figures were their take-home pay. The pathologists finally took the Government to court and won their case. But the community had been softened up by Dr Blewett and the Government. They were saying that the pathologists were a lot of rogues. Now the Government is attacking the pharmacists. Let me read some media headlines to the Senate. One reads, `Government may legislate to stop drugs ``rip offs'' '. Another one reads, `How chemists rip you off on prescriptions'. Once again, the Government is softening up members of the community, trying to convince them that they cannot trust their local chemists. They have been accused of ripping off up to $25m by overcharging on prescriptions. Once again, there is nothing to substantiate the claims at all. It is reported that the Department said:</PARA>
<PARA>While we have no hard evidence on the extent of the problem . . . </PARA>

He embarked upon an identical exercise before he marched into Czechoslovakia and before he marched into Poland. It was exactly the same softening up process against the Jews. Hitler used identical methods. He abused various groups of people and then marched in and took action against them, expecting to get the community on side so the people would not object to his abuses. The same method is being used by this Government. We are all used to these methods. But the people are asking: Why is it that it is only under this Government that the doctors and the nurses have been on strike? Now we have the pharmacists on strike. Never before have these professions been on strike until this Government comes in and uses these sorts of methods against them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I listened to Senator Giles tonight. She said, `We've got too many pharmacists. We should close the pharmacies down'. That is her answer. Mr Staples is saying, `We'll put their stock on the supermarket shelves. That is how we'll close them down'. That will not work. The people are awake to the methods being used by this Government. They will not tolerate this any longer. The pharmacists are spreading the word. The people who use their pharmacies are being told what is happening. We heard tonight on the news that hundreds of thousands of pharmacists and their staff are on strike all over Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to spend very long contributing to this debate tonight. But I rise out of a sense of anger and, I think, frustration because of some very ill-considered remarks that were made by the previous speaker, Senator Walters. The remarks are particularly disgraceful this week because of the history of this week. It is this week that people right across the world are remembering the fiftieth anniversary of the start of the Second World War, a war that destroyed many people and almost destroyed a race of people. To draw an analogy between the happenings of 50 years ago and an economic and political dispute between a section of the Australian community and the Government is really scraping the bottom of the barrel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator McGauran is trying to interject. His time here is very limited. I have heard many outrageous comments which unfortunately have come from all sides of the chamber. But I really think that we have hit the pits tonight for the sake of winning a few votes. We have heard an analogy drawn between the happenings in Australia today at a series of meetings and the desecration of a race of people some years ago by one infamous individual. It is unfortunate, indeed pathetic, that the chamber cannot take some action against outrageous, outlandish and scurrilous claims such as those we have just heard. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret having had to intrude in the debate; I have used only two minutes. I hope that the point is made. If we want to score points, we can do it in political and economic debate, but we ought to be a little sensitive to the feelings of those many people, not only Australians, who are hurting very deeply this week because of this anniversary. Senator Panizza can shake his head. If he is prepared to tolerate it from his side of the chamber, he can tolerate the admonition that goes with it from this side of the chamber. The race from which Senator Panizza evolved was intimately involved in that terrible crisis that befell the world. The race that I come from was neutral, but my people suffered as well. I really think it is the pits that we have stooped to those low levels to win a few votes and to satisfy a few constituents. We can do it in other ways. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not detain the Senate for very long, but I want to make a few points regarding country pharmacies. I am sorry that Senator Cook and Senator Giles are not in the chamber, as they remarked on this matter earlier. If the Government succeeds in its attempt to rationalise the number of pharmacies in the cities, people in the cities will then have to drive an extra five or six kilometres to get to a pharmacist. What is more, people in the cities always have access to pharmacies that are open for 24 hours. But, as Senator Walsh will tell us, it is a far different story in the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Cook told us that he was going to keep the country pharmacies open with a subsidy on the number of scripts they dealt with. When Senator Giles was speaking earlier I interjected and said that that would be a temporary measure. That situation will remain while a pharmacist is prepared to stay in a country town. As soon as he is too old or wants to move out, for education or for any other purpose, no-one will take his place. In my home town we have a pharmacist who is over 80 years old and who cannot get anyone to take his place. A qualified pharmacist in the district who is a farmer shows him some mercy by helping him out at weekends to give him a holiday every now and then. That is the only way that we have kept our pharmacist. He would have gone long ago if that were not the position. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the point that a pharmacist who is kept in a town only by a subsidy will never be replaced once he has gone. That is when the trouble will start. The doctor may then be given permission to dispense drugs himself or the stock will be taken over to the hospital and there will be a limit on the hours in which people will be able to get drugs. As Senator Giles or some other honourable senator said, the patent medicines will then go into self-service stores. That may be so but, if that happens, people will lose the free advice that a pharmacist always gives them if they purchase patent medicines from him rather than go to the doctor. More people will then go to the doctor and so this Government will be copping more bills. A pharmacist in a country town does a lot of other things in the paramedical field. He generally runs the ambulance and helps in a number of other areas. If he leaves it will be an even bigger loss to the town. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Giles suggested that we should adopt the American system. As a former matron of a hospital and a former country person, she ought to have another think. Professionalism would be lost if a corner drug store dispensed drugs that, if taken in the wrong quantities, are highly dangerous. Senator Peter Baume, who is a medical practitioner, will tell honourable senators what can happen if mistakes are made and someone dispenses a drug of the wrong strength. Professionalism will go out of the door. I think the Government, and especially Senator Giles, should have another good look at this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I rise to close the debate on the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits Determination Revocation and Tribunal Membership) Amendment Bill 1989. The purpose of this Bill is twofold: firstly, it overturns the decision of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal dated 28 August 1989, which has been the subject of the primary debate tonight; and, secondly, it makes changes in the membership of the Tribunal and the way in which the Tribunal shall conduct its inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to deal very briefly, as I am conscious of the time limitations, with the principal comments made by way of criticism by Senator Cook when he spoke this evening. However, before I do so I place on record my thanks to my colleagues Senator Bjelke-Petersen, Senator Walters and Senator Panizza for their contributions to the debate tonight and, in particular, for their forbearance in keeping their remarks brief, because I know that each of them would have wanted to speak at considerable length. I also thank my colleagues Senator Boswell, Senator Susan Knowles and Senator Watson, who did not participate in the debate this evening despite the fact that they are extremely well informed on this subject and who would have made very powerful and detailed contributions to the debate this evening. I place on record my thanks to them for their forbearance. </PARA>
<PARA> The three points of importance which Senator Cook made and to which I turn are these. Firstly, he says that this Bill is an attack upon the independence of a tribunal and that that is somehow incorrect and illegitimate-the same point made by Mr Staples in a press release which he put out on 30 August, and in which he called for what he described as `respect for the umpire'. In fact, that would carry some weight had it not occurred in the same week that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) went before his Caucus and said to his Caucus, for a purely political purpose, `Let us overturn the decision of the Remuneration Tribunal dealing with parliamentary salaries'-not just a decision which is prospective but a determination which has already been accepted and which people have been notified will come into effect in progressive stages-or were we not to get back into this Parliament, a piece of legislation to alter the remuneration provided for members of the judiciary after they had had their wages and salaries determined by an independent tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of the day there is one far more overriding principle than this question of the independence of tribunals and judiciary determinations-that is, the absolute and overriding principle of the supremacy of the elected Parliament. That is a point from which no derogation can be accepted at the end of the day. No matter what the Tribunal says, this Parliament is supreme. Indeed, if the High Court of Australia says something that this Parliament does not like, the Parliament often legislates to the contrary. We have in the House of Representatives at the moment a piece of legislation seeking to overturn, in effect, a decision of the High Court made in relation to the immunity of Commonwealth instrumentalities. So the supremacy of this Parliament is the overriding and overwhelming issue to be addressed. Senator Cook, in Cabinet and Caucus meetings, undoubtedly did not front the Prime Minister on Monday or Tuesday this week and say, `We must not do anything about interfering with the Remuneration Tribunal determination on salaries because there is perceived to be a greater public interest in taking action'. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing, to which Senator Coulter also alluded, was somehow an indication that changing the membership of the Tribunal was improper. The proposal in the Bill which I have presented is that the Tribunal, instead of consisting of a chairman who shall be a member of the Industrial Relations Commission and two other persons, shall consist of the Chairman, who shall be a member of the Industrial Relations Commission, and two other persons appointed by the Minister from persons who have qualifications, knowledge and experience relevant to the pharmaceutical profession or industry. It does not say that they shall be pharmacists. It does not say that they shall be nominated by the Pharmacy Guild of Australia or by any other particular body. For instance, it might be an economist who has practised long in the area of health economics with a specialist relationship with and knowledge of the pharmaceutical industry. It might be a statistician or an epidemiologist with qualifications relevant to the pharmaceutical industry. It might be a manufacturer of pharmaceuticals. It might be somebody who has been involved in clinical trials on pharmaceuticals. It simply says that they shall be persons who have qualifications, knowledge and experience relevant to the pharmaceutical profession or industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind Senator Cook of a debate that took place earlier today. The Minister was establishing a vocational registration eligibility committee (VREC), and he put on that vocational registration eligibility committee a ministerial nominee and four other persons, two to be nominated by the Australian Medical Association (AMA) and two to be nominated by the Royal Australasian College of General Practitioners (RACGP), the people immediately involved. That was the principle of the body set up by legislation passed today in terms of the VREC and VRAC-vocational registration appeals committee-arrangements that we were talking about earlier today who had those particular qualifications relevant to the job. In fact, they removed representatives of the Australian Medical Council, I think it was, and a body called NSQAC-the National Specialist Qualification Advisory Committee-because they were not regarded as having the qualifications which were better represented by having two AMA and two RACGP representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> I also remind Senator Cook of the other debate we had here some time ago over the determination by the Pathology Services Advisory Committee. He will recall that that committee has five members. The Chairman, as with the Chairman of this particular committee, is a judge of the Industrial Relations Commission. If my memory serves me correctly, it is Mr Justice Munro. The Pathology Services Advisory Committee has to have nominations from the Royal Australian College of Pathologists. So the tribunal that makes the determination about pathology services has as direct representatives nominees of the pathologists.</PARA>
<PARA> This proposal advanced by the Opposition today does not go that far. It does not say that they have to be pharmacists, it does not say that they have to be nominated by the Pharmacy Guild of Australia or any other professional body; simply, that they have to have qualifications which the Minister regards as meeting the determination of being relevant in terms of their knowledge and experience so far as the pharmaceutical profession or industry is concerned. For the life of me I cannot see that that constitutes any improper attempt to put the whistle into somebody's else's mouth, which was basically the analogy that Senator Cook wanted to draw. Frankly, I think that is an unsustainable argument. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point that Senator Cook raised was the question of whether this determination was made on the basis of best available evidence. I would like to canvass that at considerable length, but I will not. If honourable senators look at the speech which my colleague Senator Watson made on 5 September at pages 1010-1017 of the Hansard, they will see the most erudite analysis of the flaws in the Tribunal's determination. Senator Watson analyses in considerable detail the forecasts, the methodology and the relationship between pharmacists' gross income, the cost of pharmaceutical goods, labour costs and the costs which the Government has already imposed on the real income of pharmacists over the course of the last couple of years. He draws attention in that speech to the Government's submission to the Tribunal about the proprietor's notional salary being taken at $15 an hour and how unrealistic that is, and the question of the restructuring of the dispensing fee. For those who want to see a most trenchant analysis of the flawed methodology of the Tribunal, I commend to them a reading of Senator Watson's analysis. </PARA>
<PARA> Regarding the quality of the survey, those who look at the page numbered 9 in the Data Base Inquiry Final Report of 28 August will see the very limited number of responses. For example, in the survey of pharmacies in Victoria, only 6 per cent of pharmacists responded to that particular questionnaire; it was only 32 per cent overall. I make only two other brief comments about the actual nature of the Tribunal report. On the page numbered 10, in a table which deals with the cost of dispensing per prescription, there are some figures which I do not believe add up, particularly the figure of $3.55 which is given as the current salary rate arising from a study of 150 pharmacies. The table gives the updated cost at 1 August 1989 as $3.55, but if one reads through the rest of the Tribunal determination one will see that they in fact work on the basis that it was only $3.50. So its own internal methodology is a bit suspect. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I make is about the question of treating the umpire with proper respect. I draw attention to another page 10 in this report in relation to the Tribunal's comment about the comment made by His Honour Mr Justice Northrop in the case of Pharmacy Guild of Australia and Another v. Riordan and Others. I read two paragraphs only:</PARA>
<PARA> In his decision in Pharmacy Guild of Australia and Anor v. Riordan and Ors, Northrop J. in referring to the Tribunal's duty in determining the Commonwealth price said:</PARA>
<PARA> `The Tribunal is not concerned to determine the remuneration of approved pharmacists'. </PARA>
<PARA>The report then continues with these immortal words:</PARA>
<PARA> This comment by his Honour is not to be taken too literally. </PARA>
<PARA>Frankly, when the Tribunal finds itself in a position of saying that the comment made by His Honour Mr Justice Northrop, a most senior judge of the Federal Court of Australia, is not to be taken too literally, I think one is entitled to wonder precisely what the argument amounts to about having respect for the umpire's decision. I think one is entitled to raise that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I make several points in conclusion. Senator Coulter has raised the question of insulin today. I shall read only one of the many hundreds of telegrams which I have received, this one from a pharmacist in West Hobart:</PARA>
<PARA> Why should I dispense drugs at a loss?</PARA>
<PARA> Insulin is a life-saving drug to those who use it. Under the proposed remuneration package struck, the Government will pay $86.80 cost of drug for the NHS quantity and $4.20 dispensing fee, a total of $91.00. The actual cost of the NHS quantity is $92.01. Net loss on dispensing will be $1.01. </PARA>
<PARA> Why should I dispense the prescription at a loss?</PARA>
<PARA>It is a fair and legitimate question. It is probably the reason that, in the Launceston Examiner of 7 September 1989, Senator Aulich, who had spent some little time running away from his comments about the use of judicial power in industrial disputes, has been quoted in an article. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Aulich was sympathetic to the current situation-</PARA>
<PARA>this is in relation to pharmacists in northern Tasmania-</PARA>
<PARA>and showed a good understanding-</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate: by telephone, at a distance, and certainly not in Tasmania itself-</PARA>
<PARA>of the ramifications of this decision in Northern Tasmanian pharmacies. </PARA>
<PARA> `He indicated to us that he would be talking to the Minister for Community Services, Mr Staples, to put to him some of the points raised by us'. </PARA>
<PARA>All I can say to the pharmacists of northern Tasmania is that they ought to find themselves a senator who is more persuasive with members of his own Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Staples has now said that his intention will be to split the pharmacy profession by moving to isolate the big tough pharmacists, as he describes them, compared with the smaller moderate pharmacists-a tactic of divide and conquer, which this Government believes is the correct way to proceed, whether it happens to be in industrial relations or in the provision of health services. It is perhaps churlish of me to say that I was intrigued by an interview which took place on 3AW when Neil Mitchell interviewed Mr Staples. Mr Mitchell put the question to him:</PARA>
<PARA> Good afternoon, Mr Staples, wouldn't you think it true that one of the main reasons that you are pursuing a vendetta against the pharmacists is that you yourself flunked out of pharmacy school, and failed exam. </PARA>
<PARA>Far be it from me to be churlish and go on with the rest of the interview to demonstrate whether or not that was true. Nevertheless, it does make interesting reading. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that we believe that the case for the disallowance of this determination is overwhelming. I reject Senator Cook's comments in terms of the independence of the umpire, thereby vitiating the right of the Parliament, and the attempt to provide for the qualifications of members of the Tribunal as somehow being illegitimate. I certainly reject his attack upon the pharmacy profession which he characterises as being involved in gross and systematic overcharging and thievery from the public purse. I reject the underlying assumption that the Tribunal decision is well-founded. I refer again to the excellent contribution by Senator Watson on that particular matter. I therefore have great pleasure in commending to the Senate the passage of the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits Determination Revocation and Tribunal Membership) Amendment Bill 1989. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quite happy to accept the amendment to the Bill as proposed by Senator Puplick in his last form of words. I ask the Senate to reject clauses 1 to 3, as amended. I do so not because there is something particularly offensive about clauses 1 and 2-if there is to be a Bill it would reflect the words that are in the technical form as set out in clauses 1 and 2-but because we are opposed to the Bill we reject those as well. The substantive provision on which we wish to focus our remarks is clause 3, which we reject. Clause 3 is headed `Disallowance of PBRT decision' and states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The determination of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal dated 28 August 1989 and made under section 98b of the Principal Act is and shall be of no force or effect. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very serious proposition. If one were to approach this issue with clean hands, an open mind and a reasonable cast of view as to what in all the circumstances is a proper course, one would have to say that what has been put in the debate in here, in the wider public forums and through the media, does not constitute in any way, shape or form a body of reasonable evidence to move this chamber to interference with a decision impartially arrived at by a tribunal properly appointed and bearing the oath and commission of its status after spending 2 1/2 years hearing evidence and receiving over 160 submissions. I put it to the chamber that it should reject these clauses because, even if it were to believe that substantive doubt has been cast, there has been no serious effort to try to see whether the prima facie belief that the Opposition holds is true. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the standard provisions for which this chamber has become famous, and for which the Australian Democrats in particular have made a name for themselves, is to refer any controversial matter to a committee of the Senate so it can inquire into the matter further. No effort has been made by anyone to do that. If there was a degree of seriousness about the belief that the Democrats may hold, I would have expected a proper form and procedure to be engaged in. That has not been done. The Opposition proposes to overturn a decision of a commission that has held a proper inquiry for 2 1/2 years and to do it on the basis of no substantial evidence whatsoever. I would suggest that what has been put forward is hearsay, argument by assertion, and loud and ringing statements by vested interests. Moreover, in my view, they are vested interests that have been misled or incompetently led in the presentation of their case to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. But that is a matter for the membership. They wished to interfere with the proceedings of the Tribunal by trying to wreck the database on which the Tribunal's decisions were to be founded. Although they failed to do that, because I believe the database is sound, they now wish to try to destroy the Tribunal because they choose not to like the decision. </PARA>
<PARA> I cast the minds of honourable senators back to an inquiry of the Public Accounts Committee in 1980. On a bipartisan basis in the House of Representatives, the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party and the National Party found that there had been misappropriation and misuse of public funds to the level of $160m-plus. I remind honourable senator that that Public Accounts Committee investigated allegations that in excess of $250m of public funds had been used inappropriately in pharmacy operations in Australia. Based on the findings the then Liberal Government, with the support of the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats, enacted this very legislation that it is now proposed be set aside. I suggest that, given the history, the charge, the investigation, the acceptance of the allegations to a large extent, bipartisan legislation and the setting up of an impartial tribunal, it requires a better answer than simply coming in here on the basis of hearsay. Many statements were made before people even read the decision. A better answer than that is required. If this Bill were passed it would be a travesty and a reflection on those who voted for the proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> If we measure what has been put, not by beyond reasonable doubt, which is a criminal standard of proof, but by balance of probabilities, which is the civil standard of proof, this chamber, on what it has before it to prompt this debate, fails the test on evidentiary grounds. If we then argue that there ought to be an appropriate procedure, this chamber fails the test on developing an appropriate procedure to get the evidentiary base. On those two bases alone, the proposal cannot and ought not succeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I spent a bit of time in my primary address directing myself to what this proposal does. We have set up an independent tribunal which has functioned under the laws of this country since 1981. To this point it has survived a coalition Government and a Labor Government. It has developed a substantial reputation. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond to that interjection because I have taken the opportunity to read the speeches made in 1981, including Senator Watson's contribution to the debate as to why the Tribunal should be independent. In Senator Watson's contribution to the debate some time in May 1981, as reported in Hansard, he asserted the need for independence and non-interference. He cited a history of where political interference in these decisions in the past had created controversy. Senator Watson has therefore invited me now to ask him why he has changed his mind and why he thinks political expediency should be the basis of decision-making in an area such as this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the honourable senator's interjection was of a different colour. His interjection cast a reflection on the independence of the Tribunal. I have dealt with this question a couple of times, but I need to deal with it again. It seems that the Opposition believes that the independence of the Tribunal can be freely impugned because its Chairman at one stage was a Labor politician. That seems to be the basis of the argument. I have said before that it is a slanderous proposition and I do not in any way resile from that, but I make this point again: the Chairman of the Tribunal did not choose himself, nor was he appointed by this Government. The Chairman of the Tribunal was chosen by the President of the then Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Anyone who impugns the choice of chairman impugns the President of the Commission because he chose someone he thought was appropriately equipped to chair this body. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Watson wants to have resort to what I regard as slander-that is, to cite the previous record-then he might well say that no judge is safe because he may at one time have represented a defendant who was found guilty and therefore he is suspect; he might say that a judge who may at one time have been a member of the Labor Party is suspect. But I go back to this point: if the honourable senator thinks that the history of an individual should be held against him in the exercise of his judicial authority, I point out that the President of the Arbitration Commission was for a long time the leading employers' advocate in this country and was identified more with the honourable senator's side of politics than with ours. I do not in any sense put forward this argument, but the honourable senator invites me to do so by his implication that the President of the Commission is somehow trying to put in a Labor fix. That is a ridiculous and stupid proposition and it should be withdrawn. I hope Senator Watson will find it within himself to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Neither the evidentiary nor the procedural base exists. The procedural base exists only in the figment of the imagination of those opposite because they have a convenient majority in this chamber at the moment. One can speculate about why there is a convenient majority-perhaps because there are grubby votes in it; because there is a public outcry; because there is disaffection; and because pharmacists are embarking upon a campaign to assert themselves over their consumers in a way which leaves open questions of their duty to their consumers and their professional ethics. Nonetheless, they are conducting that campaign. Thus it is that on that very seamy, very suspect political basis we have a unity of view in the Opposition. There is neither the evidence nor the procedure to support it. The procedures adopted by the Opposition parties when in government are the procedures we have observed and they should be followed. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I conclude, I make one other comment. In the debate in this chamber and the wider public debate there has been a fudging of a very important distinction. On the news tonight, I saw people protesting against the Government's decision, as they termed it, through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. The Government has not made a decision; the Government is bound by the decision of an independent, judicially appointed body. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make only two points because we are supporting these clauses and I think we can dispense with them quite quickly. Earlier, Senator Puplick read out figures in relation to the costs of dispensing particular drugs and the remuneration to the pharmacist for dispensing them. He showed that the costs were greater than the remuneration. The pharmacist had posed the question: `Why should I dispense an agent if it is going to cost me more to dispense it than not to dispense it?'. Senator Cook asked for evidence. That is one fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point I make, and I link it with the first, was made by Senator Giles. She totally demolished the Government's case when she said that, in cases where pharmacies were essential, the Government would make an extra payment. It follows automatically from that remark that all those pharmacies that do not get the extra payment will go to the wall. It follows absolutely from that remark that those pharmacies that are regarded as essential will get an extra payment. If they do not need an extra payment, why is the Government giving it to them? Those pharmacies that do not get an extra payment will go to the wall. The Government will determine through that mechanism which pharmacies will go to the wall or simply continue to sell stockings and so forth. Perhaps they will take the American path and sell ice-creams and many other things. That is the evidence, and on that evidence alone we support clause 3. We believe the determination should be overthrown. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are not prepared to support these clauses. For reasons which I indicated at the second reading stage of this debate, we do not believe that what the Opposition has proposed is appropriate. Honourable senators will be aware that I have introduced a private member's Bill which suggests an alternative course to this.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government opposes the adoption of clauses 4 and 5. The most obnoxious of the two clauses is clause 4 regarding Tribunal membership. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 4. Subsection 98a (2) of the Principal Act is amended by omitting paragraph (b) and substituting the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(b) 2 additional members, appointed by the Minister from persons who have qualifications, knowledge and experience relevant to the pharmaceutical profession or industry.''. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have said, this is the more obnoxious of the two provisions. However, clause 5 introduces, for want of a better term, a note of hilarity into the debate by saying something totally meaningless. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(2a) In an inquiry under subsection (1) the Tribunal shall have regard to the need to ensure that variations in the Commonwealth price of any pharmaceutical benefits have the effect of facilitating the efficient and effective provision of national health care services.''. </PARA>
<PARA>That element is considered in any judgment anyway, but it is in the mind of the beholder what an efficient national health care service is. This clause is introduced simply because outrageous, unsubstantiated, unproven and untested allegations are being made about what the effect of the current Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal's decision will be upon the delivery of pharma- ceuticals across the range. Not only are those allegations unproven, but they omit to acknowledge the fact that the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) has embarked on a series of discussions with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia about such matters as the professional allowance and-I cannot recall its precise term-the isolation allowance. It is an allowance which would be provided by the Government to ensure that isolated pharmacies are kept open to serve areas on the ground of geographical need or that they are underserviced. Clause 5 suggests that the Government is not mindful of the need to provide a spread of services based on regions and meeting need. Indeed, the Government has been prepared to put its money where its mouth is in offering subsidies to maintain that spread of service and meet those needs. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 5 suggests that the obverse is true and that, somehow or other, the Tribunal should be saddled with making all of these decisions without the necessary access to the public purse to guarantee that the effect of those decisions will be real. Since, according to the 1988-89 Budget, the Government has put $580m into this proposal as subsidies for pharmacists, I think it ought to be acknowledged as having a huge stake in delivering the services that are required. I think, therefore, that this is an obsolete and unnecessary provision. But, as I said, it is not the more objectionable of the two. </PARA>
<PARA> The more objectionable is the one in which the Tribunal is fixed to bring about the decision one wants. I welcome the Australian Democrats to the fold on this aspect, because I understand that Senator Coulter has indicated that they will be supporting the Government's position on this. Indeed, so did Don Chipp when he spoke in the debate in 1981. In 1981 Senators Chipp and Mason, both speaking on behalf of the Australian Democrats, supported-on a Bill introduced into this chamber by Senator Messner, as the Minister representing the then Minister for Health, Mr MacKellar-the provision that the Tribunal panel be constituted in its present way, and that it have regard to economic and accounting principles. This provision has been down-played in the addresses in support of it by the Opposition. It has been suggested that any range of people with a passing knowledge or whiff of experience of pharmaceuticals might qualify in the eye of the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is true, but we will have to move suspension of Standing Orders and do all sorts of things if you want a vote. We will have to move it tonight. I am not trying to interrupt you, Minister, but we have got until 10.30. I am alerting you to the fact that we can negative the adjournment question and carry on into the night if that is your wish.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us see how the debate unfolds. This amendment impugns the reputation of two of the members of the Tribunal who have sat on the hearings thus far. It is a direct assertion, by its very existence, that those people did not bring to the evidence and to the 2 1/2 years of hearings the scrutiny that was necessary to make a sound judgment. Therefore, it is an inappropriate provision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nonetheless, it has been brought forward because of the public outcry of which I spoke earlier; a public outcry which seemingly has startled the horses in the Opposition to chase votes; a public outcry which is based on prejudice and bigotry. There is a sense that the pharmacists are entitled to what they want irrespective of the determination of an independent Tribunal. This proposal fixes the Tribunal in a way in which maybe the appellant can obtain what he thinks is justice, without necessarily weighting the Tribunal in a proper, balanced way in order to have the breadth of experience necessary to make objective judgments about what the level of pharmaceutical payments should be. For those reasons, and in recognition of the support we have from the Australian Democrats, I oppose these two clauses. </PARA>

This afternoon during another debate I used some fairly direct language in reference to members of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. I do not resile one iota from what I said.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Stone wants to defend the Australian federation of air pirates, he can go ahead; he is welcome to do it. The pilots have been criticised by the most extraordinary array of leading lights in our community including, of course, very recently the President of the Liberal Party of Australia, John Elliott, who would not be described as a bleeding heart leftie. Of course, John Elliott tipped a great bucket on the centralised wage fixing system at the same time. I quote what he said about the pilots in an interview on The World Today on Monday, 4 September:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am no supporter of the pilots. I've checked the numbers out. The pilots on our corporate aircraft that I fly, fly nearly twice as many hours as TAA and Ansett pilots and I reckon they sit around too much. It's just that the planes are not flying. The pilots in the United States on domestic airlines fly 2 1/2 times the hours of the pilots in Australia. So there's something wrong. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Maguire is quite right-it is happening. People are being educated in terms of what formerly has been an area that very few people knew about; that is, the salaries and conditions of Australian pilots. I know personally of former Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines pilots who are now very busily flying for charter companies. They have broken their own strike. This is happening not only in the Northern Territory but right around Australia. I have also recently been told of pilots who hold legal qualifications and actually run thriving legal practices as well as flying aircraft.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other day a person I know told me about an Ansett pilot who runs a very thriving bobcat hire business. Before the air pilots dispute started this fellow was always intrigued that this Ansett pilot could make $80,000 a year from operating a bobcat. He could not work out how this pilot, who had told him that he operated a bobcat himself, could possibly run a $80,000 a year bobcat hire company while flying an Ansett jet. Since all of the information has come out about the pilots' working conditions, and since he now knows that the pilot works only three days out of seven for the company that pays him, he knows perfectly well how he makes $80,000 a year out of a bobcat hiring business. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I am provoked beyond endurance I will carry on for half an hour. I rose tonight to tell a story about a small group of young Australians who have been affected by the air pilots dispute and who were here in Parliament House yesterday. Tonight I will hand out some brickbats and some bouquets. The brickbats are certainly for the airline pilots of Australia. Late last year a group of schoolchildren from Berry Springs School in the Northern Territory-not the upper end of town I can assure you, Mr Acting Deputy President-planned a trip to Canberra and the snow. An entire class of primary school children has been fundraising for that trip for the whole of this year. I am sure many honourable senators know that it is a very painful job raising money for that kind of excursion for kids whose parents simply cannot afford, out of their own pockets, to send them off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been actively engaged in assisting the children in that fundraising. I went out to the school and told them what they would find down here. Not surprisingly, not only was the fundraising part of their entire school year but also the trip to Canberra was built into the class curriculum for the whole year as an educational and learning exercise. And a very excited bunch of kids they were. When I went out to the school a couple of weeks ago, before the strike started, to plan the final part of the trip, all the kids were in the classroom armed with their maps of Canberra and Parliament House. I handed out the worksheets that had been sent to me from the Education Office in this place and we had a session on Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not telling this as some sort of bleeding heart story that I have dug up. It happens to be the cold hard truth. At three o'clock when I had finished with these kids the principal of the school said, `Come outside'. The buses were lined up outside to take the kids away. There was one kid-obviously I am not going to name him-climbing onto the bus with a green plastic garbage bag clutched to his chest with a grin on his face like a Cheshire cat. The principal said, `I want to take you outside and to introduce you to this kid. We have just told him today that he will go on the trip. We are fully funding him because his parents are pensioners and cannot send him and he has just been into St Vincent de Paul to get his winter clothes'. If honourable senators had seen this kid they would have thought that he had just come from Marks and Spencer. I shook hands with him and he said, `I am going on the trip'. I said, `Yes, that is terrific'. He said, `I have got all of these clothes-jumpers and things-for nothing'. I said, `That's great'. </PARA>
<PARA> A few days later the pilots went on strike. This was calamity for this small group of kids. They had been raising money for the entire year. The entire trip was supposed to last only a week, flying each way. Then there was a problem. Had the kids not come on the trip they would have had to pay out almost $5,000 in cancellation fees which the operators probably not unreasonably would not have refunded. The kids had been booked to be provided with ski gear, lessons and motel accommodation, the fees for which the operators were not prepared to waive. Not only would the planning and the fundraising of an entire year for these kids have been ruined but also they would have had to shell out $5,000 of that hard won money for a trip that they would not have gone on. </PARA>
<PARA> A decision was made, very reluctantly under the circumstances, to come by bus instead. It turned out to be a horror trip. I was hoping that they would arrive here at Parliament House saying, `We had a great time on the bus; it was wonderful and we had a terrific time'. In fact, they had a miserable time as was demonstrated when they arrived here yesterday and as Senator Tambling will attest. He was kind enough to help me entertain them, along with Senator McMullan. I am grateful to both honourable senators for doing that. </PARA>
<PARA> This is what happened: because there is so much pressure being placed on the bus companies because of the airline pilots strike, these kids were kept on that bus for all but one hour-50 minutes to be exact-between Darwin and Alice Springs; that is a journey of 1,000 miles. The bus was not even allowed to pull up so the kids could have something to eat. It had one hour off the road between Alice Springs and Adelaide: that is a second journey of 1,000 miles. So the kids had two hours out of the bus in a trip of 2,000 miles. They spent 3 days and 3 nights on the bus. They arrived here like zombies yesterday morning. The teacher who accompanied them said, `We have to come to Parliament House because our trip has been so totally ruined that we cannot fit everything in unless we do something today'. I said to her, `Look, I will tell you what we will do. Let the kids sleep for half a day. Come over to Parliament House at one o'clock. Senator Tambling and Senator McMullan have offered to help. We will turn it on for them. We will put on a special afternoon tea for them. We will try to make their visit reasonable'. </PARA>
<PARA> The kids arrived here at one o'clock and I took them up to my room. I wish I had had a camera. Thinking about it, I said to one of the journalists tonight, `I should have gone up to the press gallery and got a photographer, brought him down and had him take a picture of the scene in my office'. I left the kids in my office for 10 minutes to make sure that the rest of the visit was organised. When I came back there were 22 bodies lying around my room. It was an incredible sight: 22 kids lying fast asleep on the floor of my office. We woke them up. We took them up to one of the committee rooms and they went to sleep having afternoon tea. Kids were sitting around the walls of the room going to sleep. We took them around Parliament House. At four o'clock yesterday afternoon we were due to walk down the hill to look at the old Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA> In handing out bouquets I want to sincerely thank the officers of the Parliamentary Education Office for the things they did for the kids yesterday. At 4 o'clock we called it off. I said to the teachers, `This is just cruel to these kids. I am sorry about this but there is nothing we can do. The kids are dead on their feet. Forget about old Parliament House'. So we cancelled it. I have to give some thanks to someone else tonight, and that is the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Hawke. I know that Opposition members will not like hearing this but I have to tell them. </PARA>
<PARA> As soon as the kids arrived here, tired as they were, every one of them said, `Are we going to see Bob Hawke? Are we going to see Bob Hawke?'. Their faces were long enough and I said, `No, you will not be able to see Bob Hawke'. Their faces dropped three feet. They said, `We came all the way down here to see Bob Hawke'. I thought: `Well, why not give it a go. He can only tell me to go and jump in the creek'. So I went over to the Prime Minister's office and I pleaded the case. Busy as he is, the Prime Minister agreed to see all of these kids at a quarter to two on Monday afternoon. I want to express my thanks to him for doing that. The best part of the trip so far has been when I was able to tell these kids yesterday afternoon that Bob Hawke was going to see them on Monday afternoon in his office. It was like giving them a shot of adrenalin. </PARA>
<PARA> I went over to the National Capital Village tonight to tell the teachers that I was going to tell this story in the Senate tonight. This is just one small group of Australians that have been profoundly mucked around by the pilots strike and have had what would have been an exciting, interesting and long-planned trip almost totally ruined by this dispute. The teachers asked me to express their thanks to the owner and operator of the National Capital Village apartments, Tom Shanahan, who, the teachers told me tonight, has gone absolutely overboard, far and away beyond the normal services that he would have provided for his guests, to make things easier for these kids and to give them a good time. He has laid on free bus tours for them. The service they have got over there is fantastic. It really has made up a lot for some of the bad parts of the trip. So I want to express my thanks publicly to Tom Shanahan and to the staff at his motel for helping these kids in the way in which they have. I also want to thank the Prime Minister for agreeing to have a special session with these kids in his office at a quarter to two on Monday afternoon when I bring them over here. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason I have raised this matter tonight is to draw attention to the inconvenience that has occurred because of the pilots dispute. These kids had an absolutely miserable trip down to Canberra. The length of the trip has been doubled from one week to two weeks because of the bus trip. Of course, if the pilots strike is not resolved, after a bare weekend in the snow, after this three days and nights on the bus, the return journey will be just as bad. The teachers told me of the travelling arrangements on the bus. The group arrived in Alice Springs four and a half hours ahead of schedule and it arrived in Adelaide five and a half hours ahead of schedule. That is the time that the group would normally have spent off the bus at the various stops. This group comprises 10-year-old and 12-year-old primary school kids. The group spent only two hours off a bus in a 3,000 mile trip-three days and three nights. For the three nights they were on the bus half the kids slept across the seats; the other half slept on the floor of the bus under the seat so that they could stretch out. They swapped around the second night; the kids on the floor slept on the seats and the kids on the seats slept on the floor. So they had a great trip. I raise this matter in the Senate tonight to draw attention to the fact that after they come back from the snow on Sunday night, if the pilots dispute is not resolved, these kids are faced with the prospect of three days and three nights going back home on the bus next week, which is not a prospect they are particularly excited about. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say to the Australian Federation of Air Pilots that I would like to see as many of its members sign those contracts that have been offered to them by Ansett and Australian Airlines, to go back to work to the already well paid jobs that they do, to go back to the centralised wage fixing system that operates and can operate to their benefit, to take the pay increases on top of the salaries that they are already getting and that will be offered by that system, to put the Australian economy back to work and to stop inconveniencing their fellow Australians to the extent to which they are. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My apologies to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, for not directing my comments through the Chair. The question that was being asked of me by Senator Collins was whether a distinction could be drawn in the responsibilities of Mr Hawke as the President of the ACTU and Mr Hawke as the Prime Minister. The answer is quite simple: both positions require responsible judgments made on behalf of all Australians with due consideration for Australia's economy. If the pilot were worth a 27 per cent increase then, I find it in stark contradiction to the new up-beat macho man we presently have living in the Lodge, who suddenly decides that his primary object in life, immediately prior to the election, is to crush the pilots. It was fine then, but it is not fine now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am only responding to Senator Collins's invitation to find somebody who has sympathy for the pilots. I do not have sympathy for their bid. Nobody that I know of on my side of politics has any sympathy for their bid. It is interesting to find beating in the soul of the Prime Minister of Australia a man who previously is on the record as supporting this sort of ambit claim first time around. Mr Hawke criticised Mr Charlie Jones, who had the audacity or the temerity, one might say, to suggest that 27 per cent was too much in 1974, and for not allowing the uninhibited processes of collective negotiations to operate when this had been part of the Labor Party's platform in both the 1972 and the 1974 polls. Mr Charlie Jones, finally in frustration, and ultimately I suspect in rage when he could no longer deal with this leader of the ACTU, said, `If I have to deal with people like you, Mr Hawke, I will sell the airline'. Mr Hawke's comment simply was that that did not seem an appropriate response to this claim of 27 per cent, which amounted to blackmail. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply conclude by saying: at least we know that there is one person who is on the public record in this Parliament supporting claims of 27 per cent, and that is the Prime Minister of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise two matters of major concern tonight affecting very large sections of the Australian community, particularly ethnic groups and some elements of the Jewish community and the Muslim community, and certainly many people of Lebanese descent. The first matter I want to raise, like the second, relates to the blatant political activities of the Australian Labor Party involving a disgraceful misuse of the positions of members of the Labor Party to bring about, for political purposes, a quite improper end. The first matter relates to a letter to the Hon. J. Johnson, the President of the Legislative Council of New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Johnno Johnson, of 19 Eastmore Place, Maroubra, New South Wales, 2035. It is from the office of the Mayor in the Council Chambers of Mascot, 2020, and it is headed with the Council's crest. It is dated 4 July 1989 and the reference is RH:JA. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Dear Johnno,</PARA>
<PARA> A number of Kingsford-Smith pre-selection voters have now contacted me and related telephone conversations had with you shortly before the ballot. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, the ballot for preselection for the Federal seat of Kingsford-Smith, soon to be vacated by the present Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. Lionel Bowen. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Some of those even admitted not voting for me, after they had promised to do so, following your conversation with them. </PARA>
<PARA> Each of those persons conveyed to me your urging to vote for the ``Christian person'' and the ``good catholic'', being a suitable person to be in the Federal Parliament. Each of those persons advised me that the view you conveyed was that Jews were not suitable parliamentary material. Two couples in your branch said you were not so subtle telling them they should not vote for the ``Jew Boy from Botany''. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst you can expect quite a bit of criticism, fair or unfair, during a pre-selection campaign (and Brereton's people did their fair share). I take extreme offence at your method of seeking support for your favoured candidate. Let me tell you, this ``Jew Boy'' had most of his family murdered during the Holocaust and has a mother who still bears the scars of her years in Concentration Camps-their sole crime being that they were Jewish. </PARA>
<PARA> Jews are all right if they donate money to the Labor Party, but how dare they try to get into Parliament. I felt physically ill when invited to your reception for Syd Einfeld, organised by the Jewish Board of Deputies. I could not attend and play any part in your gross hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA> This ``Jew Boy'' considers if a person like you, with the anti-semitic views you espouse, can rise to the high office as the President of the Legislative Council within the Labor Party, then there is something very wrong with our Party. </PARA>
<PARA> This ``Jew Boy'' is going to stay involved in the political process at whatever level, and will fight to ensure that, never again, will there be an attempt by anyone to persuade rank and file numbers by the reprehensible views that have been espoused. In my opinion, millions of people did not die 45 years ago in vain and I propose to fight to ensure they did not. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. That is the first matter relating to an official of the Labor Party in a high position, a position of power, misusing that position for political purposes. Let me now tell the Senate about a meeting that took place yesterday in the office of the Speaker of this Parliament, Mr Leo McLeay. I am told on very good authority that the meeting was attended by some Labor heavyweights including Mr Keating and Mr Punch. That meeting was also attended by Imam Al Hilaly and several of his supporters. Imam Al Hilaly at the time had an application before the Minister for Immigration, Senator Robert Ray, for permanent residence. As I understand it, that meeting was held to enable those who attended to seek to influence the Minister in his decision. Arising out of that meeting, I was advised early this morning that Messrs Keating, Punch and McLeay have proposed that the Minister grant permanent resident status to the imam's wife and temporary status to the imam. I was, therefore, not surprised when, at Question Time, the Minister made the most extraordinary announcement in this area that I have heard for many years, in which-I will deal with it in a minute-he basically granted an additional temporary status to the imam. That is an incredible decision which is without precedent to my knowledge, allowing him, in other words, to have stayed for eight years on continuing temporary entry permits. These permits have been continually renewed in extraordinary circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second part of the proposition about which I was told this morning is that the Minister grant permanent resident status to the imam's wife. So I was not surprised to see in the Minister's statement that consideration of the permanent resident status of the imam's wife and two children born outside Australia-two of his four children-would take place shortly. If the Labor Party wants to continue to play heavy politics with immigration, I suppose one can say that it is continuing a very strong tradition. We all know how Mr Hurford ordered that this man be deported in 1986 following the imam's breaking of an undertaking to leave. But when Mr Hurford was replaced by Mr Young, the Labor Party magically found reasons why this man, who Mr Hurford discovered was not a fit and proper person to be a permanent resident, should suddenly become a fit and proper person to be a permanent resident. </PARA>
<PARA> Immediately before the last Federal election, in July 1987 we had the extraordinary situation of the imam's visa being magically extended yet again by this Government. There was a great big thankyou dinner. I heard tonight from Senator Collins that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has time to do lots of interesting things, such as meeting school children. He had enough time to attend the great thankyou dinner held by this group along with an incredible galaxy of what the Labor Party would prefer to call stars-I tend to look upon them more as comets-at which the supporters of Imam Al Hilaly expressed their gratitude. No doubt those of them who were enrolled also expressed their gratitude at the polls. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then the imam has been here almost on probation, if you like. He was warned at that time. Certainly Mr Hurford left no doubts in anyone's mind about his view of the imam. But from then on the imam had to behave. He had to ensure that he made no divisive statements; that he would accept the clear and bipartisan political views in Australia, that in a multicultural society one should not seek to be divisive. We all know that the imam has continually disregarded-not just on a one-off occasion-that admonition. We know that even despite the standover tactics employed by some of his supporters and the strong-arming to silence the imam's opponents, there is a large collection of people who have been prepared to object to his presence in Australia, particularly people from the Muslim community. It is not correct to suggest that this is simply an anti-Muslim pro-Jewish plot to get rid of this man. The submission to the Minister from his own Department--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Robert Ray" NAMEID="UI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The draft.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The draft submission to the Minister from his own Department lists quite a few groups which have, as recently as May and June of this year, expressed opposition to the imam's being here. There are some, it is true, written and verbal representations, from those people who want him to stay; but there appear to be very few that are remarkably recent relative to those that are very old, going back to 1982. I am very disappointed to see the names of some people on that list. I will not go further than that, except to say that I cannot understand how anyone taking an objective view of this matter could do anything other than establish that the facts reveal that this man has been divisive while he was on probation. What is he going to be like if he receives permanent residence and there are no sanctions available? What sort of power will a man like this exercise when he has already shown an arrogant disregard for the rules while he was on probation?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I stress to the Minister that if he is concerned that allegations of standover tactics on the part of the imam's supporters are baseless, he might try a little harder to find the facts than his Department appears to have tried. I am not saying that the imam necessarily encouraged some of the thuggish activities on the part of some of his supporters, but I am saying that some of the stand-over tactics and thuggery by some of his supporters are simply not acceptable in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister might well say, `But I have not granted him permanent residence yet. All I have done is given him a 12-month temporary entry permit in order to test the bona fides of the imam's statements that he is now in favour of a multicultural society and that he does not think one should say naughty or divisive things'. Except for the fact that it is moderately inappropriate, it is some sort of conversion on the road to Damascus. </PARA>

The Minister will remember that the New South Wales Ethnic Affairs Commission suggested a retraction and an apology. There is no apology here. There is no intention of apologising, as the Minister well knows. This is a retraction for convenience, because he knew darned well that if this retraction did not take place there would be no temporary entry visa and certainly there would be no permanent residency.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. These representations, made to this group yesterday, certainly took place. The people were photographed by the Special Broadcasting Service coming out of Mr McLeay's room. Perhaps they came down to discuss something else such as the coming of spring or where the road to Damascus really is. I know what happened at that meeting. I know what that meeting was all about. The Minister should not pretend that people do not know what is going on. I say to the Minister that his statement on the decision of Imam Al Hilaly is absolutely incredible on the evidence. The Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Three key objections are raised as to his suitability for permanent residence:</PARA>
<PARA> 1) That he is a divisive influence on the Lebanese community of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister's response was:</PARA>
<PARA> There is some evidence to support the first contention . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There is only some evidence, but at least it is supporting. I suppose that we could call that strike one. There is certainly no attempt to brush aside that evidence because it is so transparently true. The second matter was:</PARA>
<PARA> 2) That on 18 September 1988 he was guilty of a racist and inflammatory attack on Jews. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister's response was:</PARA>
<PARA> There is . . . overwhelming evidence to support the second contention. </PARA>
<PARA>The third question is a double-barrelled question:</PARA>
<PARA> 3) That he is closely associated with, or is a puppet of, the Libyan regime. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators should notice the way those two quite different propositions are lumped together. What curious integrity prompts someone to do that, because they are different? What does the Government do? It demolishes that aunt sally by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> There is . . . insubstantial evidence to support the third contention. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister knows perfectly well that there is overwhelming evidence to establish that the imam is closely associated with the Libyan regime. It is false, it is misleading of this Parliament and it is a disgrace for this Minister to pretend that there is insubstantial evidence to support the fact that he is closely associated with the Libyan regime. I will read the evidence. It is in the draft submission to the Minister, this Minister who says it does not exist and that it is insubstantial. I wish to quote from paragraph 61 of the draft that I have that the Minister denigrates by saying it was stolen out of a letterbox. He has not denied the facts, but he says that it was stolen out of a letterbox. I can assure the Minister that I did not steal it out of any letterbox. But the Minister, by attempting to denigrate the facts, because they do not happen to suit him, by disregarding this document and saying that it was stolen out of a letterbox, is attempting a pathetic cover-up. In this submission the Department says to the Minister:</PARA>
<PARA> There is evidence indicating that the Imam Hilaly's presence in Australia has the support of the Government of Libya or its agents. That Government has contributed not insubstantial sums to support the organizations which fund, inter alia, the Imam's expenses. Such expenses include the legal expenses for the Federal Court appeal against the Government's decision of 1986 not to grant Imam Hilaly permanent residence and for the Commonwealth's (successful) appeal to the Full Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, all the legal bases for why this man should go are magically overturned, not by the law but by this politically inspired Government. In responding to questions like this Imam Al Hilaly has indicated:</PARA>
<PARA> I also personally did not receive one cent out of this amount. </PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA> I have not received any money and this report (a contemporary media account) is incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Literally and physically, it is accepted that the Imam did not receive one cent from the grant from an agency supported by the Libyan Government. However, it is open to hold that the Imam did benefit from those funds which entered a pool of funds from which monies are paid, inter alia, for the Imam's purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>So he does not get the money; he just gets it. It is absolutely incredible! The report also states:</PARA>
<PARA> Further, the Imam indicated that he was unaware of the grant `until the press announced this'. In responding to a question as to why the Imam did not refute contrary views in `The Australian' of 16 December 1987, the Imam indicated, `Today, (16 August 1989) this is the first time I've become aware that The Australian newspaper have written something like this about me.'</PARA>
<PARA>Maybe that was before his conversion on the way to Damascus. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> In pursuing the general theme, the Imam said that he visited Libya for an international conference some two years ago. According to Departmental records, this visit was between June and September 1987 when Imam Hilaly travelled out of Australia. The fare for this visit was also provided by an agency supported by the Libyan Government. </PARA>
<PARA>But our Minister here says, `Oh, no. There is insubstantial evidence to show that he is closely associated with the Libyan regime'. What an incredible, disgraceful and deliberate misleading of this place!</PARA>

<PARA> Your views on this matter and the relevance of it to Australia might or might not be relevant to the consideration of the Imam's application in light of all the evidence. It is noteworthy, however, that the relevant Australian Government agency has, on the information then available to it, indicated no objection to the Imam's continued presence in Australia. If you do not agree with that view, you would be expected to have a reasonable basis for differing with that view. </PARA>
<PARA>I have already asked the Minister, one way or another, to say what the word `then' means in this report. When was this report received from the relevant governmental agency? What was the relevant governmental agency? Is it still true that there is no objection on these grounds? It seems to me that the Department was preparing the way for an appropriate response when it heavied the Minister to come to the view that this was not a matter of substance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think departments read the wind pretty well. They read the breeze. I will read one more section:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>You might hold that answers to questions put to Imam Hilaly on this most sensitive question do not allay reasonably held concerns about the Imam's links with Libya which, to our knowledge, commenced in 1973. </PARA>
<PARA>This is no sudden, new exciting involvement: they commenced in 1973. They are longstanding. Despite that, the Minister can still say that there is insubstantial evidence to support the contention that he is closely associated with the Libyan regime. I agree with the Minister that there is insubstantial evidence to support the allegation that he is a puppet of the Libyan regime. I suggest to the Minister that it may have been a more honourable course to have separated those two propositions out. </PARA>
<PARA> What concerns me immensely about this is the recognition and the admission by the Minister in his statement and by almost everyone concerned that this man has been a major divisive influence in Australia. I am particularly concerned that the Minister's decision to examine the rights to permanent residence of the wife and two children separately from the right of the husband creates an absurd situation, because it colours the inevitable request by the imam in 12 months' time when the decision will be made in respect of his application for permanent residence. If in the next two weeks this Minister says, `The wife and children haven't been divisive, surely they can stay', what problems does that create for the person-it will not be this Minister-who in 12 months' time will be making a decision about whether the imam himself will be granted permanent residence. The clear thing that this Minister keeps avoiding is that what he has done by granting temporary residence to the imam, and the prospect of agreeing with his New South Wales right wing heavy mates to grant permanent residence to the imam's wife and two children, is to influence the outcome of the imam's application for permanent residence in a year's time, to make it just that much harder to get this person out of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said in this place this week: `I will make a decision on the matter later this week, based on the facts, not on prejudices, and based on a whole variety of matters, but not on the basis of political pressure or representation'. We know the representations took place. Are we seriously suggesting that Mr McLeay and his colleagues, having decided to propose this course of action that permanent citizenship be provided for the imam's wife and temporary citizenship be provided for the imam, did not in fact come to the Minister with it? Is that really being suggested? Is it not remarkable then that it just happens to be what seems to be emerging in this case? Although the decision is not made on the basis of political representation, it just coincidentally looks as though that is what is happening. I believe this matter is absolutely disgraceful. I do not know of anyone else who has received anything like this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Michael Baume for giving me notice that he was going to raise the second matter on the adjournment tonight. He raised similar matters last Friday, but I was told only as he got to his feet. The geography of this particular building means that, if one wants to hear what a senator is going to say, on the journey down to the chamber one misses half of it. That is the reason that I did not come in on Friday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have nothing else to thank Senator Baume for. I regard his speech tonight as a typical example of the thing I criticised the Imam Hilaly for. It is nothing else than one-sided, bigoted, biased and smearing. Senator Baume has read the draft report. I inform him that the final report is not substantially different. But he has read it only in a one-eyed way. I do not have that luxury. I have to look at all the facts, not only in that report but in the whole file on the Imam Hilaly. I cannot take a position where I let my prejudices affect my judgment. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it would be pretty well recognised-not by Senator Baume, because he is not from Victoria-that if there are two groups within Victoria that have supported me very strongly in politics, it is the Jewish community of Victoria and the Christian Lebanese community of Victoria. That goes back long before I entered representative politics, in which I have had a long involvement. When Mrs Sadat could not deliver the key lecture last year, it is not a coincidence that I was invited to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to place on record that, despite what Senator Baume says, I made this decision objectively and without giving in to representations. At no stage have I said that I have not had representations. For heaven's sake, I have had everyone ringing me on it. At every function I have gone to I have had representations made to me. At a luncheon in Sydney some of the most prominent members of the Jewish community put to me the case against Imam Hilaly. At a dinner in Sydney some of the most respected figures in the Christian Lebanese community put the case against Imam Hilaly. I have had members of the Islamic community argue to me that Imam Hilaly should not be in this country. I have listened to their representations. I have had Labor politicians come to me on both sides of the argument. Of course, Mr McLeay has made representations to me. So have other Labor members, saying that he should go. I was advised from the first week in this job by the New South Wales State Director, and an expert on these things, that I had to make up my mind on the facts and not on representations. </PARA>
<PARA> One can go back right through the record for a year, during which time I have had to shut up on the issue. After Imam Hilaly's disgraceful speech on 18 September, I did not utter a word. If I had, it would have been seen as prejudging the case and I would have been in court the moment I decided upon any one of the three or four options. It has been very hard for me not to say anything about this particular subject for a whole year. Of course, I would like this matter to have been resolved three months ago. The proposition was put to us that the imam would like to go to Mecca for the Haj-the sort of grant I would have made to the leader of any other religion: this being the pre-eminent thing in the religious calendar, that person should participate. That delayed the decision by two to three months more than it should have. </PARA>
<PARA> What Senator Baume has not acknowledged tonight is things I had to look at. One of the key factors in Minister Hurford's decision that the imam should go-and it is not for me to judge between Minister Young's opinion and Minister Hurford's opinion; they both based it on their view of the facts-was that the imam in the first few years in this country showed no inclination at all to learn English, which is part of the contract of anyone coming to this country. One of the things I have looked at within the last 12 months is that he has made massive efforts to learn English, to fit into this country. That was one of the factors I looked at. </PARA>
<PARA> A second factor I looked at is this: right at the height of the disturbances in Sydney on the Salman Rushdie affair, who was the only leading Islamic figure that came out and called for a peaceful solution, who condemned violence and said that Salman Rushdie should not be killed? It was Imam Hilaly. Senator Baume should acknowledge that tonight, if he wants to put a fair case. When what I describe as disgraceful incidents occurred at Arncliffe between the so-called Hizbollah and Amal groups, which groups came in under Senator Baume's Government, I might say, with its active sponsorship-it was not just a question of who made it under the system but who was deliberately brought here as a tool of government policy-who was the only religious leader in the Islamic community to come out and call for peace and to offer to mediate? It was Imam Hilaly. Imam Hilaly has, on two occasions, tried relatively successfully to meet with the Jewish community since his great sin of 18 September. There has been no acknowledgment from Senator Baume tonight that those things occurred. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The views of apology for Senator Baume, for me and for someone of Islamic faith are entirely different in their approach to these matters. In Imam Hilaly's mind his retraction would be seen as a major apology in this particular area. Senator Baume has put forward a very one-sided case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to move onto part of the substance of this matter. I do not care whether Imam Hilaly met with some of his local members of parliament this week. I could not care less. Senator Baume makes the assertion that my right wing mates heavied me. I am about to tell him that they cannot and they never will. They know not to try. I come from Victoria. I come from a political position where I have one luxury in life: no-one can heavy me. </PARA>
<PARA> I have never granted an immigration case to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) or the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the year that I have been Minister. I have granted it to some other people if the case is just, but I have not granted them a case because it has not been strong enough. The one thing I want to do in the immigration portfolio is to take the fix out, to stop political patronage where one person gets a jump ahead of the other. Why do honourable senators think I fought so hard to get rid of ministerial discretion? I saw one of the former Opposition Ministers spend $1.5m trying to get rid of a drug pusher. The day after he left the ministry the next Liberal Minister walked in and gave him permanent residence in this country. That is the sort of thing that has happened in immigration far too often. It is the sort of thing that I am trying to eliminate out of the immigration area. </PARA>
<PARA> When I approached the Hilaly case I had to approach it fairly and with an open mind. My political instincts were probably the other way to which I made the decision. I can assure Senator Baume-he will produce no proof tonight-that I was not politically heavied in any way. There is no way I ever will be. I decided a long time ago that life was too short to be a toady and a whippy. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me return to the facts against the Imam. Clearly they are there, although Senator Baume has only adduced one tonight, and that was his speech. The fact that he was divisive does not necessarily mean he has to go. It happens to be a divisive community. One of the judgments we have to make is that if he went and the vacuum has to be filled, would that community be better off or not? I do not know. The second point-this is the one I concede-is that his speech on 18 September, in which he slandered the Jewish people of Australia and the world, was a disgraceful one. It was a disgraceful speech. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened to a lot of sermons I disagree with over the years. I bring to this matter a complete neutrality, being a card-carrying atheist. I do not like or dislike any particular religion for that reason. I have also said that I do not accept his explanation that he was distinguishing between Jews and Zionist Jews. I find it difficult to understand what the subtlety is because people will take offence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because Senator Baume has produced nothing against the imam, he says that he has to be condemned forever for that speech. That speech cost him permanent residence. Without that speech I would have had to look at his file and say, `Here is an employer nomination case'. It has clearly been advertised. It is clearly a unique job. It cannot be filled within Australia. He is clearly qualified for the job. He has paid all his fees. He has met every other requirement, including health and character assessments. The one thing we have to determine on public policy interest is whether he should be allowed to have permanent residence. Without the speech of 18 September the answer would have been unequivocally yes. However it happened. I have overwhelmingly noted in my mind some of his actions since then. Senator Baume might respond, `Oh, he is behaving himself because he knew his visa was up'. That may be true. That is the reason I wanted to test it over a further 12-month period. Senator Baume says that this is a unique case. This is not unique. A lot of people have been in this country on a temporary visa or other methods for seven, eight or nine years. That is a testament to a very poor immigration Act and a susceptibility to legal appeals, et cetera, much of which, I concede, post-19 December this year, when the new Act is proclaimed, will disappear. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to go on to a couple of other points. Senator Baume says that it is wrong to consider Mrs Hilaly's case. Why? Does she have no rights? She has lived here for seven years. She has two children who are Australian citizens. Am I supposed to take the sexist attitude that I will judge only the old man but am not allowed to judge the claims of Mrs Hilaly and the kids? Honourable senators have to remember that the benefit of the doubt always goes to people whose kids are Australian citizens. The exception is when there has been a massive breach of immigration law. Long term, we are not going to have that problem. In 1986 we said that children born in Australia to people other than permanent residents will not be Australian citizens, but there were some born before that. The general attitude of Liberal and Labor governments has been that in those cases we regularise the status of the parents in accordance with their children's citizenship. That is another thing that leads us towards saying that Mrs Hilaly also has rights. She has the right to be judged by herself, not on her husband's actions. I am not guaranteeing that the judgment will result in permanent residence because she will not be applying under the employer nomination scheme. She would have to apply under the compassionate section of the Act, which is much harder to approve and much harder to achieve. She has the right to do it; she has done it. I have the right at some stage to make a judgment on it. In summary, I reject a lot of the accusations that Senator Baume has made tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know and Senator Baume would not expect me to comment on that. I am not going to. I will never comment on a view expressed to me, whether or not it has ever been expressed by a security organisation. I take that attitude. I wear the lumps, but I am not going to vary on that policy. I put on the public record that it is not as though everyone shares Senator Baume's views. I will quote from a press release from the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas, Mr Ruddock, who said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The decision of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs to issue Imam Hilaly with a 12 month temporary entry permit, in order to test his bona fides is reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not the only one that takes that attitude. I put on the record, in case I fall for the sort of debating tactics of Senator Baume, that he goes on to criticise me over Mrs Hilaly. Quite clearly, I accept that the criticism is well intended. He also goes on to say that he would not have given permanent residence on this occasion to Imam Hilaly. I agree with my shadow Minister on that. I think we have seen tonight that Senator Baume's attack has been so one-sided and so blinkered. I think that is a tragedy. It does not do him credit just to put one side when he has at least got access, in the document he claims to have, to both sides of the argument. As Minister, I had to take both sides into account. I knew that the decision would not be popular, but one would have to concede that no decision in this matter would be popular. It could be said that I have squibbed the decision one way or the other. I deny that on the basis of the trend of events. We had a disgraceful event almost 12 months ago and three or four factors in the meantime have mitigated it. I have not added, but I could have, that for all the imam's faults-he is a bit like Bruce Ruxton in one sense-no-one here would criticise his social work. No-one would criticise the hours he has put in helping Islamic youth, Islamic women's groups and so forth. He has done a lot of good work in that area. Even Four Corners had to be gracious enough to acknowledge that. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not accept Senator Baume's categorisation of this case, but one thing I want to put on the record is that I made up my mind on the facts of the matter and not on the representations. However, I do not deny that I had representations. Heaven forbid! I never sought the representations, I might say, but the subject would come up if I attended a dinner in Sydney with prominent members of the Jewish community who wanted to discuss a range of issues-foreign affairs, our attitude to Israel, or the Australian Government's attitude to Palestine Liberation Organisation recognition. Of course, views were put to me by the Jewish community. At dinner with the major Christian Lebanese leaders in Sydney their attitude would be put to me very strongly. When certain members of the Islamic Council make a courtesy call on me, the subject is raised. At fund-raising functions in Sydney the opposing sides have bowed to, smiled at and toasted each other and then come to see me separately to ask me to get rid of the imam or to keep him. These things happen. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the imam is on notice in one sense: he had better behave himself for the next 12 months. Irrespective of whether Mrs Hilaly gains Australian citizenship, he will be judged on his record over the next 12 months. If that record is in any way imperfect, he will be departing for the country of his origin. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Baume raised another subject of which I have imperfect knowledge. However, I should put the record straight in one sense. There is still no evidence that Mr Johnson uttered the remarks it is claimed that he did. There is no evidence; there is a claim. I have known Johnno Johnson for nigh on 20 years. I know he is a very deeply religious man. I know of his very deeply held religious views. In that 20 years he has also known that I am a card-carrying atheist, yet I have never known him once to raise a religious issue or make a sectarian remark. I find it very hard to believe the allegations made in the letter tabled today. I say in all honesty: I have never met Alderman Ron Hoenig, so I will say nothing about him. But I have known Johnno Johnson for 20 years and I find the allegation very hard to believe. </PARA>
<PARA> The degree of sectarianism that exists in the Labor Party now is minimal. I joined the Labor Party in 1966 in the Victorian branch, and sectarianism was then rife as a result of the split. It was not anti-Semitism, but a strict Catholic-Mason break-up. Fortunately, within eight years of my joining the Labor Party-not due to any effect that I had on it-I saw sectarianism disappear entirely from the Victorian branch. At least in the Victorian branch-and I hope it is the case Australia wide-I have never seen anti-Semitism, with one exception. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of members of the Jewish community have represented the Labor Party in this Parliament in the last 20 years. Joe Berinson, Barry Cohen, Dick Klugman, Moss Cass and others have served with great distinction. Members of the Jewish community have also served with great distinction on the Liberal side. I would hate to think that anyone is ever judged on his religious background these days when seeking preselection or election to Parliament. If what is claimed occurred-I still say I do not think it did-I would be absolutely ashamed to be a member of the Labor Party. It is true that from time to time each party-I can point to both sides here-has someone on the abrasive side, William Hartley being such a one. I was on the National Executive; I voted to expel him; we expelled him. With that we cleaned out of the Labor Party a lot of those potential sentiments. That was one of the proudest days of my life, and I am not normally proud to see anyone expelled. </PARA>
<PARA> From my knowledge of Johnno Johnson I find the charge hard to accept. I cannot disprove it tonight, nor do I know on what basis it was made. I know that in the heat of preselections a variety of malicious accusations are made. Sometimes it is the Cardinal Richelieu false assassination attempt. I am not saying that this letter constitutes that, but it has been known. Senator Baume would know that the odd desperate candidate has been known to bomb his own backyard in an attempt to get publicity. We saw that most recently in the last State election in Western Australia with a gentleman-not a member of Senator Baume's party or mine-who is now embroiled in many court cases. That has occurred. It is a possibility that this letter falls into that category; I do not know. </PARA>
<PARA> But I do know Johnno Johnson. I have never known him make a sectarian remark in the 20 years I have known him. I know how distressed he will be by this and I am sure that within the next day or two he will put the public record straight. I know him to be an honourable man and I cannot imagine his making the sort of sectarian remark attributed to him. I regret that the incident has occurred. I apologise to the chamber as I am not duty Minister but have detained honourable senators for some time. I think it is time we allowed the next speaker to proceed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night in his adjournment speech in this chamber, Senator Panizza invited me to put up or shut up, to take up the challenge that he has made to me to repeat my allegations outside this place so that we could settle that matter once and for all. I refer to page 1127 of Hansard. The first part of the invitation is illogical because I have already both put up and shut up. The central cause of Senator Panizza's purported concern appears to be the fact that I stated that people who had been shipped to Australia under the British child migrant scheme had worked on his family property. I quote from page 426 of the Senate Hansard of 18 August. I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In my responding speech my intention was to demonstrate that Senator Panizza was in a special position to know more about the child migrant scheme than any others. I used information given to me from four different sources to which I have again returned today. Two of them claim to have been told by Senator Panizza himself that former boys from the child migrant institutions had worked on the family property, but in no way did I intend my words to imply that the boys were harshly treated, of tender years, or anything of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA>I regret that that statement and whatever Senator Panizza read into it has caused him so much concern. I cannot retract it. I cannot apologise for it because I believe it to be true. I believe my sources, which I do not intend to give. The sources are not all interconnected. I do not intend to reveal my sources in any way, just as Mr Ruddock, the Opposition spokesman on immigration and ethnic affairs, it was reported in the Australian today, would not say how he obtained a letter which has been referred to in a previous debate. He said he had not spoken to the people involved. I ask why Senator Panizza would demand a different course from me, a course not demanded of a shadow Minister in his own Party. Why would people on two separate occasions say that Senator Panizza had said one thing to them and then say in the Senate that that was not true? On 18 August Senator Panizza said at page 425 of Hansard:</PARA>
<PARA>I categorically state before every member in this chamber that no child migrant from that institution or any other like institution has either worked or holidayed on our family property. . . </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of Senator Panizza's invitation was to repeat the allegations outside this place so that we could settle the matter once and for all. That was the first time that Senator Panizza had invited me to repeat my so-called allegations outside so that we could settle the matter once and for all. It was quite the reverse, in fact. Previously Senator Panizza had said to me privately, and more than once, that if I said the same words outside this place he would serve a very expensive writ on me. He also telephoned the Secretary of the Child Migrant Friendship Society of Western Australia and spent half an hour on the telephone, according to the lady in question, intimidating her with talk of a writ-so much so that her husband phoned my Perth office in great distress. </PARA>
<PARA> On 4 September Senator Knowles asked me to apologise for making statements which I had not made. I refer to statements made by Senator Knowles and reported on page 927 of Hansard:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . Mrs Pearce has quite categorically stated that she has not contacted other senators as Senator Jenkins has claimed . . . </PARA>
<PARA>As I said at the time, that is gross misrepresentation. I did not say that Mrs Pearce had contacted other senators. I said-and I quote from page 273 of Hansard of 17 August:</PARA>

Mr MacKinnon replied courteously and promptly within two weeks, importing that it was a Federal issue on which I was an appropriate representative but inviting further contact with him if he could be of further help. Mr Howard's office replied that on 11 May 1989 the letter was passed to Mr Peacock from whom no further reply or acknowledgment had been received. The society was pleased with the response from Senator Robert Ray to whom the letter was referred by the Prime Minister. The response, dated 27 July 1989, promised the child migrants certificates of entry and permanent status but not Australian citizenship. The society attributes this good fortune to my work in raising the issue in the first place in June. Several individual members of the society have assured me that they had previously contacted other members of parliament for assistance without effect. However, I now know of at least one Western Australian State Labor Party member who has very kindly decided to assist, and that is Dr Judyth Watson, MLA.

Apologies are sought, a writ is threatened, and vicious and tasteless accusations are made. I would say it is a classic example of Liberal game-playing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 29 August Senator Knowles delivered what must be one of the most tasteless and malicious personal attacks ever delivered in this chamber in the new Parliament House. I have already dealt with some of the matters that were mentioned in that speech. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I ask Senator Knowles, who says that I accused my colleague Senator Panizza of various wrongdoings, whether she would kindly state what those wrongdoings are. I have not accused Senator Panizza of doing anything wrong, only with being wrong. Senator Knowles has asked me to give the name of other senators to whom I was referring. I do not wish to do that and I will not do it because I certainly would not wish anybody else to be harassed in the same way. Also, I do not think it would do any good whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the other offensive and untrue gossip, in Senator Knowles's speech on 29 August she referred to a meeting in my office with a group identifiable as a Canadian delegation under the political exchange program. I can state quite categorically that the hearsay detailed by Senator Knowles is totally untrue. In essence, Senator Knowles said that I could not answer most of the questions put to me by the members of the delegation, and I did not provide them with Party platforms and policies. On these untrue reports, I am awaiting comments from the chairman of the political exchange program, Sir Robert Cotton, to whom I wrote last week. In the meantime, I have had verbal contact with an independent witness of the briefing which Senator Knowles has misrepresented who denied that there was any dissatisfaction with my performance or the materials I distributed. Those materials were one full volume of State policies given to the leader of the group, a Federal Party platform for the 1987 Federal election, and copies of the objectives and principles of the Party. I am amazed that Senator Knowles should attribute uncouth behaviour to the members of the Canadian delegation. This must obviously be investigated because of its very serious implications for international relationships under the political exchange program. I suggest Senator Knowles has degraded herself and her Party by admitting her unethical participation in such behaviour. </PARA>

<PARA> I can cite the case of a recent delegation that came to Western Australia and was supposed to be briefed by Senator Jenkins on behalf of the Australian Democrats.

<PARA>LOST CHILDREN OF THE EMPIRE STRIKE BACK</PARA>
<PARA>In 1967, 90 children sailed from Southampton dock, England, for a new life in Australia. They were to be the last contingent of Britain's child migration scheme-a more acceptable phrase than child exportation-that had lasted 350 years and exiled some 150,000 boys and girls as young as three, to outposts of the British Empire. </PARA>
<PARA>Mostly the children did not want to go and remained permanently affected by their experiences. </PARA>
<PARA>Abuse and deception, according to Philip Bean and Joy Meville, the authors of Lost Children Of The Empire, characterised the Australian schemes. The recollections of some of these children-now adult men and women-should shame and horrify Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>Nigel Fitzgibbon was one of about 10,000 British children who were shipped to Australia after World War II. The systematic abuse of some of these children in Australian institutions is one of the blackest spots in the whole history of child migration. </PARA>
<PARA> On August 15, 1947, Nigel boarded SS Astaurius with about 250 boys and girls destined for orphanages in Australia. Both his parents were in fact alive, even if they hadn't been contacted for permission for their son to go to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> After arriving at Fremantle, Nigel was despatched in a group of 20 to Bindoon Boys' Town, a Catholic orphanage in the bush about 120km north of Perth. </PARA>
<PARA> Nigel was impressed by the green hills and grape- vines but, on arrival at the orphanage, found there was little chance to admire the view:</PARA>
<PARA> `After we'd had our new clothes taken from us, we were given some khaki clothes and next day started fitting into the routine. Being on a farm, there were cows to milk first thing in the morning and that sort of thing. </PARA>
<PARA> There was no real education but we didn't care. At the time, the Brother in charge was a good man but a few months later he left and we got told about this man, Brother Keaney, coming back, And he arrived. </PARA>
<PARA> He started pulling boys out of the classrooms, 'cos he wanted to start massive building projects.'</PARA>
<PARA> Within three years the boys had built three large two-storey buildings with spacious hallways and chapels, dormitories and schoolrooms. Each building was made of stone and granite that the boys brought from the bush and cemented in place. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as that, they built dams by hand, numerous farm buildings and Roman Catholic monuments. </PARA>
<PARA> Nigel recalls it being nothing more than sheer slave labor, from dawn to late evening, made even worse by the primitive tools they were given to use. </PARA>
<PARA> The boys were emaciated from an inadequate diet: gruel for breakfast, which was mixed with bran from the chicken feed. </PARA>
<PARA> Nigel also claims a number of the Brothers sexually abused the boys. </PARA>
<PARA> But what really seems to have broken Nigel's spirit and left a life-long scar, is the sheer physical brutality and sadism of one brother. </PARA>
<PARA> The brother had a special stick with a 303 bullet on the end of it with which he hit and prodded the children in certain areas. </PARA>
<PARA> On one occasion the Brother hurt Nigel badly, and he inspected the injured area for some time after a particularly cruel incident. </PARA>
<PARA>`you can't forget those things and I think it made a lot of kids there very hardened. A lot of those kids never married, and if they did have a relationship with a woman, a normal relationship with a woman, it often didn't last because you never felt the tenderness the feel of a close relationship with anyone, in your young life. You saw violence, day after day.'</PARA>
<PARA> Nigel left Bindoon when he was 17 and, despite his experiences, gave the impression of having made a go at life. He joined the army and was there for 22 years, becoming a Warrant Officer, Class 1, and winning lots of medals. </PARA>
<PARA> He married and had children, though his marriage was not a great success. He is now separated, which he mostly attributes to his life at Bindoon. </PARA>
<PARA> Another boy at Bindoon never forgot the ``disgusting job of cleaning out sewage pits'' and being told they could build themselves a swimming pool. ``We all worked really hard on construction only to discover that it was a dam for the orchards-although we never saw a piece of fruit. I remember often having no shoes, although my oldest sister tells me that money was sent for shoes.''</PARA>
<PARA> The boys often foraged for food. As one said:</PARA>
<PARA> `We would get porridge in the mornings and a cup of tea. At lunch, we'd get toast. And then for dinner we might get a rabbit-we'd go out and trap them or we'd literally dig them out of the ground.'</PARA>
<PARA> One remembered his first day at Bindoon, aged 12, ``started with Brother Keaney hitting me on the head with a walking stick''. </PARA>
<PARA> One ex-Christian Brother, who spent some years at Bindoon and saved at least three from drowning in the swimming hole, wrote to one of those he had saved after seeing him on television talking about his experiences. </PARA>
<PARA> He admitted that, looking back, it might have been a blessing if the creek had claimed them in view of what terrible lives some had ultimately led, ``suicides, alcohol, broken marriages, loneliness, desertions-a life of misery.''</PARA>
<PARA> Some of the sexual abuse of children that took place in orphanages run by the Christian Brothers was criminal. At least half a dozen boys had to have corrective surgery, yet none of the doctors involved ever reported the cases, nor did they report the general injuries that took place under suspicious circumstances and placed boys in hospital. </PARA>
<PARA> Colin Reidy, who went to Clontarf Orphanage, recalls: `The Brothers often came to the bed and pulled your clothes back and tried to fondle you and that was one of the reasons I was singled out, because I wouldn't take it: I would kick and spit. Because I flatly refused to go along with it, I knew I was in a lot of trouble, so I would rush down to the priest at eleven at night and wake him up and talk to him and he kept promising to do something about it, but he never did.'</PARA>
<PARA> There were children who cried in bed at night, afraid to wake up the next morning. There were children who no longer cried. Some, reacting to the cruelty inflicted upon them, would in turn inflict their anger on smaller boys by beating them, or they would be cruel to animals. </PARA>
<PARA> The girls sent out to Australia faced a bleak childhood, too. One girl had a particularly severe beating by a reverend mother, which affected her into adult life. </PARA>
<PARA> Many said that one of the worst things at Goodwood Orphanage was that they received no care or kindness. As one girl said:</PARA>
<PARA> `What I missed most was a bit of love. You had no one, you had the girls you come out with but they were in the same boat as you. Some of the nuns were nice, but still they didn't give you the love you needed.'</PARA>

The Committee's report was a valuable part of the process that led to the Government's retirement incomes statement. The Government's retirement incomes policy is the result of one of the most sustained exercises in policy development research and consultation that this Government or any government has seen. The Government's response to the Committee's report acknowledged the important role the Committee's work played, as a close reading of the response reveals. For the information of honourable senators I seek leave to incorporate the Government's response to that report into Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Government Response to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs Report `Income Support for the Retired and the Aged: An Agenda for Reform'. </PARA>
<PARA>The following document provides the Government's response to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs report ``Income Support for the Retired and the Aged: An Agenda for Reform''. This report was released during the period that the Government was developing the first ever comprehensive national policy on retirement income. The Government's retirement income policy was released as part of the 1989-90 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has taken account of the views expressed in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. In line with the broad objectives of the Federal Government, the Committee aimed to turn the two systems of income support, that is the social security system and the occupational superannuation system, towards the common purpose of providing more adequate, equitable and cost-effective retirement income provision for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has undertaken extensive consultations in the process of developing its retirement income policy which is fair, adequate, secure and sustainable. We believe that it was crucial for the interested parties to be involved in the development of this historic policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Most of the recommendations made by the Senate Standing Committee have been taken up by the Government. Some recommendations were not consistent with the Government's judgment on the best long term community interest or with the views expressed by the community in its consultations with the Government and, therefore, have not been adopted. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government believes that a flexible and sustainable retirement income policy which delivers fair and adequate incomes needs to build on the twin pillars of the age pension system and private saving, especially through superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA>The centrepiece of the Government's retirement income policy is its commitment to maintain the age pension as an adequate base level of income for older people who have not had the opportunity to save during their working lives. It will be possible to meet the expectation of higher living standards for the retired in the future only if we can improve on our current levels of saving and if we can provide better employment opportunities for older workers and for women. </PARA>
<PARA>Consistent with recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee, the Government recognises that the level of the age and service pensions, as well as rent assistance, pensioner concessions and the amount of tax and income test free income determine income adequacy for most retirees. We remain committed to maintaining and improving the adequacy of the age pension. Labor's longstanding commitment to an age pension of 25 per cent of AWE will not only be met but exceeded in April 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will undertake a major restructuring on the income test and tax interaction to improve the level of income adequacy for age pensioners and increase incentives for savings. We will implement a three stage reform of the income test and tax overlap so that from July 1995, no age or service pensioner will be required to pay tax. This will be achieved by better integration of the pension and tax systems. From 1995 age pensioners will deal only with the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is committed to ensuring that people in the workforce have opportunities to save more for their retirement years. It will ensure that superannuation contributes to increased adequacy of retirement income by extending superannuation coverage across the labour force; improving superannuation benefits; ensuring that superannuation benefits are not lost when an employee changes jobs; making superannuation more responsive to women's patterns of working; and seeking to ensure that superannuation is not wasted before or at retirement. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will maintain an individual's current free choice to receive a lump sum superannuation benefit. However, we are concerned that superannuation should be used for retirement purposes and we are committed to providing people with realistic opportunities and incentives to use their lump sums to provide regular income. </PARA>

<PARA>REPORT OF THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON COMMUNITY AFFAIRS,</PARA>
<PARA>AUGUST 1988:</PARA>
<PARA>``Income Support for the Retired and the Aged, An Agenda for Reform''</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Part One-Income Support Provided through the Social Security System</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 1. </PARA>
<PARA>That the level of age and service pensions be increased to reflect more closely the income needs of those wholly dependent on this source of income support during their retirement and old age. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>For those pensioners with no other income, the Federal Government remains committed to maintaining and improving the adequacy of the age pension. Labor's longstanding commitment to an age pension of 25 per cent of AWE will not only be met but exceeded in April 1990. There will be a special increase in April 1990 of $2 a week for single pensioners and $3.30 a week for married pensioner couples on top of indexation. The Government is committed to further increases over time and will continue to monitor the circumstances of those pensioners with no income other than the pension. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 2. </PARA>
<PARA>That the Government increase the current level of rent assistance available to low-income age and service pensioners who are required to seek accommodation in the private rental market. </PARA>
<PARA>Reponse</PARA>
<PARA>In the 1988-89 Budget, the Government announced a series of phased increases to raise the level of rent assistance from $15 a week in 1988 to $20 a week in June 1990. Families with children were given extra payments in recognition of the extra costs they face. </PARA>
<PARA>Further increases are contained in the 1989-90 Budget. Rent assistance which is paid to age and service pensioners in private rental accommodation will be increased by:</PARA>
<PARA> $5 a week in December 1989</PARA>
<PARA> an additional $5 a week in June 1990 (announced last year)</PARA>
<PARA> a further $5 a week in September 1990; and</PARA>
<PARA> will be indexed twice yearly in line with the Consumer Price Index from March 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>These increases in rent assistance will improve the incomes of our poorest pensioners. They will mean that the level of rent assistance by September 1990 for age pensioners will have at least doubled since December 1988. For the first time ever, they will also have the security of indexation of rent assistance as well as of the age pension. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 3. </PARA>
<PARA>That prior to increasing the level of rent assistance, the Commonwealth negotiate with the Governments of the States and the Northern Territory to devise appropriate leasing and rent control mechanisms to ensure that increases in the level of rent assistance do not generate corresponding increases in rental charges by landlords and agents. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Social Security Review concluded, on the basis of overseas and Australian evidence, that increased rental assistance will have little or no effect on the level of rents. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 4. </PARA>
<PARA>That the Government take steps to ensure that adjustments to pension rates related to changes in the Consumer Price Index take effect no more than 2 months after the end of the relevant Consumer Price Index review period. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>In the 1989 April Economic Statement the Government committed itself to reducing the lag between price increases and pension increases by 12 weeks in 3 stages:</PARA>
<PARA> by 4 weeks in November 1989;</PARA>
<PARA> by a further 4 weeks in April 1990; and</PARA>
<PARA> by a further 4 weeks in September 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>Indexation will continue to be six monthly but will be in March and September compared to the current arrangements of June and December. As of September 1990 indexation adjustments will take place 12 weeks after the end of the relevant Consumer Price Index period. This will provide pensioners with the speediest CPI indexation in history. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 5. </PARA>
<PARA>That the Government initiate a review of the taxation treatment of age and service pensioners with a view to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) reducing the impact of the income tax burden on pensioners with low or modest incomes by either (i) regularly adjusting the special pensioner tax rebate in line with increases in the level of pensions, (ii) adjusting the ordinary tax threshold, or (iii) exempting pensioners from paying income tax altogether;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) improving the administration of the present taxation system as it affects pensioners by amending the present provisional income tax system and/or improving measures to facilitate the withholding of income tax at its source when income is received; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) determining whether the measures announced in the 1988-89 Budget fully address the particular problems of surviving pensioner spouses following the death of their husband or wife. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government will implement a three-stage reform of the income test and tax overlap. The first stage which was announced in April 1989 will make the income test free area for pensioners 100 per cent tax free by July 1990. This will eliminate tax payable on non-pension income within the pension free area and simplify the way in which the social security system interacts with the tax system. The free area for a single pensioner is currently $40 a week. It is $70 a week for married pensioner couples. </PARA>
<PARA>The second stage of the Federal Government's reform is to index annually the income test free area, for social security and veterans' pensioners, from 1 July 1991. The free area will continue to be 100 per cent tax free. The free area has never before been indexed by any Federal Government. Maintaining its real value will give pensioners greater certainty in organising their finances. </PARA>
<PARA>The third stage of the Federal Government's reform will address the position of pensioners who have income above the income test free area-that is, part rate pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government is committed to introducing from 1995 a better integrated system of social security and tax administration for age and service pensioners and to reducing combined pension withdrawal and tax rates. This will be achieved by removing all age and service pensioners-both full rate and part rate-from the tax system and making part rate pensioners subject only to the withdrawal rate on the pension entitlement. This means that from 1995 no age or service pensioner will pay income tax. The present high EMTRs will be reduced substantially to 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>A reform introduced in the 1988-89 Budget ensured that all pensioners receiving the pensioner tax rebate are exempted from paying provisional tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Pensioners already have the option of having tax instalments deducted from their pension. </PARA>
<PARA>The tax burden of surviving pensioner spouses was reduced in the 1988-89 budget by the exemption from tax of the special temporary allowance. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 6. </PARA>
<PARA>That the Government extend entitlement to Commonwealth pensioner fringe benefits (i.e. the present range of free pharmaceuticals, hearing aid services, and telephone rental, postable and certain travel concessions) to all recipients of age and service pensions. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>In November 1983 the Government indexed the income limits for the Pensioner Health Benefit (PHB) card. This change meant that the income limits for Commonwealth fringe benefits maintained their real value and that more age pensioners than ever before are now eligible for fringe benefits. The proportion of age pensioners eligible for a PHB card has increased from 78 per cent in 1983 to 84 per cent currently. </PARA>
<PARA>Since 1988 pensioners have been entitled to retain eligibility for the PHB card for up to three months if their income rises by no more than 25 per cent above the PHB income text limits. </PARA>
<PARA>Extension of Commonwealth pensioner fringe benefits free of an income test to all recipients of age and service pensions would be costly and not as well targeted as other changes that the Government has chosen to introduce now. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 7. </PARA>
<PARA>That the age of eligibility for the age pension for women be increased from 60 to 65 years thereby establishing a common age of pension entitlement for both men and women. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 8. </PARA>
<PARA>That the adjustment to the age of eligibility for the age pension for women be phased in gradually over a period of 5 years and that this period of adjustment commence at a time to be determined by the Government, but not later than 1992. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 9. </PARA>
<PARA>That, during the phasing-in period, the wife's pension and the widow's pension continue to be made available to those women aged 60-64 years who are eligible for such pensions, and that the special benefit be made available to those single women aged 60-64 years who are ineligible to receive any other form of government assistance but who are deemed to be in special need. </PARA>
<PARA>Response to 7, 8 &amp; 9</PARA>
<PARA>The Government will monitor the progress of women's participation in superannuation and labour market opportunities, particularly during the period from 1995 when improved vesting and preservation standards apply, before there is any consideration of an increase in the age pension eligibility age for women. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government intends to design an education program during 1989-90 to educate the community on the benefit of saving for retirement with specific attention to the retirement income needs of women and increasing the opportunities for older workers. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's commitment to award restructuring emphasises the need to improve career paths for women as an avenue to providing better opportunities for women in the labour market and in regard to wage issues. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government believes that extension of award superannuation is the best means of providing superannuation to the majority of women who currently receive no superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA>Changes will be made to personal superannuation which will be of particular benefit to women including:</PARA>
<PARA> from 1 July 1990 people working as little as 10 hours a week will be allowed to contribute to personal superannuation and receive a tax deduction;</PARA>
<PARA> people will be able to continue to contribute to superannuation and receive a tax deduction for up to two years while outside the paid workforce;</PARA>
<PARA> changes to the administration of reasonable benefit limits (RBLs) will assist people who experience rises and falls in their income throughout their working life: it is intended that RBLs will be based on the highest average salary received by a person before age 65 in any three consecutive years;</PARA>
<PARA> a base salary of $25,000 will be adopted for RBL purposes which will ensure that people with low incomes have an entitlement to a reasonable level of concessionally taxed benefits;</PARA>
<PARA> access to superannuation concessions for the self employed and for employees with little or no employer sponsored superannuation will be improved by increasing the limits on contributions which these people can make and which can be counted as deductions against their taxable income; and</PARA>
<PARA> the pension RBL will be increased to provide for pensions indexed to the CPI with an 85 per cent reversionary benefit to a surviving spouse. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government does not intend to alter the qualifying age for wife's pension.</PARA>
<PARA>Class B Widow's pension was phased out from 1 July 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 10. </PARA>
<PARA>That the Government develop a flexible system of age pension entitlement whereby people approaching the above recommended uniform age of pension entitlement of 65 years may be given the choice of qualifying for a part pension up to 5 years earlier by receiving a rate of assistance reduced on a pro rata basis according to the person's age. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Overseas experience suggests that providing an earlier part pension can encourage early retirement. The Government considers that such encouragement is wasteful of resources and is not in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA>It should also be noted that such arrangements are not compatible with Australian social security arrangements which are based on flat rate non-contributory pensions and benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is committed to providing opportunities for the continued employment and re-employment of older workers. This entails mechanisms to improve employment and labour force participation, to reduce unemployment and welfare dependence and to make adequate provision for the unemployed in the 55-64 age group. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1990, the Government will trial three different models of contact, interview, counselling and referral for 55-64 year old unemployed people. </PARA>
<PARA>During 1989-90 the Government will consult extensively with key community, employer and union organisations to develop a long term strategy for generating attitudinal change about the employment of older workers. </PARA>
<PARA>As part of a process to end age discrimination the Attorney-General will report in 1990 on the need for legislation to outlaw age discrimination in employment practices. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will also monitor the impact of industry and award restructuring on older workers. </PARA>
<PARA>Changes to the administration of Reasonable Benefit Limits for superannuation benefits will provide an incentive for continued workforce participation by older workers. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 11. </PARA>
<PARA>That the age of eligibility for the service pension for ex-servicewomen be increased from 55 to 60 years thereby establishing a common age of service pension entitlement for both ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen, but that this adjustment be made so as not to affect the current population of female service pensioners aged 55-59 years or those women who have already met qualifying service requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government does not propose to alter the qualifying age for service pension. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 12. </PARA>
<PARA>That all age and service pensioners be paid at the standard rate of pension currently payable to single pensioners, irrespective of their marital status. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>This matter is to be reviewed in the final issues paper to be produced by the Social Security Review. </PARA>
<PARA> Research into the income relativities required to provide the same standard of living for single and married income units where the household head is not in the workforce shows that the existing single pension of 60 per cent of the combined married rate is a reasonably accurate reflection of the different cost structures. </PARA>
<PARA>Any change to the current arrangements which directed additional expenditure to increasing the married rate of pension to a level equivalent to the standard rate of pension would decrease any additional assistance available for those groups shown to be in most need. These include those with little or no non-pension income, pensioners in private rental accommodation, those who have been in receipt of pension for a long period and those who live alone. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 13. </PARA>
<PARA>That the Government retain the present 10-year residency eligibility requirement for the age pension, but:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) continue to conduct negotiations with overseas countries so that further reciprocal social security agreements may be concluded; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) consult with the relevant ethnic communities in Australia both in the initial stages of developing agreement proposals and during the official negotiation process. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Australia has current, operating social security agreements with the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Italy. The Agreement with Italy is the shared responsibility style of agreement which Australia now favours. </PARA>
<PARA>An agreement with Canada enters into force on 1 September 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>By the end of 1989 an Agreement with Spain and a revised Agreement with the United Kingdom should be signed-both could enter into force during 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>It is likely that Agreements with Malta, The Netherlands and Ireland and an Understanding with Quebec will be ready for signature during 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>Negotiations are continuing with Portugal and the Federal Republic of Germany. Information exchanges and discussions have begun with Austria, Greece, Yugoslavia, Turkey, Cyprus, Switzerland, the Scandinavian countries and the USA. </PARA>
<PARA>Formal negotiations do not commence until the relevant ethnic community has been consulted and indicates general support for an agreement. Community concerns are taken into account during formal negotiations. Community consultation during the negotiation phase is not appropriate given the confidentiality of government to government negotiations on an international treaty. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 14. </PARA>
<PARA>That, to ensure the income support needs of the aged are met through a means testing process that is fair to all and allows government pensions to be directed to those genuinely in need of assistance, the Government amend the current assets test by requiring those owning houses of high market value to satisfy a separate and supplementary housing test similar to that advocated by the 1984 Gruen Panel of Review as part of its modified `tall poppies' assets test proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Recommendation is rejected unequivocally. It is not Government policy to include the family home in the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 15. </PARA>
<PARA>That the Government:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) widen access to the Pension Loans Scheme by allowing any age or service pensioner to borrow from it, irrespective of their income and ownership of assets, providing they have sufficient capital to repay the amount borrowed plus accrued interest, and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) publicise more widely both the availability and the advantages of the Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Pension Loans Scheme is designed to meet cases of genuine hardship where it is not practical for pensioners to organise their assets to provide for their own income support. </PARA>
<PARA>In view of the concessional interest rate available, an extension is likely to result in a poorly targeted increase in program expenditure and increased administrative costs. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 16. </PARA>
<PARA>That, in giving effect to the Government's stated objective of addressing the need for further changes to the retirement incomes system, especially the need to develop a more integrated approach towards meeting the income needs of the aged through the social security system and the occupational superannuation system, the Government include in its consideration of the reform proposals put to it the option of introducing a two-tiered age pension system which:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) at one level, would provide a flat-rate, non-means-tested entitlement (set at 20 per cent of Average Weekly Earnings) to all people of eligible age, and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) at another level, would provide a means-tested income supplement (set at 10 per cent of Average Weekly Earnings) to those in particular need who are unable to supplement their income in retirement and old age by other means. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government rejects this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>Submissions to the Social Security Review generally agreed that the current system of a means-tested pension and occupational superannuation was the best system for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The means-tested nature of the age pension:</PARA>
<PARA> concentrates assistance on those in most need; and</PARA>
<PARA> provides supplementary assistance to those with moderate amounts of private income. </PARA>
<PARA>The payment of a flat-rate non-means tested entitlement would:</PARA>
<PARA> entail significant costs;</PARA>
<PARA> direct additional assistance to people who in most cases have already benefited from tax concessions for superannuation purposes throughout their working life;</PARA>
<PARA> reduce resources available to assist those with the least income and assets; and</PARA>
<PARA> on the basis of the Committee's costings, appear to entail a reduction in pension for some full rate pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA>Part Two-Income Support Provided through the Occupational Superannuation System</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 17</PARA>
<PARA>That the Department of the Treasury continues to calculate estimates of the cost of occupational superannuation taxation concessions and publish such estimates in each year's annual Budget Papers as well as in its annual Tax Expenditures Statement. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>This is existing policy to the extent it is possible:</PARA>
<PARA> figures are usually not available until about 18 months following the end of the financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 18</PARA>
<PARA>That the Government, noting that it may not always be appropriate that all employees belong to the same scheme, require through regulation, that employers sponsoring schemes for some of their employees, also offer superannuation scheme membership to all employees (including regular part-time employees) aged 18 years or more who have completed a maximum of 1 year's service or the equivalent of this period, with that employer. </PARA>
<PARA>Response to 18 &amp; 19</PARA>
<PARA>The Government through its amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act intends to make it unlawful to discriminate against permanent part-time employees in the terms and conditions relating to superannuation schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 19</PARA>
<PARA>That a lead-in period of 1 year be allowed between the announcement of the new minimum membership eligibility standard and its date of first effect. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 20. </PARA>
<PARA>That the Government amend the Commonwealth Sex Discrimination Act 1984 by repealing section 41 (1) to make it unlawful to discriminate against another person on the ground of the other person's sex or marital status in the terms and conditions relating to a superannuation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 21. </PARA>
<PARA>That the Government repeal section 41 (4) of the Commonwealth Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to make it unlawful to use gender-based actuarial or statistical data to determine contribution and benefit rates. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 22. </PARA>
<PARA>That the Government encourage, through the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, complementary action by the Governments of the States and the Northern Territory to ensure that occupational superannuation schemes operated by them and their respective authorities do not discriminate against women on the ground of sex, marital status or pregnancy. </PARA>
<PARA>Response to 20, 21, &amp; 22</PARA>
<PARA>Legislation to repeal section 41 (1) of the Commonwealth Sex Discrimination Act 1984 and to replace it with more limited provisions is currently before Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>Following enquiries by the Human Rights Commission (now the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission), the Government has taken steps to amend the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to remove the general exemption in respect of superannuation. The effect of this will be to remove most forms of direct discrimination on the grounds of sex and marital status in superannuation practice. At the same time, consistent with Human Rights Commission recommendations, the Bill allows for scope for more limited exemptions, for example, the inclusion in fund conditions of a provision based upon reasonable actuarial data. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has written to all State Premiers and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and has received assurances that State public service superannuation schemes either comply with the standards set in the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1989 or are in the process of being amended to comply. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 23. </PARA>
<PARA>That, as a condition of eligibility for superannuation taxation concessions under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the Government further regulate to require that, as a minimum, employer-financed benefits (except those covered by Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulation 8) be mandatorily vested in accordance with the following age and length-of-service criteria:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) full vesting to apply to all employees aged 30 years and over who have completed 1 year of service;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) graded vesting to apply to all employees aged 18 years and over but less than 30 years such that the proportion of employer-financed benefits vested equals 20 per cent after 1 year service, 40 per cent after 2 years of service and so on, so that 100 per cent vesting is achieved by an employee's fifth year of service;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) periods of service accrued with an employer before the age of 18 to be credited towards the graded vesting standard; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) fund trustees be required to inform all members in writing of the vesting conditions applicable to their superannuation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 24. </PARA>
<PARA>That the new compulsory vesting arrangements apply only to benefits accruing after the date of the introduction of the standards. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 25. </PARA>
<PARA>That a lead-in period of 1 year be allowed between the announcement of the above recommended minimum vesting standards and the date of their first effect. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 26. </PARA>
<PARA>That the new vesting standards be imposed only in conjunction with requirements for the compulsory preservation of vested employer-financed benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>Response to 23, 24, 25 &amp; 26</PARA>
<PARA>The Occupational Superannuation Standards (OSS) Regulations made under the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 impose the following vesting and preservation standards which superannuation funds must comply with in order to be eligible for taxation concessions. </PARA>
<PARA>The current vesting standards require a superannuation fund to vest in full in a member;</PARA>
<PARA> all member contributions and, from a specified date (generally 30 June 1986), all member financed benefits (that is contributions plus earnings); and</PARA>
<PARA> employer financed benefits standards arising from 3 per cent award based superannuation contributions. </PARA>
<PARA>The current vesting standards do not apply to other employer financed benefits flowing from company and industry based superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government recognises the need for a general minimum vesting standard. It also recognises the need to avoid onerous cost burdens on employers and proposes to phase in a minimum vesting standard over a 10 year period. </PARA>
<PARA>Employer financed benefits accruing from 1 July 1995 (other than those already required to be vested under existing standards) will vest in the employee at a rate of not less than 10 per cent per annum so that by the end of the tenth year with an employer there will be 100 per cent vesting of those benefits. This is a minimum standard. It does not prevent an employer, as many already do, from providing a faster vesting process. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 27. </PARA>
<PARA>That, the Government regulate to require that, as a condition of eligibility for taxation concessions under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) employer-financed benefits, which are compulsorily vested in accordance with the Committee's preceding recommendations relating to vesting, also be compulsorily preserved;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) member-financed benefits, which are compulsorily vested in accordance with Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations 6 and 7, also be compulsorily preserved; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) benefits subject to these preservation requirements be preserved until a member's retirement from the workforce at an age of not less than 55 years or earlier in the case of certain contingencies (invalidity and other special circumstances) as otherwise prescribed in accordance with Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulation 11. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Currently superannuation benefits in new schemes or 3 per cent award schemes are required to be preserved until retirement from the workforce at age 55 or later. Some other schemes also require preservation until this age. The Federal Government has decided to standardise the minimum preservation age. </PARA>
<PARA>From 1 July 1995 an amount equal to the minimum level of employer financed benefits required to be vested under the new vesting standard will be required to be preserved until retirement on or after age 55. This requirement applies only to employer financed benefits made after 1 July 1995 and does not apply to any benefits prior to this date. This does not replace the preservation requirement under the existing standards. </PARA>
<PARA>The Insurance and Superannuation Commission will be consulting the superannuation industry, employers and unions in the process of the detailed implementation of these improved vesting and preservation standards. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the Federal Government's intention that the vesting and preservation standards applying from 1995 will be monitored and reviewed with a view to determining the feasibility of further enhancement of vesting and preservation to age 60 and after 2005. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 28</PARA>
<PARA>That, with regard to the form of occupational superannuation benefits:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the Government regulate to make the eligibility of superannuation funds for taxation concessions under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 conditional on employer-financed benefits and tax-deductible `eligible persons'-finance benefits being paid in the form of superannuation pensions;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the regulation not apply where an individual's entitlement commutes to a level of annual superannuation pension income which is unacceptably low;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the introduction of the regulation be co-ordinated with the phasing-in provisions applying to the vesting and preservation of benefits recommended earlier so as to avoid this regulation having any retrospective effect in its design; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the lump sum option continue to be available for benefits funded from non-deductible employee contributions. </PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Government rejects this recommendation. The Treasurer announced in the 1988 Economic Statement that the Government would not restrict the present free choice between lump sum and pension superannuation benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is concerned that superannuation should be used for retirement purposes. The Government is committed to providing people with realistic opportunities and incentives to use lump sums to provide regular income. </PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government has two elements in its strategy for meeting this objective. The first element consists of changes to superannuation Reasonable Benefit Limits to encourage annuities. The second element consists of removing the disadvantage to the purchase of annuities in pension and benefit income tests. </PARA>
<PARA>Superannuation Reasonable Benefit Limits (RBLs) set the maximum amount of tax assisted superannuation a person may receive. The RBL for superannuation pensions and annuities is considerably more generous than that applying to lump sums. </PARA>
<PARA>In May 1988 the Federal Government announced that superannuation funds could provide benefits up to those permitted under the higher pension RBL provided at least half of the benefit is taken as a pension or annuity. The remainder (up to half) may be taken as a lump sum. </PARA>
<PARA>The RBL administration arrangements are to be amended from 1 July 1990 to provide greater incentives for benefits to be taken as pensions and annuities. The new policy flows from a review by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC) of the administration of the Reasonable Benefit Limit guidelines. This review took close account of retirement income policy concerns, particularly with respect to incentives for preservation, the taking of benefits as annuities and the promotion of longer workforce participation. </PARA>
<PARA>In conducting the review the ISC consulted widely with the superannuation industry, business and unions. </PARA>
<PARA>From April 1990 the social security (and veterans') income test will be amended to disregard the portion of an immediate annuity or funded superannuation pension which represents the notional return of the after tax purchase price. The timetable for implementing this change will allow time for consultation with the life insurance and financial advisory industries on the details for implementation. This measure is fundamental to increase incentives for retired people to use lump sum superannuation payments as a source of regular indexed income. It complements superannuation measures which are intended to encourage preservation of superannuation to retirement and the purchase of annuities. </PARA>
<PARA>There is already a significant tax advantage in preserving superannuation benefits in a rollover fund until retirement. This advantage will be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA>From February 1990, a concession will be provided to pensioners and beneficiaries, other than age and service pensioners, to encourage preservation of superannuation benefits to retirement. By disregarding from the income test on an ongoing basis the income accruing on compulsorily preserved superannuation, there will be a closer integration of the Federal Government's social security and superannuation policies. The compulsorily preserved amount will also be disregarded under the assets test. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The comments made by honourable senators opposite after the tabling were nothing short of astonishing and certainly did not indicate a close understanding of the Committee's report. A large number of the Committee's recommendations dealt with the adequacy of the existing pension system. The Committee recommended that the pension be increased to guarantee adequacy for those without private income. By way of response, by April 1990, the Government's commitment to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings will be not only met but also exceeded. The Committee recommended that the Government increase rent assistance. In December 1989 rent assistance will rise by $5 a week, by a further $5 a week in June 1990, and by another $5 a week in September 1990, and will be indexed from March 1991. The Committee recommended that consumer price index adjustments to pension rates be speeded up. Indexation of pensions will be brought forward by 12 weeks, providing pensioners with the speediest CPI indexation in history. The Committee recommended that the Government look to the interaction between the social security and taxation systems. By July 1990, the income test free area for pensioners will be 100 per cent tax free. From July 1991 the income test free area will be indexed. By 1995 pensioners will be completely withdrawn from the tax system. That means that by 1995 no age or service pensioner will pay income tax-a commitment for which the Opposition has failed so far to give bipartisan support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All these issues go to the heart of the issue of adequacy. There seemed to be no understanding of that from honourable senators opposite when speaking to the Government's response to this report. Senator Knowles said:</PARA>
<PARA> When the Government looks at the effect of the assets test and many other measures that it has taken, it will see that many more pensioners are in dire financial straits than some years ago. . . </PARA>
<PARA> For a government that claims to look after people on welfare, it has not been doing a particularly good job as far as pensioners are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>There was also criticism of the special pension rate increase in April 1990 and constant criticism of the Government for not doing enough for pensioners. Yet just a breath or two later, Senator Knowles is criticising the Government for creating a `welfare mentality' where `there is no point in providing for one's retirement because the Government will look after one'. Senator Knowles's remarks clearly suggest a conflict in her understanding or a lack of understanding of the Committee's report. I will not take up any more time. I suggest to honourable senators who seem to have an insufficient understanding of the Government's response to the report that they read it as I have incorporated it by way of refutation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For years under the Gray Government in Tasmania, the timber industry and the conservation groups were at loggerheads over the Tasmanian forests. The Gray Government, with its gung ho development policies, was prepared to allow the wholesale destruction of the beautiful pristine forests of Tasmania for short term gain, never giving a thought, or a cent, for the development of an alternative plantation based timber industry that would both conserve the valuable old forests and provide alternative employment in a sustainable industry. The decision of the Helsham Lemonthyme and Southern Forests Commission of Inquiry removed some, but not enough, of the National Estate areas from exploitation, while about 30,000 tonnes of old forest growth was surrendered to logging as a result. About one-third of the National Estate forests were incorporated into the World Heritage area while the conservation movement sought a moratorium on the rest. A new era in the relationship between the industry and the conservation movement was initiated in May this year with the formation of an historic Government in Tasmania-the Labor-Green Independent accord, the first of its kind in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This year the industry said that it needed about 30,000 tonnes to replace the amount taken away by the Helsham inquiry. It seems that about 11,000 tonnes of this can be found outside the National Estate area. The remaining 18,000 tonnes have been provided by timber resources located in degraded coupes in National Estate areas-an area which amounts to about 300 hectares in all. In exchange for these areas, the industry has agreed to the addition of about 500,000 hectares of pristine wilderness to the World Heritage area to make up a total of about 20 per cent of Tasmania. Significantly, no jobs have been lost in this deal. It is necessary to stress that the logging that is occurring in the National Estate is taking part in heavily degraded areas. The conservation movement in Tasmania has in no way resiled from defending the National Estate. Recognising that the industry was in crisis, it was prepared to locate timber resources in areas which were already considerably degraded and trade those for a considerably larger area of pristine forest. </PARA>
<PARA> A four-person panel, consisting of a representative each from the Forest Industries Association of Tasmania, the Forestry Commission, the union movement and the conservation movement will have decided by next Sunday on the areas to be logged. The Tasmanian Minister for Forests, David Llewellyn, has been successful in helping to negotiate an agreement between the industry and the conservation movement and has delivered a compromise that seems to be more than satisfactory to all parties concerned. The Tasmanian Wilderness Society and the Australian Conservation Foundation held a joint press conference with the unions, the companies, the State Government and the Forestry Commission on 21 August this year. This group is to set up, over the next 12 months, a timber industry plan to move the industry entirely out of the National Estate areas. The two big pulp companies, Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd and Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd, which own two concessions covering the southern forests, have stated that they do not want to log in the National Estate; they just want to be assured of a secure resource base. </PARA>
<PARA> On another front, the big sawmillers also have just completed a six-month study on how they can get out of the National Estate. A broad integrated package for the entire industry in Tasmania is in the making. It will, if successful, be a model for the rest of Australia, particularly for the contentious south-east forests of New South Wales, where the Federal Government is still procrastinating on using the powers it has, and the State Government is continuing to be pig-headed about the issue. Tasmanian Premier Michael Field has already announced the boundaries of the World Heritage areas. Some on the western side have not been included because of their alleged mineral potential. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, has flagged the possibility that the Federal Government may expand the World Heritage area to include these latter areas. I join with the conservation movement to encourage the Federal Government to do so because of the low prospectivity of those areas and the fact that the area's conservation value far outstrips its economic value. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I was going to speak on a serious matter relating to the Australian Wheat Board. Unfortunately, I will have to deal with Senator Jenkins first because of her outburst. On 17 August she slandered me and my family and I objected to it. I will read to the Senate what Senator Jenkins said that I got annoyed about. On page 359 of the Hansard of 17 August 1989 it states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It certainly would have been well known to Senator Panizza at the time, as boys-</PARA>
<PARA>b-o-y-s-</PARA>
<PARA>from Bindoon worked on the Panizza family property. He is not the only Western Australian senator on whose family property they worked . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat: `he is not the only Western Australian senator on whose property they worked'. That is not past tense; it is present tense. So there are 12 of us in the Senate from Western Australia; take Senator Jean Jenkins out, and that leaves 11 senators from Western Australia who are under suspicion. Senator Jenkins continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . but I chose not to allude to that because I had no reason to address any personal remarks. But Senator Panizza has forced my hand in this case. I am surprised that he did not mention it himself . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Jenkins by her own words knew, or she thought she knew, that she had something on me and my family. Then she has the hide to stand up here tonight and say that she did not slander my family. As I have said before in this place I do not mind defending myself. I have had plenty of experience at doing that. But there are people in my family who cannot defend themselves because they are no longer around to answer those accusations. That is why I have asked Senator Jenkins to remove that slander from this record. </PARA>
<PARA> The other night was the first time I challenged Senator Jenkins to repeat her comments outside the Parliament. I will tell her where I challenged her to repeat her comments outside-it was outside our Whip's office. Senator Jenkins stood up here tonight and denied that I had ever said that. That is not the only mistruth that Senator Jenkins has told us today. But I will come back to that later. She has gone on with a lot of other garbage about other Liberal Party members, or Labor Party members for that matter, being contacted. I was not contacted and a lot of my colleagues have said the same thing. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me get back to the reference to this other senator from Western Australia. When we told Senator Jenkins to put up or shut up she came in with that weak-kneed excuse-probably written by somebody else-that she did not want to embarrass that other senator; she would prefer not to mention his or her name. Senator Jenkins will not mention the name of any other senator because she did not have one in mind in the first place. So Senator Jenkins came in and made a totally untrue accusation. She should be judged for what she has said. I still invite Senator Jenkins to speak outside the Parliament so that we can settle this matter once and for all. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now come to the point about threatening people outside this Parliament. Senator Jenkins told us another untruth this evening. She said that I rang Sheila Pearce-if I have her name right-the President of the Child Migrant Friendship Society of Western Australia and that I abused her for half an hour. The biggest lie in this is that Mrs Pearce rang me. What is more, I did not abuse her. We only discussed what was in the Hansard that someone had sent her. All I can say is that I am working as hard as I can for the people who are ex-child migrants from Western Australia and from Australia to help them out if they are, indeed, in need. </PARA>
<PARA> For just a moment can I return specifically to the matter of the boys from Bindoon who worked on the Panizza family property. Senator Jenkins told us that she had two or three or four people tell her that I had said that I had ex-child migrants working on our property or that my parents had employed them on our property. That is a lie: it is a bare-faced lie. I will tell honourable senators why. I have explained to other people that I knew something about the child migrant situation and that I employed two ex-pupils of Clontarf, another Christian Brothers school. In this slanderous assertion, Senator Jenkins said that I employed boys from Bindoon. However, I said to those people that I had employed two ex-child migrants from Clontarf. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not generally in the habit of asking people where they went to school, whether they went to school, whether they belong to the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party of Australia or even the National Party of Australia before I employ them. I only want to know whether they are experienced at the job and what sort of a job they will do. I found out later that these two had been at Clontarf. One of them was 21 years old when I employed him-he was hardly a boy, even if Senator Jenkins was alluding to his having been at Clontarf-and the other one was 26 years old. The 26-year-old hung around for about four years and proved to be a very good and reliable employee and the other fellow hung around for 17 years. I will now cease my remarks on that subject. I hope that this will be the last time I will have to mention this subject in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to some other important matters. I know it is getting late in the evening but I would like to discuss briefly some aspects of the Australian Wheat Board as it looks at the delivery of wheat for this season. You are probably well aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the Australian wheat industry is deregulated. I have a few concerns regarding the content of a circularised letter sent to wheat growers by the Australian Wheat Board relating to the payment for wheat delivered this season. </PARA>
<PARA> Contrary to the system before deregulation, two payments are made on the guaranteed minimum price. Initially, a harvest payment is made and a post-harvest payment is made in March. There are nine options for those payments. Option 8 is the one that concerns me. Under this option farmers can defer the after-harvest payment which is normally made in March until practically whenever they like, but it must be taken by the time the pool is closed which could be in two years time. Option 8 states:</PARA>
<PARA>Deferral of the total `Post Harvest Payment' until a later date nominated by the grower, payment subject to deductions. </PARA>
<PARA>There is also a footnote in the letter which I would like the person who is responsible for these matters to take up to ensure that the right information is provided to wheat growers. The footnote states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is our belief that `HARVEST PAYMENTS'-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the first payment-</PARA>
<PARA>included in the Optional Payments Scheme would be assessed by the Taxation Department in the year of the wheat delivery. However `POST HARVEST PAYMENTS' included in the Optional Payments Scheme may not be assessable as income until the actual payment is made to the grower. </PARA>
<PARA> A ruling is currently being sought from the Taxation Department on the above and if our beliefs are confirmed it would mean that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) There would be no tax advantage in including the `HARVEST PAYMENT' in the Optional Payment Scheme as these payments would be assessed as income in the year of wheat delivery. However growers may wish to include the `HARVEST PAYMENT' in the Optional Payment Scheme in order to minimise interest charges.</PARA>
<PARA>The information contained in the next point worries me and that has placed many farmers in a quandary in that it will have them make decisions concerning these payments which may cause them to fall foul of the Australian Taxation Office later. The footnote continues:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) There could be a tax advantage in including `POST HARVEST PAYMENT' in the Optional Payment Scheme were the grower to schedule this payment to be made after 1 July 1990. This payment could then be assessed as income in the year of payment to the grower. </PARA>
<PARA>I would just like to address that latter point and to point out the concerns I have about it. It is a pity that Senator Walsh is not here to hear this. The notion contained in the option is one that flies in the face of the principle that when a seller has control of the payment he receives, it is normally assessed in the year of sale. Where the seller has no control over receiving the payment, then it is assessed in the year in which it is received. In other words, the Wheat Board is floating the idea in an official letter to the growers. Some growers might not read past paragraph (b), and may take it that they can postpone the second payment to a subsequent financial year and be taxed in that year. For the reasons I have said, they could be quite wrong. I would like the responsible Minister to take that matter up and see whether he can give us a ruling some time in the future so that there will be no confusion in the minds of the growers before they start delivering their wheat later this year, which is not too far away. I did have a few other points, but I have held up the Senate for long enough this evening. I thank the Senate for its time. </PARA>

I will give the Senate an example of how amazing Senator Jenkins really is. I made a speech in the Senate on 29 August 1989 that started at 10.49 p.m. and finished probably 20 minutes later. Senator Jenkins was actually present for the entire speech. In my speech I outlined the grievances that I had against Senator Jenkins and that I wished her either to come in and apologise or to state the facts. A week or so later Senator Jenkins wrote to me and asked whether I would give her the courtesy of explaining to her what it was that I was wanting an apology for, to which I responded, `All the details happen to be in the Hansard of 29 August 1989, pages 537 to 539'.

I did speak to Mrs Pearce. She rang my office the day after my speech in the Senate and was very angry that I had supposedly spoken very disparagingly of her organisation the night before. When my Perth office passed this on, I phoned Mrs Pearce and I said, `Well, that is not so', and I read from Hansard exactly what I had said about her organisation, which appears on page 539. In the interests of time, I will not repeat it tonight. I said absolutely nothing disparaging about the organisation; in fact, I was very sympathetic to the organisation. I was very cross that Senator Jenkins had done her normal trick of trying to get publicity by being outrageous when, in fact, the Child Migrant Friendship Society of Western Australia was the one that had suffered. </PARA>
<PARA> I then went on to question Mrs Pearce about certain things. Senator Jenkins tonight has once again not told the truth in the Senate in as much as she said that I did not quote exactly from Hansard and that I missed out certain words. I can categorically deny that. I very nearly took a point of order at the time to seek a withdrawal, but as she was having so much trouble fumbling around and trying to find everything in the first instance and we waited about five minutes for her to find something later on, I thought, why bother, because the poor old thing really does not have a clue what she is on about. Statements had not been made that I had harassed Mrs Pearce or that I had made her ring Senator Jenkins and made her apologise. I said to Mrs Pearce that what Senator Jenkins had done and was continuing to do was all very sad and the only effective way of stopping her dead in her tracks was by asking her to make the apology or, as Senator Panizza put it, to either put up or shut up, and that would be the end of the story. Mrs Pearce said, `Well, if that is the case, that is fine and that is what I will ask her to do because she is damaging our cause. The whole system is damaging our cause'. Senator Jenkins comes in here tonight and says, `But I did not say that any senators in here had supposedly been contacted and not responded'. She went on to read from Hansard. She stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Pearce reiterated to me today-</PARA>
<PARA>that, is Senator Jenkins-</PARA>
<PARA>that she and other members of the society had previously approached Labor and Liberal members of parliament in Western Australia but these members were not willing to give them support. </PARA>

He then pulls strings to beat people who are not only senior to Senator Jenkins, but who are officer holders in the Parliament whereas Senator Jenkins is not-and the list goes on. Her husband dodges the system. She went on to say that I had said this about the Canadian delegation. The Canadian delegation is not mentioned in my speech. When I took the point of order during Senator Jenkins's speech tonight and I said, `Where is the uncouth behaviour that I had allegedly referred to', she read what I had said in Hansard which in no way reflected on the Canadian delegation, that it had acted in an uncouth manner. I have to say that the Canadian delegation comprised very pleasant, intelligent, capable, competent people. I just wish I could say the same about Senator Jenkins. She summed it up by saying that I had alleged that they were gossiping. They were not gossiping. We simply were having a conversation in a very cool, calm and rational manner which, unfortunately, Senator Jenkins would not know about. The allegations just go on and on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The members of the Canadian delegation-now that she has mentioned them-were just amazed. They were not being nasty, horrible or uncouth; they were just amazed that a member of the Federal Parliament did not seem to know too much. Her husband knew a bit more, but then again, who is the senator? Senator Jenkins still will not come clean. She will still not name the senators to whom she referred, alleging that other Western Australian senators had child labour on their properties. She still will not come clean. She is very brave to come in here and make the allegations, but when it comes to backing up her statements it is a different story. That is very sad, but it is what we have come to expect from Senator Jenkins. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I find it even sadder to think that she has dragged, from what I can gather from a telephone conversation, a very nice lady, Mrs Pearce, through all of this. It is a disgrace. Mrs Pearce is trying to do what I consider to be a very important job. I encourage Mrs Pearce to keep on going, to keep at it, even though Senator Jenkins has caused all of this trouble for her Society. It is very sad that a very nice lady, who is trying to do the best for people who have suffered, has had to go through all of this. </PARA>
<PARA> From the Senate's point of view, we have a senator here from Western Australia who, as I said before, with any degree of luck will not be here much longer. The honourable senator admitted a few weeks ago in one of her many articles that she gets into the papers, courtesy of a staff member who travels on a Royal Australian Air Force plane, that she should not have been elected in the first place. So with any degree of luck, within a short space of time-from what I gather, it might even be by 2 December-we will not have to put up with any of this rot any more and the Senate will be much better for it. I hope that this is the end of the story. It is sad that Senator Jenkins has made the allegations and that she will not back them up. But que sera, sera. I hope that before Senator Jenkins makes any other foolish, wild, scurrilous comments, she will think twice. I hope that her staff will think twice before providing her with information and before phoning around the country to provide inaccurate information because we will not stand for it. I will have great delight in repeating her antics around the electorate because it will show her in a very poor light. It will show that she is prepared to come in here, rant and rave and fiddle around the fringes in a true wimpish fashion but that, when challenged, she has not got the courage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to do that. It is normal practice that there be a duty Minister. But I did not rise to speak about that. On 29 August I asked Senator Tate, in his capacity as Minister for Justice and as Minister representing the Attorney-General, whether he was aware of a recent series of articles and reports in the Australian newspaper concerning the activities of the Yugoslav secret police, the UDBA. In particular, I refer to an article of 29 July this year alleging that the UDBA `has formed close ties with a Federal member of Parliament'. The report stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . a source in the Yugoslav Department of Foreign Affairs in Belgrade . . . said information that may have originated from the MP, a Labor Party backbencher, has shown up in the dossiers of Croatian exiles in Australia, held at UDBA headquarters in the Yugoslav capital. </PARA>
<PARA>I asked Senator Tate:</PARA>
<PARA>Has the Australian Government investigated these allegations, particularly the allegation that the UDBA is operating in Australia? If not, why not? Will it now establish an official inquiry into the allegations? If the Government finds that there are UDBA or other agents provocateurs operating here, is it the Government's policy to expel them? Finally can the Minister assure the Senate that there is no known connection between any Australian Labor Party member of Federal Parliament and the Yugoslav secret police?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tate took that question on notice. Three days later, on Friday, 1 September, he responded:</PARA>
<PARA>I am aware of the articles and the various allegations made in them. I follow the practice of successive Commonwealth governments in not commenting on matters concerning national security. </PARA>
<PARA>In a statement I released later that day following receipt of that answer I said that in my view it was simply not permissible for the Government to be allowed this time to fall back on the excuse of national security. I pointed out that what is involved is, firstly, allegations that a foreign government-in this case Yugoslavia-is conducting clandestine secret police operations of a terrorist nature in Australia; secondly, that certain Australian citizens are the victims of these clandestine operations; and, thirdly, that a Labor member of Federal Parliament is alleged to be aiding and abetting these clandestine operations against Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> I said in that statement that the Australian electorate has a basic right to information about these allegations and that, at the very least, the electorate has a basic right to know whether one of its own elected representatives is deliberately engaged in activities designed to damage Australian citizens. I also pointed out that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), who was at that time in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, should be instructed to pursue these allegations with the Soviet Government while he was there. However, I understand that he did not raise the matter with the Yugoslav authorities nor were these matters raised with him. </PARA>
<PARA> I also understand that Senator Evans decided to go to Belgrade at very short notice. I wonder why that was the case. To my knowledge, Senator Evans has not reported to the Parliament on the reason for that visit to Belgrade at short notice, although he attended a conference of non-aligned countries. However, I understand that the suddenness of his decision to go threw the Yugoslav officialdom into something of a flap. It has not been explained why he decided to visit Belgrade at such short notice. It appears from press reports since his return that he may well have gone to negotiate the reopening of the Yugoslav Consulate in Sydney. I refer to a report in the Australian of 6 September by the foreign affairs correspondent, Roy Eccleston, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Yugoslavia may be allowed to reopen its Sydney consulate-general later this year-about 12 months after the Federal Government ordered it shut after a shooting incident. </PARA>
<PARA>We well remember that shooting incident last year. It led to significant problems and a rupturing of relationships between Australia and Yugoslavia. The consulate was closed and its staff were expelled after the Yugoslav Government refused to hand over an official who had allegedly fired shots that seriously wounded a teenage boy, Josef Tokic, during a demonstration last November. The Opposition has said that it will oppose any reopening of the consulate until answers have been received to the allegations that have been made about the use of Yugoslav consulates as a cover for Yugoslavia's security service. Senator Evans is reported in the same article as having spoken in `glowing terms' about relations between the two countries whilst he was in Yugoslavia. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>relations . . . were already very much back on a sound footing with good economic and political co-operation. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know where Senator Evans got that view but, in the light of recent allegations, I suggest that is a very false approach to have adopted. Why would he do this? Why would he allow the reopening of the consulate under these circumstances? In particular, why would he be prepared to have the Sydney consulate reopened at a time when it is reported also that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) is to reopen its files on Australians suspected of having links with Yugoslav secret service agents? It was reported in the Australian on 19 August that ASIO is to reopen its files and that an ASIO source had told the newspaper that an inquiry would soon be launched into the activities of a number of senior Australian public servants who were known to have had regular contact with identified agents of the Yugoslav secret security organisation-the UDBA-which, as I understand it, is now the Yugoslav Intelligence Service, the YIS. </PARA>
<PARA> Following my question in the Senate last week, to which I have already referred, my colleague Mr Aldred in the House of Representatives on Tuesday this week also raised the activities of the Yugoslav Intelligence Service in Australia. Amongst other things, Mr Aldred discussed the allegations in these reports that there are dossiers in Belgrade, the information in which has originated in Australia from the Yugoslav Intelligence Service. Mr Aldred said in his remarks in the House on Wednesday:</PARA>
<PARA>I am led to believe that several of these dossiers substantially originated from the Yugoslav Welfare Association based at Fitzroy in Melbourne. The Association ostensibly is a non-government community organisation catering for the welfare of Yugoslavs in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>Just exactly how these files containing details on Australian residents found their way from Fitzroy to Belgrade is a mystery but it is a mystery that needs to be investigated as a matter of some urgency. Quite obviously, somebody or bodies facilitated their transfer to the Yugoslavs. </PARA>
<PARA>It is worth noting, as I am advised, that the current Chairman of the Yugoslav Welfare Association and one of its co-founders is the Labor Federal member for Hotham, Mr Lewis Kent. Of course, Mr Kent has now been shoved aside as the member for Hotham for the next election to make way for Simon Crean. Instead, he will be contesting the new seat of Corinella for Labor. It is also worth noting that the Yugoslav Welfare Association has received substantial grants-in-aid funding from the Federal Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. The evidence available to me indicates that that funding now exceeds $100,000. In the House of Representatives yesterday my colleague the honourable member for Mitchell, Mr Cadman, moved:</PARA>
<PARA> That this House expresses its concern that the Australian Government has not been unequivocal in denouncing attempts by the Yugoslav Government to manipulate Australian community groups. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Cadman, a single speaker, spoke to that motion, as only one person is allowed to speak under the rules of the House of Representatives. The single speaker for the Government responding to the motion was the honourable member for Hotham, Mr Kent, the Chairman of the Yugoslav Welfare Association. Perhaps that is not surprising, as Mr Kent was born in Yugoslavia. As I understand it, he has been in Australia since the early 1950s. After his arrival he changed his name from his Yugoslav name, Lajco Kapolnai, to Lewis Kent. Nevertheless, I would have thought that the content of Mr Cadman's motion was of sufficient importance to require a member of the Government with more status and standing than Mr Kent to respond. It was an important, serious motion. I would have thought that it was the sort of motion that a Minister, probably a senior Minister, would normally respond to. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of his speech, Mr Kent said in response to the allegations that dossiers on Australian citizens now with the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs had originated in the Yugoslav Welfare Association in Fitzroy that the only information on individuals held by the Association was the name of the individual and the details of his or her welfare situation or problem. He said that this information was innocuous and that, even if it did get to Moscow, Belgrade or anywhere else, `it would be of no consequence'. Mr Kent also invited a Liberal member or senator to inspect the files of the Association. </PARA>
<PARA> Significantly, Mr Kent did not deny that information on personal files held by the Yugoslav Welfare Association may have found its way to Belgrade via the operations of the Yugoslav Intelligence Service in Australia or through any other route. That lack of denial is extraordinary in itself, particularly as Mr Kent is the Chairman of the Association. But equally extraordinary is his willingness to expose what I would regard as highly personal information on individuals, in effect, to public examination by members of parliament. I wonder what those persons who have placed their confidence and trust in the Yugoslav Welfare Association would think about that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I said was that I found it extraordinary that Mr Kent in the House of Representatives yesterday invited a Liberal member or senator to inspect the files of the Yugoslav Welfare Association, as I understand it, to satisfy themselves that the contents were innocuous. I do not think it is possible for that invitation to have been extended without that information being available, as Senator McKiernan implied. So, with respect, I do not think I am going overboard on what Mr Kent said. I am giving a factual statement of what he said and what the obvious implication of that must be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say again: I wonder what those persons who have placed their confidence and trust in the Yugoslav Welfare Association would think about knowing that perhaps I or some other member of parliament had been invited to look at the files which contained their details. In any association, particularly of a welfare nature, the material in those files would be essentially of a personal nature. I was, therefore, amazed also at Mr Kent's assertion that the personal information on the files held by the Association is innocuous. On the contrary, such information must contain a great deal of information on highly personal matters concerning individuals or at least be of a nature that would lead to the obtaining of such personal data from other sources. </PARA>
<PARA> The allegations that have been made in the press and from other sources about the activities of the Yugoslav secret police in Australia and about the links between the secret police and a Labor member of the Federal Parliament are of the utmost gravity. On the weekend of 29 July the press actually named Mr Ivan Dronjic, the second ranking official in the Yugoslav consulate in Melbourne, as the particular parliamentarian's case minder and said that Mr Dronjic was one of the top ranking Yugoslav intelligence service agents now operating in Australia. A few weeks earlier, the Australian said this:</PARA>
<PARA>One of Europe's top terrorists, Yugoslav hit man Vinko Sindicic, now imprisoned in Scotland for attempted murder, has been revealed as the mastermind behind the biggest terrorist case in Australia's history-the alleged plot by Croatian exiles to launch a bombing campaign in Sydney 10 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>They were convicted, and have been subsequently released. So these matters are very serious. They affect our national security. They affect the institution of Parliament. They go to the very core of our nationhood and our democratic freedoms. As I said in my statement last week and as my colleagues in the House of Representatives have repeated this week, I believe it is essential that there be a full inquiry into these allegations. I think that inquiry should be public. It could be a royal commission or a parliamentary inquiry. I am not advocating one particular form of inquiry over another. But what I am demanding on behalf of all our constituents is that there be a full inquiry into these very serious allegations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Long-winded conspiracy theories at 1 o'clock in the morning are not everyone's cup of tea, even in an institution as notoriously tolerant of ratbaggery and fanaticism as this one is. Nonetheless, I do not want to enter into the debate on the alleged activities of the Yugoslav intelligence agency in Australia or the question of the Australian response to any such alleged activities. I am not in a position to do so, nor is any other member of the Government; nor is any member of the Government likely to be in a position to do so, for the simple reason that, in accordance with the practice of successive governments in this country, none of us comment on operational matters affecting security and intelligence agencies. That is the reason why Senator Short's view of the world has not attracted a more substantial response from the Government than it has, and that is why it will not attract a more substantial response in the future. It is simply not a matter that is appropriate for public response by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I do make the point that the Australian Government does require all missions accredited to Australia to act in accordance with internationally agreed principles governing the conduct of diplomatic and consular staff, and Senator Short can be assured that those principles are very much present to our mind and very much govern the kind of response we make as a government to matters for which there is some element of substantiation. Beyond that, I can comment no further. </PARA>
<PARA> What brought me into the chamber at this ungodly hour was the fortuitous occurrence of my switching on the sound on a hitherto mercifully silent television screen to hear Senator Short making some gratuitous observations about my recent visit to Belgrade and some gratuitous assumptions about what I was doing there. Let me briefly set the record straight. The reason I was in Belgrade was to attend a meeting of the non-aligned summit, the preparatory meeting of the Foreign Ministers. It was not a visit I had originally planned to make, because Parliament was sitting and it was outside the program of overseas visits that I had originally contemplated. But when the timing of the second Paris ministerial meeting on Cambodia was established and it became apparent that one of the things governing the timing of that Paris meeting was its conjunction with the Belgrade meeting, to which many of the Paris Ministers were planning to go, I took advantage of the opportunity of being in Europe to pay a two-day visit to a conference which is probably second only to the United Nations General Assembly itself as a meeting ground and an important multilateral gathering. In particular, it is one to which Australia is invited, and has been for years, to attend as an observer and an occasion which offers a tremendous opportunity for a broad-ranging set of ministerial contacts. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, in the course of my only two full days that I was present in Belgrade, I had 18 substantial bilateral meetings-11 with Commonwealth Foreign Ministers; four with either Foreign Ministers or senior officials from Saudi Arabia to talk about the live sheep issue; one with Mexico to talk about regional economic cooperation and a variety of related matters; one with Brazil to talk about the Antarctic initiative and some other related matters; and one with Mozambique to talk about southern Africa. In addition to those meetings, I had three meetings with Yugoslav Government Ministers. I would appreciate it if Senator Short would give me the courtesy of listening to the terms of this response, but he is incapable apparently of doing even that. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not raise the opening of the consulate. The reopening of the consulate was raised with me, and I am about to tell Senator Short, if he will listen, what exactly transpired. The situation is that when the matter was raised with me-and it was put to me in forceful terms, in particular by Foreign Minister Loncar, that it was time for that consulate in Sydney to be reopened-I indicated to him, in the only conversation in which the issue arose substantively, although it was mentioned in passing in the other two, that the question of the reopening of the Sydney Consulate-General would not be considered by the Australian Government until at least towards the very end of this year. As with all decisions of this kind, the decision to close the Consulate-General will, of course, be reviewed in due course. No decision has been made to reopen the Consulate-General at this stage. Nothing I said to any of the Yugoslav Ministers to whom I spoke would give rise to any belief on their part that such a decision had been made. Nothing I said would give rise to any belief on their part other than that we would possibly be reconsidering the matter towards the end of this year. It should not be assumed that any such decision will be made at the end of this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The general point I made to my interlocutors-I do not have the transcript with me-was that feelings in Australia had been very strong on that issue. We regarded what happened as intolerable. That strength of feeling was shared by the Government. We reacted accordingly at the time. We had wanted to take criminal proceedings against the consular officer concerned but that was made impossible by the particular reliance on the consular privileges that was used by the Yugoslav authorities at the time, in circumstances we all know and which I do not need to rehearse. I made the point that a very significant cooling-off period, as it were, or response period, would be necessary before any such reopening should be contemplated. </PARA>
<PARA> That is all I need to say to put the matter squarely on the record. In other respects, the bilateral relationship between our two countries is, as it always has been, in reasonably good shape. That was an essentially isolated incident. It was an unhappy and unfortunate incident with potentially tragic consequences. Mercifully, they were less than tragic so far as the injury to young Josef Tokic was concerned. Nonetheless, what happened was totally indefensible and the Government has made that clear on innumerable occasions. It is a decision that we will review in due course but the time for review of the decision has not yet come. That was made perfectly clear to the Yugoslav authorities in the course of a visit that was not a bilateral visit and not a visit made for the purpose of discussing or negotiating, as Senator Short intimated, anything to do with this particular question but a visit to attend a very important multilateral meeting. It was a meeting at which I took the opportunity to make a very large number of very important calls. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) Public Service procedures require some Commonwealth officers, whose work involves access to commercially sensitive information, to seek assent before taking up outside employment. These procedures do not have application to Ministerial staff.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Mr Hickman informed the Minister of his decision to take up outside employment on 28 September 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I understand that an individual's previous employment is not relevant to the acceptance of their registration as a lobbyist in the General Register.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Arvin Consultancy has had contact with the Defence Minister's Office, and other Minister's offices, on several occasions since it was established. Arvin Consultancy has no preferential access to the Minister's Office.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In 1989-90 my Department expects to use a total of 15,000 reams of paper at a cost of $68,000. This includes the cost of recycled paper which I have introduced into my office for media releases and general correspondence. The Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories is adopting a similar program.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department's preliminary evaluation found that the increased use of recycled paper has no adverse effects upon office equipment.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department is investigating additional uses for recycled paper, and is increasing its use for general administrative purposes. In addition, my Department has implemented a paper management scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) to (5) As was announced by the Prime Minister in his Statement on the Environment on 20 July 1989, the Minister for Administrative Services and I are investigating the use of recycled and unbleached paper in Commonwealth Government offices.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services has established an inquiry into the use of recycled paper with the following terms of reference:</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to Administrative Services' service-wide activities</PARA>
<PARA>1. List all contracts involving the use of paper products and document their paper content, scope of usage and approximate annual value. Contracts will include:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) those covering writing, copying and printing paper; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) those covering all paper products other than writing, copying and printing paper.</PARA>
<PARA>2. For each category of paper use, identify the minimum performance specification to be met by the paper product.</PARA>
<PARA>3. Define what recycled paper is, its qualities, characteristics, and costs.</PARA>
<PARA>4. Following consultation with relevant agencies, assess the extent to which the above contracts can and should (or cannot and should not) be sourced from recycled (and/or less highly bleached) paper.</PARA>
<PARA>5. Recommend an implementation strategy covering the appropriate use of recycled paper by Commonwealth Government Agencies, including, as necessary, a strategy for gaining Government approval for relevant recommendations which extend beyond the authority of the Minister for Administrative Services.</PARA>
<PARA>6. Prepare a comprehensive report on the above matters for consideration by the Minister for Administrative Services not later than 30 September 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to Administrative Services' internal activities</PARA>
<PARA>1. Review existing recycling policies and practices and assess the scope for improvements.</PARA>
<PARA>2. Report to the Minister by 30 September 1989 in relation to internal recycling policies and other areas where there is scope within the portfolio (i.e. in addition to contracts) to increase the use of recycled and less highly bleached paper.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australia and New Zealand Environment Council has agreed to establish a working group to develop standards for recycled paper for government use and to examine further uses for low grade recycled paper. In addition, all portfolio ministers have been asked by the Prime Minister to report to me on their departments' wastepaper recycling strategies and ways to improve or extend those strategies.</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister intends to report early next year on the implementation of the measures announced in his Statement, including the results of the investigations into departments' use of recycled paper and their wastepaper recycling strategies. My Department has implemented a major paper management and recycling program in its central office. This is working well and could be expanded across the public service. I shall continue to promote the expansion of this program.</PARA>
