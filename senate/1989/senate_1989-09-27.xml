<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>

<TITLE>Community Services and Health Legislation</TITLE>
<PARA>To the President and members of the Senate assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> We, the undersigned, oppose changes to general medical practice contained in Community and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, on the following grounds.</PARA>
<PARA> 1. We oppose legislation which creates two classes of general practitioners and two classes of patients. Medicare is for all Australians. All Australians should receive the same Medicare rebates when consulting the doctor of their choice in any general practice or specialised area of general practice.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. We oppose this legislation as it ignores the needs of women as patients and as doctors. It devalues women's health, and it will discourage women from, not only becoming general practitioners, but entering medicine.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. We oppose this legislation as it jeopardizes the confidentiality of the patient-doctor consultation. Doctors on this Vocational Register must release patients' confidential clinical records for examination by the Independent Peer Review Organization and also, information may be further released to other `relevant' authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate will reject the proposed changes to general medical practice contained in the Community and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989.</PARA>

<PARA> That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life.</PARA>

<PARA>The Honourable President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule.

<PARA> Medicare cannot pretend to be a universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access to items 6469, 274 and 275 on the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion.</PARA>

<PARA> (c) notes the statement made by the Director of the World Bank on 26 September 1989 that developing countries should reduce military spending, which means that there is a contradiction between Australia's trying to increase its military exports in South East Asia and beyond, while at the same time being a member of the World Bank;</PARA>

<PARA> (b) expresses its shock that the Budget detailed a sorry trail of broken election promises, including the introduction of an immediate cut in petrol tax, the provision of a much-needed cardiac unit, an increase in teacher numbers and an extra 30 police, all of which have now either been shelved or forgotten in the luxury of Government;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) recognises that, despite assurances by Mr Field to the contrary, overall tax collections by his Labor/Green Government will still rise by $31.6 million or 1.1 per cent in real terms and Tasmanian home owners are to be slugged by a massive 38.6 per cent rise in land tax;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) acknowledges that the $25 million cut in the State's capital works program, including a mere $3 million for new projects, a 9 per cent reduction for roadworks and a 6 per cent cut for public housing will only serve to worsen Tasmania's unemployment crisis; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) recognises that the only 20,000 new jobs Mr Field will succeed in creating will be on the mainland as an ever-increasing number of young Tasmanians will now be forced to leave their homes to find work.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate now has before it the National Health Amendment Bill 1989, the purpose of which is to increase the maximum general patient contribution for prescribed drugs supplied under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) from the present $11 to a new level of $12. I should say at the outset that the Opposition does not oppose this piece of legislation but I make--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the only reference you are going to make to it too, isn't it?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. But I make it clear that in the committee stage of this Bill we will move to insert an additional clause to bring about the overturning of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal (PBRT) decision of 28 August 1989, which was the subject of a Bill introduced into the Senate by me and passed a couple of weeks ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's proposal to increase the maximum patient contribution from $11 to $12 is estimated by the Government to achieve savings of $10m in 1989-90 and $17m in the full financial year. The Bill also provides for the indexation of the patient contribution so that there will be an automatic increase in the maximum general patient contribution calculated according to a formula which is set forth in the legislation now before us. This will be another example of the way in which this Government continues to increase imposts and charges on the Australian people by a system of automatic indexation rather than coming back to the Parliament from time to time in order to front the Parliament with its views about increases in charges. Honourable senators will recall that taxes on petroleum products and retail taxes on items such as tobacco and alcohol are now increased by automatic indexation so that prices increase automatically at set periods during the year in accordance with a formula, which very few people actually understand. Australian taxpayers and consumers are required to pay more without the Government having to come to the Parliament on a regular basis to justify its seeking to increase these taxes and its revenue in this fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the Opposition does not propose to seek to strike out the automatic indexation provisions within this legislation. As I said, we do not oppose the Bill. We are committed to the preservation of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme as an effective and efficient means of delivery to the community of the most modern and up to date medications at subsidised and affordable prices. It is true, nevertheless, that some aspects of the system ought to be more thoroughly investigated. For example, it is quite clear that a large number of people in receipt of subsidised pharmaceuticals could well afford to pay more realistic prices. Some of the people who hold health care cards which allow them the maximum rebate under the scheme are nevertheless in a position to pay more out of their own resources rather than be subsidised to the extent that they are by the taxpayers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> To come back to the central issue in this legislation, I pose the question: What will consumers get for the extra dollar that they have to pay for their PBS prescriptions? Will they receive the same level of service from pharmacists that they currently enjoy? Will they continue to have convenient access to the services of a pharmacist? I say that, if the Government continues down the path that it is currently pursuing in relation to pharmacies, the answer to both of those questions will undoubtedly be no. </PARA>
<PARA> In its April 1989 economic statement the Government set PBS savings at $31m in 1989-90, $96m in 1990-91, and $156m in 1991-92. Obviously, some of these savings will result from the matter which is before the Senate this morning, that is, the increase in the maximum general patient contribution. I remind the Senate, however, that the Government's own estimate is that it is looking here at a saving of only $10m in the current financial year and $17m in a full year. That falls far short of the $31m this year, the $96m in the next financial year and the $156m in the financial year after that which the April 1989 statement said was going to be saved. The principal way in which the Government aims to make these cuts, and which will be the subject of the debate in the committee stage, is by the attack which it is making on the remuneration of individual pharmacists. That debate in the committee stage will allow us to explore some of those issues in greater detail. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it appropriate at this point to put on the record some of the proposals which the Liberal and National parties have advocated in terms of the way in which we would operate the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, which is the subject of change in this legislation. I say quite clearly that we would seek to maintain the PBS, endorsing its underlying principles of subsidising the provision of the safest, most effective and modern therapeutic goods and services and directing the greatest assistance to those in greatest need. We would act in a way which is totally consistent with the view that pharmacists are both highly skilled and the most accessible health care professionals in the community. They are uniquely qualified and well placed to deliver a most comprehensive service, elements of which include the dispensing of prescribed medications, counselling patients on medication regimes, public education on drug use and abuse and assistance in preventive medicine programs. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said on the last occasion when this matter was before the Senate, the primary health care advice which is given by pharmacists to people who come into their retail outlets is of enormous benefit to the whole community. It saves government considerable amounts as people seek advice from their pharmacists instead of going to medical practitioners and paying for that advice. They feel quite safe, quite secure, in going to their local pharmacy to seek that advice. Very often they go into a pharmacist's shop seeking advice, not necessarily making any purchases but using the pharmacist as a health care adviser, if not provider, in those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> We would be seeking to achieve improvements in the PBS by measures such as amendment of the National Health Act, which governs the operation of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal, to create a body which has better understanding of the role of community pharmacy-again, that was the subject of an earlier debate in this place-developing a formula for the calculation of remuneration based on allowances for mark-up, dispensing costs and professional services and for the regular adjustment of remuneration in line with changes in the consumer price index; the removal of price controls on items costing less than the maximum patient contribution, and acceptance on the part of the Government that pharmacists' manual and computerised claims must be processed and paid without delay; an active consultative arrangement between government and pharmacies involved in the supply and delivery of pharmaceutical goods and the services to deal with matters outside the scope of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal or its replacement; and, finally, a review of the activities of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority to ensure that they make effective and efficient contributions to the national health care system. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of the problem which we are now facing in terms of pharmacy in Australia results from the Government's bandaid policies in terms of the way in which the pharmaceutical benefits scheme now operates. During this current debate the Government has made changes on a number of occasions. Following the determination of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal of 28 August and the outcry which that produced, the Tribunal itself has realised that it needs to undertake reviews in a number of areas. It has agreed that it needs to undertake a review of the cost of dispensing high-priced drugs as a result of its decision. It has clearly indicated that the criteria required for the special essential pharmacy allowance that the Tribunal recommended should be paid to pharmacies which may not be economically viable but which are needed to supply the PBS drugs benefit to the community need to be reviewed and that there ought to be a review of the $15 an hour used by the Tribunal in calculating notional pharmacy salaries-a ridiculous decision for it to have come to. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators know full well that the Pharmacy Guild of Australia is proceeding in the Federal Court of Australia for a review and an overturning of the PBRT decision. It is expected that that case will be heard on 12 October. I remind honourable senators of the previous determination of the Federal Court by His Honour Mr Justice Northrop in relation to the last occasion an attempt was made by the Government to cut the remuneration to pharmacists. His Honour held in that case that the decision arrived at by the Tribunal should be struck down because it was a decision which no reasonable person acting on the facts available to him could have made. He believed that the decision of the Tribunal was manifestly unfair and should not have been made. </PARA>
<PARA> On a previous occasion I drew attention to the comment made in the 28 August determination of the Tribunal, which took a sideswipe at His Honour Mr Justice Northrop. It quoted what His Honour had had to say in relation to the Tribunal's duty. His Honour said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Tribunal is not concerned to determine the remuneration of approved pharmacists. </PARA>
<PARA>The Tribunal, at paragraph 6.2 of its report, said:</PARA>
<PARA>This comment by his Honour is not to be taken too literally. </PARA>
<PARA>One can see that the attitude of the Tribunal, even when rebuked by the judiciary, is one of telling the judiciary exactly what it thinks of it, treating the judiciary with the same degree of contempt with which it treats the pharmacists-and, indeed, the same degree of contempt with which the Minister treats the pharmacists; I shall return to that in just a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> It takes a great deal, as honourable senators would know, for pharmacists to motivate themselves to do such things as go out and doorknock individual electorates, but honourable senators would be aware that in Melbourne pharmacists have doorknocked in the electorates of Aston and Jagajaga to indicate the extent to which they have community support for the maintenance of their position against the attempts of the Government to disadvantage them substantially. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has already changed its mind on one aspect, and that is the special allowance to be paid to pharmacies in remote locations. It was announced on 25 September, or thereabouts, that the Government was moving to placate the country pharmacists in the dispute over cuts to dispensing fees. It announced that chemists with small businesses more than 10 kilometres from approved pharmacies will receive a special allowance worth about $12,000 a year. It is understood that about 400 of Australia's 5,600 pharmacies will benefit, most of them in country areas. The allowance will be available to pharmacists who are at least 10 kilometres from the nearest approved pharmacy, dispense fewer than 15,000 claimable prescriptions a year and are open at least 20 hours per week. That was a recognition that the Government had got that element of the determination on pharmacy remuneration wrong and needed to correct it. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague Senator Knowles says, as soon as the Government is put under a little pressure it can change that bit. Indeed, we will see in a moment that it is prepared to change other bits. The Senate will recall that the determination of the Tribunal proposed that the 25 per cent wholesale mark-up under the scheme should be abolished, thereby making it uneconomical for a number of high cost pharmaceutical products to be stocked and carried by pharmacies. The Government realised it had made another error and is now proposing that, instead of being reimbursed by the Government for the surcharge currently levied on drugs by wholesalers, as recommended by the Tribunal at an additional hearing on this issue last week, a new fee will come through a 3 per cent increase on wholesalers' margins, going up, therefore, to 13 per cent. This will cost the Government an additional $3m to $5m each year. This new 13 per cent margin will replace the existing surcharge levied by wholesalers and will apply only to drugs costing more than $45.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Government thinks that will solve the problem of pharmacies having to carry high cost drugs at their own expense, it is in for a rude shock. As Mr Robert Davies, the Chief Executive of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, has made clear, there is still no incentive for pharmacists to carry these drugs, and people are still likely to have to wait for pharmacists to buy in these higher priced items in order to secure their proper remuneration, and not be required to carry the cost of subsidising the Government's scheme out of their own pockets. </PARA>
<PARA> The key to the whole dispute between the Government and the pharmacists lies in the attitude which this Government, in particular the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples), has taken towards this highly skilled and dedicated group of professionals in the community. The approach which Mr Staples, the Minister responsible for the scheme, has taken towards the pharmacy profession and individual pharmacists has been absolutely disgraceful. They have been threatened, bullied and intimidated. For example, an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 25 September states:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Staples warned that the $12,000 handout-</PARA>
<PARA>which was proposed as part of a rationalisation scheme for pharmacies-</PARA>
<PARA>would be withdrawn if the Federal Court overturned the Tribunal's decision. He said chemists faced the added risk that an adverse court decision would make pharmacists even worse off by returning remuneration to 1981 levels. </PARA>
<PARA>I draw attention to this whole question of the court's arm's length principles and the role of the Tribunal and the Government in this matter. Senators will recall that when the pharmacists rejected the Minister's offer in May, and said that the matter ought to be determined differently, the Minister told them, `If you reject my offer you will end up being worse off under the recommendations of the Tribunal'. At the same time he has pretended that the Tribunal is entirely independent of and at arm's length from the Government. Yet he was in a position to say `You either take this offer now or else you will be worse off as a result of the Tribunal's determination'. That clearly indicates that the Tribunal is not properly independent of the Government. The myth which the Minister has tried to peddle that dealing with the Tribunal is dealing at arm's length is simply not correct. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have a situation where the Minister says `If you go to the Federal Court and you seek from the court a proper protection of our position you will be worse off'. In other words, he is threatening people that they should not seek to use those legal remedies which they have available to them. If they do seek to secure protection under the rule of law, they will be financially worse off if this Minister has anything to do with it. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not only is that blackmail, as Senator Knowles says, but I was absolutely staggered to see a statement made by a public servant, Dr Jeff Harmer, who is apparently Assistant Secretary of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Division within Mr Staples's Department, a statement which the Sydney Morning Herald reports in these terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Harmer said chemists could be big losers from a win in the Federal Court, in line with a recent precedent where pathologists won in court but ended up worse off. He said the chemists were `risking absolute disaster' by appealing.</PARA>
<PARA>When public servants get into the business of acting as agents for Ministers in the process of threatening people who seek to access their proper legal rights through the court system, Ministers have responsibilities to deal with those public servants. I doubt whether this Minister will do so, but he ought to, because that is a disgraceful sort of threat for a public servant to make against citizens seeking protection of their rights under the judicial system of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has sought to split and divide the pharmacy profession. Earlier this month the Government moved to establish a new body which it expected to provide it with advice. Mr Staples said that he would be approaching people whom he described as more moderate members of the Guild and other influential pharmacy groups which he believed would cooperate with him in undermining the position of the Guild and allow him to negotiate with them in a way which would suit the Government's agenda. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>There are a lot of people, particularly older people, who think the hotheads are going to cause them a problem. </PARA>
<PARA>By `hotheads' Mr Staples was referring to the elected officials and the senior members of the Guild. He said that they were concerned that `hardliners' were going to destroy the viability of the profession and, therefore, he was going to isolate what he regarded as the big, tough pharmacists and find a group of `moderate' pharmacists, so-called, to cooperate with him in splitting the profession. The Australian on Wednesday, 13 September, under the heading `Split in pharmacy guild may end row' commenced its article with these words:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government claimed yesterday it had forced a split in the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and was now confident of a quick resolution to the industrial dispute over cuts to dispensing fees. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the typical approach of the Hawke Labor Government-divide, separate and set people at each other's throats. The Government tries to split people; it tries to set one group of professionals against another to achieve its overall aims. But the Federal Government's attempt to split the Pharmacy Guild of Australia backfired badly. One member of the Government's new advisory panel of so-called moderate pharmacists, which was announced on 12 September, indicated that he might pull out in disgust along with other members. The Chairman of the Community and Pharmacy Support Group, Mr Jim Jackson, predicted the collapse of the advisory panel because it had been formed by the Minister in haste and even without the consent of some of the people named to be on it. Mr Rod Hammond, a member of the new advisory panel which included presidents of the State branches of the Guild, said that he had not formally agreed to join the panel and would be reconsidering his position. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I will not be party to anything which divides the profession. </PARA>
<PARA>On 15 September 1989 in the Sydney Morning Herald it was reported:</PARA>
<PARA> The president of the Queensland branch of the guild, Mr Richard James, wrote to the minister responsible for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, Mr Staples, yesterday saying he had looked forward to making a `positive contribution' to resolving the dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>The article went on, however, to indicate that Mr James had decided to resign from the advisory committee and he is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> However, I was subsequently concerned and dismayed at statements attributed to you-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Mr Staples--</PARA>
<PARA>by the media-statements that my membership of the panel represented `a split in the Pharmacy Guild of Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA>People quit this so-called advisory panel because they saw that the Minister was making an attempt to split their profession, to divide their Guild and to set people against each other. That has not worked and it will not work. At a meeting of pharmacists held on 7 September in Parramatta where some 5,000 employees in the pharmacy profession met a resolution was passed which had several parts to it, the first of which was:</PARA>
<PARA> That this meeting endorses the actions that are today taking place in all states of the Commonwealth-</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate that that was the two-hour shutdown of pharmacies-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to show the Hawke Government and in particular his minister Staples that we are unified and refute his statement that we are a group of HOTHEADS. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course they are not; they are dedicated, skilled, professional people who object to being abused by the Minister, to being threatened by his public servants and to having their remuneration cut by his so-called arm's length tribunal in a fashion which is detrimental to their economic welfare at a time when they are under considerable pressures, when threats are being made by the Minister to transfer more and more pharmacy business into supermarket arrangements and when they know that the basis upon which the Tribunal came to its determination was fundamentally flawed. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not alone in this view, as my colleague Senator Knowles will undoubtedly be saying much the same later in the debate. Mr Graeme Campbell, a member of the House of Representatives for the electorate of Kalgoorlie, a member of the Australian Labor Party, wrote a letter to Mr Jim Snow, the Chairman of the Caucus back bench pharmacists liaison committee. We should remember that this was the great committee Mr Snow and Mr Lee were to get together. They were going to fix up the Government on behalf of the pharmacists. By gee, they had that all lined up; they had promises; they had Senator Aulich telling everybody in Tasmania that he would look after their interests in northern Tasmania by fixing up the Minister too. Mr Lee from the electorate of Dobell and Mr Snow from the electorate of Eden-Monaro were going to set out the facts and they were going to straighten out Mr Staples. What did it all come to? Absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Campbell, however, wrote to Mr Snow indicating that he believes that Mr Peter Staples is treating backbenchers `like idiots'. Those words were contained in Mr Campbell's letter relating to the pharmaceutical benefits issue. The letter goes on to say that it was Mr Campbell's view that `the confrontationist and emotional atmosphere being generated by some of the absurdities coming from the Minister's office'-those are his words-were central to the way in which this debate was being unveiled in the community. Mr Staples therefore stands condemned by one of his own backbenchers for the divisive role that he has played in this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by drawing attention to the point with which I started, namely, the service provided by pharmacies to the Australian community. I refer to an article by Hammarstrom and Westerholm, two Swedish policy specialists, which appeared in a publication called the World Health Forum last year. That is a publication of the World Health Organisation in Geneva. Under the heading `Pharmacists to the fore' the article makes the point that in Sweden, as in Australia, pharmacists are becoming increasingly a part of the front line battle against community ill health. If we fail to understand that, then we will be short-changing the public and, indeed, the Australian taxpayer. Ultimately, we will be prejudicing those policies which are needed to improve community health. The article indicates that pharmacists come into contact with far more patients than do other primary care centres and ought, as a result, to be regarded as one of the cornerstones of primary health care in this country. We cannot afford to have a government which continues to make pharmacists and the pharmacy profession the scapegoats for its own financial problems in terms of the cost of the PBS and the confusion which exists in the national and public health schemes around this country at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, we will not oppose the National Health Amendment Bill 1989 because we accept the arguments that the Government has put forward about the increase in the maximum contribution rate from $11 to $12. We draw attention to the fact that the Bill also indexes these contributions so that in fact the cost to individual consumers will creep up, unbeknown, surreptitiously, quarter by quarter or half year by half year, without the Parliament being asked to approve those increases. That is a policy decision which the Government has made. We will not seek to interfere with that. We will, however, in the committee stage come back to the question of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal determination of 28 August. We will seek to overturn that once again and require the House of Representatives to deal specifically with that matter, unlike the legislation which the Senate has already passed and which the House of Representatives can simply decline to debate. For those reasons, we will support the Bill and move the committee stage amendment in due course. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the face of it, the National Health Amendment Bill 1989 is a very simple Bill. As has already been explained, it seeks merely to increase in line with the cost of living the maximum patient contribution for pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) drugs from $11 to $12 and then, moving on from that, to put in place a system of continuing indexation so that that maximum patient contribution can be kept in line with the cost of living over the succeeding months and years. However, as simple as it may seem on the surface, the introduction of this legislation in the Senate does open up the question of the adequacy of the way in which the Government has been dealing with pharmaceutical benefits, not only in regard to this Bill and the recent debates on the Opposition's private member's Bill in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal determination, but also in regard to other debates late last year in relation to the movement of drugs from the general list to the authority only list. This resulted in a number of those drugs being subsequently moved back to the general list as it was realised that the basis for the decisions in relation to some of those drugs was inappropriate. At that stage I called for a review of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme in toto. I gave notice of a motion in the Senate calling for that review. When I sought to move that as a formal motion the process was objected to, so it remains on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I raise again the very important need totally to review the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, not just in the context of the cost of this drug against that drug, but in relation to the alternative modalities of treatment which are available. Is it appropriate to look at the costs of expensive drugs vis-a-vis cheaper drugs in isolation from what other things might happen to the patient being treated with those drugs? For instance, it may well be that the use of more expensive drugs on some occasions causes a patient to spend less time in hospital. There is some controversy regarding the Federal Government's allowance to the States in relation to patient bed days in hospital, but the average figure would be about $150 per day. Clearly, we make a very substantial saving if we use a drug which causes a patient to spend one day less in hospital, but that saving does not accrue to that area of accounting which covers the PBS; it accrues in other areas such as hospital costs, part of which may well be borne by private health insurance. Nonetheless, it is a real cost that has to be borne in the community somewhere. It is that total social costing in relation to the PBS which needs to be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA> As we have frequently debated in this place, there may be alternative modes of preventative action which may be a great deal more effective than allowing people to become ill and then having to treat them with drugs. For instance, we still allow, without restriction, the promotion of a whole raft of unhealthy foods on the market which contain large amounts of sugar, fat or salt. The companies that manufacture and promote the sale of these things claim their advertising as a tax deduction. So until recently 49 per cent of the cost of that advertising was borne by the public through avoided tax. Now, a substantial portion of that cost is borne by the community through avoided tax even with the lower rate of tax. At the same time, we run relatively minuscule programs, in terms of cost, to convince the public that it is desirable that they avoid those foods. Would it not be more desirable to do something about the amounts which are spent to promote more healthy diets in the community and to avoid later the more expensive drugs which are necessary to treat patients with coronary heart disease, patients who need coronary bypass operations, and patients suffering from hypertension and a whole range of other diseases? As I understand it, no study along those lines has been done, but that is precisely the sort of investigation that is needed if we are to come up with a pharmaceutical benefits scheme which is integrated and dovetails into a total health care program which is strongly oriented towards health care and not illness treatment. By the very nature of things, the majority of drugs are oriented towards sickness treatment rather than health care and health protection. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the distribution of costs of drugs on the PBS-I took these figures out this morning-we find that a very large proportion of drugs which are now listed on the PBS fall below the $12 cost. This Bill seeks to introduce a maximum patient contribution of $12, the presumption being that the Government considers that $12 is a reasonable amount for a patient to pay. When I look at these figures I find that of the drugs on the general list, 74 per cent cost less than $12, 26 per cent of those on the authority only list cost less than $12 and, in total, nearly 60 per cent of all the drugs on the schedule cost less than $12. In other words, it may well be appropriate, if the Government considers that $12 is a reasonable amount for a patient to pay as a maximum contribution, to simply remove some 60 per cent of the drugs on the PBS-namely, those that fall below that $12 mark-and allow patients to pay the full cost of those drugs. The total costs may well be less than having a doctor write out a PBS prescription with all the associated costs of remuneration of the pharmacist and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly, when one moves up the cost scale, 14 per cent of the drugs on the general list cost between $12 and $20; 15 per cent of the authority only drugs and 14 per cent of total drugs cost between $12 and $20. In the expensive class-drugs costing over $100-only 2 per cent on the general list cost more than $100; 16 per cent on the authority only list and 7 per cent of the total number of drugs on the PBS. I recognise that these figures do not represent the cost to the Government, because clearly fewer or more of the cheaper drugs, or fewer or more of the more expensive drugs, may be prescribed. Therefore, we need to look at the cost of a single prescription, multiplied by the number of times prescriptions for those particular drugs are written, in order to determine the total cost of those drugs to the PBS, the Government and the community. However, it would seem that a substantial reduction in both government and overall costs could be achieved if a large number of cheaper drugs were simply removed from the list. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill, as has been pointed out in the second reading speech and by Senator Puplick, is simple and straightforward, but it does open up the way in which the Government has dealt with the pharmacists in the recent past through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal determination. Honourable senators will recall that several weeks ago the Australian Democrats introduced a private member's Bill into the Senate to disallow the result of that determination. That private member's Bill was superseded by a similar Bill from the Opposition. The Opposition's Bill was debated and passed through this chamber. As Senator Puplick has pointed out, that Bill now resides in the other chamber and has little chance of being debated there. </PARA>
<PARA> I admire the Opposition for introducing a similar amendment to this Bill, because it will force the Government to consider the matter properly in the parliamentary context. Therefore, the Australian Democrats will support the Opposition's amendment in relation to the disallowance of the Tribunal's determination when we reach the committee stage. We certainly express the hope that when the Bill goes to the House of Representatives in an amended form, the House of Representatives will see fit to set in place the appropriate and comprehensive review of the PBS and pharmacists' remuneration which should have been carried out. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has stated that the purpose of the recent determination was to remove 23 per cent of the PBS costs as they relate to pharmacists' remuneration. Interestingly, according to the explanatory memorandum, the Bill will have the effect of increasing the patient contribution-or conversely of decreasing the Government's cost-by $10m in 1989-90; $35m in 1990-91; $55m in 1991-92; and $78m in 1992-93. Clearly, the Government is very keen to reduce its contribution to the health care costs expressed through the pharmaceutical part of health care in Australia, but that is not to say that the total costs to the community are not rising. Again, it is disturbing-and I stress this-that we appear not to be doing total social costing. What is health care costing the community as a whole? Whatever channel that cost proceeds through, whether it be through private sources or by way of taxation to the Government and then remuneration, in the final analysis does not make a great deal of difference. We should be looking at the total cost to the community and attempting to arrive at a health care system which is based on health care and which seeks to reduce the total costs, not simply shifting the burden from the Government to private sources. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also said that it is seeking to reduce the number of pharmacies. I repeat that that is a complete red herring. It has nothing to do with the cost of drugs to the community. I again draw to the Senate's attention Senator Giles's contribution in the debate of 7 September on the Opposition's private members' Bill in which she talked about essential pharmacies. She said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . pharmacies in outer urban areas, pharmacies where there are people with very little mobility, pharmacies in rural areas where there are no others within some distance-will have the capacity to attract an essential fee. There will also be an extra fee for essential pharmacies of $5.40 payable on and from 1 October 1989 to be adjusted in the same manner as is prescribed for other prescriptions. </PARA>
<PARA>The point I made during that debate, and I repeat it, is that the identification of an extra fee for essential pharmacies in my mind clearly implies that those pharmacies would simply not be able to continue without that extra fee. It follows that, through the mechanism which the Government now has in train, it will be possible for the Government essentially to determine which pharmacies will continue in business and which will not. That is a power which I believe the Government should not take to itself. Again, I stress that it really has nothing to do with the overall cost of the PBS, which is what this Bill is about. One could use the extreme example: it would not matter if there were only one pharmacy in Australia. If all the pharmaceuticals were dispensed through that one pharmacy the cost to the Government would be identical, so the number of pharmacies does not make a great deal of difference. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the point at which I began. I believe that the whole of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is in a mess. It is a system which has been in place for many decades. The list has been added to and subtracted from and the philosophy which has guided the addition or removal of drugs from that list has changed over time. There has not been an assessment of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme in relation to alternative modalities of treatment and their cost and effectiveness. It is extremely important to undertake such an assessment at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Government has recognised that the matter is in a mess. Senator Puplick quoted both Mr Staples and Mr Robert Davies, the Chief Executive of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. I believe that he was probably quoting from the editorial in today's Australian Financial Review which I have in front of me. In relation to the slight alteration which the Government has now acceded to concerning the $3m to $5m extra each year in relation to the surcharge Mr Davies said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . it would remove the ridiculous situation where pharmacists were paying more for a drug than they were paid by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, he was merely referring to the cost differential. It does not go to the heart of the matter-that is, most businesses would have some financial incentive to buy, stock and hold drugs against the time when patients walk in off the street with a prescription and require those drugs. Certainly it is a ridiculous situation if pharmacists have to pay more to buy and hold drugs than they get back when those drugs are dispensed. Clearly, they should also get some sort of a fee for actually buying and stocking those drugs, particularly the expensive drugs which are perhaps prescribed less frequently. In today's Financial Review Mr Davies is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . there was still no incentive for pharmacists to carry these drugs and people would still have to wait for pharmacists to buy-in these higher-priced items. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that that is a completely accurate statement. The editorial goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> However, the Minister for Housing and Aged Care, Mr Peter Staples, said yesterday the move would-</PARA>
<PARA>this is presumably a quotation from Mr Staples-</PARA>
<PARA>``put an end, once and for all'', to claims by pharmacists that they would be unable to carry these drugs because of tribunal's decision. </PARA>
<PARA>That is simply not a fair statement. The concern being expressed by pharmacists very strongly and vociferously in recent weeks has not been properly dealt with or properly allayed. It does not represent a small number of pharmacists. I remind the Senate that at the various rallies that were held in the major mainland capital cities around Australia roughly 1,000 pharmacists, or 80 per cent of the pharmacists in each State, turned up at each of those rallies expressing their concern. In addition, I personally received some 800 letters from pharmacists expressing a great deal of concern. It is not appropriate for Mr Staples to claim that this concern being expressed by pharmacists represents only a small group, a vocal minority or, in any sense, a ratbag element. The Government is attacking the whole basis of the pharmaceutical dispensing business in Australia. Clearly a far more thorough review of the remuneration of pharmacists through the PBS is called for. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary we, like the Opposition, will be supporting this Bill in relation to the increase in the maximum patient contribution from $11 to $12. We will be supporting the indexation of that contribution. We have no quarrel with that at all. We believe that the other more significant and substantial matter in relation to the remuneration of pharmacists has not been properly dealt with. It is appropriate to deal with it within this legislation. We express the hope that the Government has been sufficiently chastened by the opposition which has been mounted by pharmacists in recent weeks so that when this Bill is amended, as it will be, and when it goes to the House of Representatives it will support the amended Bill and set in place the proper and appropriate review of pharmacists' remuneration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the National Health Amendment Bill 1989. The purpose of this legislation, as my colleagues have already said, is to increase the consumer contribution under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) from $11 to $12. Quite frankly, it is not really a matter of great significance. What is of great significance is what this Government is doing to pharmacy in other areas and why the Government made this minor adjustment while continuing to direct its cost cutting programs towards pharmacy incomes. It hides behind the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal, as it did vociferously when opposing the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits Determination Revocation and Tribunal Membership) Amendment Bill 1989. The cynical standpoint on the pharmacy policy of the Hawke Labor Government is the hope that there are more votes among consumers than there are among pharmacists, who are the scapegoats for the costs of the system. I do not believe that members of the Australian public are fools. They have given pharmacists a 76 per cent approval rating. They will not thank any government, much less this Government, that deprives them of access to pharmacies and diminishes the quality of health services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let it be said that Australian pharmacists are not just concerned about their own viability. These pharmacists happen to be professionally trained people who take pride in what they do, who take pride in the delivery of a good quality service and who want to continue that service to those who need it. Australia has an ageing population and, therefore, more and more people are needing pharmacy and more and more people are requiring drugs to keep them out of hospital. Yet this Government is hell bent on wrecking the pharmacy industry. I cannot understand the logic of that. One needs to look only at the cost of keeping people out of hospital; that should be the incentive on its own. The cost of a one-day bed in a public hospital equals the yearly prescription drug bill of eight people. Surely that is enough reason for this Government to see reason. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the fault of pharmacists that the system delivers an average prescription price of 2 per cent of average weekly earnings. They are the ones who are providing a very efficient system. When I say 2 per cent of average weekly earnings, that compares with 4.3 per cent in the United States of America and 4.2 per cent in Great Britain, which has a supposedly free health service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition knows what the Government is wanting to do here. It also is trying to bring in a free health service. But, pensioners and low income earners aside, the PBS has been increasingly structured to provide a massive subsidy to consumers, regardless of need. What Australia needs is availability of drugs, not some hypothetical, mythical case of the Government saying, `We are going to provide a free service to all, regardless of what is really required'. Of course, the Government is threatening, in its aim to close down community pharmacies, that people can go to public hospitals to get their scripts filled. What a nice old clog-up that will cause in the public hospital system. It is already clogged in all other areas, so why not clog it up in pharmacy as well! If the Government means to persevere with a policy that has reduced the cost of prescriptions from 6.6 per cent of average weekly earnings in 1955 to 2 per cent today, it should be honest with the electors and tell them that their taxes will continue to rise in order to provide such a general subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the alternative is to crush the pharmacists, in the hope of reducing demand by the old socialist tactic of cutting supply and quality. Increasingly, Australian pharmacists and their customers can conclude only that the Hawke Labor Government has developed a total hostility towards community pharmacy. The evasions by the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) were bad enough but now we have the spectacle of his boss, the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett), telling us all, with a straight face I might add, that pharmacists have enjoyed `a real bonanza'-they are his words, not mine-in extra income and that their earnings have risen well above everybody else's in the community. That simply is not so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Giles has just interjected and said that it is. I will get back to that in a little while. It is interesting because Senator Giles obviously has not bothered to talk to representatives of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia; nor has she checked back on the figures of what has really happened to pharmacy incomes. The Opposition can conclude only that the Minister has taken leave of reality, if not of his senses, or that he is banking on the fact that if a senior Minister says in effect that black is white he will get reported in the media and some people will be silly enough to believe him. It is, however, an incredibly misleading statement coming from a government that has done its very best, its utmost, to reduce pharmacy incomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The old story put out by Labor against the mythical wealthy doctor is now being re-run against the mythical wealthy pharmacist. There is at least some truth in the fact that Medicare gave an opening to a few medical entrepreneurs. But I defy this Government to point to any pharmacist who has grown wealthy through the pharmaceutical benefits scheme under which pharmacists depend upon the decisions of governments, tribunals and the prescribing habits of doctors. To a very large degree they are not masters of their own destiny and this Government is seeking to wipe them out. </PARA>
<PARA> If the threat to community pharmacy were not so serious, the Minister's outburst would be quite hilarious, coming from a government that last year cut the real income of pharmacists by 12 per cent by a combination of measures such as the reduction in professional fees, the 5 per cent cut in wholesale margins, the doubling of the maximum prescribable quantity of drugs per prescription and the removal of drugs from the PBS list on the grounds of expense rather than efficacy. All along the line the Government has decided what is best for the consumer-not what is best for the patient or the industry. It has decided what is best for itself and its penny-pinching habits. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite all the reductions that have been made, Senator Giles had the courage not only in the Senate today, but also previously when debating our Bill to overturn the Tribunal's decision, to say that pharmacies are on a real winner. One could believe that they are megamillionaires by listening to her. It is about time she got out there and talked to a few of those pharmacists. They have not been allowed to share in the gains created by their improved administrative efficiency in switching to computerised returns. I add that the cost of switching to computerised returns has been borne by the pharmacists-nobody else. No fairy godmother swooped down and dumped a computer into their pharmacies. They had to go out and buy the wretched things. Yet the Government says that they have been allowed to share in the gains. They jolly well should be allowed to share in the gains! It is the pharmacists who have achieved a 5 per cent productivity gain over the last 20 years and who have cost this Government nothing in the past eight years by retraining 20,000 people in computer use to save the PBS. They have saved the Government $20m each year. The thanks they get for forking out the money is to have their incomes cut. Pharmacists have never known the meaning of restrictive work practices. But their reward has been an attack on their incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> Supposedly, thanks to the policies of this Labor Government, the gross income of pharmacists over the last five years has risen by 81 per cent. That is what Senator Giles will be carping on about again today, as she did a couple of weeks ago. Their incomes have risen by 81 per cent. That is not bad, is it? But let us look at the rest of the story. The cost of pharmacy goods has increased by 125 per cent and the cost of labour has increased by 90 per cent. That is not bad, is it? But whacko, the pharmacists got 81 per cent, plus all the other decisions of this Government that have cut their incomes. I note that Senator Giles on the other side is mumbling away. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it any wonder that there are more and more untruths being told by a Minister, who, quite frankly, is about as bright as a blown globe in this respect, who will not tackle the issue and will not look at the problems for the consumer, let alone the pharmacist? But we are expected to believe that the pharmacists have had this great windfall and have never had it so good. The actual increase to pharmacists, prior to the Tribunal's decision of a further reduction of 23 per cent, was an increase of 46 per cent. People on average weekly earnings have had an increase of 52 per cent. The consumer price index has risen by 51 per cent. Yet the Government has the audacity to say that pharmacists are wealthy. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government, of course, when it is not abusing the pharmacists, hides behind the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal, declaring that the decision that it made to cut pharmacy incomes by 23 per cent had nothing to do with it at all; it is holier than thou. The Government says, `It is not our decision; it is an independent reneration tribunal's decision'. But what a lot of people do not know is that the Government actually put an ambit claim to the Tribunal to reduce the income and remove the mark-up. That is what the Government did. But it says, `It is not us, we did not make the decision; we cannot overturn the Remuneration Tribunal's decision'. What rot! For sheer political gain, it has overturned the independent-and I emphasise the word `independent'-Remuneration Tribunal's decision on parliamentary incomes. Needless to say, most people would think that that is the greatest idea that has ever come out. But how can the Government say on the one hand, `We cannot overturn the independent remuneration tribunal's decision on pharmacies because it is independent', yet, on the other hand, for sheer political gain with regard to the pilots dispute, overturn the independent Remuneration Tribunal's decision on parliamentary incomes? It not only overturned it; in another area it went outside what it should be doing. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at why it cannot overturn the Remuneration Tribunal's decision. It has already overturned part of it. It has already said, `We will give pharmacies in remote locations, in country areas, an allowance of about'-and I emphasise the word `about'-`$12,000. We will also give an allowance to those who are at least 10 kilometres from the nearest approved pharmacy, those who dispense fewer than 15,000 claimable prescriptions a year and are open at least 20 hours a week'. That is fine. At least it has seen the light of day in one respect, but that has gone against the Remuneration Tribunal's decision. Yet when it comes to the real crux of the issue, it says, `Oh no, we cannot change that, that is not within our province'. </PARA>
<PARA> What our amendment seeks to do yet again is to try to have the decision of the Tribunal of 28 August 1989 overturned. As the Senate would know, the Opposition put forward a Bill 2 1/2 weeks ago to have this decision overturned. It was actually carried in the Senate, but, of course, one does not need to be cynical to realise that that Bill will never see the light of the day in the House of Representatives. This time, the Government has to decide what it is going to do, whether it is going to continue to persecute the pharmacists and the consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that it is not only the Opposition that is very angry about what is happening to the pharmacists and the consumers. Even one of the Government's own backbenchers, as my colleague Senator Puplick mentioned earlier, has left a message in no uncertain terms for Minister Staples about the Minister's treatment of the Government's back bench. He has said that Minister Staples is treating backbenchers like idiots. It reminds me of a little story someone told me yesterday about the kid in class who had given the wrong answer to a question and was called up to the teacher who said, `You know, you are one step away from an idiot', and the kid said, `Do you want me to take a step back?'. This could well be said about what Minister Staples is doing, because the letter of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, Mr Campbell, to the chairman of the caucus back bench pharmacists liaison committee, Mr Jim Snow, attacks Mr Staples's handling of the dispute and says that his attitude has inflamed every pharmacist. That is quite right, from the very simple basis that Minister Staples has not the faintest idea what the pharmacists are talking about, even when he goes to listen to them, which I might add is not very often. Mr Campbell also accused Minister Staples of circulating incorrect figures about remuneration and causing a worsening of the dispute. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is my view that this confrontationist and emotional atmosphere is being generated by some of the absurdities coming from the Minister's office. </PARA>
<PARA>Not coming from anyone else, but from the Minister's office. That really tells the whole story, does it not? The fact is that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal makes its decision taking into account data that is supplied to it by this Government, with a database survey drawn from a response of less than 0.3 per cent of pharmacists and using unacceptable criteria for assessing incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> This Hawke Labor Government believes that an independent community pharmacist is worth only $14.30 per hour, which is less than half the hourly rate for a middle range government salaried pharmacist. One may well ask: How does this compare with incomes of other health professionals? I would suggest not too well at all. If we asked the whole of the health community to work for $14.30 per hour, the whole thing would be shut up. It is fair to assume that, by its actions, the Government is aiming for a situation where pharmacists that survive will only do so as public servants. Why else is Labor so blind to the advantage of the current system whereby the independent pharmacist is not subject to the outside pressure of a non-pharmacy employer? How hypocritical for the Minister in charge of pharmacy remuneration to have stated last year at the annual dinner of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia that `the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has been one of the best such schemes in the world'. Gee whiz, has he not changed his tune now? He now wants to see the end of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the expressed concern of the Government as to the cost of pharmaceuticals, an item that in 1970 consumed 19 per cent of the health budget comprises 11.3 per cent of health expenditure in 1989-90. Rises in the cost of drugs are not the responsibility of the pharmacists. They have absolutely nothing to do with it. But the pharmacist is the one who, nonetheless, is called upon by the Government and its agencies to act as scapegoat while the cost of the big ticket items of Medicare continue to rise.</PARA>
<PARA> By its actions and evasions, this Labor Government will bear a massive responsibility when pharmacies close up and deprive Australians of an essential, respected and, I might add, user friendly health service. Closures will impact not only upon country towns-in Western Australia several smaller but far from insignificant centres are now without a pharmacist, and more have closed in the last couple of weeks-but also upon great numbers of the elderly who will no longer be within walking distance of a pharmacist. They will find that remaining pharmacists can no longer afford the time to advise them free of charge and monitor their drug usage. </PARA>
<PARA> What right does this Government have to decide where any pharmacy or any business, whether it be a delicatessen, a newsagent, a supermarket or whatever, should be established? It has no right at all. Yet the great carrot that the Government is now using is, `We'll give you extra money as long as you're further than 10 kilometres away from the next recognised pharmacy'. How dare it say that. If it is someone else's choice to decide to fork out the money to establish any business, he should be the master of his own destiny. He should not have the Government saying, `We're going to rationalise the availability of pharmacies'. It is not a case of rationalising pharmacies; it is a case of closing pharmacies. </PARA>
<PARA> If we want an illustration of how consumers feel about pharmacy we need only look at one instance of an elderly lady who spoke on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation talkback radio in Perth on 8 September. She stated that a pharmacist had in fact corrected an error in a prescription for tranquillisers and had warned her of the danger of addiction. She asked the question, `Who else would give me this free advice?'. It is a very good question. The other day I heard of a pharmacist who drove a sick patient home. The Government, of course, would say that that is not his job, and it is right-it is not his job. But the pharmacists happen to care about the destiny of their patients, not just their own. Those pharmacists who do put in that extra effort should be admired, not belittled and done out of business. That is the very important aspect that the Minister is missing. </PARA>
<PARA> Rubbish from a senior Minister about rises in the earnings of pharmacists is a mockery to a chemist in another Perth suburb who netted $31,000 last year, a figure for which most people in real professions who have had to gain university qualifications and many years of experience would not even work. It is also worth noting that for this modest income of $31,000 the pharmacist happened to have worked 60 hours a week. And this Government wants to take away 23 per cent of his income. This pharmacist employs one full time and two part time assistants but can no longer afford the services of another qualified pharmacist attending one day per week. This is a very familiar story. It is no wonder that the staff of pharmacists, who are also experienced and dedicated people, feel compelled to write to honourable senators and honourable members expressing a fear that both their jobs and a necessary service will disappear. </PARA>
<PARA> Typically, the honourable member for Canning, Mr George Gear, self-appointed critic of doctors and other health professionals, who has had a field day in the last few years bashing all those people, responded to such a letter by accusing the writer of not having written the letter herself and declaring, `I take no notice of these threats'. That is the concern expressed by Mr Gear. I also saw a letter sent to a constituent by the honourable member for Brand, Ms Wendy Fatin. It was absolute and utter gobbledegook. Four of us read the letter and still did not understand it. She was trying to respond to a complaint by saying nothing and doing nothing. The Minister for Health in Western Australia says, `I'm going to get all my colleagues over there and I'm going to tell Minister Staples what to do about this. This has to be overturned'. But what has he done? Absolutely nothing. I understand that he has not even spoken to his Federal colleagues. This is getting beyond a joke. Those opposite are trying to calm people down while at the same time sticking hard and fast to a decision which they claim is not theirs and which they can do nothing about. That is simply not true; they can do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Only last week the honourable member for Canning, Mr Gear, tried to beat up a story that Western Australian pharmacists were threatening to charge pensioners for their prescriptions. The truth, which of course we would not expect from him, is that pharmacists have properly advised pensioners to order medications in advance since the policies of this Hawke Labor Government will make it very difficult for pharmacists to afford to keep many drugs in stock. These divisive petty tactics only show up the failure of the Government and will not divert pensioners from the real issue, which is that their continued access to user friendly pharmaceutical services is under real threat. </PARA>
<PARA> The pharmacists do not want to penalise anybody. All they want to do is continue running the very good show that they have been running for years and years. The Government is making decisions that are now forcing the pharmacists to look at other means of income. One may well ask the question: What would happen to the Medicare blow-out that has already blown right out of the water if the pharmacists kept on sending people back to doctors for the advice that the pharmacists are now giving them for free? The doctors would have to charge them. What sort of blow-out would we get then?</PARA>
<PARA> It is also sadly significant that fewer young men-who may after all be expected to function as sole breadwinners during the crucial years of family life-are entering pharmacy because they do not see it as providing adequate rewards for the professional training involved. It is very sad but nonetheless highly understandable. Many women are also reassessing their careers and their ambitions with regard to pharmacy. Why should they, or anyone else for that matter, put up their money to own a pharmacy only to have this Labor Government take it away? They cannot even sell the business because there is no money for people to buy it; there is no incentive for people to buy it. Do they put the business up for sale? Instead of selling goodwill they would have to say to the new buyer, `Don't worry, you will be out of business in six months time'. Who will buy a pharmacy? What will the pharmacists do? The Opposition will neither condone nor lie down and take the wholesale destruction of community pharmacy. The future of Australian health care will be very much the poorer, but maybe that is the continued ambition of this Government. I call upon the Government on this occasion to see reason and agree to overturn the Tribunal's decision by supporting our amendment to this Bill. The future of community pharmacy relies upon that decision. It is the right and proper course to take. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Health Amendment Bill amends the National Health Act to increase the maximum general patient contribution for prescribed drugs supplied under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) from the present $11 to $12. The increase in the general patient contribution from $11 to $12 is estimated by the Government to achieve savings of $10m in 1989-90 and $17m in a full financial year. With indexation of the patient contribution, estimated savings are $35m for next year, $55m for the year after and $78m for 1992-93. Annual indexation of the general patient contribution will be in line with the March quarter all-group consumer price index (CPI). Many may wonder what pressure the Australian Statistician will come under when the Government wants to change the general patient contribution or its method of indexation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Stone in this chamber on 7 September this year, speaking on the Australian Statistics Advisory Council annual report of 1988-89, said that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) put obvious pressure on the Statistician to change the method of calculating the CPI after a disastrous December CPI result of 2.1 per cent in 1988. The ABS changed the method of calculation and made the hollow claim that no political pressure had been involved in the decision. There is fancy footwork in this Bill and the index may change for reasons quite other than those that have to do with the real state of inflation. That is one issue that concerns the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last two years the Government has bungled changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Instead of getting to the roots of cost increases in the PBS and consulting the industry, the Government has continually made changes that have threatened the viability of the community pharmacy. As often as those changes have been made, the Opposition has called on the Government to carry out a total review of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. On 1 January 1989, the Government cut wholesale margins from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. The cost to the average pharmacy was approximately $250 a week. The effect of this was that a surcharge was introduced by the wholesalers and the full cost of this was borne by the pharmacists. </PARA>
<PARA> In May 1988 the Government added 53 drugs to the authority only list. This was an attempt to get doctors to prescribe alternatives. One pharmacist I spoke to said that it seemed as though someone in the Department had simply run through the list and picked out the 53 most expensive items. Some of the 53 drugs had no alternative-for example, the anti-cancer drugs. The result was a bureaucratic nightmare for doctors, pharmacists and patients alike. A loud scream to modify the system was heard and changes had to be made. The Government also doubled the maximum quantities on many PBS items on 1 August 1988. This resulted in an average loss of $120 per week per pharmacy. Included in this were most psychoactive drugs and the resultant outcry from this change was so great that the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) quickly changed his mind. One of the things that forced him to change his mind was a letter sent by every pharmacy board in Australia to all pharmacists reminding them of their responsibilities under the various State health Acts not to dispense inappropriately large quantities of drugs, especially large quantities of psychoactive drugs. I have said this before and I will say it again: pharmacists are not shopkeepers handing out lollipops. As drugs have become more potent, pharmacists' responsibilities have increased. They feel a great responsibility when they are ordered, instructed or through legislation are required to hand out large amounts of drugs that they believe should not be handed out in those quantities. </PARA>
<PARA> In September 1987 the Government also announced a series of changes in the PBS. One of these was to delist a number of drugs and substitute them for the cheaper generic alternative. The result was shortages and a large number of people having difficulty with the supply of medicine as the generic alternative was often unavailable. The Minister refused to admit that there were problems. There was also the added result that many older people were faced with being prescribed the generic drugs which had different packaging, different labelling and different names. Many older people who had been taking these drugs for a long time became quite confused. In fact, there were examples of some people taking wrong drugs as a result of these changes. A number of the generic drugs were alternatives to anti-depressants. When the generic alternatives were supplied in bottles instead of the strip packs of the original product there was the potential for drug overdoses. A psychiatrist picked that up and complained. </PARA>
<PARA> The next decision which threatened community pharmacies was made by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal (PBRT). It reduced the fee paid to pharmacists to 10c from February 1989. This decision has been overturned by the Federal Court and the Federal Government has appealed against the decision. With respect to the PBRT's decision, the Federal Court said that it was `so unreasonable that no reasonable person would have so exercised the power'. Further, it said that it was difficult to see how, at a time of general inflation, the amount of the professional fee should be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest decision made by the PBRT on 28 August 1989 will cut pharmacists' incomes by 23 per cent. This decision was based on a survey conducted by Deloitte Haskins and Sells in 1988 that was statistically flawed and invalid. Less than 10 per cent of pharmacies in Australia were surveyed and only 32 per cent of that sample group responded. So 0.3 per cent of pharmacists were surveyed and responded. As a Victorian senator, I was fascinated to find that only two pharmacists in Victoria were in that sample. The President of the PBRT felt that the sample was insufficient, so he rang a number of pharmacies, not those in the original sample, and supplemented the results. Wonderful methodology! Most of what comes into this chamber would be failed on the basis of methodology, if it were presented by any second year student doing a research project in a university on any subject I could name. Absolutely appalling methodology is used. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal has reduced from 1 October 1989 pharmacists' remuneration by $1.05 per prescription and has abolished the mark-up on cost of goods. The average loss per pharmacy will be in the region of $20,000 to $25,000. As this is prescription based, the loss will depend on the number of scripts the pharmacy dispenses. The Tribunal's decision will mean that at least 1,500 pharmacies face the very real possibility of closure. This estimate is based on the number of pharmacies dispensing fewer than 15,000 PBS and repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme (RPBS) scripts per annum. This represents 28 per cent of all pharmacies. The remaining 72 per cent will have to reduce services and shed staff in a drastic way. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just tell the chamber a story I heard last night. I went home depressed last night. The hire car driver who drove me home told me she was working day and night. She drove a taxi in addition to the hire car because of the pilots strike and the lack of business here in Canberra. That story can be repeated throughout Australia. As Chairman of the Halls of Residence committee at Monash University, I know, for example, that students' rents will go up next year because conferences had to be cancelled. The ramifications are enormous. The hire car driver told me not only about the problem, but also about how her husband was told yesterday afternoon that his services would no longer be required after 5 o'clock on Friday night. He has a heart condition and had sold his pharmacy a year ago and went to work for another pharmacy. He was told his services would no longer be required because the Government is to change the remuneration for pharmacists on Sunday. The driver to whom I spoke had not only one burden, that resulting from the pilots dispute and the Government's mishandling of it, but also the burden of the retrenchment of her husband. That is what is happening; it is not something that will happen next year or sometime down the track, but at 5 o'clock on Friday. I felt very good going home to bed knowing that at least until the election I have a safe job, while this person had to go on working 15 hours a day seven days a week driving a cab and pulling a hire car out of the garage in the evening to do a few jobs for the Commonwealth, and her husband did not have a job. I bet that many Australians are in that sort of situation today. </PARA>
<PARA> The 23 per cent cut in pharmacists' remuneration came about after the Government last year cut pharmacists' real incomes by 12 per cent. It plans a further cut of 8 per cent this year. Over the past five years costs of pharmacy goods increased by 101.5 per cent and labour costs by 87 per cent. Pharmacists' gross income increased by only 81 per cent. This year we would expect wages to increase by 7 per cent-that is the Budget estimate-statutory charges to increase by 7 per cent, stock prices by 7 per cent and in Victoria, which is another case altogether, it is more than likely that WorkCare rates will increase also. But the Tribunal sees fit to reduce the pharmacists' remuneration by 23 per cent. One can imagine the result if this happened to the waterside workers or any other union or group. There would be mayhem. </PARA>
<PARA> A large part of the increased costs in the PBS is going to the manufacturer. Between 1985 and 1988, 62.3 per cent of the increased costs went to the manufacturer and 13 per cent to the pharmacist. The CPI in this period rose by 27.2 per cent, yet the pharmacist is the one who is being expected to bear the brunt of cost cutting in the PBS. The Tribunal created such ridiculous anomalies that from 1 October 1989 pharmacists would have been expected to stock and sell certain drugs at a loss. It is just unbelievable. For example, the cost to the pharmacist of 20 milligrams of Roaccutane is $157.72. The payment to the pharmacist was to be $153.20, resulting in a loss of $4.22 before taking any account of holding costs or any of the other things that go into stocking. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Such as interest on overdrafts. I can go on. There are the costs of refrigeration for drugs that require it. I do not need to enumerate the costs that are involved in holding drugs. In this PBS the Government and the Tribunal have yet again been forced to back down and back-pedal from this part of the decision. Since I have been in this chamber the whole of the PBS has had a history of on again, off again-drugs on, drugs off, rules in, rules out. The Tribunal said that it did not realise that its decision would have created such a situation. The Tribunal should have found out what the consequences of its decision would be for every drug. The Tribunal ordered the Government to pay a gap fee to the pharmacists in the interim until a change was made to wholesalers' margins. As the decision stood, PBS listed drugs with a wholesale cost greater than $50 would not be dispensed because of losses involved. There are 171 brands and/or strengths of PBS listed items in this category. These drugs include all insulins for diabetics, most anti-cancer drugs, some antibiotics, some drugs to treat high blood pressure and some drugs for asthmatics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A report in the Age yesterday said that the Federal Government appeared to have struck a deal with wholesalers about the issue of whether pharmacists will stock expensive drugs once their fees are cut-an agreement that wholesalers would stop surcharging pharmacies but instead increase their margins from 10 per cent to 13 per cent. This would be done by increasing the agreed price of drugs, a price set by the Government and paid to pharmacists, wholesalers and manufacturers. Pharmacists I have consulted have said that items with a high turnover will be held and sold, and that, although the pharmacists may make little profit on these items, at least they will not be making a loss. But items with low turnovers will be able to be held only at a loss to the pharmacist. Although the pharmacist will be charged the correct manufactured price and will receive payment from the Government based on that price, the costs of holding that item will still not be covered. We do not do it with magic. Pharmacists have to have somewhere to hold the drug, they have to have insurance and they have to pay all the other costs that I outlined before. There are overdraft costs; there is stock wastage on some drugs which, because they have a low usage rate, may have an expired out of date code; and there are freight and other costs. The pharmacist will still lose on these items, so they will not be stocked. The public will have to wait for them to come in. Some of these drugs are for asthmatics and diabetics. </PARA>
<PARA> Pharmacists are presented with a moral and ethical dilemma. They want to be able to supply these drugs. They are there to offer a service to the community. But if they continue to do so, they will make a loss. Anybody with any economic sense will know that one can only do that for a limited amount of time and then one goes out of business. An unreasonable demand is being made on pharmacists. </PARA>
<PARA> The effects of the Tribunal's decisions are many, and Senator Knowles outlined a number of them. We have already got the loss of employment. We will see increased costs to Medicare. How often have people in this chamber gone to a pharmacist and said, `I have this little rash here. What should I do about it?'. The pharmacist will say, `You could use such and such but I recommend that if it is not healed within so many days you go to your doctor'. The rash then heals and one does not go to the doctor. Pharmacists offer a primary care to people who come in seeking advice. Senator McKiernan smiles. I bet he has been to a pharmacist to ask for advice. As pharmacies close there will be time pressure on remaining pharmacists because they will be dispensing a large number of drugs and that will impinge on their ability to act as health care givers. Pharmacists see themselves as health carers, and I think that they deserve to do so. The very role the Government has said it is trying to enhance and encourage is being reduced. There will be less time for pharmacists to counsel patients on medication, thus increasing the risk of drug interaction, and less patient compliance, increasing the risk of overdose. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I came into the Senate my area of interest was gerontology, the study of ageing. Some 82 per cent of the people who use the pharmaceutical benefits scheme are pensioners. Most of those are older people. It is a known fact, demonstrated scientifically, that as people get older-and I am talking now about the old, old people of 75 years plus-their ability to comprehend instructions declines, and this condition is exacerbated if they are ill. One of the things about which older people get instructions is taking drugs. Not only does our ability to comprehend instructions decline as we get older but also, from 40 years of age onwards, the half life of drugs in our system-the length of time for a drug to be excreted-increases. So older people are more likely to suffer from drug interactions, especially if they take the wrong drugs at the wrong times in the wrong quantities. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is particularly important that pharmacists have the time when they are dispensing drugs to older people to go over what has been said to them in the doctor's surgery. We are all nervous when we go to a doctor's surgery. We almost forget to tell him about the wart on our toe or something else. He gives us instructions but we are anxious because we are worried about what his prognosis or diagnosis will be. When we go out, the pharmacist is there and can tell us again. I am sorry to say that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) the other day referred to an elderly gentleman in South Australia as `a silly old bugger'. All those older people who get that sort of respect from the Prime Minister of our country-and I would not use that term for older citizens, who deserve better treatment-will not have a pharmacist who has time to go over the way they should take drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> Country pharmacies will be particularly affected. The greatest concern centres around 450 country towns that have only one pharmacy. Those pharmacies are under the same cost pressures as others. The closure rate of these pharmacies will increase. Once pharmacies close they will not re-open. Nobody will want to re-open a pharmacy with the uncertainty caused by Government decisions to make changes in the PBS. We have seen many of those on again, off again changes. Many small country town pharmacies service pensioners in close proximity to where they live. These people will suffer most if pharmacies close. Pharmacies cannot mark up their prices like other businesses to compensate for low turnover. The Government has canvassed the idea of an isolated pharmacy allowance for pharmacies at least 10 kilometres-it was much further before but the Government has reduced the distance-from their nearest competitor. This would apply only to pharmacies dispensing fewer than 1,500 scripts per year. There is some doubt as to whether in the present climate this measure would ensure the viability of these vital pharmacies. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not mentioned the effect on women. Twenty per cent of pharmacy owners are women, and 60 to 70 per cent of graduates of pharmacy colleges are women. It seems amazing to me that this Government attacks two of the courses which have the highest intake of women. We have just had a recent attack on medical education and medical students. One of the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Trust for Young Australian students, a young girl from Portland, said to me yesterday, `You know, I am now having to think about whether or not I will be able to have a family'. This 18-year-old was saying, `I do not know whether I will be able to have a baby because it will take me 11 years before I can get the full rebate on Medicare'. The Minister says, `Don't worry. They wouldn't worry about whether they can have a family; they will be able to stop off and have a family'. This 18-year-old girl, wanting to go into medicine-a Victorian, one of my constituents-was thinking, at 18, about whether she can have a family. </PARA>
<PARA> This is yet another attack on women. Ninety-eight per cent of assistants in pharmacies are women, many in part-time employment; 82 per cent of pharmacy employees are women; and 85 per cent of customers in pharmacies are women. I am glad that Senator Reynolds is here and I hope she is listening to me because I ask her: Which group will be most affected by this legislation? It will be older people and women-and the majority of older people in Australia are women. The Government is attacking women in two fell swoops-the employees in the pharmacies and the people who use the pharmacies. </PARA>
<PARA> At the beginning of this year the Pharmacy Guild of Australia made a submission to the Government which looked at the whole structure of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. That submission cost the Pharmacy Guild $100,000 to produce. What has been the Government's response? The Pharmacy Guild tells me it has had scant recognition from the Government and all the negotiations have been about the almighty dollar-the bottom line, the dollar cost of the scheme. What the Government has not done is take up the pharmacists' offer-and they have offered-to work towards a total restructuring of this sick scheme. Only last Tuesday I sat in the Victorian office of the Pharmacy Guild and talked to pharmacists. They said, `We have got suggestions to make about how to reduce the cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. We know that there are some anomalies and problems. We want to work with the Government to address and redress them. We wanted to do that so much that we actually prepared a submission which cost us a lot of money and the Government has given it almost no consideration'. Let me turn to the advertisement in yesterday's Australian which has this heading:</PARA>
<PARA> Is your local chemist leading you down the garden path?</PARA>
<PARA>When Minister Staples put out an advertisement about nursing homes not being conned-many senators will know that I am interested in nursing homes-he was game enough to put on it, `Authorised by Peter Staples, Commonwealth Minister for Housing and Aged Care, Parliament House, Canberra'. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LI4">Senator PATTERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, we did ring up and were given no answers. We are waiting for them, and hope to get them in the mail. With regard to the advertisement dealing with the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, changes in drugs and brand names, entitled `Prescription drugs-important news', the pharmaceutical benefits scheme had the good grace to put the Commonwealth pharmaceutical benefits scheme logo on the bottom, but no authorisation. As far as yesterday's advertisement is concerned, unless one is in the know one would not have a clue who authorised it. All that is shown are the letters `PBS', with no authorisation. It seems to me to be almost a political statement. It says that the Australian Government is concerned about the health of all Australians. If that is not a political statement, what is? I suppose one could make up all sorts of names using the initials PBS, but I will not do so. In this advertisement the Government says that chemists are worried about how much money they make. All Australians, in the economic mess we are in, are worried about how much money they make. Pharmacists have businesses to run, staff to pay, mortgages to meet and families to support. They have a right to be worried. Members of parliament on both sides of the chamber are not so slow to go to their remuneration tribunal when they are worried about how much money they make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I say, the advertisement states that the Government is concerned about the health of all Australians, and the implication is that pharmacists are not concerned about the health of all Australians. The Government, the PBS or whoever authorised this advertisement, is wrong. Where is the proof that pharmacists are not concerned about the health of all Australians? If they were not concerned, would they provide the level of service they do-services which are not supported in the funding arrangements, like free deliveries and free advice? Pharmacists are not a group of people who do not care about the health of all Australians. The PBS advertisement was, I suppose, authorised by the Minister, but we do not know that. What else do we see in this advertisement? It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Every Australian will continue to have ready access to chemists. And all Australians will continue to be protected by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> These facts are guaranteed by the Australian Government and by law. </PARA>
<PARA>Pharmacists have said that in order to compensate for the price reductions forced on them by Government without any offset savings they will have to make those savings internally by cutting services such as free pickup and delivery of scripts. If, then, they cannot afford to maintain the services they provide, they will have to withdraw from the pharmacy business. What do the Government's fighting words in this advertisement mean? Are pharmacists to be subject to civil conscription? Are they to be denied the right to withdraw their labour? Is the Government intending to socialise the pharmacy area? I remind the Senate of section 51 of the Constitution which states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to-</PARA>
<PARA>Section 51 (xxiiia) states:</PARA>
<PARA>The provision of maternity allowances, widows' pensions, child endowment, unemployment, pharmaceutical, sickness and hospital benefits, medical and dental services (but not so as to authorise any form of civil conscription), benefits to students and family allowances . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that section in brackets because it has been considered in two cases, one concerning the British Medical Association in 1949 and one concerning the General Practitioners Society in 1980. The advice I received as to the judges' decision is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The result is that a majority in both cases decided that, as a matter of grammatical construction, the prohibition against civil conscription only applied to the phrase ``medical and dental services''. If this interpretation is upheld by future High Courts the unemployment benefit payments which are made conditional upon some form of civil conscription would not breach that pl. 51 (xxiiiA). </PARA>
<PARA> Neither of the two cases gives a conclusive definition of what would constitute civil conscription. </PARA>
<PARA>The legal advice that I received on this section of the Constitution went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>Five Judges in the General Practitioners Society case considered that a law could impose civil conscription even if it did not create a legal liability to perform a medical service. Thus a law could have economic or other results which would force doctors to practise even if the law did not specifically do so itself. The court was of the view that this practical compulsion also amounted to civil conscription. </PARA>
<PARA>Here we have a threat hanging over the heads of the pharmacists that every Australian will continue to have ready access to chemists, all Australians will continue to be protected by the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, and that these facts are guaranteed by the Australian Government and Australian law. I am sure when it was written, it was known exactly what was meant by that. Who is leading whom down the garden path? We may yet see pharmacists being forced down the garden path by civil conscription. It is not just the pharmacists but all Australians who are being forced down, not a garden path, but possibly a dangerous path which involves the erosion of the free right of citizens to withdraw their labour. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not take up very much of the time of the Senate today but there are a few points which have been raised in the debate which deserve a response. We are debating the National Health Amendment Bill 1989 which is quite narrow in its application and simply refers to the amendment of the National Health Act to increase the maximum general patient contribution for prescribed drugs supplied under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) from the present amount of $11 to $12. It is estimated that this will achieve savings of $10m in 1989-90 and $17m in a full financial year. There is no disagreement between the Opposition and the Government concerning that Bill, but, predictably, the debate this morning has concentrated on the controversy surrounding the Government and the pharmacists subsequent to the recent decision of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I find the most recent point made by Senator Patterson, that we are talking about civil conscription of pharmacists, a somewhat long bow to be drawing in this context, and in any other, I might add. It is certainly completely unlikely to be on the agenda, that is, if Senator Patterson is serious about it. In view of the fact that pharmacists on average receive only 30 per cent of their income from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, it seems to me very strange to assume that there was any justification whatsoever for civil conscription of pharmacists or anybody else involved in pharmaceutical services. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to correct a statement that I made on the previous occasion we debated this issue in the Senate. On the basis of a newspaper report-which I did not check; I must be more careful-I said that it was strange to discover that about 20 per cent of all Australian pharmacies were to be found in Western Australia. I was surprised about this. On checking, I found that the newspaper report was incorrect and that, more predictably and more credibly, the number of pharmacies in Western Australia is a little less than 10 per cent of the number of pharmacies in the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of these pharmacies are doing very well. I did not, as Senator Knowles suggested, insist that all pharmacists were making high profits. That is not the case. None of us have ever suggested that was the case. Obviously, where competitive, the pharmacy industry can be very financially rewarding. Why else, for example, would there be in Fremantle a pharmacist on each of the four corners of a very busy intersection? Clearly, they must be competitive to stay there, and to provide the services they provide in a very busy part of town. I cannot imagine many of them staying at that level of competition if they were not viable. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of statements were made about the new advisory body that the Minister has established since negotiations with the Guild broke down completely. It seems to me that, contrary to what Senator Puplick suggested about divide and rule, et cetera, the only sensible and responsible decision was the one that the Minister made, in view of the strong disaffection that pharmacists from all over the nation were indicating with their own Guild. </PARA>
<PARA> All pharmacists who were invited to join the advisory body joined it, with the exception of Mr Rick James of Brisbane who, I understand, initially accepted the invitation on 12 September and sent a letter of resignation on 14 September, although the letter itself was dated 12 September. One could make one of two assumptions from that set of facts. One could assume that he initially never intended to accept and was simply using the occasion to make a political statement or, more likely, that a considerable amount of pressure was placed on those individuals who were invited to join that advisory body and that Mr Rick James was the only one to yield to that pressure. </PARA>
<PARA> I am happy to say that he was replaced by Mr MacAnuff of Shenton Park in Western Australia, a pharmacist for whom I have a great deal of respect. He was put on the advisory body as a representative of CAPS, a group of pharmacists in Western Australia which is considered to be strongly militant. It was an indication of the Minister's very good sense that he sought a member from Western Australia and someone who will put a strong position on behalf of what I understand is the unanimous view of Western Australian pharmacists. Mr MacAnuff also takes a very principled professional stand as a leading member of a Western Australian professional association of pharmacists. The first meeting of the advisory group occurred last week and I understand that each member of the group made a fine and constructive contribution to the group's deliberations. As a result of the meeting a number of statements have been made by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the criticisms of the Tribunal. There is still considerable confusion in the minds of some Opposition members about the Tribunal's role over the years, the effects of its decision, and the possible effect of any High Court decision which rejected the legitimacy of the Tribunal. Senator Puplick expressed his view that statements that were made in relation to this matter were a threat to or intimidation of pharmacists who had decided to appeal the Tribunal's decision. That is not the point at all. If such an appeal were successful it would remove the legitimacy, not only of the Tribunal, but of all the Tribunal's decisions for the last eight or nine years. That would return us to the position that existed in 1981 before the Tribunal's establishment. We totally reject allegations of hostility and contempt of pharmacists as a whole. That certainly is not the case and, as I have said, we are working closely and constructively with a new advisory body which appears to have strong support amongst the pharmaceutical community generally. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal's decision has also been criticised on the grounds that since the decision itself other decisions have been made. The Tribunal did what it was required to do. It rejected the bandaid approach which has been taken over the years and which, as Senator Patterson acknowledges, has led to its own anomalies and to a cost escalation which is certainly of concern. We must take measures to stop this escalation. I remind the Senate that a couple of years ago the cost was $700m. Last year it was over $1 billion. This year it will be well over $1,200m, or a 17 per cent increase. </PARA>
<PARA> We anticipate that in three years the cost of our pharmaceutical benefits scheme will have risen to $2 billion. That cost escalation has been partly-there are a number of elements, of course-as a result of the fact that the decisions of the Tribunal have been blanket decisions. For example, there were the decisions about a blanket mark-up fee which has been removed. There is considerable concern-we knew that there would be-about the extra costs to pharmacists of very expensive drugs. That matter has now been dealt with. Nobody ever anticipated that it would not be dealt with. Right from 11 May, when the Government package was put to the Pharmacy Guild, it was known that the Commonwealth would need to negotiate with wholesalers in regard to surcharging. As a result of these negotiations, in return for an end to surcharges, the Government is to increase the wholesalers' margin on drug prices from 10 per cent to 13 per cent. This will be done by increasing the agreed price of the drugs, a price set by the Government and paid to pharmacists, wholesalers and manufacturers. It does not affect the price paid by consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> The increase of 10 per cent to 13 per cent will provide a degree of compensation for the loss of the 25 per cent blanket mark-up for drugs. The Government will pick up the surcharge for drugs which cost over $45. It will remove the cost pressures on small pharmacies especially, which would have had real difficulties maintaining their stocks, as has been said this morning on a number of occasions. It will involve the expensive drugs such as insulin, and drugs that are used for the treatment of cancer and high blood pressure. That is the issue of the surcharge. Nobody doubted that that issue would have to be dealt with subsequent to the Tribunal's decision. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of essential pharmacies has also been dealt with. I will not go through that again in detail but as a result of the advisory body meeting last week we were able to announce that a new Government allowance for chemists would start on 1 October to assist those pharmacies which were adjudged to be essential pharmacies because of their geographical isolation and which were handling a relatively small number of prescriptions. We have added to those criteria. Now special cases outside those criteria will also be considered by a review committee which will include several community pharmacists. So the door is not shut to pharmacies which believe that they are essential pharmacies and which believe that they should be eligible for that extra assistance. This is an ongoing process; it will not stop on 1 October or at any time in the near future. Right from the beginning, it was known that the issue would have to be dealt with subsequent to the Tribunal's decision. It is not an overturning of the Tribunal's decision but an addition to it, a decision which is open to the Government to make. </PARA>
<PARA> The third issue, which is one which will also receive a great deal of consideration over the next few weeks and months, is the professional role of pharmacists. It is on the agenda of the new advisory body but there will be wider consultations as indeed there should be about this important issue. Pharmacies vary greatly in the populations that they serve and in the demands that are placed upon them. For example, a pharmacist who serves a complex of aged people's homes is providing a service to individuals who, in many cases, are really quite frail but because of the drugs that they have been prescribed are able to be kept mobile. We know this is extremely important for the quality of their lives and also to maintain them as independent of expensive nursing home services. The pharmacist in this position is dispensing almost inevitably very costly and very potent drugs and in such situations he is required to give a great deal of advice and counselling to the client. </PARA>
<PARA> Other pharmacists have large populations of quite fit pensioners with whom they deal; so the demand for day-to-day counselling is not quite so great. The drugs that are being dispensed tend not to be so potent and so forth. Other pharmacists are dealing with young families and particularly mothers with young children. Children contract frequent infections, all sorts of bumps and bruises, rashes, coughs, colds and all the rest of it and mothers are very grateful for extra advice which the pharmacists willingly give. I will quote what I think is a very good description given by Mr Jim Snow, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, during this debate in the House of Representatives. He said of pharmacists:</PARA>
<PARA> They know more about the actions of drugs than do the prescribers of drugs-</PARA>
<PARA>that is a pretty grim comment on people who prescribe the drugs-</PARA>
<PARA>They know more about the side effects of drugs. They know more about the need for patient compliance and how to encourage the patient to comply with the taking of medication. They know more about drug incompatibility. They know more about what drugs should not be taken with others. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are statements with which none of us would argue and with which none of us has ever argued. We appreciate the fact that in order to encourage and to recognise that particular role of the pharmacists we must be prepared, after due consideration and wide consultation, to provide some financial recognition of that particular role. I believe the bona fides of the Government are impeccable in this matter. The Tribunal has done its job. As I said, it has rejected the bandaid approach which has existed for about 30 years. It has given a decision which the pharmacists are at liberty to appeal but that decision, as everybody knew, was only on one issue and that was the prescription fee. All these other issues that have been taken up subsequently have always been on the agenda. They could have been agreed with the Guild in May when the Government made an offer of a package. </PARA>
<PARA> It looks as if, after a great deal of heat and excitement and not a little anguish, the offers-or at least some modification of them-that the Government made in May are gradually coming to be accepted by the majority of the pharmacists. The point has been reached where the discussions that we are having are seen to be constructive. The majority of pharmacists find them acceptable and they are certainly nowhere near the dangerous interpretation of Senator Patterson-that we might be moving to conscript the pharmaceutical industry. </PARA>
<PARA> We in the Government of course oppose the amendments that are being proposed today by the Opposition which not only would have the effect of postponing the 1 October commencement of the Act in relation to the National Health Amendment Bill but, I suppose, might even throw into question the date of application of a number of these other issues about which there has been so much discussion. The other effect of the Opposition's amendment would be that the determination of the Tribunal of 28 August 1989 should be of no force or effect. Naturally we believe that that decision should go ahead. We also believe that the other measures that have been accepted and are seen to be acceptable should also go ahead on 1 October for the benefit not only of the pharmaceutical industry but also, much more importantly, of all those people in the community who depend so strongly, and so justifiably too, on the excellent services that they receive from the pharmacists. </PARA>

We are also looking at an Opposition amendment, which I support, which is an amendment also to the National Health Amendment Bill that the decision of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal dated 28 August 1989 shall be of no force or effect. That, of course, is to reiterate a decision that has already been made by the Senate that that decision of the Tribunal should be of no force or effect. This is a means of requiring the Government to have a much closer look at that decision of the Senate than otherwise would be the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Giles has spoken of the fact that only 30 per cent of pharmacy income comes from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS). That may be the average figure but it is quite clear that that is an average figure and there are many pharmacies, many of them small, for whom the income from the scheme represents a much higher proportion of their income and it is of great significance to them. Undoubtedly to some others earning less than that average figure it has less significance. Senator Giles also seemed to take great comfort from the fact that the advisory committee which the Government at last has set up is looking at the Government's offer to pharmacists made in May of this year. Compared with the Tribunal finding, the May offer may be slightly more attractive but that is not an attractive settlement and it is not a proper settlement. It is interesting to note that the Government has now set up an advisory or consultative committee. I say to the Senate: what a great pity it is that the Government did not think of doing that a long time ago; that it did not talk to those in the pharmacy industry about problems and about the situation and their claims. </PARA>
<PARA> In discussing these matters which we have before us today we should do so in light of the fact that pharmacies' incomes in this regard were cut last year by 12 per cent and this year by an extra 8 per cent. Pharmacists are one group in the community whose incomes have gone down quite dramatically. At the same time, the costs of running a pharmacy have escalated. Over the past five years the cost of goods that they purchase has gone up 100 per cent and the cost of labour has gone up by 90 per cent. The Government's claim that their income from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme has risen by 81 per cent is a tampering with the figures to get an attractive outcome rather than an accurate look at the actual costs of running a pharmacy and keeping it going. I believe that the average income over the last six years from the scheme has increased by 46 per cent, but average weekly earnings have gone up by 52 per cent; there have been consumer price index increases. The cost of drugs has gone up by 125 per cent, and that of qualified staff has risen by 90 per cent. The Government's claim as far as income is concerned is totally wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of the Tribunal decision of 28 August, which I have raised previously, is the question of the methodology used by the Tribunal. I raised the matter in the Senate on 5 September when I moved a motion requiring the Government to obtain from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal, and table in the Senate, a full statement of the methodology employed and the details of the information it used, but the Government declined to do that. It implied that it was not in a position to require the Tribunal to provide such details. I think that that is somewhat of a joke. The Government is becoming very coy about it, and in the light of statements that we all remember vividly of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in relation to the Government's relationship with the Reserve Bank of Australia-that is only one example-we know that the Government is in a position to say to the Tribunal, `This information ought to be supplied and ought to be made public'. There is little doubt that the Tribunal would comply with such a request, or hint even, from the Government. After all, the Tribunal has leant very heavily on the Government's own submission to it in relation to this matter and that is why we have this final outcome. In my opinion, it does not rest easily with the Government to say that it cannot require the Tribunal to provide the details. </PARA>
<PARA> We are then left with the situation of looking at the report and drawing our own conclusions as to the methodology that was used. I will refer to a very few passages by way of illustration. Paragraph 2 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The decisions reached are the result of a considered judgement of the available material, all of which has been given appropriate weight and used with due caution. </PARA>
<PARA>Whatever those expressions might mean. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The result has not been reached by a series of arithmetical calculations without regard to the consequences which are likely to follow. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpose and say that that obviously is not the case. It is now clear that many of the consequences have not been perceived and foreseen. Paragraph 2 continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Rather, the final conclusion is the result of balancing the findings of the studies and the available material on the cost of dispensing pharmaceutical drugs under the National Health Scheme on the one hand and a proper consideration of the likely effects of the adoption of these findings on the operation of the current pharmaceutical benefits scheme on the other. </PARA>
<PARA>Is it any wonder from that language that pharmacists say, `Hey, come on, let's know the real methodology that was used in coming to this conclusion'. I refer to section 13, entitled `Fee Determined', and invite honourable senators to read paragraphs 13.6, 13.7 and 13.8 and, further on, paragraphs 13.10 and 13.12. Paragraph 13.6 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Tribunal has not determined this level of fee as a result of a simple arithmetical exercise but has made a judgement based on the evidence in its totality and after having regard to all of the submissions which were made by each of the principal parties . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I remind honourable senators that one of those parties was the Government, which wanted the reduction which finally came about. Paragraph 13.7 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The total fee will be constituted by the two elements . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This was referred to, firstly, in paragraph 13.8, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>The first element in the new base fee will be an amount of $2.45 which is to cover the cost of labour in supplying an item covered by the NHS. This amount contains a factor for each of the various labour costs . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 13.10 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The second element in the new fee will be concerned with non labour costs and has been fixed at $1.05 per item dispensed. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 13.12 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Tribunal has estimated the average remuneration per prescription . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Is it any wonder that pharmacists want to know more about how this came about.</PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to the cost of labour. We get a little bit of help on page 10. In paragraph 3.6, under the heading `Cost of Dispensing per Prescription' there is the amount of $15 for the proprietor's salary. I find that absolutely remarkable. Pharmacists can certainly earn a great deal more as pharmacists in the Public Service than at that rate per hour which is the figure used by this Tribunal in coming to a conclusion. Again, pharmacists are entitled to know why that figure was chosen as the relevant figure. The $15 referred to is about the middle of the range salary for a government pharmacist, and it is certainly less per hour than many tradespeople receive. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal's decisions have, in the past, been reviewed. This has been referred to today and I shall refer to it again because I believe that it is significant. In June the Federal Court rejected the Tribunal decision to cut pharmacists' professional fee by 10c per script. The court said at the time that the Tribunal decision was `so unreasonable that no reasonable person would have so exercised the power' and that `it was difficult to see how at a time of general inflation the amount of the professional fee should be reduced'. It is absurd to say that there should be no criticism of the Tribunal's findings or that they cannot be rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the livelihood of many pharmacists is threatened and they are entitled to know the basis of the decision. This group in the community has already been squeezed financially. We have heard today that most will not be able to afford the expensive items and patients may have to wait many days before they are able to obtain drugs that have been prescribed for them. It is interesting to note, though, that in spite of the Government saying that the Tribunal decision cannot be changed, there is an article in today's Canberra Times headed, `Government move to pacify pharmacists'. It is encouraging at least to know that the Government recognises what it has done to the pharmacists. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government moved yesterday to encourage pharmacists to keep stocking high-cost drugs by setting a fixed surcharge on drugs costing more than $45. </PARA>
<PARA>Many drugs cost $45 and more; many cost less than that. So the pharmacist is still being required to stock those drugs at his own expense-he is paying the interest on his overdraft to have drugs on his shelf for this purpose. At least this will be changed for drugs costing more than $45. I take that as a recognition of the fact that it was wrong of the Tribunal not to include in its finding a fee for the cost of the drugs being purchased by the pharmacists in advance so that they are available when required. </PARA>
<PARA> In future pharmacists will have much less time to give advice to people who come into the shop on little matters and to give comfort and encouragement, perhaps, to some who are ill, are taking drugs, or who do not quite know what to do. I believe that that is a valuable part of what a pharmacy provides. I do not see a pharmacy merely as a place where a customer puts a prescription in a slot in one spot and then stands at another spot and waits for the pills to pop out. There is much more to the relationship between customers, patients, and the pharmacist when they go into a pharmacy. It is a pity that that is being overlooked completely. </PARA>
<PARA> There is talk that the Government wants more closures. That is an interesting matter. The Government seems almost to be laying the blame on the fact that there are too many pharmacies. The Tribunal report also refers to that in paragraph 12.9 on page 19, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>The structure of pharmacies, particularly their size and location, is a matter which should be considered by an appropriately designed inquiry and we recommend that this be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA>I wonder where the Government gets its information that causes it to say, `There are too many pharmacies. That is the real problem. There should be closures'. It even offers a paltry $50,000 to some pharmacists if they are prepared to walk away from their livelihood. The Government should tell us how it has come to that conclusion when, as recently as 28 August, the Tribunal said that it is a matter that ought to be looked into. It is not really the number of scripts that determines the viability; the number of scripts will be much the same. There is much more to it than that. There are high costs in the medical system. There will be even higher costs if people are forced to go to doctors and hospitals instead of being able to talk to their pharmacists first. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate again that the cost of one bed day in a hospital equals the yearly prescription bill of eight people. Surely, anything that keeps down the cost of hospitals and the occupation of beds ought to be looked at and is the first line of health care. There is the question of the loss of pharmacies in the country which service the needs of those living in isolated areas. Those people are entitled to expect to receive those vital services. I believe that this decision discriminates against low income earners and pensioners by the lack of convenience and the additional expense of travelling, maybe only to the next suburb, in getting a prescription filled. </PARA>
<PARA> The real cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is affected by a number of things. The Government, I believe, is going the wrong way about trying to find the solution. It relates to the number of scripts which are written. It relates to the age of the population-and we are an ageing population. It relates to the expansion of the number of concessions that are provided for users as against those who are not receiving the concessions. It relates to the growth of the population and it most certainly relates to the new and sometimes very costly drugs which are now available. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is taking a very short term view of what it is trying to do. Prompted by the failure of Medicare to cover the cost of health services, it is attempting to wind back costs by cutting into the pharmacy services. There have been cutbacks, and these have been referred to. In 1987 a limit was put on the number of visits to consultant physicians for which Medicare would pay. In 1988 the Government halved the number of items for which pathology benefits would be paid, including the removal of sun spots. We had the authority only listing issue and the generic drugs issue. Presumably, we have not heard the last of it. We know all about the number of people who have to wait a long time for hospital care and about the poor relationship between the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) and the doctors. We have had many problems in Canberra with health care. I shall not go through them again, but until we attained self-government a few months ago, health care in Canberra was totally a matter of the way Medicare functioned. We in Canberra have seen very clearly how it has failed while at the same time the Medicare levy has increased from one per cent of taxable income to 1.25 per cent. We all know that Medicare costs a great deal more than that. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Government has begun to realise that its own submission in requiring a reduction of income has been wrong. I have referred to the one concession it has made. One newspaper article is headed `Government gives country chemists a break'. It refers to what is now being done to assist those who live 10 kilometres from an approved pharmacy and to a special allowance, et cetera. The only disappointing part of that article is that it refers to a `Government subsidy'. I do not believe it is helpful to the debate for it to be referred to in that way. I do not believe that it is accurate. Last week the Minister announced an isolated allowance worth about $4,000 a year to pharmacists in far-flung areas. It is very clear that the Tribunal's finding does not meet the needs of pharmacies or those whom they are servicing. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Giles at least has joined in and contributed to the debate. She is the only member of the Government who has. I hope that when the Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health (Senator Cook) comes in he will deal with the issues more fully and answer some of the questions that have been put. In the light of the facts which exist, the questions which the pharmacists are asking ought to be dealt with by the Minister. I refer to them in the words in which the pharmacists themselves have put them: that the gross margin be restored to the 1988 level in real terms, adjusted for increases in costs; that a mark-up separate from the dispensing fee be restored and the impact of wholesaler surcharges dealt with; that professional services be recognised and rewarded; that there be regular updating of the dispensing fee according to appropriate indices, with no offsets for the impact of mark-up; and that essential pharmacies be given special assistance to maintain viability. The last point has been looked at, at least in part, in relation to some of the remote pharmacies. The Minister owes it to the Senate to deal with these matters when he speaks in this debate today. I support the amendment which the Opposition has moved. I believe it is important that it be passed by the Parliament and that the matter be looked at afresh. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Health Amendment Bill 1989 is piffling. The Government should be aware that if it has generated this amount of heat in the Senate there is a bushfire raging outside in the electorate. The Bill itself is not designed to increase pharmacists' income at all. All it does is put the patient contribution up from $11 to $12. All that money goes to the Government; it does not go to the pharmacists. It is a new tax on the sick. It is a sick tax. It is a tax on the halt, the lame and the blind. People who need medication are being taxed more. Not only that, the Bill indexes the tax so that it goes up surreptitiously as time goes on, I presume in accordance with the consumer price index. It goes up according to a formula that nobody understands very well. It will increase the tax on the sick for their pharmaceuticals. It does not increase at all the remuneration of chemists. It is the chemists' remuneration that is causing the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over recent years the Government has been trying to reduce the cost of its pharmaceutical benefits scheme and no-one can blame it for that. It has promised the best, fairest and most equitable health system in the world and it is attempting to deliver it but, of course, it cannot deliver that sort of a scheme when it has created an unlimited demand for its services and when it has only a limited budget from which to satisfy that demand. It has to either increase the health budget or decrease the services. This is what it is doing. It has been doing it for years. The target it has picked this time is the chemists' remuneration. If we have a wages system in the country and we want to start a revolution, the easiest way to do it is to reduce people's incomes. The Government has been reducing the incomes of the pharmacists recently. If the Government is going to run the fairest, best and most equitable health system in the world, on top of everything else it needs a network of pharmacies and pharmacists who are happy and busy in delivering pharmaceuticals to the people. Under the guise of rationalising the system it is rationing the system. The Government has announced that it wants to see fewer pharmacies and better services. It wants to decide, by financial incentives, where people will have their pharmacies. </PARA>
<PARA> This sort of caper, this social engineering, is just not on when it comes to the delivery of pharmaceutical services. For example, the first pharmacies that will be hit by a reduction in their incomes will be those in poor economic areas. They might be busy pharmacies but because they are in an area that is supplying pharmaceuticals to, say, many pensioners they are marginally economic. The same applies to pharmacies in the country. They may be marginally economic but they are providing a reasonable and good service. The pharmacists providing that service have been happy enough with the remuneration they are getting, but they are not happy with what is happening now. For the Government to use such terms as greedy, money hungry, money grubbing pharmacists reminds me of the argument it used against the doctors. I will take that up when the sitting resumes. </PARA>

Has the Minister been made aware of the recent Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee statistics showing that there have been reductions in higher degree enrolments of nearly 7 per cent in the field of science and nearly 4 per cent in the field of engineering?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The relevant table shows that there has been a fall in higher degree enrolments in those two faculties. It also shows that there has been an increase, approaching 10 per cent in both cases, in enrolments for bachelor degrees in the same faculties. However, another couple of points have been drawn to my attention. Principally, the table on which Senator Macklin's question is based relates to universities only and, therefore, does not include institutions in the former advanced education sector, which accounted for almost 20 per cent of higher degree commencements in science and engineering in 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am advised that the Department is not yet in a position to check in detail statistics collection data on commencing students provided by all institutions in their educational profiles, but it appears to show a rise of some 270 or 11 per cent in higher degree commencements in the fields of science and engineering-150 and 120 respectively in 1989-which suggests that there may be different patterns of growth between the former universities and colleges of advanced education. It is also thought that it might reflect funding arrangements whereby institutions are no longer permitted to count students who have spent more than two years enrolled in a masters degree course or four years doing a PhD. This makes commencements a better indicator than enrolments of the trend in higher degree study.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Only a fortnight or so ago I wrote to the then Minister for Justice of the Republic of Colombia, Mrs Monica De Greiff, who has since resigned, informing her of the support of the Australian Government for her efforts to combat the war declared on the legitimately elected Government in Colombia by the drug barons and war lords of that country. I said in that letter that I offered the fullest cooperation of our national agencies, especially the Australian Federal Police and the National Crime Authority. Imagine my shock and some shame as an Australian on being informed yesterday that allegedly certain Australians were prostituting themselves to those drug barons and war lords and making their military skills available for the training of the private armies of those drug barons, which are being used against the Government and the people of Colombia with the perpetration of a terrorist campaign of violence and intimidation against those people and that Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Parliament itself has indicated its view of Australians going abroad to engage in this sort of activity by passing a law some 11 years ago which makes it an offence for Australians to engage in hostile activities or to train others to engage in hostile activities against the government of a foreign state. Honourable senators will recall that heavy penalties of 14 years and 10 years imprisonment were provided in relation to those offences. In so far as mercenary activity is concerned, payments made under the shamefully concocted contracts between those employing these mercenaries and the soldiers or terrorists involved would prima facie be available to be confiscated under the Proceeds of Crime Act-legislation also passed recently by this Parliament. So I believe that the Government and the Parliament of Australia have indicated their general policy in relation to the abhorrence in which we hold those Australians who go abroad and engage in this sort of mercenary activity.</PARA>
<PARA> Since being informed of this incident the Australian Federal Police, the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been engaged in following up the matters which are alleged to have occurred. Substantial progress has been made in identifying several Australians apparently involved in these mercenary operations and in locating them. That process of investigation is continuing, as I know honourable senators would wish it to do. It is intolerable that Australians should be involved in any collaborative effort working with the drug barons and the war lords, who are targeting Australia with their cocaine shipments. Of course, other Australians are aiding and abetting these drug barons and war lords-those Australians who, at some trendy party, engage in the snorting of cocaine. They are helping to finance, through the criminal syndicates that operate in Australia, by cash flow back to the barons, those very terrorist operations which they see reported on their television sets every night. I wish they would make the connection between what they see on their televisions and what they do when they go to their trendy parties later the same evening.</PARA>

In so far as the Bureau of Industry Economics is concerned, that Bureau prepared an analysis for the Australian Manufacturing Council of relative productivity at Kodak and a variety of matters relating to its management style and so on which is now in the possession of the Government.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australian policy is to work for a comprehensive solution to the Cambodian problem-in fact, any kind of solution which will stop the killing once and for all in that country. We are looking at a solution which would enable all Cambodians to participate in a process of national reconciliation and the reconstruction of their country. In common with member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, the United States of America, India and other participants at the Paris conference, we have taken the view that the prospects for such a durable settlement to the Cambodian problem are better with the Khmer Rouge participating in at least a transitional solution, despite its appalling record, rather than continuing to operate as a guerilla force fighting a prolonged insurgency. It is a matter, on the one hand, of weighing the certainty of continued conflict with the Khmer Rouge if it is left out of any such settlement process against, on the other hand, the very strong possibility, at least, of being able to avoid further bloodshed if it can be brought within such process accompanied by safeguards, reassurances and mechanisms to ensure that it will not be able in the future to exercise the kind of evil influence that it has in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There was agreement at the Paris conference among the Cambodian parties on the need for a new constitution for the country and the formation of a duly elected government following a transitional period. It was recognised that all factions ultimately would need to test their popularity at the polls. That much was agreed. As everyone knows, the stumbling block was the inability of those factions to reach accommodation among themselves on the sharing of power and the arrangements generally during the transitional period. The conference was suspended but the co-presidents, France and Indonesia, were empowered to begin consultations within six months with a view to reconvening the conference. I certainly hope that that may prove possible. We have always been concerned that failure to achieve agreement in Paris could lead to a continuation of the fighting in Cambodia. There are already reports of intensive fighting near the Cambodian town of Palin, close to the Thai-Cambodian border. That lends real urgency to efforts to achieve compromise among the factions and a comprehensive political settlement of the kind I have described, in particular, involving acceptable transitional arrangements and some international supervision, preferably under the United Nations, through an international control mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA> As I have said previously in this Parliament we will continue to support efforts which maintain pressure on all parties, both internal and external, which have the capacity to influence and bring about a comprehensive settlement. Prime Minister Chatichai of Thailand has held discussions in the last few days with leaders of the coalition Government of Democratic Cambodia and Hun Sen about a possible ceasefire. He is also exploring, as has been made public, the possibility of a technical mission being sent to Cambodia under United Nations auspices to explore the country's reconstruction needs. Our Embassy in Bangkok was informed of these proposals but was not involved in their preparation despite what some reports have said.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia supports all efforts to achieve a comprehensive political settlement and we certainly hope that Prime Minister Chatichai's efforts will facilitate that. Whether or not his specific proposals do lead to progress depends in the first instance on their acceptability to all Cambodian factions. Regrettably, at the moment that does not seem very likely. I will keep the Senate informed from time to time of further developments on this matter. I hope that next week at the United Nations I will have the opportunity to have a large number of conversations with other involved foreign Ministers in the hope that we can begin to see some daylight in what at the moment is proving to be a distressingly intractable situation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Berechet, of the Australian Romanian Human Rights Society, is pretty well known to my Department. He has made prolific representations over the years, has been an organiser of several hunger strikes and protests of different kinds and occasionally has made threats of self-immolation by himself or persons whom he represents. Mr Berechet has announced his hunger strike and that of others by putting very detailed file numbers in a press release, which I would have thought would probably be a breach of the Privacy Act. His current campaign revolves around a view that my Department has refused to grant entry visas to their relatives in Romania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In response, let me give some examples, without mentioning any names, of the merits of the cases. A number of the applicants were rejected simply because they failed the points test. Mr Berechet seems to think that there is some automatic right of these people to come to Australia without the need to meet normal requirements that apply to everyone else. Other cases are still under consideration by my Department, either awaiting a primary decision or, in some cases, until the appeals are resolved. In one particular case that the Romanians are protesting about my Department did issue a migrant entry visa but the person is not interested in coming to Australia. We have had to go to the point of video-taping an interview with that person and bringing it back to Australia to show the lack of merit of the claims.</PARA>
<PARA> I am always prepared to meet with groups with complaints about this matter but, as I have said here on other occasions, I will never meet any group under the threat of having a hunger strike. Finally, I add that I do not appreciate Mr Berechet's claim that the Australian Government has approved applicants for migration `to all Romanian gypsies and criminals and to others who have come to this country to join drug dealers'.</PARA>

Has the Minister noted the article by Mr Ross Gittins in Monday's Sydney Morning Herald in which Mr Gittins describes the decision as looking innocent but pernicious to bring forward the collection of company tax and suggests the measure was dreamt up in the Treasurer's office as `a little gimmick to plug a hole in the Budget'-that is, to help Mr Keating come up with a bigger surplus? Does the Minister disagree with the assessment quoted by Mr Gittins that in the calendar year 1990 there will be a $2 billion increase in company tax, equivalent to a one-off surcharge, taking the company tax rate back to 47c? In view of the continuing and well-founded opposition to the decision from the business community and the accountancy profession which, unlike the Government, can understand the practical and financial burdens which will flow from this decision, I further ask the Minister: What did the Treasurer mean last week when he talked about possible changes to the decision as it affects smaller companies? How does the Government intend to define smaller companies? Is the Government prepared to reconsider the decision for all companies because, as Mr Gittins points out, this measure will impose an additional severe squeeze on company cash flows at a time when the economy will be slowing under the Government's high interest rates policy?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, let me make the historical point that company profits and tax flows have been better than they have ever been-certainly better than they ever were under the Fraser Government-so let us get that straight right from the beginning. I have read the article by Ross Gittins and I am no more capable than he is of placing that interpretation on the changes to the company tax regime that were announced in the Budget. In terms of the intrinsic merit of the decision, we are putting Australian companies in the same position as pay-as-you-earn taxpayers and provisional taxpayers. We are putting Australian company taxes in the same sort of environment with which international corporate taxpayers are confronted. Senator Watson is engaging in special pleading, as he has done all his life. He wants us to be internationally competitive except in the way corporations pay their taxes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Resources and is consequent upon the official opening of the enormous North West Shelf gas project by the Prime Minister last week. Has this project actually been in operation, shipping liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Japan, ahead of the official launch? Can the Minister inform honourable senators of any projections that have been made of the potential of the North West Shelf project for the economies of both Western Australia and Australia as a whole?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1415" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="RESOURCES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was pleased to accompany the Prime Minister on Tuesday of last week at the official opening of the export phase of the North West Shelf gas project in Perth. It is regrettable that, because of the pilots strike, the ceremonial opening did not occur in the Pilbara where it was scheduled to take place. Nevertheless, the opening was attended by representatives of the Australian joint venture partners, the present and past Premiers of Western Australia and the Japanese utility customers in the power industry and the gas industry. It was a significant event in the history of energy trade in Australia. Overall, the North West Shelf project is worth $12 billion. It is the biggest single project of its kind ever undertaken in Australia and is arguably the biggest single project of its kind in the world. Ahead of schedule, it commenced exports of liquefied natural gas to Japan; some two months earlier than previously targeted. The project came in under budget, which is a significant achievement for the project managers, the engineers employed and the workers engaged in its construction and development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the 20-year export phase of its life the project will earn $41 billion in revenue in 1989 dollar terms. Its exports are valued at between $1.5 and $1.8 billion a year in 1986 dollars. The joint venture partners will pay $10 billion in royalties and company tax, split on a 25:75 basis between royalties and company tax. The Government will also receive revenue from customs duties and taxes derived from project employment. As at June 1989 a total of $6.182 billion has been committed to the project, of which 74 per cent was Australian content. The joint venture partners for phase two have restructured so that each has a one-sixth share. The Australian participation is 27 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> All associated with the development of this project deserve the commendation of the Australian people. It heralds for us two quite outstandingly important issues. The first is that, because of this development, Australian engineering competence and major resource development project expertise is recognised as being of world class and, indeed, outstandingly so. For Australian project tenderers to major resource developments overseas and in this country, the North West Shelf is a symbol of what Australians can do in major resource development and by any terms is a massive tribute to them.</PARA>
<PARA> The second element that is vitally important is that the Japanese have signed long term 20-year contracts to consume LNG exported from the North West Shelf. There are precious small reservoirs for stockpiling of gas at the wharf in Tokyo. Thus, in signing a long term contract, the Japanese wanted to be absolutely certain of reliability of supply. Those LNG vessels have to appear in silhouette over the horizon of Tokyo Bay with a regularity that has the precision of a Swiss watch. The fact that the Japanese, as consumers, see in Australia an ability to deliver that reliability is a tribute to Australia in the sense that our major export market recognises Australia as a reliable source of supply of a key energy input, essential in terms of its regularity for day to day energy demand in Japan. In terms of our other resources exported out of this country, that is a significant tribute to the Australian work force, to the Australian resource managers and to Australian exporters. It is a powerful argument for Australia to win a greater share of these significant markets overseas for resources and for other elements of our trade exports.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I recall, there is a provision in the two-airline agreement enabling its cancellation in the event of failure by the airlines to fly regular trunk routes, as Senator Durack has said. I would be very surprised indeed-without offering a legal opinion off the cuff, which I am not entitled to do in this place anyway-if that kind of provision were applicable in a circumstance like this, which it is manifestly beyond the capacity of the airlines to influence, given the resignation of their pilots and their obvious inability at the moment to provide more than 50 per cent of the services that they normally provide. The threshold to the question has its own answer in that respect. If there is anything the Minister wants to add, I will supply such information. If the threshold fails, the rest of the question is inapplicable. Certainly, the entry of other parties into the Australian airline system is contemplated in the context of deregulation next year. Whether it would be possible for anyone to get into the market in the present circumstances, with the time leads and lags that are involved, is of course another practical question. On any view, the dispute is likely to be sorted out before it would be possible for some new operator to make any significant difference to the number of aircraft that are flying. Again, I will seek a further comment from the Minister if he wants to add something to what I have said.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just recently. Senator Walters may not read the rural press, but then I guess that she is ignorant on a lot of other fronts as well. There have been reports in the press recently concerning industry anxieties about the import of uncooked Canadian pig meat. The decision made by the Government to not obstruct the importation of uncooked Canadian pig meat on health grounds was made after extensive triallings by the Australian Animal Health Laboratory, in which it trialled the possibility of the transmission of the disease transmissible gastroenteritis in pig meat, and after five years of consultation with the industry and various scientists associated with veterinary disease. In addition, I am advised that a scientific study team has concluded that there is a one in 3.3 million possibility that there may be a transmissible gastroenteritis transmitted by the importation of uncooked Canadian pig meat. Indeed, some industry spokesmen have alleged that that is not a reasonable representation of the odds and that in fact the possibility is one in 15,500. On that basis, I have asked the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to investigate that second claim. They tell me that it is not valid and that the one in 3.3 million possibility is the proper ratio of risk. Even if it were one in 15,500, that would be according to their precepts of acceptable risk, within the terms of that acceptability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is here an important question for Australia. We are the only country in the world that has had a barrier to the importation of uncooked Canadian pig meat on health grounds. Since we have conducted the trial and consulted with the industry, there is no reason why we should maintain that barrier. If we were to, we would be doing so artificially, and thus be in breach of our General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) responsibilities because we would be putting in place an artificial barrier to trade which is contradictory to our free trade stance in the world.</PARA>
<PARA> On the 11th of this month Bruce Lloyd, the shadow spokesman for primary industry, alleged that if Australian herds of pigs contracted transmissible gastroenteritis, up to 90 per cent of suckling pigs would die in less than three weeks. We say that that is just rubbish. We stand by the one in 3.3 million prospect. We also say that there is very little chance, if any, of the mixing of herds. Indeed, if an infection did break out, the area would be quarantined immediately, the pigs involved slaughtered and the piggery disinfected.</PARA>
<PARA> There is some sort of very insipid background campaign to beat up the issues in this area of trade. Given our GATT responsibilities and the acceptable level of risk that has now been determined, there is no--</PARA>

I ask the Minister: First, are there one or more Australian Embassy defence attaches currently in Fiji? If so, what is their specific purpose in being there at this time? Secondly, does the presence of a military attache in Fiji not contradict the Australian Government's suspension of military aid, which was announced after the first coup in Fiji in May 1987?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia's embassy in Suva does include a defence adviser. He has a warrant officer assistant. The defence adviser in Suva is accredited, however, not only to Fiji but also to Vanuatu, Western Samoa, Tonga and other nations of the South West Pacific with whom we have good working defence relations, including active defence cooperation programs. The defence adviser in Fiji has important responsibilities for these other defence relationships. It is convenient to cover these nations from Suva because it is centrally located and well connected. As well, the defence adviser has played a valuable role in the broader work of the embassy in Suva by assisting in its assessment and reporting of developments in Fiji itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the second part of the question, the presence of the defence adviser in no way contradicts or acts against the spirit of the Government's suspension of defence cooperation with Fiji, which of course was introduced, as the honourable senator said, following the first coup in May 1987. The suspension of that assistance program remains in force. By that action, and indeed in many other ways, the Australian Government has continued to make perfectly clear to the Government in Fiji and to the Fijian military forces that it regards the role of the FMF in 1987 as being repugnant to our deeply held beliefs-indeed universally deeply held beliefs-about democracy and constitutional government. As to the concluding part of the question, against that background, there is manifestly no contradiction whatever in maintaining that degree of defence representation in Suva.</PARA>

I gave a more extended answer on that subject during the Estimates committee discussions last night. I refer the honourable senator to the relevant Hansard for a fuller account. That particular document, involving as it did references not only to the removal of the Australian defence attache but also to the severance of trade relations with Australia, is a product of its particular time and is not to be taken as reflecting the current views of the Fiji Government, Major-General Rabuka or the Fijian military forces.</PARA></TALK.START>

To the extent that I am unable to do that, I may not be able to answer completely all of the elements of his question. But I will answer what I can on the basis of the brief that is in front of me. Under a bilateral agreement between Japan and Australia, Japanese long-line vessels are permitted to take fish, including tuna and billfish, from designated areas in the Australian fishing zone. They are excluded from within 12 nautical miles of the New South Wales coastline north of Sydney-an area adjacent to New South Wales north of Sydney area E. They are also subject to a seasonal closure from 31 December to 31 March. This requires them to stay at least 50 nautical miles offshore.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From 1 November this year Japanese vessels will be required to stay at least 50 nautical miles offshore all year. Within this agreement is a voluntary undertaking by the Japanese at least to return to the sea any live black or blue marlin and striped marlin caught off the northern New South Wales coast between 31 December and 31 March. Australia is about to commence bilateral negotiations with Japan on the renewal of the fishing agreement and will be happy to take up in those talks other general related issues. I appreciate that that is not a complete answer to the honourable senator's question, so I will undertake to give a fuller answer to those elements of his question not answered in this reply. There are to be further negotiations and they hold the prospect of some redefinition of these rules.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Master Tax Guide on pages 549 and 551 sheds some light on the matters raised. I will not quote from the Master Tax Guide but the sense of what it says is that expenses incurred when seeking new business are generally non-deductable but those incurred in maintaining or improving relations in regard to existing business are deductable. The amounts allowable for such deductions are set out on page 51 of the Master Tax Guide. The allowable deductions are subject to substantiation rules, as one would expect them to be. Attention was drawn to this in an article in the October-November edition of the publication the Eye which reported that Dr Hewson had travelled to Japan to consult and provide briefings for overseas clients of Baring Securities (Australia) Ltd and that he put in an invoice for $28,000, which is around or slightly above the annual income of somebody on average weekly earnings, to cover both his travel costs and fees. So whether the Ferrari-driving yuppie shadow Treasurer is able to claim the expenses incurred by him in getting what would appear to be assessable income depends upon the degree to which he is able to substantiate the claim and also on the degree to which it is accepted by the Commissioner of Taxation as being entirely a business trip, not a private pleasure trip.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Archer asked me a question about pilot qualifications in the context of the present dispute. I am now able to give a further supplementary answer from the Minister for Transport and Communications. Advice from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is that the various claims that the Authority is relaxing normal requirements for foreign pilots are not true. Where pilots are obliged to sit examinations of any kind, the only essential requirement is that the examinations be successfully passed. The setting of minimum periods at which unsuccessful candidates may resit examinations is an administrative provision aimed at encouraging candidates to prepare themselves adequately for examination. Provision that the specified minimum periods could be varied if circumstances warranted was introduced and notified to the aviation industry in February 1989. The CAA is therefore in this respect applying provisions that were widely notified months before the present pilots dispute arose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of the number of hours required to be flown before pilots can be approved to operate on Australian registered aircraft, the CAA has advised that the essential requirement is that a competent and approved person be satisfied as to the competence of a pilot before he is approved to operate an aircraft. That is the criterion. The normal role of the CAA is to exercise surveillance over the adequacy of an operator's training and to act as a checking organisation. This role is being maintained. In addition, appropriately qualified CAA officers may independently certify the competence of a pilot to perform a particular flying role.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 20 September, only seven days ago, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that the Chairman of the Japan Association of Travel Agents, Mr Manabu Kanematsu, at a luncheon which was attended by the Managing Director of the Australian Tourist Commission and senior executives of all of Japan's major travel companies, said that the pilots strike in Australia ranked with the killings in China's Tiananmen Square and the Chernobyl nuclear accident in the Soviet Union in 1986 in its ability to deter tourists. That is a striking statement, but it does not understate the importance to Australia of the current airline pilots strike. The Australian Tourist Commission has estimated that as a consequence of this strike we will have a 40 per cent fall in Japanese tourists in the next year. Japan is Australia's second biggest and its fastest growing source of tourists. These are extraordinarily serious consequences of the strike. We in this country become inured to strikes because we are brought up in the Labor culture, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) culture, that we can strike whenever we like for as long as we like. I believe we have become blase about the present airline pilots strike and we have lost perspective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to put two points before the Senate. The first is that by Australian standards it is now a very long strike. We are into our sixth week. The second point is the more important one. It is probably the most devastating strike this country has ever suffered in economic terms. The consequences of the strike will be with us for years. The national interest demands that we have an immediate resolution to this problem. This country is not so extraordinarily wealthy that it can go on with this sort of political and economic nonsense. The country is actually bankrupt. </PARA>
<PARA> The strike had its origins in an inappropriate centralised wage fixing system that has failed-the accord. The Government, by its own admission, had knowledge that this strike was coming. It did nothing about it. It did nothing to pre-empt it. It had no contingency plan for when the strike arose. When it started all the Government did was dump fuel on the fire and guarantee that it got out of hand completely. The ego of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) overcame his limited powers of judgment. The Prime Minister was looking for a quick dramatic fix: kill the pilots off; knock the strike over; go to a snap poll and avoid the consequences of the economic morass that he has got this country into. All he has done is prolong the strike, particularly with his means of paying compensation and the prohibition that there will be no negotiation outside the 6 per cent wage guidelines, despite the fact that the Government knows very well that the pilots are being offered by both Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines more than the 29 per cent increase the pilots are asking for. We have no policy from this Government other than the seige mentality that is comparable to that of the generals in the First World War. The Prime Minister is prepared to fight to the last drop of Australia's economic blood on this issue. He just will not give in. He will not negotiate. The Labor Party is quite incapable of running a modern complex industrial society, with the inevitable interdependence between the members of that society. In the process it is sending this country absolutely bankrupt. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequences of this strike are being felt today at a personal level by the families and many small businesses that support the tourist industry in Australia. It is true that the big companies are suffering. Unlike the airline employees and the airline companies, people involved in the tourist industry are getting no compensation at all. Remember that they are paying historically the highest interest rates that this country has ever seen-again another consequence of the economic policy of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Tourism is very important to Australia. Last year, at $6.5 billion, it became our single biggest export industry, eclipsing coal at $6 billion. It has an aggregate turnover within the country of about $26 billion. It is our biggest foreign exchange earner and our biggest employer outside the Public Service, with over 480,000 employees, many of them youths and women. Last year we attracted to this country over 2.2 million overseas visitors. Some 628,000 of those come from Oceania, mainly from New Zealand, and 660,000 from Asia, mainly Japan. Every one of those Japanese tourists that comes to Australia is here for six days on average and spends between $3,700 and $5,000 while here-nearly $1,000 a day. We had 404,000 tourists from North America and 529,000 from Europe, mainly from the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, has said repeatedly in his press releases this year, tourism is Australia's fastest growing industry, employing 6 per cent of the work force and generating about $25.5 billion of our gross domestic product (GDP). In one press release Senator Richardson said that every overseas tourist coming to Australia is worth as much as six tonnes of sugar, 10 tonnes of wheat, 27 tonnes of coal or 64 tonnes of iron ore. </PARA>
<PARA> In the recent past the Australian tourism industry has made a huge investment. It is a new industry on the scale on which it is practised today in Australia. But that investment has been made at today's prices and at today's interest payments. We are suffering devastating publicity on a worldwide basis because of the inability of the Government to overcome this strike. The projections of the Australian Tourist Commission are that we will be down one million tourists next year and $3 billion in the next decade as a consequence of the Government's inability to cope with the strike. Tourists who come here from overseas must have predictability in their travel arrangements. They must know that if they come to Australia for 10 or 14 days they can get on a plane at the end of that time and get back to their place of employment in Europe, North America or Japan. They cannot be held hostage. If they do not get back they lose their jobs. If they do not lose their jobs they know that their budgets blow out. </PARA>
<PARA> A consequence of the present strike is that the package tour operators in North America, Japan and Europe, who work 12 to 18 months ahead, are just writing Australia right out of their programs. They are a very significant part of the Australian overseas tourist trade. When this strike ends, as it must, the costs to Australia will be enormous. We will need time to recover. We will have to demonstrate our performance as a safe market for people to come to and not get stranded and we will have to spend massive amounts of money in overseas advertising-and this at a time when the Government is busy running down its advertising budget overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be very interesting in this debate to see how the Labor Party handles the schism within its ranks over the airlines strike. In the last week we have seen the great split between the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, (Mr Holding). In my files I have many extracts from the papers. There is one from the Sydney Morning Herald which says:</PARA>
<PARA>Keating disputes tourism's ruin. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The pilots' dispute will cost the tourism industry $250 million in lost revenue from international visitors alone in the run-up to Christmas, the Australian Tourist Commission (ATC) claimed . . . </PARA>
<PARA>But the Treasurer-he always knows best-Mr Keating, was sceptical of the industry's warnings of impending ruin. Another article said:</PARA>
<PARA>Pilots not damaging tourism yet-Keating. </PARA>
<PARA>Another article said:</PARA>
<PARA>Keating claims tourism not hurting yet. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Financial Review of 22 September said:</PARA>
<PARA>Keating questions harm. </PARA>
<PARA>What was the response from the industry? `Tourism rage at slap-down from Keating.' ` ``Keating wrong'', says fellow Minister, Mr Holding'. `Pilots: Labor left splits with PM'. And on it goes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not surprising that Mr Keating does not understand the consequences of the strike because he does not understand the economy of this country. He has moved us from a debt position of $33 billion 6 1/2 years ago, when he assumed responsibility for the Treasury, to a debt of $125 billion with the huge balance of payments deficits that we have. Why, only last week we had a record deficit of $2.5 billion. Mr Keating tells us that this is the price of success! God knows what the price of failure would be if a debt position of nearly $130 billion at the ministration of Mr Keating is success. So it is not surprising that he gets the tourism equation wrong and cannot work out what is happening out there in the marketplace. The best vocation for Mr Keating would be selling real gold watches to tourists and travellers on the streets of Sydney, which he could do with great persuasion and conviction. But he certainly cannot run this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us get back to this country and the costs of the strike at the present time. The immediate costs are being borne, as I said before, by many small individuals. Everyone would have heard the broadcasts this morning of the protest meeting in Cairns. Cairns is one of the focal points of new developments in tourism in Australia. My advice there is that in the recent past car rentals have been down by 60 per cent in their peak season. The central business district is reporting drops in trading of 40 per cent to 80 per cent. Airport shops are down to 75 per cent of their normal figure and the accommodation occupancy rates are running as low as 10 per cent. The greatest effect of this strike, of course, is in the outlying States. The effect is greatest in Queensland but it is also very significant in Tasmania and Western Australia. I will leave it to my colleagues to go into that in more detail later on. In passing, I comment that for my own State the cost of the strike so far is estimated to be around $90m to $100m. </PARA>
<PARA> How did we get into the position that we are in today? We got there because the Government bungled the whole thing. We are in very, very serious trouble. The only way we will fix the trouble is by allowing the airline management and the pilots to talk together. The Government, as I said before, knew the strike was planned months and months ago, and did nothing to pre-empt it. There was no contingency plan. When the strike started all we had were the irrational and intemperate displays of abuse from the Prime Minister at the pilots because they withdrew their labour. That right to withdraw labour is always very dear to the Labor Party. The Prime Minister could not get into this fight fast enough. He had no need to enter it at all but he upped the ante, went in and put his neck on the line. Again I have many cuttings from my files. The Canberra Times on 14 September said:</PARA>
<PARA>Hawke's air emergency. </PARA>
<PARA>On 14 September the Sydney Morning Herald said:</PARA>
<PARA>Pilots: PM puts job on the line. </PARA>
<PARA>On 14 September the Australian said:</PARA>
<PARA>PM risks all for total victory over the pilots. </PARA>
<PARA>On 14 September the Age said:</PARA>
<PARA>Hawke puts authority on the line over pilots. </PARA>
<PARA>The Age also said:</PARA>
<PARA>PM declares an air `emergency'. </PARA>
<PARA>On it goes. On 9 September the Age said:</PARA>
<PARA>Hawke bashes the pilots for the sake of other unions. </PARA>
<PARA>These are not the actions of a reasonable, responsible man. There is now very great community concern in Australia at the actions and judgment of the Prime Minister. There is great concern about his emotional stability. Some very serious judgments are now being made about his ability to handle the job. He is exhibiting all the signs of serious cerebral neuronal impairment at the present time. His judgment is execrable. One example is his wish to compensate the airlines for the position they find themselves in, which is dictated by the ACTU saying there will be no stand-downs. Ansett is losing in excess of $10m a week. By my calculation it has lost around $50m to $60m. It wants to settle and reach agreement but the Prime Minister will not let it. Instead, we have this compensation scheme. No-one knows the details of the compensation-how it is to be paid or how it is to be audited. How can Sir Peter say that he deserves the money? I have been rung up in my office by parents of airline employees who are working as flight attendants. I have been told of the case of one family whose two daughters were stood down on 13 September. Presumably the Government will pay compensation to Ansett for those two daughters who should be working as flight attendants, but at the end of the day the agreement to pay compensation to the airlines only prolongs everything and is grossly unfair. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the striking features of the dispute has been the massive disinformation campaign run by the Prime Minister in concert with the airlines. Three weeks ago we heard stories of how the pilots union was collapsing, the strike would be over and the planes would be flying the next day-30 per cent the next week and 50 per cent by the end of the month. We are almost at the end of the month and there is a very long way to go before 50 per cent of aircraft will be flying. Returning to the files, in the Australian dated 9 September, Paul Kelly wrote the following article:</PARA>
<PARA>This week Bob Hawke was buoyant, ebullient, radiating confidence in the pilots dispute. He predicted the beginning of the end. Within a few days Hawke would be vindicated or embattled. </PARA>
<PARA>That was written nearly three weeks ago. We have also had propaganda from Sir Peter Abeles. I quote from a transcript of the Current Affair program broadcast on 14 September, nearly two weeks ago, in which Sir Peter said:</PARA>
<PARA>Next week you won't see just six or seven planes, you will see very rapidly us-whichever way it goes-to have half our fleet flying again much faster than I would have dared to say a week ago. </PARA>
<PARA>He said he would have half his fleet flying, and that should have taken place some while ago. He claimed that he had signed on 50 pilots. Very few pilots have signed on. No check or training captains, for example, have signed on. I am advised that those who have crossed the line are having such pangs of conscience that 50 per cent have taken sick leave. Clearly, from the traffic on the Australian air routes, the companies have made no progress in breaking the strike position of the pilots despite the massive amount of propaganda. </PARA>
<PARA> On the subject of propaganda I refer to the great disinformation campaign that has been waged about the number of stick hours that pilots put in. A figure of eight to 12 hours a week has been given. That has been obtained by taking every pilot in the companies and dividing the figure into the number of hours flown on the type of aircraft. The reason why that figure is so low is that both airlines are involved in massive re-equipment programs. For example, Ansett is training 100 pilots a year on its 737 fleet. That takes up six weeks of the pilots' time during which they do no productive flying at all. Ansett is training pilots on its A320 fleet as fast as it can, and the same applies to Australian Airlines. The disinformation campaign that has been waged has been absolutely striking. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday Senator Archer asked a question of Senator Evans relating to safety. He asked whether there had been changes to safety procedures, which required a yes or no answer. There have been changes to safety procedures as a consequence of Government pressure being brought to bear on the airlines. For example, Ansett did not have a training or check captain in one of its divisions. It has certified a captain in that role in breach of its flight manual. A flight manual is a document laid down by the company, approved by the Civil Aviation Authority, and it cannot be broken without approval. The Ansett flight manual provides that the validation of a new check captain requires three legs where he observes and three legs under supervision where he is checked by a check captain, the flight manager of the fleet and, finally, a CAA examiner of airmen. Ansett obtained certification for one of its captains by flying four non-revenue legs under the supervision of a CAA examiner of airmen. The net result might be the same, but the legal significance is that the law was broken. The consequence of this debasement of safety standards means that Australian travellers are seriously put at risk, despite what the Government says. </PARA>
<PARA> We then have the humbug relating to contracts. Both Ansett and Australian have offered contracts. I have here a copy of the Australian Airlines contract. It provides a base salary which is an increase on the present salary, and an increment whereby the annual salary is divided by one 660th per hour flown beyond a 55-hour figure. In actual fact, the working of that formula gives the pilots more-by about 15 per cent-than they are asking for. The Australian community is absolutely fed up with this strike. The airlines' management wants to settle. The pilots want to settle. The public wants the dispute settled. Australia is bleeding to death on this issue, yet we have the enormous ego of the brain-damaged Prime Minister, an ego which can be measured as costing Australia $3 billion--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will address that point. The Australian Associated Press (AAP) is providing a very useful service in giving a regular update on the news scan service of the increasing and devastating cost of this dispute. It is very patchy. With reference to the interjection I just heard, it is a fact that in the major capitals such as Sydney and Melbourne the impact of the dispute on most of the hotels is not felt as badly as it is in the isolated parts of Australia. There are some parts of the tourist industry, such as bus companies, which are doing great business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, in respect of the Northern Territory, as AAP notes, the loss so far is around $12m. I would say that is a low figure. One of the things that particularly concern me, and I am continually making representations about it to the Government, is the very low level of flights being maintained to isolated parts of Australia such as Darwin, which is currently running at only 15 per cent. Having said that, there is no doubt about where the blame has to lie. It lies fairly and squarely at the feet of the Air Pilots Federation. For Senator MacGibbon to say that this dispute is being caused by the Government or the central wage fixing system is nonsense. It was caused by the totally intractable position of the Air Pilots Federation which it has not moderated by one degree. I refer to the Federation's public statements made only yesterday and again today in its negotiations with the companies. </PARA>
<PARA> The solution which the Opposition is suggesting is the simple-minded rhetoric that if the pilots simply sat down with the companies everything would be sorted out. That is precisely what caused this dispute. On day one the Pilots Federation wanted 29 per cent plus, it has not budged from that by one iota, and it repeated that demand yesterday and today. Instead of simply believing the rhetoric that is being run by the Federation it is about time the Opposition took the blinkers off and looked at the facts. The Pilots Federation, crying crocodile tears, says that `it deeply regrets the damage done to the tourist industry, but this is beyond our control'. That is a lie. Not only was it not beyond the control of the Pilots Federation but the document that I tabled here in the Senate, the one that was issued to members of the Federation months before this dispute started, on how to handle a non-income period, indicated just how cold-bloodedly and callously the Federation planned this dispute to inflict the maximum possible damage from day one. It has not budged from that position for six weeks. This dispute will go down as being the most badly handled dispute by union leadership in this country's industrial history. </PARA>
<PARA> The terms of the matter of public importance talk about the Government's mismanagement. What is relevant in this debate this afternoon, and it should have been canvassed before, is the degree of mismanagement that has been applied to this dispute by the Air Pilots Federation. It will go down as being the worst handled dispute ever in this country's history. It has been handled in the most juvenile, unbelievable fashion by the leadership of the AFAP. I regret that the membership of the Air Pilots Federation has followed it like sheep. I regret it because I know quite a number of those pilots very well from the time they flew in the Northern Territory. I think they have been very badly advised. What Brian McCarthy has done for the airline pilots of this country is what Bruce Shepherd did for the doctors. I think Brian McCarthy has done a better job on the airline pilots than Bruce Shepherd did on the doctors. </PARA>
<PARA> It would have to be the first duty of a union-and I have been a trade unionist all my working life-to protect the jobs of its members. That would have to be the fundamental tenet that members can expect from a trade union. But what has this union done for its members? I will tell honourable senators what it has done. It has cost all of its members their jobs; it has cost all of its members their seniority; it has cost all of its members, who perhaps would have been laid off under the productivity increases which the airlines are not unreasonably wanting from their pilots, their redundancy payments; it has cost its members all of the conditions-and they were considerable conditions-built up over the last 30 years attached to those agreements. Importantly, it has also cost its members the support and the respect of the majority of their fellow Australians. That is a pretty severe price to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> I might also add in respect of the jobs that a significant number of the resignations that were handed in by pilots were presigned and undated. If any trade union that I belonged to came to me within one week of the dispute starting and said `Hand me an undated resignation from your job which we will hand in at our discretion' I would tell the union to go and jump in the creek. It is a pity that the Federation members have been led by the nose by these stupid-and they are stupid-tactics. </PARA>
<PARA> Legal people said, I noted in the press at the time, what a brilliant move this was legally. It may have been very clever legally in avoiding common law actions. Industrially it was stupid. It was the trump card of the Federation. Unfortunately, it also happened to be the last card of the Federation. There are not many people in this country, there are not many groups of workers, who are in the happy position of being able to resign from their jobs as a weapon during an industrial dispute-within a week of the dispute starting. Only the airline pilots could afford it. But it was a stupid thing to do industrially and they have continued to be stupid ever since. </PARA>
<PARA> I offer a piece of gratuitous advice to the Pilots Federation, and this is genuine advice-I am in the public relations business, like every single person in this chamber: if I were a member of that Federation I would be making sure that someone other than Brian McCarthy handled the public relations for me in terms of any future industrial action that I might be taking, because he has been a disaster. Brian `the sphinx' McCarthy. So many people are getting their backs up every time they see that wooden face on television saying, `29 per cent'. He has been saying it for six weeks. If he keeps on doing it I think that the Pilots Federation is going to have to either change its President or send him off for a very intensive course in public relations because he has been an absolute disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> A furphy has been put forward which I would like to address-Opposition members have got on to it in the last couple of days and they think it is cute-about strikebreaking by this Government, strikebreaking by the airlines. What a nonsense. Senator Stone first ran it and everyone had a good laugh. Senator Chaney ran it again yesterday and again today, I noted, in the Senate during Question Time. It is a nonsense. There is no strike. People have the hide to compare this dispute with Mudginberri. No-one is more familiar with Mudginberri than I am. It is not in the same street as Mudginberri. There is no strike. Why is there not a strike? There is not a strike because the airline pilots have resigned from their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> I heard Senator MacGibbon saying what a tragedy it is that in this country people can go on strike whenever they like. It is called democracy, Senator. It is the greatest system of government in the world, with all its faults and failings. In exchange for that freedom, there are certain things one has to do within our system that provide limitations on free association and what one can tell individuals about whether they want to stay in work or not. If the airline pilots are stupid enough to hand in presigned, undated resignations to the Federation and say `There are our jobs, there is our seniority, there is our redundancy, there is everything that the Federation has worked for and built up in the last 30 years; it is out the window as far as we are concerned', then so be it. It is their right in this country to do it. No government can stop them from doing it and no government should have the power to stop them from doing it. If they are stupid enough to do it, then be it on their own heads. </PARA>
<PARA> But having said that, therefore there is no strike. What is happening now is that the Opposition once again is picking up the rhetoric of the Air Pilots Federation saying that there is a strike, because McCarthy says there is a strike. McCarthy put out a press statement last night in the most extreme and offensive language. Honourable senators opposite talk about offensive language. I will give them a bit in about five minutes from now from the President of the Air Pilots Federation to the President of the Industrial Relations Commission and they can tell me whether they think it is a sensible way to handle a dispute. I will incorporate the letter. </PARA>
<PARA> McCarthy says that the Government is using scab labour, that it is strikebreaking. What did the Federation say to the Industrial Relations Commission about that? I will tell honourable senators. In terms of hypocrisy and cant, the Federation is equalled only by members of the Opposition. I will quote from a transcript of the proceedings before the Industrial Relations Commission which I was going through to find out what the positions of the parties were. I found this little gem. It is from Wednesday, 30 August 1989. It is Mr Cox, representing the Air Pilots Federation. The representatives of the airline companies had been using the word `dispute' in relation to this matter, which I did not think was unreasonable. Not only were the airline pilots enraged about the use of the word `strike' but they could not even handle the use of the word `dispute'. This is what the Air Pilots Federation said in front of the Industrial Relations Commission in August. I quote from page 27:</PARA>
<PARA>I used the word problem. I deliberately do say not a dispute, because there has been no strike action taken by the federation at any time during the airline area . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I clearly mention that now because the word has been clearly used as dispute and I have to say the word dispute or its connotations has been that there has been a strike by airline pilots. There has not. And there continues not be a strike by airline pilots. </PARA>
<PARA>Talk about two bob each way! The President put out a statement yesterday saying that the Government is strikebreaking; the airlines are strikebreaking. Federation representatives stand up in front of the Industrial Relations Commission-in court-and twice say categorically that they are not on strike. They cannot have it both ways. But they continue to want to have it both ways, not just in respect of how they are handling this dispute, but also in respect of how they handle their own membership. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federation should have a talk to the 40 per cent of its membership who are not airline pilots, those pilots who fly for government entities in Australia and those pilots who fly for the general aviation sector in Australia. The Federation adopts a very interesting position in respect of them. They consider themselves to be the forgotten members of the Air Pilots Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Federation arguing? It is arguing that 40 per cent of its members should stay inside the system which it is pouring scorn on and over which it is bringing this country to its knees. It wants 40 per cent of its members to stay inside that system, because it benefits them, and it wants 60 per cent of its members to go outside the system. If the honourable senator wants any evidence of that, instead of simply believing the latest press release that Brian McCarthy puts out, which is what the honourable senator has been doing, he should read the facts. I commend to the honourable senator a reading of the transcript. This is what the representative of the domestic airlines said to the Commission in respect of this matter when it was heard on 30 August:</PARA>
<PARA>So the federation is using the processes of the commission seeking arbitration on matters, seeking increases consistent with the commission's wage-fixing principles in this area, taking the benefit of the system, in stark contrast to its attitude to both the commission and its wage-fixing principles-and I might say the public interest-in the domestic area. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>If the commission pleases, the federation cannot have it both ways. In my respectful submission it cannot take the benefits in this area and come to the commission saying, ``Everything is rosy, there is no disputation. In fact we are processing claims through the good offices of the commission.'' And on the other hand take the notorious stance which it is taking in the major dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely true. If the honourable senator reads this transcript, he will see that that is exactly what the Federation is saying. It went before the Commission and said, `We do not want to touch anything in the general aviation area that affects 40 per cent of our membership. There is no disputation. All the agreements are holding up. Everybody is doing wonderfully well in the central wage fixing system and before the Commission. We want those members to stay in the system and we want the other 60 per cent to go outside of it'. We cannot have that schizophrenic, stupid attitude responsibly put by a trade union and expect it to be taken seriously. But that is the position of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots which the Opposition is supporting so enthusiastically. </PARA>
<PARA> I could quote a lot more but for want of time I will finish with this quote. Mr Parry, who was also representing the airline industry at the same hearing, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The position would appear to be that the federation is quite happy to use the commission and the principles in the areas where it has little membership or strength. However, where the federation considered it had some strength it ignored the commission and also ignored the wage fixing system. The airlines that I represent do not consider it appropriate that the federation retains the benefits and protection of the award system under certain awards which are before the commission today when they are not prepared to process claims under certain other awards in accordance with wage fixing systems. Those other awards being the ones that were recently cancelled by a full bench of this commission. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly the federation cannot have the best of both worlds. The position of the companies I represent is that they consider it an appropriate step for the commission to exercise its powers under section 113 and set aside all awards for which the federation are respondent. If the commission pleases, that is the position of the companies I represent. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not an unreasonable position. The reality is that the position adopted by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots in this dispute is totally unreasonable and totally untenable. As someone who is an expert in industrial relations said to me this morning when I showed him a certain document which I intend to incorporate, `Who in the bloody hell do these people think they are?'. It is a very good question. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to get on to a few things that have been said by Mr McCarthy and his friends in the Opposition about two matters: contracts which were just mentioned by Senator MacGibbon and yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Chaney; and $100m. The President of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots continues to assert on the basis of no evidence whatsoever that $100m of taxpayers' money is being spent by the Government in assisting the airlines in this dispute. That is absolute nonsense. It may well be that if members of the Federation do not wake up to themselves and start behaving responsibly with a bit of consideration for the fact that they are Australians and that they have to exercise some consideration for their fellow Australians who have been devastated by this dispute-the Opposition is quite right about that-it will cost the Government $100m after the 28th of this month. If the Federation does not start showing some sense that it has been called upon to show by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Chaney, in here and before the press, it could cost $100m. It has not cost $100m or anything like it. </PARA>
<PARA> This morning I read cover to cover the contracts that are being offered by Ansett Airlines of Australia to the airline pilots. I did so because I was not prepared to come in here and say that Senator Chaney's assertions yesterday were false unless I knew that they were. Senator Chaney said yesterday that he had seen a contract and that it provides for a 40 per cent increase in salary on the existing working conditions of the pilots. He is either misleading the Senate or he should go back to law school and do a tutorial in contracts. I have read the contracts and I will tell honourable senators what they offer. </PARA>

This dispute had a bit of light at the end of the tunnel the other day. Everyone welcomed it. There was a huge sigh of relief around Australia from a lot of people when Mr Justice Maddern said, `Let's have this before the Commission'. Of course, everybody welcomed that, including Senator Chaney. In an interview given on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Monday, 25 September 1989, Senator Chaney said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I agree with Senator Chaney and that is what the pilots should have done. Headlines have appeared all over Australia on this issue and I quote just two: one appearing in the Canberra Times states, `Strike hopes dive: Pilots snub peace deadline . . . ' and the other appearing in the Australian Financial Review of today states, `Pilots snub judge's airline peace move'. It was with total despair that thousands of Australians, including me, saw those headlines. Why have the pilots done this and how have they done it?

<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your statement made last Monday. </PARA>
<PARA> Your statement purports to record the history of the dispute, to make findings and give consequential directions. The Federation wishes to record that your statement was made without any prior disclosure to the Federation of the content of the statement, nor any opportunity being given to the Federation to be heard by you. The Federation does not accept the content of much of your statement. However, no point would be served in canvassing those areas in this letter. </PARA>
<PARA> To respond to your statement, the Federation must hold meetings of its members. These are being arranged at short notice in Brisbane, Perth, Melbourne and Sydney over the next two days. The federation will not be able to respond by 3.00 p.m. today. It will respond immediately the meetings have concluded, and there has been an opportunity to formulate an appropriate response. Any delay is not of the Federation's making. Had the Federation had earlier notice of your intentions the matter could have been dealt with at meetings that were held last week. </PARA>
<PARA> Your statement records that the airline companies `have employed pilots on individual contracts'. The question of whether any and if so what type of pilots have signed individual contracts has been a contentious issue during the dispute. In order that the Federation can make an informed response to your statement, will you kindly inform the Federation of your understanding as to the number and classification of pilots who have signed individual contracts with each airline, and further indicate the source of the information on which your statement was based. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today the Senate is debating a matter of public importance which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The personal suffering and financial hardship inflicted on tens of thousands of Australians, particularly those living in more remote parts of the country, by the Government's gross mismanagement of the airline pilots' dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>We debated yesterday the matter of the Government's gross mismanagement and the Senate came to the conclusion that the Government is guilty of gross mismanagement. The Australian Democrats established the fact that it is not only the Government at whose door gross mismanagement may be laid. No one can condone the stance that the air pilots have taken. I have listened to other statements that have been made but I do not think that any inflammatory statements will help the matter at this stage. I also listened very carefully to the speeches by Senator MacGibbon and Senator Collins. I would like to state that hot air in this place will also not solve that dispute. Ultimately the only way the dispute can be solved is by negotiation, however that is finally done. </PARA>
<PARA> To turn to the first part of the matter that we are debating, there is a great deal of personal suffering. The effects have been horrendous in many cases. People have been unable to attend events of great importance to them on a personal basis such as weddings and funerals. People have been unable to be near someone who is ill or distressed. People have been unable to take their holidays when planned. Sports teams have been unable to compete. One particular incident of great tragedy which I would like to bring before the Senate was reported in the Hobart Mercury of 12 September when it was claimed that Tasmanian heart patients had died while waiting to travel interstate for surgery. Once we get to suffering on that level, we are into great suffering indeed. The greatest and most devastating effect overall has been felt by the tourism industry and by those who depend on the tourism industry on a flow on basis. Certainly, the more remote parts of Australia have suffered most of all. Some areas have been virtually cut off as far as air travel is concerned. Last week I opened a hotline in my Perth office on the issue of the air pilots dispute. Many of the people who called in were involved in the tourism industry. The picture painted by these people has amplified on a personal basis what has been reported of late in the media and there seem to be similarities in all States. Much of the Australian land mass may be defined as remote. Certainly, I would define as remote the whole of Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Tasmania and the northern parts of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> As Western Australia is my home State, I would like to start with the situation there. Western Australia has been virtually cut off to air travel since the pilots dispute. We have only to look at the press reports of airline schedules to see that the city of Perth very rarely rates a mention. The Perth Convention Bureau has been monitoring the financial loss suffered by its hotel members as a result of the pilots dispute and the effect on conventions and hotel accommodation. The hotels involved are the Hyatt, the Sheraton, the Perth International, Burswood, the Orchard, the Langley, Observation City and the Transit Inn. As at 18 September the hotels had suffered the following losses: 66 meetings and conventions, 4,129 delegates, 7,253 room nights and more than $1.2m in business. Over $3.6m in business spending has been lost to Perth as a whole. The estimated total loss to the State as a whole in terms of conventions alone is well over $6m. </PARA>
<PARA> I spoke to the owner of a women's fashion boutique in Broome, a town which is particularly suffering from the pilots dispute. This boutique sells only Australian made garments and its sales are down by some 70 per cent. Obviously this is another example of a flow on business which is suffering. I guess that as this boutique sells only Australian fashion, this downturn will flow on to the manufacturing industry. Broome has been particularly badly hit. The two French aeroplanes with their French crews which were hired to specifically fly from Perth to the northern parts of Western Australia cannot land at Broome airport. There is no air traffic control at Broome airport and pilots act as air traffic controllers. Because the French pilots either cannot or will not do this, Broome has been cut off from commercial air travel for the whole of the last six weeks. Planes land at Port Hedland, Derby and Kununurra, but not at Broome. </PARA>
<PARA> I could tell the Senate a number of distress stories about Broome, but I will not have time to do that today. Other towns in Western Australia, such as Geraldton, Kalgoorlie, Derby, Port Hedland and Exmouth, also have been very badly hit by the pilots dispute. Hotel accommodation, taxi hire and self-drive car hire are down and the tourist agencies have lost out on pre-booked tour trips. I think the only companies in that area which are gaining from this situation are the bus companies whose business is well up. A number of Australian operators have changed itineraries for groups which they are sending to New Zealand after a short stay in Sydney instead of to other Australian destinations such as central Australia or Queensland. This means that, apart from cancellations, the impact of the strike has been particularly felt in Sydney, north Queensland and the Gold Coast, Central Australia-particularly Ayers Rock and Kakadu-Tasmania and Perth. A report from the Alice Springs Regional Tourist Association Inc. says that tourism has virtually halted and it will take months, if not years, for many operators to recover. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been already mentioned in this place, the effect has been particularly devastating on the State of Tasmania. The tourists are staying away from Tasmania because holiday-makers require firm schedules and guaranteed connections. The Wrest Point Casino has laid off all casual gaming staff. Other gaming staff now work only four days a week. Launceston's recently opened international hotel has been forced to restructure its management and the Executive Director of the Tasmanian Visitor Corporation Ltd reports that some Tasmanian hotels are suffering occupancy rates of only 5 per cent, which is about the lowest I have heard of. </PARA>
<PARA> Tasmania's growing gourmet food industry relies on regular, complete air schedules and is losing millions of dollars while the dispute lasts. Conventions, meetings and conferences have been cancelled in Tasmania, as they have been throughout Australia. Tasmania plays a unique role as the end of the season destination for many Victorian football clubs. One Hobart hotel, which specialises in catering for club visits, has had to suffer the cancellation of all 20 clubs which were scheduled for October. The northern parts of Queensland have also been particularly badly affected. During a rally last night in Cairns some 2,000 people expressed their anger at the pilots dispute.</PARA>
<PARA> Although this dispute has continued for six weeks, there seems to be no definitive end in sight. Early in September, representatives of the Australian Tourist Industry Association met with representatives of such peak industry bodies as the Australian Bankers Association and the Australian Finance Conference. In fact, the tourist industry is getting remarkably unsympathetic treatment from banks and the finance industry generally. Members of the tourist industry have told me that the finance industry is slow to move and that any lending is being done at current commercial rates. </PARA>
<PARA> At the rally in Cairns there was a call for the Reserve Bank of Australia to release some statutory reserve deposit funds back to the banks and their subsidiary finance companies to assist in the restructuring and continued existence of individual operators. All the businesses in Cairns have been particularly badly affected. One local car rental business, which used to employ 10 people, now employs seven and is likely to employ fewer. Business is down to 60 per cent. Of course, this is the peak time in that part of Queensland. It is a time when people escape from the southern winter. I am told that today the temperature in Cairns is 28 degrees. Some of us here might be envious of that. The car hire firm I mentioned relies almost exclusively on tourism for business. </PARA>
<PARA> The tour operators in Cairns, and the hotels particularly, are operating at about only 30 per cent of their normal capacity. In many instances, they are offering 50 per cent discounts. So, in fact, they are operating at only 15 per cent. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IH4">Senator JENKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have talked about some towns in the west. If I have time, I will talk more about that. All over Australia we are looking at poor takings in hotels, motels and convention centres. The flow on from this is affecting sales of petrol, spare parts for the car industry, laundries, catering services, retailers and taxis. It is affecting just about everybody. Revenue is way down and the figures have been explained in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is particularly interesting to look at air fares and I think this matter needs to be raised at this stage. The return air fare from Perth to Sydney is $1,004. The return air fare from Perth to Singapore in the low season is some $690 and in the high season some $800. The air fare from Perth to Bali in the low season is $500 and in the high season $600. Broome has been advertised as an alternative holiday resort to Bali. The building up of that business has decreased dramatically, and the tour operators in Broome are saying that it will take a long time to build it up again. People are losing their confidence in the airline industry in Australia and it will take a very long time for it to return. We read in the newspapers that a series of meetings to plan the recovery of the tourism industry will be held next month in each capital city. It will be very interesting to see what will come out of that. There is talk of people taking the pilots and maybe the airlines to court. We will have to see what comes out of that. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time left to me I will give further details of the situation in Western Australia. We read that the takings in Broome are down to such an extent that it is highly unlikely that businesses will be able to recover for years to come. Cable Beach Resort has lost more than $400,000 in the past 1 1/2 months. It reported that 90 per cent of its business comes from incoming flights. Therefore, that business is virtually non-existent. The Mangrove Motel and the Roebuck Bay Resort are up for sale because their turnover is down by some 30 to 40 per cent. Together they have had to put off some 60 staff. Room rates are down from $100 to $25 a night. This is the picture right across Australia. Hotels are having to give special deals in order to have anybody in them at all. One company is having to sell its charter boat service in Broome. Sales are reported as down right across the board in all retail stores. Weekend package holidays in Exmouth have been affected 100 per cent. There is a great fear in Geraldton that the crayfishing industry will be affected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The pilots dispute has reached such critical proportions that unless a breakthrough occurs this week many decent Australians will be sent to the wall through no fault of their own. It is unforgivable that a strike that was planned with military precision by the pilots well before the event, planning that was well known not only to the airline industries but also the Government, was allowed to eventuate. Why was this allowed? It was allowed because Sir Peter Abeles, Mr Rupert Murdoch and Mr Strong were anxious to use this confrontation for their own purposes. They were determined that by early next year they would have shed 400 pilots without paying redundancy payments so that when the deregulation arrived next year, the new airlines, so far Capital Airlines and Compass Airlines, would be able to compete more readily with Australian Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This dispute has been readily acknowledged by all sides as one that will be long and drawn out and one in which the winner will take all without concern, sympathy or care for those hurt along the way. The Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Peter Morris, could not even guarantee that the strike would be over by Christmas. The situation is that the pilots, sitting back on jolly good incomes, and the airlines, with their millions of dollars behind them, are prepared to sacrifice the average Australian worker for their own ends. No dispute can be resolved without both parties giving a little. But instead of allowing, through financial hardship, both parties to get together and talk, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has personally entered the dispute. He had inflamed the situation by stupid, childish, tantrum-type remarks. He has refused to allow the parties to talk and has subsidised the airlines, deliberately permitting them to forgo the financial hardship which is necessary to bring them to the conference table. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last few weeks the pilots have offered to go back to work full time so long as the Government allows them to negotiate, through the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, with their employer. It would have to be proper negotiation of wages and productivity. But the Prime Minister has refused to allow this to happen. The Government's mishandling of the pilots dispute is costing this country thousands of millions of dollars, not just in the short term but in areas in which it will take years to recover. I am sure we were all horrified and thoroughly embarrassed by the television news in the early steps of the strike which showed a Japanese tour organiser trying to explain to his tourist group that there was no way they could travel to their promised destination. He said, `All planes are grounded because of a strike'. Finally, he said, `It's unbelievable'. Even to Australians who are used to the worst industrial disputation of any country it is unbelievable. The long term harm to our tourist industry is inconceivable. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Treasurer, Mr Keating, maintains that very little damage is being done to the industry, yesterday, Senator Button, during his criticism of the Opposition, which was showing concern about the plight of so many affected industries, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Liberals come back from their electorates having found that the tourist industry is feeling the pinch a bit. </PARA>
<PARA>He and his mates obviously do not have the vaguest idea of what is happening in Tasmania. If the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, the only Minister from our State, is not capable of getting our problems across to Cabinet, Senator Button should come down to see for himself just what the situation is. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me explain to the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus), who is present, what is happening in our State. The two casinos in Tasmania and the Sheraton Hotel in Hobart are in dire straits. Their occupancy is down to 20 per cent. In the last week conferences at Hobart casino have been cancelled. Others have struggled on with about a quarter of the previously expected numbers. These conferences-one of which, ironically, was a tourist conference-have all lost considerable money which was necessarily spent on planning them. Does the Minister who is present really believe that a conference planner will look favourably on Tasmania next year bearing in mind the loss this year? The Prime Minister and his Ministers say that this situation will only be temporary. Senator Button says, `We're feeling the pinch a bit'. The Government should come to its senses immediately. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the reduction in the number of guests in these large hotels, 80 casuals have been stood down in one of them. The other two hotels will stand down all casuals on Monday. This includes gaming casuals, housemaids, room service attendants, et cetera. The permanent staff, from management down, will be put on a four-day working week. While permanent staff salaries will be cut by one-fifth the effect on the casuals, many of whom are supporting mothers with several children, will be devastating. Is the Minister too isolated, with his high salary, to understand this? How would he cope if he suddenly lost one-fifth of his salary or lost it altogether? How do these people continue to pay the 17 1/2 per cent or 18 per cent interest rate on home mortgages that this Government has forced upon them through its mishandling of the economy?</PARA>
<PARA> Is the Minister aware of the flow-on effect to other Tasmanian industries of the devastation of the tourist industry? The casinos' ordering of liquor and food-meat, vegetables, seafood, yoghurt, custard and cheese-is down 35 per cent on their normal level. Hairdressing and laundry industries are feeling the pinch. Our local industries are not just feeling the pinch a bit; they are being devastated. The local butcher has assured me that his sales are well down. It is not just the big operators which are affected. I will quote from a letter written to me by a small operator-Bushventures 4WD Tours:</PARA>
<PARA>As a small family operator totally involved in the Tourist Industry in Tasmania, I feel compelled to write and voice our deep concern . . . </PARA>
<PARA> We stand to lose our livelihood, our home, and along with this the stigma of bankruptcy . . . through no fault of our own. </PARA>
<PARA>We rely almost totally on mainland and overseas tourists. </PARA>
<PARA> Tourism has been promoted as our number-one industry and is increasing and yet our politicians have allowed us to reach a point of losing 90% of our income by not securing exemptions for Tasmania during disputes, and for not even being able to coordinate any proper emergency arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The banks are very willing to extend our overdraft, but how do we repay them?</PARA>
<PARA> Is the Government going to drop our interest rates?</PARA>
<PARA> Pay our commitments to the bank?</PARA>
<PARA>So the letter continues. If Senator Button could spare a few moments to come down and look at the craft shops around Salamanca Place, he would discover how they are feeling. They are not feeling the pinch only a bit. One shopkeeper told me that the shop had taken $3 for the day and that would not even pay the rent. It is not only the tourist industry that is affected; all our industries are involved. As many honourable senators would know, Tasmania has a salmon and sea-run trout industry worth $40m a year. The salmon harvesting season has just begun and the ocean trout harvesting season has almost ended. To maintain its markets the industry was forced to transport ocean trout by charter aircraft at a loss. Oystas, a new company, is also at risk of losing its interstate, Japanese and American markets. Our crayfish, abalone, fresh cheese, fresh fruit, fresh flowers-what do we do with a week old tulip?-vegetable and meat industries are losing out. We can get our perishable goods to Melbourne, but we cannot get connecting flights. On several occasions flights have missed international connection. That is only part of our State's problems. I have not even mentioned the hire-car and taxi industry. Senator Button and his mates say that we are feeling the pinch only a bit. I believe they should come to Tasmania and have a look at the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make it quite clear that this situation has occurred as a direct result of the Government's industrial relations policy. It has no legislation, no policy, to force the pilots back to work. It does not matter that the Prime Minister keeps saying that this could occur under our policy. The Australian people know that that is wrong. It has happened right under this Government's industrial relations policy. If we are seeking an independent review of the matter let us consider what the credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service had to say. It gave as one of the main reasons for downgrading our credit rating the persistence of structural weaknesses embedded in Australia's domestic and international position, such as intransigent rigidities in the local labour market and transport markets, as these constrain international competitiveness. In other words, the Government's industrial relations policy is not flexible enough and inhibits our competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me explain how our policy would work. We would have voluntary unionism so that those pilots who were not union members could negotiate with the airlines in their own capacity. Pilots who were union members could get their union to negotiate on their behalf. If the negotiations fell through they would go to the Industrial Relations Commission, which could make a determination that would have the backing of law. That is not the case at the moment. The present situation could occur only under the Labor Government. I call on Ministers in this Government to take on the Prime Minister-I am sure that not all of them agree with him-and tell him that he cannot continue to sacrifice the average Australian for his own political face-saving. He must retire from the dispute before there is an air tragedy. If a tragedy occurs because of the short cuts in air safety about which we have spoken in this place today, it will be laid right at the feet of the Prime Minister and the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter before us today is indeed an important one. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The personal suffering and financial hardship inflicted on tens of thousands of Australians, particularly those living in more remote parts of the country, by the Government's gross mismanagement of the airline pilots' dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>I would be one of the first to agree that a great deal of personal suffering has resulted from the pilots dispute. No doubt many people have suffered considerable hardship because of it. No doubt those Australians who live in remote and isolated areas are also greatly affected by the dispute. I also think that the domestic air travelling public has suffered great inconvenience. Many trips have been postponed or cancelled. Road, rail and bus travel has greatly expanded and, indeed, a large number of overseas tourists have either cancelled or postponed trips to Australia because of the dispute. There can be no doubt that the dispute has cost individuals a great deal of money and cost the country great losses of earnings, and many businesses will no doubt suffer lost profits. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the alleged mismanagement of the dispute, in my view the Opposition has got it wrong. The Government has a duty to govern in the interests of all Australians and to maintain a balanced system of wage movement, not the anarchy or law of the jungle which appears to be coalition policy. When the Opposition claims that this dispute has been mishandled, it is guilty of some of the worst humbug and hypocrisy. The Government must stand firm behind a wages policy that has established guidelines and seen the reversal of the disastrous Fraser-Howard years when inflation and unemployment went out of hand in 1981-82. In those years Australia experienced a wages explosion and a recession followed that saw unemployment rise to around 11 per cent. The policy of the coalition Government of that time, which allowed collective bargaining and ended centralised wages fixing, gave wages outcomes that threatened to wreck the whole country. Indeed, the industrially strong did very well out of those years, whilst other groups of wage and salary earners copped the inflation and the broken promises. They remembered those failed policies in March 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition's present policy seems to be the same. The coalition does not feel the need to rethink and reassess its position since 1981-82, even through the price of its policies has been the political wilderness ever since. This is an important matter, because the central issue in the pilots dispute is whether a centralised system of wage fixation with checks and balances and benefits for all wage and salary earners can survive. The alternative, which the pilots want, is a wage fixing system which allows them, with their ability, to wreck the tourist industry, dislocate business and cost Australia valuable overseas exchange in order to have wage rises whenever they wish. The pilots can hold a gun at the head of the Government or the airlines and say, `Pay up now or we will cause all the dislocation and disruption that we can'. The pilots know that they can rely on the support of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Government and the airlines refuse to pay up, they are accused by the Opposition of mishandling the dispute. Of course, if things were different and the Government did not stand firm, the wage fixing principles would be thrown out of the window. The industrially strong would immediately use the muscle that they have and completely break the wages system that has seen an unparalleled growth in Australian employment. If that were to happen, no doubt the Opposition would be arguing here for quids for its mates and nothing for the rest. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, it is interesting to see the Opposition's real industrial relations policy at work. When Canberra doctors were out after every dollar they could get, the whole world had to come to a stop. The Opposition screamed foul and said that the doctors had to get exorbitant rises immediately. I seem to remember listening in this Senate to how terrible it was that visiting specialists could get only $67 an hour in Canberra but could get $97 in Sydney and how the world would come to an end because of it. All of this was stated here day in and day out by Senators Walters, MacGibbon and Lewis. </PARA>
<PARA> I also remember hearing in a debate as recently as this morning how the Government really ought to pay more to the pharmacists. It was a different story when it came to the Mudginberri or Dollar Sweets workers. Every sanction possible was advocated then. The policy was different, but quite clear-cut. If the meat workers and confectioners had been wiped out, no doubt the Government would have mishandled that dispute as well. In that case the Opposition wanted every possible weapon used to break the strike. This time it is the Opposition's mates, so it wants negotiations, pay deals and the whole bit. The hypocrisy of the Opposition's whole industrial relations policy stands out starkly. When ordinary workers are involved, every weapon is used to break them; but when it is the Opposition's mates we must all get together and work out a deal. The Norm Gallaghers of the airline industry can feel safe with the coalition's industrial relations policy. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent article in the Age shows quite clearly what the community thinks on this issue. An article entitled `Poll finds most think pilots' pay claim is unreasonable', showed in polling that the public stood firmly behind the Government in the dispute. Three out of four people in Melbourne and Sydney believed the pay claim to be excessive. Even more enlightening in this article was a phone poll conducted in Melbourne with a sample of 400 respondents which showed that 76 per cent of those surveyed believed that pilots should not be a special case; in other words, over three-quarters believed that pilots should not be allowed special dispensation to step out of the wages system. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at the chronology of events is interesting in this case. On 10 August the rolling stoppages started and the Industrial Relations Commission hearing was set for 11 August after the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP) refused to answer how the 29.47 per cent wage claim was consistent with the wage guidelines. On 11 August the pilots' federation never attended the Commission but instead organised a 12-hour stoppage in Melbourne. From 12 to 14 August it was the turn of Brisbane, Perth, Cairns and Sydney. On 11 August the AFAP stated quite clearly that pilots saw no point in pursuing wage increases within the wage fixing guidelines. Since that time the pilots' federation has stated that if pilots get the rise and somebody says that it is consistent with the guidelines, it will not worry the pilots. We are dealing with an organisation that is pursuing its goals by all the ruthless means at its disposal. It has shown nothing but contempt for wage fixing principles. It works few hours and has some of the best paid workers in the country. When the Opposition says that the Government is mishandling the dispute, it really means that it supports the pilots. The Opposition seems to wish them well. </PARA>
<PARA> On the Australian Broadcasting Corporation program 7.30 Report of 14 September we find some born-again trade unionists. I say `born-again' trade unionists because they spent most of their parliamentary careers scorning the achievements of the trade union movement. All of a sudden they now believe in trade unions, and they say that the Government is aggravating the situation. On that program Senator John Stone, a chief born-again trade unionist, had a few things to say. I quote from that program:</PARA>
<PARA> Paul Lyneham: And to save the centralised system you force the pilots to sign private contracts outside the system?</PARA>
<PARA> John Stone: Well, I mean, exactly. I mean, the funny thing is that the Prime Minister, that really seems to be the sticking point for the Prime Minister, and indeed Sir Peter Abeles too. I mean, they seem to be prepared to say yes, we will talk to the pilots individually or maybe in groups, small groups, but we're not prepared to have them represented by their trade union. Well, I mean, this is the ex-president of the ACTU talking. </PARA>
<PARA> Paul Lyneham: Isn't there some irony, though, in John Stone's suggesting there should be talks with the trade union?</PARA>
<PARA> John Stone: No, on the contrary. I've always believed, and every member of the Opposition has always believed in the right of any worker in this country to freedom of association, to form a trade union if they want. And indeed, as you know, our industrial relations policy-which I should say Fred Chaney would explain in much more detail than I-provides specifically for enterprise unions, for unions to be formed of workers within a particular enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA>So all the coalition members are now big supporters of the trade union movement. Some honourable senators opposite must be squirming about these revelations. Senator Stone must be a worry to some of his National Party Senate colleagues. Senator McGauran must be getting out of here at the right time. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday Senator Chaney, when debating the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders, stated that so far the dispute has cost half a billion dollars and it could cost $3 billion in a full year. He went on in that same speech to argue that many smaller players would be hurt so badly that they would vanish from the scene altogether. I note that in that speech nothing was said about organisations, such as the AFAP, that ruthlessly hold Australia to ransom, nor did we hear anything about what would happen if the Government caved in to the demands of Senator Chaney's mates. Mr Peacock, who is the current Leader of the Opposition, stated on 31 August:</PARA>
<PARA>We are not in government today, and the duty is on this Government to fix the dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>So much for constructive opposition! Mr Howard, once more prominent in the coalition, let the cat out of the bag on 3AW's Upfront program on 19 September by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I hope that this dispute is settled and I hope it is settled in a way that permanently weakens the centralised wage fixing system. </PARA>
<PARA>The real target in the Opposition's sights is the system of centralised wage fixation. It would prefer the law of the jungle-the law that operated in the last of the Fraser-Howard years that saw disastrous wage and employment outcomes. The born-again trade unionists are saying little about the tactics of the AFAP or what would happen should it be successful and destroy the wages policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I think it is essential that the Government stand its ground and ensure that wage fixation is not a contest of industrial muscle or the law of the jungle. In a rare moment Mr Peacock got it right on the AM program of 25 August. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>It's a classic case where you've got to go beyond the employer/employee fight and look after the national interest. And the Government is correct. </PARA>

<PARA> Right from the start the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has been determined to inflame the dispute. The former great conciliator of the ACTU, whose solution to this kind of dispute was invariably surrender by employers and opposition to any stern measures of previous governments, did not call the pilots bus drivers by accident. He thought there were votes in attacking tall poppies whose real crime is not the 30 per cent wage demand that we in the Opposition never supported when divorced from productivity but the fact that they want to go outside his accord. Once the Prime Minister realised that his abuse was counterproductive his form letter to individual pilots appealing for a return to work tended to lack credibility, not least because Mrs Deborah Wardley, a well known and respected pioneer female pilot, was addressed as Mr. Some personal appeal!</PARA>
<PARA> We had the so-called world's greatest Treasurer trying to tell us on 21 September that black was white and that the tourist industry was not being damaged by this Government's prolonged dispute and being publicly contradicted by his colleague, the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding). Rhetoric, however irresponsible and destructive, is only one part of the mishandling of this dispute. On 20 August the Prime Minister gave his support to the tactic of the airlines in taking legal action against pilots. They would not have resigned without this prime ministerial threat. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting to listen to Senator Collins a little while ago. He comes from the Northern Territory, an isolated part of this country. He spent his entire 20 minutes pilot bashing. He did not even mention all of the things that are happening in the Northern Territory-as I said, a very isolated part of this country. It is a shame he did not contact his Northern Territory colleague from the National Party, Senator Grant Tambling. Senator Tambling has pages and pages of information about people who are really hurting in the Northern Territory. People repeatedly tell him that their businesses are 50 per cent. People with a staff of nine are considering laying off four or five staff and believe that the effects of the pilots dispute will be felt for six to 12 months if they still have a business. The list goes on. A business selling opals in Alice Springs had sales for the month of September which equalled $1. Last year at this time the owner was banking $7,000 a week. She has already laid off two people. Another person with a live fish aquarium lost 100 per cent of his business as there were no live shipments for six weeks. It has closed down temporarily. It requires direct flights and rates have doubled. There are outstanding orders in all States except Tasmania that cannot be filled. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tambling has compiled a very sad list. Of course the list goes on in Western Australia, my own State. The owner of a seafood company sends seafood to the eastern States and requires other products in return. He anticipates that he will lose approximately $50,000 in turnover. He is also considering retrenching staff. Computer software companies and fresh fish suppliers are losing $60,000 per week and have laid off nine people. This is happening across the whole of the industry. Fishermen and their boats are remaining idle and are not earning any income. The cooperative of private limousine drivers is losing between $6,000 and $7,000 a week. It has put off several casual staff. The small shopkeeper reports that sales are down from around $8,000 a week to less than $1,000 a week. The wildlife park relies heavily on tourists and family groups and is losing up to $12,000 a week. Once again, this is just a small sample of people who are getting hurt. There are 26 examples in this small sample. But Senator Collins abuses the pilots and does not for one moment consider the way in which the Prime Minister has inflamed the situation. Would he accuse the other unions, who will not even consider talking to their employers in case of a dispute? No, he would not. We do not agree with that 30 per cent increase without consideration, in tandem, of productivity increases. </PARA>
<PARA> On 5 September the Prime Minister admitted in Parliament that his Government had encouraged the airlines to negotiate with individual pilots and to ignore the Australian Federation of Air Pilots that, like so many other unions, is the organisation that the great majority of individual pilots wish to have representing them. This is the person who says that people should belong to unions. This is the person who is constantly contradicting himself, constantly inflaming the situation. This system of representation is the one that the Prime Minister has condoned, developed and fostered as recently as yesterday at the ACTU Congress. But where it applies to the pilots is a different kettle of fish altogether. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we have the action of the Hawke Labor Government providing financial subsidies to airlines through the waiving of fees, an action designed to encourage the airlines to tough out the dispute to the immense damage of the tourist industry and the national economy. It even had the cheek to pretend that the waiving of charges, a $14m loss to revenue per week, did not constitute spending public money. Well, whose money is it? No government has any money other than that which the taxpayer provides. The Prime Minister is saying that it is not public money. Whose money is he bailing the airlines out with?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. It is certainly not his own and I think this is what the people need to realise. They are paying more each year in personal taxation for this Government to prolong this dispute. Australians should realise that this Labor Government had the practical means at its disposal to have brought the parties together weeks ago if it wanted. But one major airline is owned by the taxpayer and the undoubted personal friendship and rapport between the Prime Minister and Sir Peter Abeles of Ansett Airlines of Australia could have been used with constructive effect rather than the reverse which exacerbated the problem. The Prime Minister wilfully allows Australia to be damaged because the ACTU accord cannot be allowed to fail. There might be a case for the armoury of award cancellations, resort to civil law remedies, use of both the armed forces and foreign strike-breaking workers and the denial of representation from a particular union if the accord truly did operate in the national interest, but does it?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Why should Australians be asked to grovel before a corporate sweetheart deal whose bottom line result is a 0.2 per cent fall in productivity each year when the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development nations are posting an average of 1.2 per cent annual productivity improvement? The accord is actually denying Australians the real benefits of improved productivity that would arise if employers and employees as individuals or represented by chosen unions were free to negotiate their own productivity-based agreements. That is all we are calling for in this dispute. Under a coalition government we would see the Australian Federation of Air Pilots sitting down with the airlines and talking productivity. If they had chosen to remain in the central system they would be subject to swift and accepted legal procedures. Will the Government do that? No, it just wants a exacerbate this problem until Australia bleeds to death. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings me to the other great weakness of this Government's desperate attempt to enforce the accord, the fact that it has no real legal basis. When did this Parliament ever vote to enforce it upon the Australian work force? The Government does not have the courage to bring that forward. It has no legal shape because the ACTU does not want the rule of law and the Prime Minister bows down before it. It is kept in being by extra-parliamentary pressure tactics. We all have reaped the reward of an institutionalised 7 per cent inflation rate. There is serious discontent among important sections of the work force who feel that they have been made more equal than others. In order to preserve a system that is the worst of both worlds, with the rigidities of centralism without just legal regulation, with the refusal to provide for constructive agreements outside it, the Hawke Labor Government is fighting to the death-the death of the tourist industry in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the problems of isolation associated with a State like Western Australia. Monday's Australian, under the heading `Today's interstate air services', states:</PARA>
<PARA>Today's domestic flight schedules, released by the airlines, are printed below. Ansett's proposed services were not available. </PARA>
<PARA>There is not one mention of a flight to Perth, the capital of Western Australia, on the whole list. It could be suggested that Ansett had flights. But I am told repeatedly that Ansett and Australian Airlines share on a fifty-fifty basis each flight that goes in and out of Perth. According to the list, Australian Airlines did not have one flight going to Perth. In the north-west, businesses are closing down at a rate of knots; they are losing business. The airlines certainly are not very forthcoming with the extent of their services to Perth, or any other area for that matter. Statewide, one-year's tourism growth has been wiped off in six weeks. Of course, the damage is far greater in Broome where the well-respected Cable Beach Club resort has lost $400,000 in this same time. </PARA>
<PARA> In the short time that I have left, one other issue I wish to cover is the question of safety. My colleague Senator MacGibbon, in his address to the Senate a short time ago, mentioned many areas of safety. If he is wrong, I challenge a member of the Government to come in here and unequivocally-unlike Senator Evans yesterday-state that there have not been any compromises in the world's safest airline record in history. This Government is compromising that safety record. Aircraft are being allowed to fly over 30,000 feet altitude with no drop-down oxygen masks but with a few oxygen bottles in the plane. If such an aircraft lost pressurisation, people would be dead in a matter of seconds. The Government is allowing that to happen. If I am wrong I wish someone from the Government would say so and give me the reasons why I am wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally, if the Government has not compromised the accreditation of pilots in air space, it can tell me that I am wrong. I am reliably informed that airline pilots from overseas have to undergo far less stringent tests than Australian airline pilots. They do not have to have familiarity with where they are flying. There are enough problems with the congested airspace without additional problems. If an overseas pilot fails his test, he is allowed to re-sit that test in 48 hours; but Australian pilots have to wait 14 days. Where is the justice in that? I do not wish to be alarming at all. I am concerned about this aspect. If I am wrong, please let the Government tell me so. We should not be compromising Australia's fine safety record that the pilots have delivered to this country over the eternity of flying in Australia. What the Government is doing is absolutely and utterly hypocritical in the extreme. The Prime Minister should be told to make these two parties get together to resolve this dispute at the earliest possible time. He should not be seen to extend and exacerbate it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon the Senate is discussing a matter of public importance-indeed, it is a matter of public importance-proposed by one of the Opposition's front bench spokespersons, Senator MacGibbon, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The personal suffering and financial hardship inflicted on tens of thousands of Australians, particularly those living in more remote parts of the country, by the government's gross mismanagement of the airline pilots' dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a matter of supreme importance. It is a matter of importance to each and every citizen and resident of Australia. Despite what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) says, this dispute with the commercial airline pilots of the major airlines in Australia is a matter of national interest and national importance. However, despite the rhetoric we have heard this afternoon from three Opposition spokespersons, there is a denial by the Leader of the Opposition that this dispute is of national significance. I quote from an interview on the Good Morning Australia program of 20 September, just a few days ago, with Mr Peacock, the present Leader of the Opposition, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>When in fact the national interest is threatened then there is a role for the Government and here, of course, I don't think any of you would argue that there's, the national interest is not being impaired. </PARA>
<PARA>We have heard many statements not only from the Opposition but also from the Government as to how the national interest is being impaired. We have seen numerous media comments about this dispute. In fact, it has led the front pages of most of Australia's media for the last six weeks. We have also seen in those newspaper comments evidence of some confusion within the Opposition ranks. The previous speaker, Senator Knowles, was taking to task in the chamber her leader here, the Opposition's spokesman for industrial relations, Senator Chaney, asking him to set out clearly the Opposition's position on the airlines dispute. Again the Opposition's spokespersons this afternoon have continued to identify the confusion that reigns within the ranks of the Opposition on this most important public issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of public importance proposed by Senator MacGibbon refers to the Government's mismanagement of the airlines dispute. Yet Senator Walters, the second speaker for the Opposition, put the blame not on the Government but on Sir Peter Abeles, Mr Murdoch and Mr Strong. She clearly named those three people as being responsible for it. Senator MacGibbon said-I think I am right with these words but he can correct me if I am wrong-that this dispute was planned with military precision. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry. It was obviously Senator Walters. I withdraw the implication against Senator MacGibbon. Senator Walters said it was planned with military precision-not by Mr Murdoch, not by Sir Peter Abeles, not by Mr Strong, not by Mr Hawke or any Government Ministers, but by the airline pilots. We have also seen in the media of Australia numerous advertising, such as came from the Leader of the Opposition on 21 September in the Australian: `Mr Hawke, for Australia's sake, sit down and talk'. How far removed can the Opposition be from reality to pay out money to put in an advertisement like that? The Opposition does not know the group we are dealing with. The group we are dealing with is the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP) led by Mr McCarthy. Mr McCarthy will put a new slant on the word `McCarthyism' which many of us, and all free democratic thinking persons, fear and dread. Indeed, there will be a new slant on that term in future years, particularly from an Australian point of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suggest that the confusion that exists in the minds of the Opposition actually comes from what is happening within the Opposition parties at the moment. There is clear evidence of just what has been happening. The New Right in Australia has been slowly but surely taking over the Opposition parties. It did not need to do a great deal within the National Party of Australia because that Party was already a captive of it. Senator Stone will ensure that its captivity remains and continues. It had some problems with some of the wets in the Liberal Party, but many of them have been rolled or, like Senator Puplick, put in unwinnable positions on the various party tickets. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot of advice has been given to the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. Although I do not know for certain, I suspect that the voice of one Peter Costello is very close to the ear of Mr McCarthy when it comes to giving advice. Certainly, there are a number of parallels between this dispute and others that have been mentioned and used in arguments in this place. For example, I mention the dispute at Dollar Sweets, which Mr Costello had a great deal to do with, and the dispute at Mudginberri. </PARA>

<PARA> I am aware of the Opposition's policy and attitude towards the Industrial Relations Commission, and I will deal with that in a short time, but whatever the attitude to Mr McCarthy is, the Industrial Relations Commission is a part of our system and has got a role and authority.

It does not always need six-figure fines to show when there are teeth in the determinations of the Industrial Relations Commission. I suggest that, until yesterday, there was a degree of respect from most sources within the community towards the role of the Industrial Relations Commission. I say `until yesterday', because yesterday, 26 September, the Australian Federation of Air Pilots actually showed what it was about. One press statement castigated Mr Crean, the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Mr McCarthy has clearly said that the Federation of Air Pilots is on its own, that there would be no national wage guidelines or prices and incomes accord for the Federation. The 1,600-odd pilots will make determinations for themselves, irrespective of the cost to the community, the cost to business, the cost to tourism or the cost to Australia. It will do it for itself-an exercise in greed and avarice that, I suggest, has never been witnessed from any trade union in Australia. I do not believe that this particular organisation deserves to be credited with the name `trade union'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second action undertaken yesterday was the letter which Mr McCarthy wrote to Mr Justice Maddern, the President of the Industrial Relations Commission. As Senator Collins said, it was perhaps the most advanced exercise in arrogance that we have ever witnessed in the industrial relations scene in this country and, indeed, we have witnessed many on both sides of the dispute. I said previously that unions are not necessarily faultless in this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not get Senator Bolkus's interjection, but I hope it is productive. I think it is worth reading the last paragraph of Mr McCarthy's letter into the record:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Your statement records that the airline companies ``have employed pilots on individual contracts''. The question of whether any and if so what type of pilots have signed individual contracts has been a contentious issue during the dispute. In order that the Federation can make an informed response to your statement, will you kindly inform the Federation of your understanding as to the number and classification of pilots who have signed individual contracts with each airline, and further indicate the source of the information on which your statement was based. </PARA>
<PARA>If that is not thumbing one's nose at the Industrial Relations Commission, I do not know what is. There were a few interjections earlier asking me to suggest how the dispute can be resolved. I suggest that the time for negotiations has now concluded. The Australian Federation of Air Pilots has clearly put on record that it does not want advice from anybody other than its New Right companions and advisers. I suggest that Sir Peter Abeles, Mr Murdoch and, indeed, the successor to Mr Strong in Australian Airlines-and I do not forget the other airlines involved in the dispute too-ought to make a decision now that there will be no further contact with Mr McCarthy or the executive of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. That body, by its letter and its statements, has proved that it does not want to talk; it does not want to resolve this dispute. It wants to drag Australia down; it wants to destroy the tourism industry. The airline executives ought to realise and accept that. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter I want to address in my contribution this afternoon is the question of individual contracts. I know it is a concept that is accepted within the Liberal Party's industrial relations policy. It is not a concept that I have advocated in the past. I suggest it is one concept that will go some way towards resolving this dispute. But it cannot be left just at the question of individual contracts, because that can end up in a dog eat dog situation and may in the long term create much larger problems than those which we have at the moment, although it will be hard to overcome what McCarthy and his cohorts have done to the airlines of Australia and the economy of Australia. There are some pilots who are signing contracts, although I do not know their names. Even if I did, I certainly would not be exposing them or putting their names on the public record so that they could have their arms and legs broken by the thugs of the AFAP. It is imperative that those pilots who are signing contracts become members of a union; not the AFAP. It may be that the Transport Workers Union of Australia has applied for coverage of their awards. In my own State of Western Australia, it may be that the Australian Tramway and Motor Omnibus Employees Association, under the leadership of my good friend Bernard Terry, which is the union that covers the bus drivers in that State, could afford some protection. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one comment about my own State of Western Australia. I heard Senator Knowles's comments and I understand her care for the State from which we both come. I also listened intently to what Senator Jenkins of the Australian Democrats had to say. I remind Senator Jenkins that Western Australia covers one-third of Australia and that there are more towns and places in Western Australia served by airlines than just Broome. Unfortunately, her remarks this afternoon will be used in argument on the location of a new airport for that town. There is some degree of contention concerning that at the moment. I conclude my remarks here this afternoon by again condemning McCarthy and McCarthyism as it is impacting and affecting the economy of Australia. I point out to Senator Panizza, who is attempting to interject, that farmers are actually being affected as well. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish briefly to comment on the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC) annual report 1989. Madam Acting Deputy President, you are probably aware that OTC was formed in 1946 with the responsibility of covering Australia's overseas telecommunications. It has been in action ever since and has certainly achieved good results. In the five minutes allocated to me I will briefly point out its successes in the last few years. OTC's biggest innovation in the last three years is probably the installation of the Auto-Seaphone. All boats within an 80-kilometre radius of the coastline can telephone through, I presume, a UHF system. The first Auto-Seaphone was launched in Sydney in 1988. I believe that the network around Australia was to be finished by about 1992 but that it has been such a success that OTC will complete it by the end of this year, giving much needed coverage. There is a 999 facility on the seaphone so that any disaster can be immediately reported and the boat concerned, wherever it is, can be picked up. </PARA>
<PARA> The other development is the extension of the use of the Radphone, which utilises a two-way system. It is not quite like a telephone; it is similar to a two-way radio. It can be used to contact boats and areas offshore up to 6,000 kilometres away from the mainland. Its use has greatly expanded. In fact, it has increased by well over 120 per cent in the last year or so. </PARA>
<PARA> I will mention briefly something that worries me. OTC is planning to phase out its facilities at Broome in Western Australia. Broome was mentioned here this afternoon when someone was speaking about tourism. Broome has OTC facilities which look after coastal shipping, probably between Port Hedland and Darwin. There are moves to phase the facilities out. Having inspected the facilities there a couple of months ago, I would like OTC to consider whether it should phase them out, because I think they are facilities it could keep. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a lack of facilities for two-way radio inland from that area. I know that that is not OTC's problem, but OTC is a participant in joint ventures with other communications outfits around Australia and around the world and it would not be beyond the realms of possibility for a good UHF system to be married with the OTC in Broome to provide communications not only offshore but also inland. There is a problem with high frequency two-way communication radios inland because of interference from Indonesia. This would be a way of giving the existing facilities a double use and providing that area with a much needed UHF transmission so as to avoid Indonesian interference. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I note from the Australian Industry Development Corporation annual report 1989 that the Corporation made a profit of $28.5m for the year ending 30 June 1989. In the previous year the profit after tax was $25.8m. In going through the report it is interesting to see the sorts of enterprises that the Australian Industry Development Corporation has supported. I refer particularly to the manufacturing section of the economy. I note that it has helped a wine producer in the Hunter Valley. It has helped a company to manufacture telecommunications equipment. It has helped the development work on the submarines at Port Adelaide. It has helped a company that specialises in shipboard communications. It has helped Interscan International Ltd, which has established and developed an Australian-made microwave landing system. It is an indication of the considerable progress that has been made under the present Government in the manufacturing section of the economy, the section which needs to be developed if Australia is to get out of its present financial problems. It is true that there have been some very large imbalances in the balance of payments between this nation and the rest of the world but it is interesting to look at where the money representing the balance against us, the investment, is going. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few minutes available to me I will read out some interesting figures. Private business investment is currently running at record levels as a proportion of the gross domestic product. In 1988-89 it accounted for 13.5 per cent of the gross domestic product and it is likely to be higher-up to 13.9 per cent-this year. This compares to an average level of 10.7 per cent in the 1960s and 9.9 per cent in the 1970s. So it has increased by a very significant amount-over 3 per cent-during the term of the present Government. A document states:</PARA>
<PARA>Another way of looking at this is in terms of the growth of investment. Over the past five years real growth in business fixed investment has averaged 10.8 per cent a year. </PARA>
<PARA>To put it in context, this compares with an average growth rate of 2 per cent a year-that is, 8.8 per cent less a year-in the 10 years up to 1983-84. I am making the point that Australia's overseas borrowings are fortunately going into the areas which will make this country economically sound in the future. That point was made in the Sunday Age, a new paper in Melbourne, which has had only half a dozen or so editions. In an article on page 1 of the money section of the 24 September 1989 edition, in relation to the balance of payments Denise Ryan states:</PARA>
<PARA> The big spenders were businesses investing in capital items such as computers and planes, but the average Australians were also doing their bit to tip the scales, with imported food, fuel and fabrics on the rise. </PARA>

Unless there is a loosening of the link between teaching and research in universities, any new academic staff (and hence research staff) will be concentrated in areas of growing student demand.</PARA>
<PARA>First, I take strong exception to the notion that we will allow or not allow academics to do research. This item is developed in more detail on page 37. In a saving exercise, the report seeks to make a distinction between teaching, scholarship and research and, quite correctly, says that a scholarship is often tied in with research because `the conduct of research requires a knowledge and critical examination of developments in a given area of research'. </PARA>
<PARA> While that is true, some extraordinary statements are relied upon in getting to this conclusion. For example, the report points out quite clearly the very large growth in full-time student equivalents between 1975 and 1985 when the student load increased by 14.4 per cent in universities and 38.7 per cent in colleges of advanced education. In that time, however, the increase in academic staff has been only about 4 per cent. Hence, the quite unexceptionable comment is made that an academic's time will probably be spent more on teaching. If increases are loaded at such an enormous rate and the staff numbers are increased at a lower rate, obviously more time will be spent on teaching. But then this statement is made:</PARA>
<PARA>The likely outcome will only be changed if universities learn to teach more efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA>First, no explanation is given about how we can teach more efficiently. Presumably, we can stuff more bodies into lecture theatres or have more in tutorials. I find it a most extraordinary statement to appear in a learned report coming from some of the eminent people who signed it. </PARA>
<PARA> The tradition of teaching and research, contrary to the suggestion on page 37 that it has a short history, has a very long history. The notion of research at a university level is intimately linked to teaching. A person is expected to push back the frontiers of his speciality. University teaching staff are expected to write papers for publication in learned journals. Indeed, the report says quite clearly that advancement is dependent on writing papers. Someone who writes papers is presumably engaging in something other than simply looking at what everybody else has said. He is contributing to the ongoing exercise, to the ongoing understanding, in that area. He is engaged in research. </PARA>
<PARA> The rather sloppy exercise of saying that there can be a neat division between teaching and research will bedevil the education debate for some time to come, particularly as the Dawkins approach to the exercise is that we will fund many people to do teaching and many other people to do research. It will not work; it cannot work by the very nature of university teaching. This attempt to get the argument up and running is to be regretted. There needs to be far more careful examination of what people actually do in universities. Glib statements of the kind that are set out on page 37, from which other conclusions are then drawn, should not be made. They are faulty because the premises upon which they are based are not in accordance with the reality of university teaching and research. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I echo the remarks of Senator Macklin. We received this quite massive report entitled Profile of Australian Science only this morning. Although I found the report very unsatisfactory, it is pleasant to see that it has moved somewhat more towards challenging the view of the Government that the research effort in Australia should simply be directed to those ends to which the Government wants it directed. Indeed, it draws particular attention to the value of serendipity in scientific research and quotes the paper by Comroe and Dripps, which is worth mentioning. The report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Their study of ten major medical advances, using 663 key papers, found that 42 per cent of the research was done by scientists whose goal at that time was unrelated to the later advance. `Such unrelated advance was often unexpected, unpredictable, and usually greatly accelerated advance in many fields'. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the last three words. It is nice to see that there is at last some recognition that the intellectual cream of this country, appropriately trained, can be free to carry out research, to hold up a mirror to what government and the rest of society would have us do, and lead us off into new and exciting directions. </PARA>
<PARA> Contrasted with that, as Senator Macklin has said, we find in other parts of the report the continued attempt to redirect research back towards those things which governments and others believe we should address. Surprisingly, we find in the introduction of the report the expression `sustained economic growth'. As I have said frequently in this place, if scientists were to apply the same critical facility they display in their fields to what economists talk about, they would realise that the expression `economic growth' is an oxymoron and has no meaning whatsoever. It is a pity that more scientists do not do that. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also usefully draws attention to the need to provide more support for PhD students. Having said that, it surprisingly does not draw attention to the fact that women PhD students, and postdoctoral students in particular, have great difficulty in continuing with their work precisely at the time when they may want to start families. It would be nice to see some especial help given to female PhD students and postdoctoral students to enable them to fulfil their biological function and have families, and at the same time continue in their chosen speciality and succeed in advancing up the academic ladder. I believe that the Government should do a great deal more in that area. The report calls again for more support from industry for applied research but again it seems to ignore the fact that much of the large industry in Australia is multinational based and the research work in those industries is carried on overseas so that simply calling for those industries to provide more funds is somewhat whistling in the wind. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent days we have seen the Government attempt to provide some support to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd, an industry which I would suspect, although I do not know, carries out practically all of its research and development overseas and then simply applies that here. One would not expect therefore that those sorts of companies would provide funding for research in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Picking up one further point, the report refers to the desirability of directing research in certain ways, as I have already indicated, and gives an interesting example. I do not know whether it is in any sense a freudian slip but it says:</PARA>
<PARA>For example, if it is concluded that there is an excess basic research effort in the biological sciences, it will take years to redistribute the excess resources to other fields of science since most of the `resources' are paid to individuals . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That raises a very interesting question about the democratic processes in this country. If the community as a whole determines that it wants to go into the biological areas, study those and make contributions in those, I simply pose the question: What right has a government to attempt to redirect the efforts of the community into physics or those areas that the Government believes are more beneficial?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been some criticism, gentle as it may be, of the Government's approach to the issue of science. Senator Macklin and Senator Coulter have said that not enough has been done for basic research. They have perhaps condemned this Australian Science and Technology Council report to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), Profile of Australian Science, as not adequately dealing with that. The introduction to the report and the letter from the Chairman of the Council to the Prime Minister give considerable emphasis to basic research. The third paragraph of the letter says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>On the basis of information now presented in this report, we have already recommended action by your Government to improve support for PhD students, to provide better career opportunities for research workers in universities and government research organisations and to increase funding for new buildings and equipment. </PARA>
<PARA>In the last paragraph the letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The strength of basic research in Australia has been an important factor in determining our place among the developed nations of the world. It has contributed to our national prosperity and well-being and has greatly improved our understanding of the many unique features of the land in which we live. </PARA>
<PARA>The report, like any report, no doubt can be criticised. It is easy enough to go through a report and say, `Look, this is left out. This has not been adequately dealt with. This has been dealt with in a way that I do not particularly like'-all criticisms that are continually made but which are pessimistic and negative approaches. We should look at the great contribution the report makes to the discussion of science in Australia, a discussion that is essential if we are to go the way we should. On page 152, which I have turned up at random, under the heading `Research priorities', the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Currently, chemists are moving into new materials, medical chemistry, inorganic materials, biological chemistry (where Australia is one of the world leaders)-</PARA>
<PARA>I have picked this page up fortuitously and there it says that Australia is one of the world's leaders-</PARA>
<PARA>and environmental and water chemistry. Chemists respond reasonably well to exciting new areas, which is an indication of the health and vigor of the discipline. This is also an argument in favour of maintaining a breadth of interest in chemical research. </PARA>
<PARA>That is just an example of why this report is well worth reading. It should be read and should inspire us all to consider further how research and development in Australia can be processed. Indeed, the Government has taken that up already. If we look at the Science and Technology Budget Statement 1989-90, Budget Related Paper No. 10, which no doubt all honourable senators and members of the House of Representatives and indeed--</PARA>

<PARA>That is right. Science has a central place in that. But the Budget Paper goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Science and technology for Australia also had philosophical implications in its recognition of the complexity of interactions between fundamental and applied research. </PARA>
<PARA>It says on page 5 that one concern the Government has in this area is that people outside government in other sectors are perhaps not spending as much or devoting as much time and attention as they should. The Government does not go into a spasm of depression about that. As in all areas, whether it be industrial relations or otherwise, it tries to encourage reasonableness and encourage Australia to go ahead as it should-in this case with scientific research for the extension of knowledge that will make it a basic level and also as an application to industry. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This has been a matter of considerable public interest in Western Australia and, I think, more widely. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) describes how on 21 June he made a permanent declaration under section 10 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 in respect of a significant Aboriginal site located on Reserve 39880 in the State of Western Australia. This particular site became the subject of an application for protection because of its significance to Aborigines and the threat of injury which the development of the old Swan brewery posed to that area, which is associated with the Waugul or rainbow serpent. </PARA>
<PARA> The site in contention was not actually the brewery site, which is reclaimed land, but land very close to it-just across the road, in fact. It is at the base of Mount Eliza and close to a permanent spring. This is understood to have been a camping area recognised certainly early in the colonisation of Western Australia and probably for much longer. It would be surprising if it were not a site of some significance because of its geographical location and the fact that it is very close to the Narrows, the easiest method of crossing the estuary from Mount Eliza to the South Perth side of the river. The Minister describes how he was required to be satisfied that the area was of significance to Aborigines, and commissioned a report from Dr Clive Senior of Northmore Hale Davy and Leake. He also consulted with the relevant State Minister and took into consideration advice provided by the Attorney-General's Department in respect of the interpretation of `particular significance' within the meaning of the Aboriginal tradition. The Minister describes how, having been satisfied that the site was of particular significance to Aboriginal people, and that the development of the old Swan brewery posed a threat of injury, he decided to make a declaration, which occurred on 21 June.</PARA>
<PARA> Developments since then have included consultations between the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Premier of Western Australia. Happily, an agreement has been reached regarding the area that is the subject of the application. On the basis of this agreement and further assurances given by the Western Australian Premier the Minister, Mr Gerry Hand, has been able to revoke the declaration of 21 June. The agreement with the State Government means that the Government will be bound by the State Aboriginal Heritage Act. There was some confusion about whether that was actually binding on the State. Before any further excavations are made at the site, including the proposed sewerage and electricity works, the State Government will act as though its legislation requires it to comply and will introduce legislation to bind the Crown by the Aboriginal Heritage Act. It seems to me that this is a satisfactory conclusion to what has been a very vexed question in Western Australia, clouded by the fact that there is not a lot of consensus in Western Australia about whether the brewery should be retained or developed. It is extremely rewarding to discover that agreement has been reached between our Federal and State governments on this matter, and it should be to the satisfaction of the Aborigines who have been so concerned about the fate of their significant site. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report is the result of the efforts of a number of people, most notably former Senator George Georges who for many years was a senator in this place and the guiding light of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare. It was a great loss to many organisations and activities in Australia when he left the Senate, but I think we on the Animal Welfare Committee felt the loss most because he always felt that the welfare of the animal came first. He felt that there were plenty of other institutions looking after industry and the rural sector, but we alone were charged with looking after the interests of the animal. This report is very much the result of his efforts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Animal Welfare Committee, under Senator Georges, has been a catalyst for the improvement of the welfare of animals in this country. The report is an important document. Even during the stages when evidence was being gathered I think the Animal Welfare Committee contributed to the issue by offering a forum for debate for all sides. This was important. We were able to give people who perhaps ordinarily would not have the means of speaking out a platform on which to express their views, some of which were considered to be radical and some of which were not. </PARA>
<PARA> We had to address the problem of animals' rights. What are the rights of animals? Do they have the same rights as, or even more rights than, people? We took a great deal of evidence on this subject. I lean towards the view that animals do have a great number of rights in many areas, probably as many as human beings do. However, in my own mind I had to come down on the side of allowing animal experimentation to continue, so I have not made a dissenting report in this animal experimentation compendium. I basically agree with the recommendations set out in this report. I wish that all those who experiment on animals would take an enlightened view towards those experiments and limit the use of animals as much as possible. I am happy to say that just about all of the witnesses who appeared before us who were involved in animal experimentation in any way claimed to recognise the rights of animals, and many of them told how they had been reducing the number of animals used in their experiments. Frankly, I hope never to have to go into another animal house. We went through animal houses in all the States, and I still have that--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator MacGibbon says he knows what I mean. There is a combined smell of fear and urine which sticks in the nose when one goes into those places. The Animal Welfare Committee, with great fortitude, went into a number of these houses. Some were better than others. Most of them, if not all, were managed by sincere people, but many of those people were not well-enough trained. This is one of our concerns. One of the recommendations in the report is that training programs be instituted for those people who take care of animals in animal houses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the major stumbling blocks we found in our deliberations is one which faces all Australians in almost all matters, and that is the issue of States' rights. Our recommendations 13.46 and 15.57 deal with that issue. We recommended that all States and Territories upgrade animal welfare legislation and establish animal welfare advisory councils and departmental animal welfare units, as has been done in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. At 15.57 the Committee recommends that the system of controlling animal experimentation in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia be extended to the other States and Territories. This system is based on upgraded legislation. It would be a wonderful thing if, in this country, we could legislate federally to bring the States into line on issues such as animal welfare. We found that New South Wales especially, and Victoria and South Australia, were enlightened in their legislative programs. Other States and Territories have not seemed to follow suit. There is a national concern for animal welfare. Ethics committees have been set up in each university in each of the States, but there is as yet no overall Federal control. I think it is time we faced the fact that we are a nation and should implement this type of control. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the examination of this issue of animal experimentation we found that the animals themselves were generally pretty well looked after. The exceptions to this were rare. We did encounter one situation in Adelaide where some animals were checked out by a medical experimenter without the knowledge of the people who ran the animal house. In fact, our Committee stumbled across this when the experimenter brought the animals back. They were rabbits which had been under anaesthetic and were still anaesthetised. The experimenter just dropped them on the table and left. We brought this up with the university officials concerned and, to their credit, they took steps to ensure that it never happened again. </PARA>
<PARA> In general, animal experimentation in this country has come a long way, certainly in the last five or 10 years. At the moment, the welfare of animals undergoing experimentation in Australia matches or exceeds that of any other country. So I think we can be proud of the progress made in Australia in animal welfare. There is probably still more to be done. Certainly the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare is still looking at new references. But this report will stand as an excellent reference work on the state of animal welfare at this time. We still have some ways to go but in general I think we can take some comfort in the fact that our animals are now being treated with the dignity that they deserve. </PARA>

It seems incumbent upon me to get to my feet and support what Senator Sanders had to say about former Senator George Georges. Former Senator George Georges was the soul of this Committee. He is largely responsible for the ethos or the character of the Committee. I think the ethos or character of the Committee is a very good one. I agree with Senator Sanders when he says that the Committee has done great things. It has brought the attention of a broad section of the community-farmers, experimenters and people who have the care of animals in other ways-to what is proper. I see on page 235 of the report a reference to ethics committees, which goes on for some pages. Ethics is simply a mixture of morality and experience.</PARA></TALK.START>

Doug Scott was replaced by Senator Brownhill. I think Senator Sanders would agree that he also has contributed well to the Committee. And there is Senator Calvert. I see that Senator Brownhill is present in the chamber. I congratulate him on the great effort he has put in. Of course, our present Chairman, Senator Devlin, deserves praise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take a few minutes to touch on one aspect of this report by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters entitled Who pays the piper calls the tune, which is a manifesto for a one-party state if ever I saw one. It is the absolute negation of the democratic rights of the people of Australia that the Australian Labor Party (ALP) proposition should be bound between two glossy covers and presented in the name of this Parliament. It will deny the fundamental political rights that Australians enjoy to support the party of their choice in the way they wish to do so. I am not joking when I say that this report is the manifesto of a one-party, dictatorial state. It has no relevance at all to democratic rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not wish to discuss the report in detail-it would take far too much time to do so-but basically it is the logical extension of the nonsense of the Labor Party in ripping off the public purse and transferring all the cost of running an election campaign to the poor, unsuspecting taxpayer. In the same way it denies the rights of people to have their choice of candidate, given the resources they need to fight an election. I support very strongly the minority report to the main report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>This Report comes nowhere near justifying its major recommendations that:</PARA>
<PARA>there be no paid political advertising on radio or television from date of issue of the writs to polling day;</PARA>
<PARA> that, in addition to the subsidies they receive in the form of public funding, political parties be given free time at the cost of the television and radio stations;</PARA>
<PARA> that the authority of the Australian Electoral Commission be extended to give it greater discretionary powers over political parties and other voluntary organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a toss-up which is the more iniquitous proposition: firstly, that one cannot buy time on radio and television to put one's point of view to the people of Australia or, secondly, that we shall have an Australian Electoral Commission which will be a tool of the government of the day invigilating anyone who gives any money at any time to a political party. It is an absolutely horrendous proposition to be put before us. It strikes at the very heart of democratic freedoms: the freedoms of religious belief, of association and of political expression. </PARA>
<PARA> If people wish to support a party they are entitled to be able to do so without having their names dragged across the front pages of a publication. You can bet your boots that the next thing the Labor Party will do will be to intimidate people who give substantial sums to the parties that are opposed to it. That is absolutely unconscionable. One only has to see the way the Labor Party behaves with respect to secret ballots. It wants to rule out the use of secret ballots by unions. It wants a show of hands at union meetings. It wants to be able to intimidate the audience at union meetings. It never wants to rely on secret ballots and give people the choice if it can avoid it. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things I am concerned about is that, even if these propositions were accepted, they would not provide the security the Labor Party claims they would. Coincidentally, after the last election we all had to submit our returns of expenditure, as we have to do, to the Australian Electoral Commission. I submitted one on behalf of the Liberal Senate team in Queensland, as the leader of that team. I exercised my choice, as I am entitled to do, to pay some money and to obtain returns from other political parties. The interesting one that I want to bring to the attention of the Senate tonight is from the Australian Labor Party, from the National Secretariat office, filed in the name of a Robert Francis McMullan, the General Secretary of the Party, who I presume is the same Robert Francis McMullan who is now a senator for the Australian Capital Territory. But that is irrelevant. The point is that it is very interesting to go through the return of the Federal office of the National Secretariat of the Australian Labor Party for the 1987 election. One can see the difficulties that democratic parties have competing with one hand tied behind their back. </PARA>
<PARA> If one goes through the pages and pages of returns that are filed here, one finds union after union supporting the ALP: the Australian Workers Union, of Elizabeth St, Sydney, $25,000; the Canberra Tradesmen's Union Club Inc., $1,000; the Canberra Tradesmen's Union Club Inc., $1,200-and that is just a front organisation for a union; and the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union National Council political fund. Not only does a union make a contribution but also it has a political fund that kicks in. It gave not $1,000 but $100,000. Then there is the Operative Painters and Decorators Union of Australia-and on and on it goes, union after union. None of those contributions that the unions make to the Australia Labor Party are matched by contributions to the Liberal Party of Australia, to the National Party of Australia, to the Nuclear Disarmament Party or to any of the other parties. A very sizeable proportion of the membership of the unions consists of members of the Liberal Party or the National Party. But they never see the benefits of their union's funds going to support the political party of their choice. </PARA>
<PARA> The most interesting thing of all is that when we come to the end of the return we find an organisation called ALP Legacies and Gifts Ltd. Savour the words, Mr President-ALP Legacies and Gifts Ltd. Is it associated with the Legacy organisation? What a resonant title. What a respectable title. We find that between 28 May 1987 and 4 June 1987 the value of ALP Legacies and Gifts was $1,946,348.19. An interest payment made on a gift of $1,106,204 amounted to $49,662. It is all declared. But what is it? It is a front. We know that in May 1987 ALP Legacies and Gifts had almost $2m in its coffers. That is a brick wall. We cannot go behind it. The ALP is fulfilling the law by declaring that it has those funds. It is declaring the interest paid on them and their contribution to the campaign. But quite obviously this is a contribution from their corporate friends. </PARA>
<PARA> We see the union contributions laid out. There is no need to be secret about them. But we are very much part, in the Labor scheme of things, of the corporate state, of big government, big business and big unions. ALP Legacies and Gifts Ltd with its $2m nearly three years ago is quite clearly the front behind which the great and powerful corporate friends of the ALP operate. I do not wish to take up the time of the Senate discussing that matter for much longer. I will come back to it later. The reason I mention it this afternoon is to demonstrate the practical nonsense of the proposition that is before us of the Labor Party that there be no paid political advertising on radio or television and that the authority of the Australian Electoral Commission shall be extended to give it the power to pry into, without warning, the accounts of all Australian political parties. The Labor Party has defence mechanisms already in place against that proposition. It is being blatantly dishonest in telling the community that it is fair and open in its own electoral funding. The Labor Party is trying to transfer the huge costs of elections onto the Australian community without asking the Australian community whether it wants that to happen. The Labor Party, by proposing this report, is certainly setting out to create a distinct economic advantage for itself so that it can hang onto power in the best traditions of a one-party state. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My remarks will be brief. I would just like to point out that the report is entitled Management of the Antarctic Division. On page 2 the report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition to the administration of the statutes above the Antarctic Division is involved, with other government agencies, in the oversight of Australia's objectives in Antarctica which have been summarised as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> to preserve our sovereignty over the AAT,-</PARA>
<PARA>the Australian Antarctic Territory-</PARA>
<PARA> including our sovereign rights over the adjacent offshore areas;</PARA>
<PARA> to maintain Antarctica free from strategic and/or political confrontation;-</PARA>
<PARA>that is a laudable goal-</PARA>
<PARA> to protect the Antarctic environment, having regard to both its special qualities and its effects on our region-</PARA>
<PARA>another good goal which unfortunately has sometimes not been religiously kept in the past-</PARA>
<PARA> to take advantage of the special opportunities Antarctica offers for scientific research;</PARA>
<PARA> to be informed about and able to influence developments in a region geographically proximate to Australia; and-</PARA>
<PARA>this next point is the one I am concerned about-</PARA>
<PARA> to derive any reasonable economic benefits from the living and non-living resources of the Antarctic. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a very exploitative type of goal. As the Government has now rejected the proposed Antarctic minerals convention, and I congratulate it for so doing, this sixth goal-to derive any reasonable economic benefits from the living and non-living resources of the Antarctic-should be stricken from the goals of the Antarctic Division. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, has said that he would reconsider this statement of policy interests. I have had no indication from him that he has reconsidered it and has changed this policy item. I hope that he will take a good look at it in the very near future and do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Antarctic Division has been tied in with the concept of a world wilderness park-an Antarctic park-which is a wonderful concept and which is giving Australia quite a bit of good publicity around the world. It has put Australia in the forefront regarding environmental concerns in this region. The Government, however, simply has not funded the Antarctic Division to the point where the Antarctic Division can even begin to start looking at the management plans for a world-class park in the area. No additional staffing for the establishment of this park has been provided. A draft management plan has not been provided for public comment. We have seen absolutely nothing on paper. The Government is big on words but very remiss in delivering anything concrete such as funding or reports. </PARA>
<PARA> The Paris consultative meeting regarding this wilderness park will take place during the next couple of weeks. It does not seem to the environmental movement that the Government has taken this matter seriously enough to give adequate funds to our representatives to allow them to address all the problems involved in the establishment of a world-class park in Antarctica. The report has to do greatly with the chartering of ships. A number of allegations have been made about ship chartering arrangements. The report is quite complete in that and I have no comments to make in that regard except to say that shipping does need close monitoring. The reason there has been difficulty in the past is that it has not been monitored closely enough. I think the Government should take a very close look at the shipping situation and not allow it to get out of hand, which apparently has occurred in the past. With those comments I will conclude my remarks. </PARA>

<PARA>Termination of the Inquiry</PARA>
<PARA> It is with considerable regret that I make this personal statement about the inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration into the sale of Australian Dairy Corporation (ADC) shares in an Indonesian subsidiary, PT Indomilk. I inform the Senate that the Committee has resolved not to make a substantive report on this matter. I recently reviewed the large body of evidence produced by a considerable investment of Committee and staff time in this inquiry over a period of several years. I concluded that it would not be possible for the Committee to report properly on the basis of the evidence to hand and that I could not justify the further effort required to produce a conclusive report with which I could be satisfied, if indeed the job could be done at all so many years after the events in question. The Committee accepted my recommendation that the inquiry be wound up. In making this decision, the Committee had regard for the fact that the matter had not been referred to it by the Senate but had been adopted by the Committee of its own volition under a standing reference. It would have been possible quietly to allow the inquiry to lapse but I thought it proper to make a firm decision before the end of this Parliament and to advise the Senate and interested parties. I think it desirable that I explain the basis of the decision and give some background on the inquiry and the issues examined. </PARA>
<PARA>Background to the Inquiry</PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry began in 1982, when the Committee, then called the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations, was chaired by Senator Peter Rae. It followed a 1981 Committee report on the affairs of the Australian Dairy Corporation and a submission subsequently received by Senator Rae from an Indonesian citizen who was involved in litigation with the ADC. The litigation concerned an attempt by the ADC to sell the 50 per cent shareholding it held in the Indonesian company PT Indomilk. An initial delay in the Committee's inquiry occurred with the 1983 election in which the Government changed, as did the membership and chair of the Committee. Although the new Committee decided to continue the inquiry, it immediately encountered difficulty because cases were current in both the Indonesian and Australian courts which bore directly on the subject of the inquiry. After delaying for 19 months, the Committee agreed to take evidence in camera, but it was clear that there would be serious difficulties in reporting before the court cases were settled. An incidental effect of the litigation was to prevent the ADC, including the departmental nominee on the Board, from discussing certain matters with the Minister for Primary Industry. The Committee was thus placed in the unusual position of taking in camera evidence from officials on matters they were not free to discuss with their Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> There were other difficulties in the evidence gathering. Firstly, the ADC strenuously sought delay and/or a high degree of confidentiality in the Committee's inquiry because it was engaged in commercially sensitive negotiations on the sale of its PT Indomilk shareholding. Secondly, the Committee required access to records of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the then Minister for Foreign Affairs was concerned-very properly as the Committee accepted-to preserve the confidentiality of that material. The Committee therefore took most evidence in camera and gave assurances that it would not be released without due notice and consideration of continuing commercial and national interests. </PARA>
<PARA> A further problem arose when a former senior officer of the Department of Primary Industry who had been significantly involved at the time of the attempted sale of the PT Indomilk shares was unable to give oral evidence to the Committee for medical reasons. Although the Committee obtained written answers from the officer to some of its questions, that procedure cannot be regarded as satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence gathered by the Committee and its staff between 1982 and 1988 comprises transcripts of one short public hearing and 14 hours of in camera hearings as well as copies of official and other documents totalling several thousand pages. Consideration of this evidence by the Committee was disrupted by two more elections and extensive changes in Committee membership and staff. Also, the Committee continued to receive many new references from the Senate over the period and initiated further inquiries under its standing references. This new work repeatedly diverted the Committee's resources and interests away from the PT Indomilk inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> I am now the only member of the Committee who was a member when the inquiry began. Senator Black, who was present at the last of the Committee's hearings in September 1985, is the only other current member of the Committee to have attended any hearing in the inquiry. We have been assisted by four permanent Committee secretaries and one acting secretary over the period. Further, since 1981, there has been a complete change in the board membership and substantial changes in senior staffing of the ADC. Other changes to the institutional environment occurred with the reforms to statutory marketing authorities implemented by the Government since January 1986. </PARA>
<PARA>Decision not to Report</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee persisted with its review of this matter for as long as it did, largely at my insistence, because some aspects of the evidence raised concerns and because we did not wish to waste the already substantial investment of time and effort. We finally reached the decision not to report with great reluctance. That decision was based on three considerations. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, we believe that the Government's reforms to statutory marketing authorities reduce the scope for future problems of the type encountered by the ADC. That is, what would have been our recommendations for the future has already been implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, it would be an extremely difficult and time consuming exercise for the current Committee members to familiarise themselves with the large volume of complex evidence collected when there was a different membership and different staff. The potential benefits of a full report would be unlikely to justify the necessary effort, and the time until a report could be tabled would extend even further into the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, and very importantly, although the evidence raises concern about the wisdom and propriety of actions by certain individuals, the lapse of time and procedural problems related to some of the collection of evidence would make it very difficult to report on those matters with fairness to the individuals concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> It would at least be necessary to call or recall certain individuals to give evidence. This process would involve questioning of witnesses on events that are now mostly eight years in the past and, in some cases, as old as 13 years. In the case of witnesses recalled to give evidence, the gap between their first and last appearances would be of the order of five years. I do not consider that the benefits of producing a definitive history of the PT Indomilk affair would justify the risks of unfairness to some of the individuals involved. But, within the limits imposed by the last consideration, I would like to outline briefly the circumstances reviewed by the Committee and draw some general conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA>Summary of Events</PARA>
<PARA> PT Indomilk was one of several subsidiary companies established in various Asian countries by the Australian Dairy Produce Board in the late 1960s and early 1970s in developing new markets for Australian dairy products. The capital for the Asian subsidiaries was supplied from the Dairying Industry Stabilisation Fund, that is from industry rather than public sources. The Dairy Board and its successor, the Australian Dairy Corporation, subsequently experienced difficulties in the management of several of these companies and its general performance was criticised in the 1981 report of this Committee which also foreshadowed a closer examination of the Indonesian subsidiary. </PARA>
<PARA> PT Indomilk was a company set up under Indonesian Law pursuant to a joint venture between the Dairy Board and a local company, NV Marison. The joint venture agreement gave the Dairy Board a majority shareholding in, and control of, the company. But there was provision for Marison to lift its holding to 50 per cent if arrangements could be made to retain Dairy Board control of the joint venture. </PARA>
<PARA> PT Indomilk was the first manufacturer of reconstituted milk products in Indonesia and was initially profitable. But by 1976 competition from other joint ventures and some operational difficulties were beginning to emerge. In that year, however, the ADC sold to its partner sufficient shares to give Marison an equal shareholding in PT Indomilk. The conditions of sale of the shares to Marison purported to retain ADC control through a voting trust in respect of one share. But the ADC had legal advice at the time that the trust was of doubtful validity under Indonesian law. The ADC's legal advisers in fact expressed strong initial opposition to the sale and the reasons for the Corporation's decision to proceed are unclear. </PARA>
<PARA> After the sale of shares, PT Indomilk suffered further financial reverses and there were serious disputes between the Australian and Indonesian partners. By 1981 PT Indomilk had fallen far into arrears in its payment for Australian raw materials and the ADC risked a large financial loss if the company had collapsed. </PARA>
<PARA> In September 1981 the ADC received a very generous offer from one of PT Indomilk's Indonesian competitors for the ADC's 50 per cent holding in the joint venture. Although the Dairy Produce Act required ministerial approval for a contract of that size, a sale agreement was signed by ADC representatives. The agreement obliged the ADC to seek approval for the sale both from the Australian authorities and from a shareholders' meeting of PT Indomilk. The ADC representatives negotiated the sale in conditions of considerable secrecy, being aware that their Indonesian partner, Marison, was likely to object. It was clear from the beginning that there would be difficulties in obtaining the approval of a PT Indomilk shareholders' meeting.</PARA>
<PARA> The ADC devised a strategy which mainly involved generating publicity in Indonesia, that would, it hoped, deter Marison and the Indonesian authorities from blocking the sale. In fact, Marison objected strenuously to the sale and the Indonesian authorities, in accordance with their well-established practice, required the agreement of both existing partners before approving the share sale. Australian diplomatic and trade representatives in Jakarta and their departments in Canberra became involved in the issue at this point, conveying information between some of the parties and expressing certain opinions on the ADC's sale strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> The then Minister for Primary Industry, Peter Nixon, advised the ADC that he would not grant his approval to the sale, required under the Dairy Produce Act unless he had an assurance that the Indonesian Government would give its approval to the share transfer. The ADC subsequently abandoned its attempt to conclude the sale. The ADC argued that any losses incurred as a result of its withdrawal from the sale agreement should be borne by the Commonwealth. The ADC representatives maintained that their failure to conclude the sale resulted from intervention by the Minister, his Department and Foreign Affairs and Trade representatives. The former Government rejected that claim and the present Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, has also rejected it. </PARA>
<PARA> Negotiations between the ADC, Marison and other parties in 1982 led to the ADC signing a considerably less generous agreement with a different Indonesian buyer acceptable to Marison. The first prospective buyer then sued the ADC, seeking compliance with the original agreement. The matter was finally settled in 1987 when a third Indonesian buyer, a subsidiary of a large commercial and financial group which had earlier taken over Marison, succeeded in purchasing the ADC interest in a settlement agreeable to all parties to the litigation. This settlement was endorsed by the Indonesian authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The terms of the sale effectively handed the ADC shares to the purchaser in return for the latter paying most of the debt owed by PT Indomilk for supply of Australian raw materials. Fortuitous movements in exchange rates cushioned the financial loss to the Australian dairy industry but the Australian holding in PT Indomilk, which the ADC had previously written down to a value of $1, was effectively given away, though raw material supply agreements continued. </PARA>
<PARA>Issues of Concern</PARA>
<PARA> This summary of the events gives only some idea of how complex were the issues in the inquiry. The evidence taken by the Committee raised four areas of concern that the Committee might have addressed had it continued with this inquiry. Firstly, it is clear in hindsight that the 1976 sale of shares was a costly error. The Committee heard of serious allegations concerning the propriety of that sale and such allegations were also made by a member in the House of Representatives on 5 April 1984. There is no documentation in support of the claims. There has been a total change in senior personnel and extensive institutional reform at the ADC since 1976. Given the public criticisms already made by this Committee and others of the former board and management of the ADC, there would be little value in pursuing these allegations to the end, if, indeed, it were possible to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, there is concern about the wisdom and propriety of ADC actions during the 1981 sale attempt. I do not consider it unfair to say that the whole basis of the sales strategy was and is open to question. It was, at best, a high risk strategy and the possibility exists that the ADC representatives were misled into actions that ultimately damaged the ADC's interests. There appear to have been procedural lapses during the sale attempt, some of which I consider to have been serious. In particular, the whole sale strategy was kept secret within a small group of ADC officers and members to a degree which I regard as unwise if not improper. </PARA>
<PARA> However, to report fully on this issue while being completely fair to everyone concerned would have involved the Committee in significant additional work. The lapse of time and difficulties with some of the documentation would probably have made it impossible to resolve the issue in a fair manner. I do not consider that the effort involved in fully investigating this complex matter would produce commensurate benefits given the changes in the ADC board and management since 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The third major area of concern relates to the actions of the then Minister and the three Public Service departments involved. This was of particular relevance because of the claims for government compensation to the dairy industry that were pushed for some years after the first sale attempt. The ADC's good fortune with exchange rates has removed the pressure for compensation. My own reading of the evidence suggests that any revival of such pressure would be a forlorn hope. I would be most surprised if any comprehensive review of that aspect of the debacle were to support the claim that government or bureaucratic intervention was crucial to the failure of the sale. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it could be argued that some interventions by the then Minister and three executive departments in the affairs of the ADC, a statutory authority, were unwise and procedurally flawed. But I judge these to have been irrelevant to the outcome; I believe the sale attempt was doomed from the start. Repetition of such interventions, I believe, would be precluded by the Kerin reforms to statutory marketing authorities. The notion that statutory authorities are open to private or informal dabbling by Ministers or departments should now be dead. </PARA>
<PARA> It is probably fair to note here that Ministers and departments normally deal with more than one issue at a time, often under extreme pressure. On the same day that Peter Nixon acceded to the ADC's sale strategy, for example, the Committee's highly critical report on the administration of the ADC was tabled. In the same week, his Government was establishing a royal commission into the Australia meat industry following a breakdown in the administration of meat inspection by the Minister's Department. </PARA>
<PARA> In evidence to that Committee of Inquiry to Examine Commonwealth and State Meat Inspection Systems, Mr Nixon was critical of the lack of professionalism in his Department. The Royal Commission subsequently found the criticism to be justified but also criticised the Minister. I suspect that the findings of the Royal Commission about the situation in the Primary Industry portfolio in 1981-82 would be reinforced by the events surrounding the ministerial and bureaucratic interventions in the PT Indomilk sale. There seems little point, however, in now exploring the past failings of organisations that have since undergone extensive change. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth significant issue that I see as arising from this sorry story relates to accountability to Parliament. The versions of some events given to the Committee by certain individuals at in camera hearings contained contradictions. Honest mistakes and disagreements may account for some of the discrepancies. Evidence by some individuals, when compared to official file documents, also suggested that those persons, while not being untruthful, had been less than fully forthcoming with the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> It is crucial to the operations of the Senate and its committees that witnesses give truthful and complete answers to questions. The Committee took its evidence in camera and gave reasonable undertakings regarding subsequent use of that evidence precisely so that witnesses could speak fully and frankly. I believe that we were unusually considerate and scrupulous in that regard. The attitude of some witnesses is all the more disappointing for that reason. I cannot say, however, that I consider any actions by witnesses to have been so serious as to justify further action by the Senate. Lapse of time as well as the complexity of the issues involved would, in any case, make an investigation of this matter very difficult and probably fruitless. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's Role</PARA>
<PARA> I feel obliged to say that the outcome of this inquiry reflects to some extent on me and the Committee as well as on the agencies and officials involved. It is clear in hindsight that this inquiry, if it was to be resolved at all, should have been settled well before this. I could have done it, but only if I had had no other duties in the Senate or in the electorate. However, the whole situation was not conducive to an early and full report on the affair. That we did not report resulted partly from changes in Committee membership and staffing, partly from the pressure of other work and partly from a concern to ensure the rights of individuals to a just hearing. It also should be emphasised that events continued to unfold during the period. I do believe, however, that the Committee's inquiry was one of several catalysts to beneficial change in the Australian Dairy Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to thank all those members and former members of the Committee and current and previous staff, certain of whom laboured mightily on the inquiry of various times during the last seven years. It was a massive task. I have agonised about this matter for years. I wish that, instead of pressing on, I had canned the inquiry at the one or two appropriate points during recent years at which that could have been done. So it is with a mixture of disappointment and relief that I have made this statement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Health Amendment Bill 1989 is a very simple and short Bill. It merely increases a patient's contribution for pharmaceutical prescriptions from $11 to $12 and indexes the contribution according to, I presume, future rises in the consumer price index. Before the debate was interrupted by the suspension of the Senate for lunch, we had discussed the tormented state in which pharmacists find themselves at present as a result of the Government's administration in recent years, particularly recent months. Previous speakers gave a very detailed account of the many problems that pharmacists face and referred to their ability to carry on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been a wide scattergun attack on the health industry in general. Earlier this year pharmacists were attacked when their prescriptions fees were reduced by 10c a time. That measure taken by the Government was challenged in the courts and the Government lost the case. Similarly, pathologists came under attack. Half the items on their schedule were crossed off unilaterally by the Government. They had to take the challenge to the court and they won their case. The arbitrary cost-cutting measures taken by the Government over recent months have created no end of havoc in the industry. As I have said before in the Senate, this kind of thing is to be expected because the Government promises that health care will be free at the point of delivery, which creates an unlimited demand for its services, but it has a limited budget with which to satisfy the unlimited demand. The two cannot meet. As the budget gets spent and the demand goes up the two move away from each other and create no end of dissatisfaction among not only patients but also doctors, pharmacists, hospitals, administrators and nursing staff. There is dissatisfaction throughout. That is the position in which the whole industry finds itself. In the Senate today we are discussing the tumult that exists in the pharmacy industry. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, the Bill is a trifling one. The Opposition does not oppose it. However, we are moving an amendment in relation to the decision made by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal last August. As has come out in the debate here, the Tribunal was acting under Government instruction to reduce the cost of dispensing pharmaceuticals by about $20m or $30m. It used a survey of pharmacists' practices which was entirely inadequate. Only 53 of the 5,600 or so pharmacists in Australia were surveyed. Less than one per cent of pharmacists were surveyed. In spite of the fact that there were some telephone surveys to follow it up, which undoubtedly would have been inaccurate-they are noted for that-the Tribunal went ahead and recommended a further reduction in dispensing fees to pharmacists. </PARA>
<PARA> Socialist governments are always putting their professional people under attack-not only doctors but everyone who contributes to the intellectual development of the society in which he lives. Probably socialists realise that they need these people to run the economy, so they try to get them working for the government. In the present case the pharmacists have finally realised that this is the last straw. Only within the last couple of weeks they closed their shops for an afternoon across the country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a responsible job. An interesting question posed today was how the reduction in pharmacy incomes will affect women because women are more involved in the industry than anybody else. Women comprise 80 per cent of pharmacists' customers and 80 per cent of the people employed in pharmacies. These figures are quite revealing. Here we have a government which regards itself as enlightened and progressive in women's issues, yet it is taking action which disadvantages women a lot more than men.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today we heard in the debate that pharmacists do not generate huge costs in the dispensing of pharmaceuticals; they merely dispense the prescriptions that are written by doctors. If we had one pharmacy or one million pharmacies in Australian dispensing the same number of prescriptions, the cost would be the same. I notice that the Government is taking action in another way, perhaps to help with the reduction in the number of prescriptions that are written. A Bill which recently passed through the Senate for the vocational registration of general practitioners was brought in because doctors were supposed to be writing too many prescriptions, and writing too many prescriptions for expensive drugs, referring too many patients to specialists, and referring too many people for tests and X-rays. When this whole concerted attack gets going perhaps that will help with the reduction in pharmaceutical costs. None of this is designed to produce better health care for the people. The Government is taking a restrictive cost-cutting action which has nothing to do with better health for the patients who form the main part of the health system and provide the reason why the whole organisation exists. </PARA>
<PARA> Pharmacy operations have been squeezed more and more. Honourable senators would have noticed that many pharmacies are now looking more like supermarkets than dispensaries. In fact, pharmacists have been reduced to the role of spruikers standing outside their shops with microphones selling their wares. I nearly said `hawking their wares' but I would not want to introduce any pun in this debate. Pharmacists have been turned into spruikers and pushers and pedlars of pills. They have come under considerable attack from the Government as if they were a bunch of money-grubbers who were not interested in their patients. </PARA>
<PARA> This same argument has been used against the doctors. The Government has confused the argument. It has referred to an increase in patient rebates as an increase in salaries for doctors. It is not. The patients are getting the rebates, not the doctors. The same applies to this legislation. The increase in patients' contributions from $11 to $12 will not increase the chemist's remuneration one bit; all that money goes to the Government. It is just an additional tax. As I mentioned earlier in my speech, it is tax on the people who are sick; the people who will require medication. </PARA>
<PARA> We have now reached the crucial point where the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal has made an inadequately low assessment of dispensing fees, based on an inadequate survey, that will disrupt our entire pharmacy network throughout Australia. The Government has talked about wanting to rationalise the industry. It has said that we have too many pharmacies and it wants uneconomic pharmacies to close. A pharmacy which might be marginally economic could still be a very busy pharmacy, particularly if it is in an area where there are a lot of pensioners. It might be a busy pharmacy which is not making big profits but is providing a good service. Similarly, there could be pharmacies that are marginally economic in country areas but the chemist is prepared to provide a service because he wants to do a professional job. But those pharmacies in particular will be the first to go under the stringent rules that the Government is applying to chemists at the moment. That will cause no end of dislocation. Honourable senators on both sides must have been heavily lobbied by pharmacists on that issue of the closure of pharmacies alone. Of course, the single pharmacy town will be terribly disadvantaged if these low remuneration figures are implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> As a matter of fact, from the time when this debate was interrupted until now, I have received a letter from the chemist at the Health Spot Pharmacy at Lismore. That chemist is going on a week's holiday. Before doing that he has to employ, by law, a locum pharmacist to cover for him. She will be paid $19 an hour-I notice that the Remuneration Tribunal puts pharmacists' wages at $14 an hour-for a 58-hour week which will be a total of $1,100 for the week. She has to be assisted by a part-time dispensary assistant who will be paid $203 for a 24-hour week. The rent for a dispensary size area of 25 square metres is $296 a week. Other sundry expenses shared between the shop and the dispensary, such as electricity, will come to approximately $275 a week. On average, the locum pharmacist should dispense nine scripts an hour which represents about 522 for the week. At $3.50 remuneration per prescription, as determined by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal, income from dispensing for the week will be $1,827. However, as the expenses which I have mentioned will come to $1,876, that will represent a loss of $49 for the week. On top of this the chemist has to run a computer, put in at his expense to improve his productivity and enhance the service to his customers. He has to maintain a dispensary stock costing $17,000 in order to provide an adequate supply of prescription items for consumers. The letter from the chemist provides a practical example of what happens. This chemist knows that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal does not want to reduce him to that degree of penury. Chemists know that the Tribunal, which has been acting under orders from the Government, has come up with an unrealistic recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost effects of high cost drugs have been mentioned. Certainly pharmaceuticals are getting more sophisticated these days, but this is mainly in the area of preventive medicine-for cardiovascular reasons and metabolic disorders-which will keep people out of hospital and delay the onset of severe illnesses that require expensive treatment. It costs a lot to keep these drugs on the shelves. The arrangements that the Government has come to are not really conducive to the proper practice of modern pharmaceutical dispensing. This attack on the doctors, that they should be more thoughtful in what they are prescribing-this Government does not want doctors to be more thoughtful; it wants doctors to prescribe cheaper drugs-is not conducive to the practice of good medicine. </PARA>
<PARA> We want to try to get this Bill through tonight. We are not opposing it but we wish to move amendments to it. I hope that the Government will come to its senses in regard to the overall administration of health in Australia because this is not the only area that is suffering because of the recurrent and persistent restrictions that the Government is placing on it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the National Health Amendment Bill, which will increase maximum general patient contributions for prescribed drugs supplied under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) from $11 to $12. This is designed to take effect from 1 October. But the Bill will not affect free pharmaceutical benefits for all pensioners and the concessional beneficiary rate of $2.50, or free scripts for the chronically ill. However the Bill does provide for annual indexation of the general patient contribution in line with the March quarter all groups consumer price index.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have much pleasure in supporting an amendment to be moved by my colleague Senator Puplick which would mean that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal determination will have no effect. As a result of the initiative of my Liberal colleague Senator Puplick, from New South Wales, the Government has scurried off suddenly to meet with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, and at a hastily held meeting this afternoon certain arrangements were made. It does appear that, while the Government and the Guild will make a joint submission to the Tribunal to defer the effect of the decision from 1 October to 1 November, there are some areas of dispute. On reading a joint statement put out by the Government and the Guild, it does appear that there is conflict on some features. While they both say they accept the Tribunal decision and the fact that the integrity of the Budget is to be preserved, the Guild does emphasise that it reserves the right to pursue the reinstatement of the mark-up with the Tribunal. I see these as certainly being points of conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has certainly expressed its displeasure about the legal actions the Guild is taking and has sought to have them withdrawn, but those legal actions will not be withdrawn unless the parties reach agreement. There are to be negotiations during October to examine the range of options for pharmaceutical remuneration-and this is an unusual term-`outside the scope of the Tribunal'. I would imagine a lot of pharmacists around Australia would be concerned about the term `outside the scope of the Tribunal'. It will be interesting to see the reaction of the mass of pharmacists who have put up such a fight to date. On the other hand, it is too early to say whether the Guild has weakened to the Government's overtures. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to emphasise that the objectives for the PBS today, in 1989, are not in keeping with the contemporary service requirements expected by the community. The Government has failed to acknowledge that. There is nothing in the findings of the Tribunal to encourage pharmacists to spend more time on patient counselling. Maybe it is discussion on these sorts of matters that it is intended should take place. The briefing from the Government and the Guild is not sufficiently adequate to indicate the scope of those areas of negotiation. One problem with the findings of the Tribunal is that the Government is seeking to implement a mechanism whereby pharmaceutical dispensing will effectively become a factory-type operation, like a sausage machine, with little intervention by pharmacists in an effort to provide the patient with advice on, say, preventive health care. There is certainly a myth around about the great profits in pharmacy. It is distressing to see Labor members of parliament going around the country and misrepresenting gross margins as net profit. I do not think that does their integrity any good at all. It is unfortunate that one member of this Parliament has made that misrepresentation in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> Up till now the Government has not been prepared to acknowledge that the Tribunal has been at all wrong. It is interesting to note that Professor Barry Hughes of the University of Newcastle until 1989 was an economic adviser to Mr Keating. Some of his criticisms are quite significant. He suggests that the Tribunal has badly miscalculated the true costs of dispensing. He maintains that if pharmacies in Australia were as profitable as the Tribunal decision suggests we would see the numbers of pharmacies in this country increase rapidly as more and more pharmacists open pharmacies in order to take advantage of the profitable situation. </PARA>
<PARA> What has actually happened, however, is that the number of pharmacies in Australia has fallen since the early 1970s. The Australian population has increased by over 30 per cent in the same period. This shows that Australian pharmacies have had moderate incomes over nearly two decades. This is a very strong indication that the Tribunal decision is simply wrong if we examine it purely on a market forces basis, apart from the earlier misgivings I mentioned and which I will not repeat today. At least the Government has now admitted that the Tribunal's inquiry has had some major problems. But despite this it still insists that the Tribunal should reduce pharmacy dispensing fees. It strongly encourages the Tribunal to make the latest decision. I think it is very important that there was pressure on the Tribunal to make this decision which has this particular effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically up to now the Government has not given away 1c. There has been some arrangement with wholesalers. Basically that is a robbing Peter to pay Paul type principle and merely involves a change in the relaxation of wholesale margins. The promised assistance to country pharmacists will not help all pharmacists in remote areas, particularly those where there is one pharmacy right out in the middle of Australia-for example, Bourke or anywhere else-which handles more than 15,000 scripts. He is going to see his remuneration completely brought down as a result of the Tribunal's decision. This extra allowance that is going to be given for under 15,000 scripts will not be available. So the incentive to that pharmacist in the future will be to reduce his range of operations and just work a few days a week. Again, this shows that the Government does not understand how this particular scheme is working. </PARA>
<PARA> I was rather dismayed to see the Government obviously respond to the pharmacists' action by placing a statement in yesterday's newspapers headed `Is your local chemist leading you down the garden path?'. There was a 008 number and no authorisation. It is a pretty poor ad. When people rang this particular number the person who answered said, `I am sorry, we cannot answer your questions, sir', or madam, whoever it was, `I am just employed to take your concerns to the Minister but I have been instructed to send you a brochure that should explain everything to you'. This is just a simple brochure. When asked for the details of this brochure the standard reply was, `I am sorry, sir, I have not got it in front of me; I cannot give you any details'. What was the whole purpose of this ad? It was a facade and a fake. When people inquired a little more deeply the lass said, `It is the intention of the Government that chemist shops will not close down'. I hesitated there because those words are important. </PARA>
<PARA> A further inquiry revealed that in relation to the supply of needed drugs such as insulin the words used were, `There is no worry; the supply will be assured'. I would advise anybody listening to this debate that it is really up to the pharmacist to decide what range of stock he is going to hold. If there is no profit in it, or a loss, the pharmacist will be reluctant to carry the whole range. I will give an example. I understand there are three principal types of insulin available which go out of date very quickly. There is limited demand from patients, so the advice to them is, `Do not leave your requests for insulin too late because there may be some delay in availability as not all pharmacists will stock the whole range in future because of the low profitability and the fact that they go out of date quickly, et cetera'. It was disconcerting that the people at the other end of the telephone were unable to answer people's concerns adequately, despite the fact that people were asked to ring up. When asked to give examples of where our local pharmacist could be leading us down the garden path, the answer was, `I am sorry, sir, we do not have any examples. I cannot answer your question but I will pass on your concern to the Minister because that is what I am employed to do'. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very unsatisfactory situation. The whole thing is quite misleading. I now refer to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal's database inquiry statement. Item 13 states:</PARA>
<PARA>Finally it has been recommended that there should be an inquiry-</PARA>
<PARA>another inquiry-</PARA>
<PARA>undertaken to consider an appropriate re-structure of pharmacy outlets with the object of achieving greater efficiency and reduced cost of dispensing. </PARA>
<PARA>After all these findings based on flawed data, what sort of confidence will that give to pharmacists? That does not even suggest who will conduct that inquiry. The whole thing has been handled very badly. As it stands, the decision will directly affect the level and standard of service that pharmacists provide and that people have come to expect across Australia. Under the new scale of charges, some pharmacists will lose money if they dispense some of the more expensive drugs. No reasonable person could expect a pharmacist in future to stock the whole range of an item such as insulin that I mentioned earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> The sad fact is that not only will incomes be cut; employees will be retrenched. Those pharmacists who do not go out of business, those who remain, will have to trim their variable costs. Of course, labour is the first component to be affected. One Tasmanian pharmacist has estimated that, on average, one full time worker, whether it be in the form of a locum pharmacist or pharmacy assistant, will have to be retrenched from each of the 153 businesses involved. At this point, I should perhaps indicate that I have an interest in this matter. My wife is a locum pharmacist. Certainly, she is concerned about the future welfare of the pharmacy business in Australia. I spoke to her this afternoon and she said that she has been inundated today by people concerned about the impact that these changes will have on their medication and its timely availability. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that the Government is now starting to respond to pressure. The Opposition has had a small victory with the Tribunal's having revised part of last month's ruling which appeared to threaten supplies of vital but expensive drugs, such as insulin for diabetics. The mechanisms still have not been spelt out adequately. It is not surprising that the pharmacists have taken to the streets because this whole thing is a disaster for community pharmacists. In fact, it is an outrage against the community. The Government is responsible because it urged the Tribunal to take this course. It is now up to the Government, having taken this initiative, to try to meet with the pharmacists to negotiate an honourable way out of this. I commend the action of my colleague Senator Puplick who has forced the hand of the Government, which until now has said that it is independent and that the matter is out of its control. The action of the Liberal Party has forced the Government to make a decision on this Tribunal. We have seen the Government today for the first time, having had initial discussions with the Guild, wanting to try to meet some of the concerns. I certainly hope that the Guild has not been conned, but I certainly look forward to a satisfactory resolution of this very unsatisfactory public relations campaign by both the Minister for Housing and Aged Care, Mr Staples, and the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak very briefly in support of my colleagues on the National Health Amendment Bill. I am pleased to see that the Australian Democrats are supporting us in this matter. I want to take up a short time of the Senate just to reiterate some of the concerns in this matter that have been put to me over the last few months, and particularly in the last couple of weeks, in my own State. I have heard tonight that the Federal Court has set down a hearing on this matter for 9 October .As a result of the action taken by the Pharmacy Guild of Australia over the cuts Mr Justice Jenkinson set the date, having been told that the case was urgent. It certainly is urgent. The concerns of the pharmacists and the people who use pharmacists for their primary health care and rely on them so much are being expressed, and they severely criticise the Government. It is because of this that the Minister for Housing and Aged Care, Mr Staples, and the Government are looking at the matter again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One does not need to be reminded of the action of the pharmacists. Last weekend, in an unprecedented move, pharmacists took to the streets in the marginal seat of Denison in Tasmania. I do not recall any action like this being taken before. It was a protest about the cosmetic changes being made on the run by the Government over this matter. There has been the flagging of the $5m rural subsidy and the recent announcement of discussions with wholesalers over surcharges on drugs. But the basic question relates to keeping these pharmacies open, particularly in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I travelled around Tasmania last week and spoke to pharmacists, particularly on the east coast of Tasmania. For those honourable senators who do not know much about the east coast, it is primarily a very nice area for people to retire to. I would hazard a guess that over 50 per cent of the people who live on the east coast of Tasmania are people who chose to go there for their retirement. There are three or four pharmacists in the whole area. If any one of those pharmacies closed, it would mean those retired people having to rely on mail order pharmacies for their drugs. That is not good enough. These particular people are not very well served by either pharmacies or other health care sources. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been said by Senator Sheil, a bushfire is raging out there as result of the length of time this attack on the pharmacists has been going on. First, pharmacists were required to change to computer-based payments systems. If they did not change, payments were going to be delayed. They are still being delayed. When I went around the State last week I heard many complaints about delays in payment. Fifty-three drugs have come off the pharmaceutical benefits list to be replaced by generic brands, and that in itself has had an effect on old people. The latest action of reducing dispensing fees is the final nail in the coffin. </PARA>
<PARA> When one talks to pharmacists, as I did at Beaconsfield, St Helens, Bicheno, Swansea and Triabunna, one finds that they are all concerned about the fact that they are required to keep such a large stock of drugs at no cost to the Government. They are required to keep $20,000 or $30,000 worth of drugs so that they can provide the primary health care that people have come to expect over the years. </PARA>
<PARA> One only has to look at local papers to see the letters from ex-pharmacists refuting claims made by the Government. For instance, the honourable member for Denison, Mr Kerr, stated that pharmacists have an average net income of $98,000. This was refuted quite strongly by Tony Wiss from Lindisfarne. He estimated that a 50-hour week produced a net income of between $24,000 and $38,000. Geoff Deacon from Lindisfarne queried the fact that the Government could find $60m for Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd but it could not find a few million dollars to support the pharmacists who look after the old people in our community. Mr Ian Huett, a Deloraine chemist, rang me about a terrible problem of a person requiring insulin. If it had not been for the fact that he had put in a computer at his own cost and had a record of who was receiving insulin in his district, there is a good chance that a life would have been lost. The Harley Johnstone Pharmacy at Penguin on the north-west coast said it will close next May unless the Federal Government defers its decision. Ralph Tapping, one of our leading pharmacists and spokesmen in Hobart, made the point that the aim of the doorknock was to ensure that Mr Kerr knew how seriously the move to reduce payments for prescriptions would impact on the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, one of our better known pharmacists, Kevin Corby, who has moved to Cygnet, publicly stated that he earned $84,000 and was left with an income of $26,000. They are the types of comments being made. They make no sense at all of the Government's arguments that pharmacists are well paid. I support the other speakers supporting this amendment. </PARA>

The second reading speech of the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) tells us that the patient contribution will rise from $11 to $12. This is estimated to achieve a saving of $10m in 1989-90 and $17m in a full financial year, allowing for indexation. Either the Minister's figures are wrong or he expects a lot more sickness in the coming year because, allowing for indexation, next year's saving should be around $14.63m, not $17m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now turn to the heading `Financial Impact Statement' in the explanatory memorandum of the Bill. Again, it states that this increase is estimated to achieve a saving of $10m in 1989-90. But then it states that with indexation of the patient contribution, estimated savings are $35m in 1990-91, $55m in 1991-92 and $78m in 1992-93. Unless there is to be a great upsurge in sickness in the next few years, I need someone to explain those figures to me; I am in total confusion. The hardest hit will be the country pharmacists-not those in the large remote areas but those in the small remote areas. For example, there are 1,200 people in my town with a total of 3,000 people in the district. We have a small pharmacy, which will not survive even with a subsidy. The closest pharmacy will then be 100 kilometres away. These are the sorts of pharmacies that will be affected the most. I think that everything has been said and, due to the lateness of the evening, we should proceed to ballot. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I have sought leave to move both of the Opposition amendments together because they are integral, one actually inserting a clause and the other one relating to the date of the commencement of the clause. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Page 1, clause 2, lines 7 and 8, leave out the clause, insert the following clause:</PARA>
<PARA>Commencement</PARA>
<PARA> ``2. (1) Subject to subsection (2), this Act commences on 1 October 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> ``(2) Section 6 shall be deemed to have commenced on 30 September 1989.''. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Page 3, after clause 5, add the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA>PBRT determination to have no effect</PARA>
<PARA> ``6. The determination of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal dated 28 August 1989 and made under section 98b of the Principal Act is and shall be of no force or effect.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) has correctly drawn attention to the fact that some progress has been made today in the discussions between the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I believe that those discussions took place as a result of the initiative taken by the Opposition, supported by the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine today, that we would proceed with amending this legislation. There are slight but insignificant differences between the statement which the Minister has read and the statement issued by the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. I make only two comments about them. The first is that in the press release issued this afternoon by the Pharmacy Guild the President of the Guild, Mr Matthews, indicated that the Guild had not been persuaded by the Government to withdraw its pending legal proceedings in this matter, and the second is that the Guild emphasised that it reserved the right to pursue the reinstatement of mark-ups and presumably other issues with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> We welcome those negotiations. We recognise that they have occurred as a result of the pressure which the Senate has put on the Government. We do not, of course, know what, if anything, will arise from those discussions. The legal action is still on foot. We believe that the passage of this amendment, striking down the determination of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal dated 28 August 1989 and made under section 98b of the principal Act, the National Health Act 1953, is necessary because it will restore the playing field to the level of being an even playing field. In other words, if no satisfactory result is achieved by these negotiations, if we do not pursue this amendment, the Government stands with a club over the head of the pharmacists-the determination of the Tribunal. If, however, nothing arises as a result of those negotiations and this amendment has been passed, we are back to an even playing field and the determination of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal will have been struck down. </PARA>
<PARA> We intend to pursue the amendments because we believe that we should take away from the Government the threat that no progress means the maintenance of the Tribunal decision, that we should bring about a situation where the threat is against the Government, and that no agreement means that the pharmacists are not the losers in the whole process. I have moved the amendments. I commend them to the Senate. I trust they will receive the support of the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine. I believe that all of the arguments about the substantive merits of the amendments were adequately canvassed on the last occasion that this matter was before this chamber and I shall not repeat them further. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will continue their support for the amendments moved by the Opposition to the National Health Amendment Bill 1989. I merely remark that the events of this afternoon confirm to my mind that this is the appropriate action. Clearly, if the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the Government are engaged in negotiations regarding changing the nature of remuneration for pharmacists under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme the Tribunal's determination will be altered in some sense. In that case I cannot understand the Government's inability to recognise that, in accepting these amendments-and I hope it will accept them when this Bill reaches the House of Representatives-it is clearing the way for an open negotiation with the Pharmacy Guild. I was surprised to hear this afternoon that Mr Staples-I hope he did not mean it-told one of my colleagues that nothing would change during the month's negotiations in relation to the Tribunal's determination. Clearly, one cannot go into negotiations over a period of a month with a mind closed against the possibility of changing some or all of the elements of that determination. For those reasons I think the Government's position is illogical. I hope it sees reason and will come round to supporting these amendments when this Bill reaches the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish briefly to reinforce all that has been said by Senator Puplick and Senator Coulter. It is clear that the amendments moved by the Opposition to the National Health Amendment Bill 1989 will be supported by this chamber. Given the significant contributions to the analysis of the pharmacy industry in the speeches of members of the Opposition here during the last two days, this is another demonstration of the importance of the Senate in pressing home to the government of the day the interests of the people of Australia as they are served through the pharmacies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Given the announcement that has been made today following discussions between the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the announcement by Senator Cook in the dying stages of this debate, if the Government is genuine in its announcement that negotiations are to be held over the coming month, it has nothing to lose by agreeing to the amendments moved by the Opposition. That will return us to the even playing field that Senator Puplick has called for. After this one month of negotiations, when there is agreement between the pharmacy industry and the Government, and when that can be shared with the Opposition and the Australian Democrats, at any point thereafter a fresh Bill can be brought in by the Government to amend the principal Act to reflect that new concord. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I make an appeal to the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), who is in the chamber. In the spirit of his own statement here this evening, and to be consistent with that statement and the agreement made between the Prime Minister and the Pharmacy Guild, he should be saying aye along with the Opposition and the Democrats in support of these excellent amendments, which reflect many hours of debate in this place. This is an important example of the way in which the Senate is vital to preserve the benefits and rights of Australian citizens. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not my intention to delay the Committee. The issues have been canvassed both within this chamber and outside it. I rise to support the Opposition's amendments, the result of which will be that the determination of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal of 28 August 1989 shall have no force or effect. That will be the result so far as this chamber is concerned. Of course, the matter will then be considered by the House of Representatives. Following what Senator Teague has just said, it would be desirable if, on this occasion, the whole of the Senate, including the Government, were to accede to these amendments so that negotiations can take place on the even playing field that the Opposition has referred to.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will not be voting for, or accepting, the amendments. Since this is a matter of some considerable principle to us, the normal expectation would be that we would seek to divide on it. But, in view of the hour, I will not call for a division. I recognise that the numbers are against us. The Opposition, the Australian Democrats and the Independent senator from Tasmania have foreshadowed that they will be voting for the amendments. I would not want anyone to think that the fact that we are not seeking a division in any way means that we are walking away from the principle. It is just that, in view of the hour and as a courtesy to the chamber, it seems an appropriate thing to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to some of the remarks that have been made and to my carefully scripted notes in reply. In our view, the amendments are a grandstanding exercise. The Opposition is on the public record, in the Hansard record of the debate in the House of Representatives, as saying that it supports the proposal to increase the general patient contribution under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to $12 and to index it in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition knows that this measure is reasonable. This chamber debated the issues about pharmacy remuneration in depth when it considered Senator Puplick's Bill. That Bill is now before the House of Representatives and there is nothing to be gained by this attempt to tie the remuneration of pharmacists to the Bill now before the Senate. This is clearly a Budget Bill. I note that the Democrats have previously undertaken not to block Supply. I would, therefore, expect them to vote against this attempt to link two separate issues. The Government will not agree to this Bill being amended. The Bill before the Senate has been publicly endorsed by the Liberals as appropriate. I am sure that many honourable senators opposite would agree that the indexing of the general patient contribution combined with the protection of the existing safety net is a logical and fair approach. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Opposition is genuine about its concern, let it release its health policy which is taking longer than the two years that the Tribunal took in determining pharmacists' remuneration. I would be delighted to see what unequivocal commitments the Opposition will give to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, patient charges and pharmacists' remuneration in its health policy. As the Opposition and the Democrats are aware, a meeting took place this afternoon. Because of that there is a new cooperative spirit abroad. That cooperative spirit should be allowed to be properly exercised. </PARA>
<PARA> I submit that the amendments are redundant, given the agreement that has been reached this afternoon. Indeed, they are likely to be more than just redundant; they are likely to be counterproductive and to further inflame a dispute, which is the opposite of what the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, the Government and the community desire. The amendments are also totally unacceptable to the Government, as I have said. Therefore, when this Bill goes back to the other place, it will be amended. This means that the Budget decision to increase the maximum patient contribution from $11 to $12 will not be able to go ahead on 1 October as planned. The Opposition and the Democrats are therefore combining to disrupt what is clearly a Budget Bill. The Government has already set its Budget parameters. However, the delay in the introduction of the $12 decision will reduce the amount of money available to pharmacists through these negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is committed to the integrity of its Budget parameters. The savings lost because of this action-the action in delaying the adjustment of the payment to $12-will have to be deducted from the amount that would otherwise have been available to pharmacists. Pharmacists will only have the Opposition and the Democrats in this place to blame if there is an additional loss to remuneration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to speak further about the all-women's scientific expedition to Cooper Creek. I mentioned this matter in the Senate a couple of weeks ago because at that stage I wanted to inform the Senate that such an expedition was taking place and also to inform the Senate of my regret at being unable to join those women. However, over the weekend I was able to take the opportunity to go to Cooper Creek and join the expedition as it started its scientific work in the desert. This seemed to me to be a matter of considerable importance and I could not miss the opportunity of telling the Senate about the pleasure and interest that I had in being able to join those women at their camp at one of the bores not too far from Cooper Creek.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is very important that we celebrate and acknowledge the achievements of women in all fields of endeavour but particularly in the area of science where the work of women is so often overlooked. I have heard it said in this place and I certainly read in the newspaper very often that Australia has no women scientists. That is certainly not the case. I know from my own experience of very many capable women in the fields of all sorts of science. In particular on this occasion I want to talk about the women who have met to explore scientific questions about botany, aquatic botany, archaeology, anthropology, biology, geology and ecology, to name just a few of the areas of scientific investigation by the expedition in the Cooper Creek basin. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, that expedition is being led by Major Fran Conlyn. There are 44 women in all, a number of whom are senior and significant scientists from around Australia. A number of women joined the expedition as explorers; that is to say, they are not scientific experts necessarily but they will be assisting the scientists in their work. The women were aged from 22 years to 65 years. They possess a range of skills and talents in one place that will be of great benefit to the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the South Australian Museum, which are both sponsoring the work being done. We have to appreciate that the expedition is doing very significant and serious scientific work. </PARA>
<PARA> The other great benefit of our trip was that we were able to go and watch the headwaters of the Cooper Creek advancing down the dry river bed some two miles above the Birdsville Track. I believe that today or tomorrow the waters will be cutting the Birdsville Track in northern central South Australia. Senator Panizza corrected me in this place the last time I spoke about this matter. He said that the waters had already reached Lake Eyre. I am pleased to be able to tell Senator Panizza that that was not the case this time as I was there as the water was advancing down the dry creek bed and Lake Eyre has filled from the south lake and from local rains far more than it has from the waters of the Cooper Creek that have not yet reached Lake Eyre. </PARA>
<PARA> The mystery of the water and the whole flow of water in the Cooper Creek is still up for grabs. Nobody quite knows how it does happen. The rains that fell in the Channel Country in Queensland last Easter are now the waters that are flowing down through South Australia to Lake Eyre. Why that water continues to advance to Lake Eyre without either seeping into the ground or being lost by evaporation is still something of a scientific wonder, if not a mystery. It is quite interesting to watch the waters advance. They do not burst, gush or flood along; in fact, they are best described as creeping. It may be that the number of lakes, lagoons and side flows that the creek waters venture into does prevent a gush of water. It was again very interesting to watch this very slow creeping progress of water that once fell in Queensland and is now about to flow into Lake Eyre and benefit the wildlife, to say nothing of the local area, in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is also very interesting to note that the last time the waters crossed the Birdsville Track was in 1974. It is very significant that some 15 years later we have had sufficient rains in Queensland and central Australia for this event to happen again. It is quite a significant or momentous occasion for those of us who were there and able to appreciate the piece of history that we were watching. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to advise the Senate of the fact that the talents the women brought to this group were not only scientific. Amongst the group were women with artistic skills, so there is a painter and a drawer. There were also a number of women with musical skills, so it was very entertaining around the campfire at night. There were writers, lawyers and a photographer and of course the skills of logistics, organisation and administration that are so necessary to transport 44 women in at least six different directions, maintaining four-wheel drivers and Unimogs and all the necessary back-up equipment and, in particular, the provision of water that is so critical in the desert at any time, but certainly at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> We were able to enjoy the hospitality and support of the Oldfield family-Mary and Kevin in particular-who maintain the Mungeranie roadhouse on the Birdsville Track. A lovely sign outside says, `Last pub in South Australia'. That is presuming that one is going north on the Birdsville Track and heading towards Birdsville. Those people are also a back-up support for the Royal Flying Doctor Service. For those of us who had the opportunity to get out into rural and isolated Australia, I think that we can acknowledge the importance of the people maintaining the Flying Doctor Service and the back-up support-the people on the ground who see that facilities such as airfields are maintained as well as petrol supplies and other resources that might be needed in that area. Many of those people are unsung heroes and heroines in the maintenance of this great country. I certainly want to place on record their contribution. I appreciated very much meeting the Oldfields at their roadhouse. They had a very likely bunch of visitors while we were there, too, but I will not take the Senate's time describing all the visitors in detail. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, I congratulate Major Fran Conlyn and the other women who have gone to the bother of organising and carrying out this expedition on behalf of a serious scientific investigation that will benefit the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the South Australian Museum. As I said, it is important that we acknowledge the contribution of women as scientists in this country. It is very often overlooked and, if not overlooked, it is disregarded. We have had a wonderful group of scientists in Australia-inventors, designers and planners-many of whom have been women. The fact that they are written out of the history books or not celebrated sufficiently is no reason for that to continue to be the case. It is for those reasons that I am particularly pleased to have had the opportunity to have joined the expedition, albeit it very briefly, and to tell the Senate and place on record an acknowledgment of the achievements of women in science in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also very important to promote science and maths for girls in Australia. We have a special project, which was instituted by the Federal Labor Government and picked up by a number of State governments, to encourage girls to consider maths and science as alternatives to the career plans they might have thought of. We can encourage young girls to consider those fields of study by letting them know the sorts of exciting opportunities those fields can present, the exciting questions they can ask and the areas of investigation they can develop. For many reasons it is important that we recognise and acknowledge this all-women expedition into the desert and in particular that we celebrate their achievements. I will be looking forward to the report from the expedition. It will remind young women and girls that there are opportunities there for the taking in this splendid country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is well recognised in history that from the Great War of 1914-18 a certain Australian character was born that has influenced this nation ever since-a character of unconquerable determination in adversity and very deep loyalty towards those men and women who served in that war. Over 300,000 Australians served in that war, and as many as 55,000 died. They are remembered in Australia by the numerous shrines in our cities and country towns right across the nation. It is also significant to remember that next year we commemorate 75 years since Gallipoli. Notwithstanding the significant and unique place Gallipoli has in Australian history, we should forget the Australians who served in other campaigns of the Great War, in particular France, in such battles as Dernancourt, Villers Bretonneux and Hamel, and the defence of Amiens. At the third battle of Ypres, in France, over 10,000 Australians were killed and over 30,000 Australians were wounded-a number greater than was the case at Gallipoli. So great was Australia's contribution to the defence of France that to this very day our nation is remembered by the French as having saved their country. I made reference to this in my maiden speech in the old House, on 21 September 1987. I said then:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>If Australians should ever doubt the respect in which they are held in the world today, let them remember that in the east of France, in the quiet township of Amiens, one can enter a quiet and picturesque chapel dedicated to the Australian diggers who so gallantly defended their beliefs and fought for freedom not just for themselves but for all people in all places. </PARA>
<PARA>It has been brought to my attention that the magnificent cathedral, in which Australia is given a very special place, is in some disrepair. There is presently a restoration program under way, though it is very slow and probably insufficient. The chapel in this cathedral dedicated to Australians is also in some disrepair. The flag that proudly stands in the chapel was presented by the Australian Government, and it too needs replacing. I ask Senator Evans, who is in the chamber, to investigate the state of the flag with a view to providing a new flag to the French Government for that chapel, and perhaps to investigate also any other appropriate contribution towards the restoration of that memorial. It is important that every visitor to that chapel, and in particular Australian visitors, feel a sense of honour; after all, that is what every shrine of remembrance in this country asks of us-lest we forget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Dunn has been kind enough to show me the notes from which she was proposing to speak. The difficulty will be readily apparent. As I understand it, Senator Dunn wants to canvass questions that will be relevant to a committal and trial but she does not want to canvass any material which has not already been squarely within the public domain in current or former press reports or in some other way. There appears to me to be no new material in what she wants to talk about. Obviously, she wants to refer to some of the existing public material and to take the opportunity to comment upon it. That raises questions which ought to be the subject of some consideration, perhaps by the Clerk, overnight or tomorrow. Consideration should be given as to whether that raises sub judice questions quite as starkly. I still think that prima facie they are raised, but it is a matter that could properly be addressed by the Clerk in consultation with the President or you, Mr Acting Deputy President. A more considered response could be given after further time has been allowed to enable that point to be checked. I certainly would not wish to respond off the top of my head on a matter as sensitive and complex as that and I think that Senator Dunn ought to be given a further opportunity to consider it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I understand that Senator Evans has addressed himself to an important point, but we all have our important points to make. My purpose in speaking on the adjournment was to bring to the attention of Senator Evans the disrepair of the Australian flag in Amiens and to request that he address himself to that. I hoped that he would listen to my speech. This is the second time that I have got to my feet and Senator Evans is still distracted. I am simply trying on the adjournment to bring a very serious and bipartisan matter to his attention. Each time I try to do so he wanders off. I will send Senator Evans's office a copy of my adjournment speech tomorrow. I ask him to read it and to investigate the disrepair of the Australian flag in the chapel in Amiens.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) No. I understand that the Public Servant who made the allegations independently approached the AFP with information, including the audit report, obtained under FOI.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) In June 1987 when the Public Servant wrote to the Minister with general allegations.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The matter was referred to the Department and the Public Servant was interviewed in June 1987 by a senior Defence officer who then referred the matter to Management Audit for examination.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) No. The matter was examined as part of a wider ranging audit and, then separately, following discussion between the Public Servant and the Head of Management of Audit. The audit examination was based on normal audit practice and procedure. The result of the audit report did not indicate that fraud had occurred therefore it was not considered necessary that the matter should be referred to the Australian Federal Police. Although the Public Servant making the allegations has been asked to provide further evidence no further information has been received which would warrant the matter being referred to the AFP.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) I am advised the Department is unaware of any review undertaken in 1988 into potential fraud in Defence by the AFP or approach to the Department for any information or assistance which would support the conduct of such a review.</PARA>
<PARA> (f) Not applicable.</PARA>
<PARA> (g) When the Issue of AFP assistance to the Defence Department was first raised in September 1988 it was to support preparation of the defence fraud control plans. However, the AFP could not help in that regard. In June 1989 the Minister for Justice and I agreed the attachment of 2 officers to look at contract tendering processes. The AFP and the Defence Department are at present settling arrangements relating to the attachment.</PARA>
<PARA> (h) The two AFP officers will be attached to the Commercial Investigations and Review section of the General Investigations and Review Branch. Together with departmental investigators they will investigate alleged commercial frauds perpetrated on the department according to a program of investigations determined by the Inspector-General in consultation with the AFP.</PARA>
<PARA> (i) It is proposed that they commence on 1 October 1989.</PARA>
