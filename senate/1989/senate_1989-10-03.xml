<TITLE>Vietnam: End of War List</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The members of the Australian Armed Forces who served in the Vietnam war from 1962 to 1973 did so with distinction, valour and professionalism, upholding the traditions of the Armed Forces.</PARA>
<PARA> After World War 2 and the Korean War the Australian Government approved an End of War List of Gallantry Medals for individual acts of bravery that were not rewarded during wartime.</PARA>
<PARA> The Whitlam Government refused to approve such an End of War List at the end of the Vietnam War.</PARA>
<PARA> Your humble petitioners pray that the Federal Government reverse the decision of the Whitlam Government and thus approve an End of War List for the Australian Armed Forces personnel that served in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA> Upon the approval of the End of War List, the case of 2nd Lieutenant John Fraser, 3RAR be considered for the award of a posthumous military honour.</PARA>

<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>The Honourable the President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA> Medicare cannot pretend to be a Universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access to items 6469, 274 and 275 on the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners humbly pray and request that the Senate will vote against any attempt to restrict access to abortion or any abortion-related items on the Medicare schedule.</PARA>

<TITLE>Community Services and Health Legislation</TITLE>
<PARA>To the President and the members of the Senate. We the undersigned oppose changes to general medical practice contained in the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act. We believe there should not be two levels of Medicare rebates for general practice. We also believe there should be upgraded undergraduate training and postgraduate training for general practitioners to obtain appropriate skills. Current and proposed Medicare rebates for general practitioner services are inadequate, and there should be appropriate Medicare rebates for doctors who provide out of hours consultations.</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore we humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled will support general practitioners to achieve the above.</PARA>

<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you support the Broadcasting (Prohibition of Violent Programmes for Children) Act 1988 which has been presented by Western Australia Independent Senator for Nuclear Disarmament, Jo Vallentine. This act aims to prohibit the broadcasting of children's TV programmes that are violent and that promote toys modelled on characters, weapons or other war accessories which are also available for sale in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications aware that last Thursday a French registered Air Maritime Boeing 737 with French pilots operating a scheduled Sydney-Melbourne internal air service accepted a standard instrument departure via Wollongong from runway 16 at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport? Is it a fact that, instead of flying the correct route, the French crew turned right, thereby breaching lateral separation standards? Is the Minister aware that, despite urgent calls from an alert Sydney air traffic control, the pilots persisted with their error? What disciplinary action has been taken against these pilots? Not only could there have been a collision between two commercial airliners with great loss of life, but the accident could have occurred over southern suburban Sydney, possibly over a school, and even more lives could have been lost.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Justice. I refer to the article in the Age on Saturday about alleged unauthorised exchanges of confidential personal information amongst public servants in a variety of departments and agencies, including the Australian Customs Service, the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, the Australian Electoral Commission and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which it was said has been going on for 10 years. A further item in today's Age alleges that the exchange might also have included Department of Social Security information. Does it appear that the allegations in the articles are correct? What is being done to stop this disgraceful practice and to determine who has been responsible? Will the Government make it clear that public servants who consider indulging in such activities are not a law unto themselves and that their actions are strongly disapproved of?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe the very speedy and very forceful response by relevant Federal Government Ministers to the allegation of disclosures, made initially in the Age and, apparently, according to Senator Coates, again today, indicates that this Government disapproves in the strongest possible terms of the disclosure of confidential information, held by the Public Service on behalf of citizens, in a way which would lead those citizens to fear that the confidentiality and privacy of that information might be breached by those public servants who have an obligation to serve their interests and not abuse the trust reposed in them.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, Senator Peter Baume wishes to take the place of the Australian Federal Police and others in investigating this matter. It is true that allegations have been made. The way they have been put together by David Wilson suggests that, unfortunately, he is reporting matters of fact. I believe the matter needs to be investigated by the Australian Federal Police. That is being pursued vigorously, and has been since these matters were first brought to the notice of the Australian Federal Police.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also important to know that the Privacy Commissioner, Mr Kevin O'Connor, is aware of the matter. Of course, the Government will assist Mr O'Connor and facilitate any investigation that he considers appropriate. I believe he has announced that he will be auditing the key departments concerned with a view to ensuring that they have in place proper security safeguards to prevent these sorts of unauthorised disclosures. Those public servants who engage, or have in the past engaged, in these sorts of practices need to know not only that this Parliament is horrified at the thought that our explicit intentions, as contained in, for example, the Privacy Act, passed by this Parliament late last year, have been ignored, but also, in so far as the activity might amount to offences under the various Commonwealth statutes, that they will be pursued. Stringent penalties are in place for those who unlawfully disclose personal information-I believe imprisonment for up to two years, for example. I can assure Senator Coates that the Government is adamant that the Australian Federal Police and the Privacy Commissioner should pursue their various investigations with the full support of the Government. We look to the results of those investigations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier, yes. I was going to say that it is not the first time that there has been comment within the last week. Senator Alston has reminded me that there was, in fact, an editorial in the Australian Financial Review. I had forgotten that it was in the Australian Financial Review. Both the letter and the previous newspaper comment draw attention to what is a pretty outrageous rort. The letter demonstrates that the rort is most outrageous in Queensland, which would not particularly surprise anybody who is familiar with the history of government in Queensland, the principal objective of which is to cream a bit off every taxpayer and a bit more off the Federal Government and then deliver it to National Party cronies. But given that the taxi plates are said to be worth a quarter of a million dollars on the Gold Coast, and that that price by definition represents nothing more than capitalised economic rent-that is, the capitalised value of the excessive fares which taxis charge-I would have thought that Senator Stone, who is a person of some substance in the Queensland National Party, might have actually tried to do something about this. As far as I know, he has done absolutely nothing. The letter in today's Australian Financial Review is so good that I ought to quote a few paragraphs from it. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I add, of course, that if the Opposition's tax policy, due to be announced next week, recommits the Opposition to its silly proposal that people would not pay any capital gains tax after they have had an asset for five years, the people who pick up these licences will, after five years, be able to flog them off, make a quarter of a million dollars capital gain, and pay absolutely no tax on it, thereby further aggravating the rort. If I am wrong and Senator Stone has made some effort-he is, I would say, the most significant member of the Queensland National Party these days-to clean up this rort within the National Party of Queensland, I look forward to hear him explaining, by way of a personal explanation at the end of Question Time, what he has done. In the absence of such a personal explanation I must assume that Senator Stone has decided, as he once put it, to adopt the Nelsonian approach to this matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. I refer to reports yesterday of calls by three members of the Queensland Public Accounts Committee for the sacking of the Minister for Land Management, Mr Harper, over his administration of drought relief funds. Was the decision of the Commonwealth Government to remove the eligibility of drought relief for funding under the national disaster relief arrangements related to Mr Harper's mismanagement?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1584" SPEAKER="Walsh Sen The Hon P.A." NAMEID="TJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the last part of the question, the decision taken by Cabinet and announced in the April statement, on my recommendation, that drought relief be removed from the national disaster relief arrangements program was made partly because of the maladministration by Mr Harper, but maladministration of this program in Queensland goes back before Mr Harper's time to the period when Mr Neil Turner was the Minister for Primary Industries. Indeed, it was during Mr Turner's stewardship that the first example of gross abuse of this program was brought to my attention. That was back in 1986, when a Mr Behan-no relation, I believe, to Senator Beahan-who was a north Queensland National Party apparatchik, the north Queensland organiser I think, received a $150,000 loan at about 4 per cent interest when the property which he then owned did not meet the requirements. The $150,000 loan was described by Mr Turner, I think it was-although it may have been Mr Menzel, a National Party MLA-as a lousy loan. To people who are used to picking up brown paper bags with $50,000 and $100,000 in them, a $150,000 loan might not seem to be very much, but $150,000 to most Australians, especially at 4 per cent interest, seems to be a very major concession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The maladministration has, of course, continued under Mr Harper and was focused very effectively in a report written, as we now know, by a Queensland Department of Primary Industries public servant called Mr Dan Daly which was leaked about December of last year, tabled in the Senate, and I think also tabled in the House of Representatives by Mr Kerin. That report showed that some areas of Queensland had been drought declared for more than half of the last 25 years, that some individual owners had been paid more than $300,000 in one year, and so on. The Queensland Public Accounts Committee investigated this report and Mr Daly's subsequent transfer and demotion within the Department. This Public Accounts Committee report was the subject of a news item in the Courier-Mail on 28 September. I will just quote a couple of sentences from the Courier-Mail report:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Daly was exonerated in the committee's report.</PARA>
<PARA>. . . .</PARA>
<PARA> The committee said Mr Daly had been moved from his job as head of the drought section secretariat without justification.</PARA>
<PARA>It also said:</PARA>
<PARA> `In the course of its inquiry, the committee has . . . substantially confirmed the concerns expressed by Mr Daly in his December 1988 memo.</PARA>
<PARA> `The committee believes that his arbitrary removal from the position of Officer in Charge, Drought Secretariat, was not justified.'</PARA>
<PARA>The final point I want to make is that one would have thought that somebody like Mr Harper, having been caught red-handed mal- administering public money to the extent that he has, would have had the decency to keep his head down for a while. But he was quoted in last week's Bulletin as saying that the Federal Government ought to be providing squillions of extra Commonwealth dollars in order to build more water storages along the east coast of Australia and particularly, of course, the north-eastern coast of Australia-the Queensland coast-so that the National Party could hand out water licences to more of its cronies who happen to hold land in the potentially irrigable areas. This, of course, is another way of generating economic rent with the expenditure of Federal taxpayers' funds and then transferring it to the pockets of National Party apparatchikis in north Queensland. It is similar, of course, to the system which prevails on the Gold Coast, in the southern part of Queensland, for transferring money from people who hire taxis to the pockets of those who are issued the plates.</PARA>

These side effects were given prominence first during 1979 in newspaper reports of occurrences in the Netherlands. Since then there have been occasional reports in the scientific press and in the lay press. Halcion has been marketed in Australia since 28 August this year. No generic equivalents are available. Approval to market Halcion followed a careful and lengthy consideration by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee of the Netherlands' experience and of all data to 1987. The bizarre side effects were of low frequency and not remarkably different from those known to occur with other sleeping drafts of the related benzodiazepine group. To reduce potential over-dosage which might increase the possibility of side effects, only the lowest strength tablet containing 0.125 milligrams was approved. Also the recommended initial dose in Australia is half of that in the United States of America. The Australian product information specifically warns prescribers about the possibility of the occurrence of amnesia and of paradoxical reactions, including hallucinations and acute psychotic behaviour. The Australian Drug Evaluation Committee maintains surveillance of the drug through the adverse reactions reporting scheme.

The journalist who wrote this account did not purport to have seen the plan but had interviewed one of its authors. The statement about the melt-through is not presented in this account as part of the plan but as the view of an interviewee, a former shift supervisor in the radiological control section at Pearl Harbour naval base.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot answer all the detail of the question, but let me say that the airlines have indicated that 17,000 seats nationwide are available at present, which compares with, I think, a figure of about 30,000 when the airlines are fully operative. This capacity is being made available by using company, RAAF and leased aircraft, as well as international carriers. Australian Airlines, for example, expects substantially to increase capacity this week using its own and leased aircraft. It has indicated that two Boeing 727s, a Boeing 737 and an Airbus from its own fleet, and up to five leased aircraft, will be in service by the end of the week. Australian Airlines has indicated that it will shortly release details of a firm network schedule to operate from 9 October, when the airline expects that the pooled capacity would be about 20,00 seats, which the airlines claim is well over 60 per cent of the average number of seats normally available.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that Senator Haines again purports to be on the side of the little person. I remind the Senate that in 1984, I believe it was, Senator Haines voted in the Senate to allow crooks like the Kelly brothers, who had been running cherry-picker schemes-fraudulent so-called superannuation schemes-to keep their ill-gotten gains, that is, to claim their payments into these fraudulent so-called superannuation schemes as a deduction from taxable income, but to then pick up all the money themselves because they made sure that none of the employees ever qualified for it. So this defence of the little person should always be seen against that sort of background.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been asked why the Government made this arrangement for the banks and not for other financial institutions. It is for the very good reason that what used to be called the statutory reserve deposits (SRDs), which are now called non-callable deposits (NCDs), apply only to trading banks. They have never applied to building societies or other financial institutions. The penalty of imposing on trading banks a non-prudential requirement was that they were directed by law to pay a certain amount-of their deposits in the days of the SRDs; and of their total liabilities in these days of non-callable deposits-into an account with the Reserve Bank on which a rate of interest very much below market rates was paid. That SRD and now NCD provision has never applied to those other financial institutions. It does impose a financial penalty on the trading banks, and I think many people would argue, and I would agree, that it is reasonable that some penalty or, more accurately, licence fee should be applied to the trading banks. The only thing that is arguable, in my view, is the size of that licence fee.</PARA>
<PARA> At the time that the old statutory reserve deposits system-which I think had applied in one form or another since 1945-was changed, banks were required to lodge with the Reserve Bank 7 per cent of their deposits. We changed that, I think it was in 1988, so that over a period of time banks would be required to lodge in an account with the Reserve Bank an amount-it was phased in over three years-equal to one per cent of their total liabilities. Banks had devised ways of holding what were de facto deposits in forms other than those which were defined as deposits for these SRD purposes. At that time the trading banks were paid 5 per cent interest on the money in that compulsory account and the Treasury note rate was around 10 per cent. In other words, the differential between the two rates was 5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the announcement made by the Treasurer last week, the differential rate will be 5 per cent and that will be adjusted every month in accordance with the Treasury note interest rate prevailing for that month in order to maintain a margin of 5 per cent between the money which the trading banks are required to deposit in those accounts with the Reserve Bank and the T-note rate of interest-the de facto licence fee. In other words, the judgment that the Government made back in 1988, as to the size of the de facto licence fee which the banks ought to be required to pay, has been confirmed in the newest arrangements. In the period between the original announcement and today, through what one might call a side effect of the general increase in interest rates, the banks have been required to pay a very much higher de facto licence fee-that is, the difference between the 5 per cent paid by the Reserve Bank on those deposits with the Reserve Bank from the trading banks and the prevailing T-note interest rate.</PARA>
<PARA> If anybody wants to criticise the Government for this decision I think she would be on sounder ground if she criticised the Government for not having made, in the first place, a decision that there would be a 5 per cent margin so that the size of the licence fee would remain constant or, alternatively, for not having adjusted the interest rate paid on these deposits by the Reserve Bank somewhat earlier than we did.</PARA>

I do know that if the other half of Senator Haines's populist economic policy was to be implemented, that is, the wish list of goodies for Christmas, the $10 billion worth of goodies to hand out around Christmas time like Santa Claus, every PAYE taxpayer in Australia would have to pay 20 per cent more tax than is now the case.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, at Question Time on Friday, 29 September, Senator Lewis asked me a question about the book bounty. Senator Lewis, as was his last week's form, inserted the word `unlawful' into his question. He asked about the unlawful payment of the book bounty. The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows: section 5 (8) (a) was not inserted into the Bounty (Books) Act 1986 until 11 May 1988 and applies only to publications completed after that date. Under the provisions of the Act prior to this amendment Government instrumentalities were eligible for bounty payments. Consequently, the 12 Government instrumentalities that received bounty in 1987-88 were all eligible to receive bounty payments. Under the Act claimants have a period of 12 months from the completion of the publication to lodge a claim for bounty. Consequently, payments made in 1988-89 may relate to publications completed prior to amendments to the Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the case of the Australian Postal Commission, which was the specific example which Senator Lewis cited, production of its publication was completed on 21 December 1987 and a claim lodged within the 12 months on 18 July 1988. Payment of bounty was approved on 26 August 1988. It would be envisaged that the other 10 instrumentalities referred to in Senator Lewis's question would fall into a similar situation but without details of the organisations involved this cannot be checked. If Senator Lewis wants to provide me with the details of those other organisations which he referred to in globo in the question, I will have each one of them checked out, but I believe they would fall into exactly the same category as the Australian Postal Commission.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The actions of Defence Minister Beazley in calling on the Australian Defence Force to deal with the situation at Nurrungar over the weekend-that is, the use of Australian troops against Australian citizens on Australian soil in defence of a United States military base which ties Australia into the nuclear war fighting strategies of the United States Government-are indeed a matter of public importance. If, as Mr Beazley claimed on radio this morning, everyone knows what goes on at Nurrungar, the limited knowledge we have came not from the Australian Government but from Dr Des Ball of the Australian National University. At the time when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) opened up and told us what Dr Ball had already revealed-that is, that Nurrungar would give the earliest warning of an intercontinental ballistic missile attack on the United States of America (USA) or its allies-the role of Nurrungar was scheduled to be made redundant by the Navstar satellites which detect the same information and have the capability to send it directly or via another satellite to the USA.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is very strange then that the Americans are actually in the process of upgrading the capability of the base the function and location of which are now no longer necessary. Can it be, Mr President, as my colleague Senator Haines has suggested, that the most important function of Nurrungar from an Australian point of view is to give us early warning of an attack on Nurrungar and the other Australian nuclear targets which have American flags flying?</PARA>
<PARA> If that is not the whole truth, will the Government please tell us something more convincing than that which the Prime Minister has told us or else, for goodness sake, let us get rid of that deadly base for, to return to the most reliable authority we have, Dr Des Ball, Nurrungar has a war-fighting capacity and is, in fact, an essential element in the Star Wars program, known as SDI or strategic defence initiative. That, of course, is denied by the Minister of Defence, but there is nothing new about it. We all know that the American people are told much more about these matters than the Australian people. What better reason could anyone think of for wanting to see Nurrungar closed? If the Government will not act to close it, the people are left only with the option of doing something about it themselves. That is basically why some 500 people made the trip to Nurrungar last weekend and that is why Minister Beazley went into a panic and called in the troops-indeed, the cavalry. </PARA>
<PARA> It is intrinsic in basic human rights in a democratic society that we have the right to protest against activities, whether they be government, bureaucratic, corporate or other, and this right was used with great effect by some 500 Australians last week at Nurrungar. The main aim of the protest was to inform Australian citizens about the existence and the function of the so-called joint Australian-US base at Nurrungar and this was achieved. Nurrungar is not listed on the map. In fact, it is designated as a prohibited area. We need only to look at some of the press which emerged as a result of last week's protest. I refer to the Daily Telegraph of Monday, 2 October, which states in an article headed `Watching in secret':</PARA>
<PARA> The joint Australian-American bases at Nurrungar, Pine Gap and North-West Cape represent our gravest nuclear threat-yet we know virtually nothing about them. </PARA>
<PARA> They are surrounded by heavy security-</PARA>
<PARA>not so heavy, we think now-</PARA>
<PARA>and a shroud of official silence. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, until this weekend's skirmishes at Nurrungar, in which 492 arrests were made, it's fair bet most Australians had never heard of the installation.</PARA>
<PARA> But the Joint Defence Space Communications Centre 500 km north-west of Adelaide is a vital link in America's nuclear strategy. </PARA>
<PARA>Later the article states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is left to academics such as Andrew Mack, head of the Australian National University's Peace Research Centre, to fill in the gaps. </PARA>
<PARA>That is in the knowledge. I continue:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Mack is adamant that Nurrungar and Pine Gap, in particular, present important nuclear targets, such as to the Soviets. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>`Basically, Nurrungar is very easy to destroy if the Soviet Union launched a nuclear attack. </PARA>
<PARA> `Because of this, the United States has developed an alternative system. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for these reasons both the anti-nuclear movement and academics such as Mr Mack want the governments to come clean about the bases and our involvement with them. `We must know more,' Mr Mack said. </PARA>
<PARA>What exactly is Nurrungar? We read in the Asian Defence Journal of January 1987:</PARA>
<PARA> The US bases in Australia are not of the type that require the presence of thousands of soldiers, squadrons of aircraft, and carrier task forces. Its bases in Australia have only a few hundred personnel and are protected by a small force of security personnel. At first glance they would seem inconsequential. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet they are not. It is freely acknowledged in Australia, and by the USA and the USSR, that the US bases in Australia are prime nuclear targets. </PARA>
<PARA>And further on in the same article:</PARA>
<PARA> If Pine Gap is a secret US base, then the United States Air Force base at Nurrungar, SA-</PARA>
<PARA>note the words `the United States Air Force base at Nurrungar'-</PARA>
<PARA>is a super-secret base. Nurrungar in its early days of development, however, had the advantage that it was located within an area which had already been restricted for security reasons. . . . The rocket range had two advantages as far as security was concerned-it was remote and it was an area in which developments could take place under the guise of further `top secret' rocket tests. The Nurrungar base was begun in 1970 and became operational in 1971. </PARA>
<PARA>Later in the same article:</PARA>
<PARA> Nurrungar is run by the United States Space Command. The facility has connections with the NSA via the USAF Security Service. There are also some Royal Australian Air Force personnel attached, although it has been suggested, like the employment of some Australians at Pine Gap, that this is purely for `cosmetic purposes' to allow the base to appear as a joint US-Australian facility. It is unlikely that Australian personnel play any major function at Pine Gap or Nurrungar. </PARA>
<PARA>(Quorum formed) I guess that the coalition Opposition does not like what I am saying as it has called a quorum. I again quote from the Asian Defence Journal:</PARA>
<PARA>As a consequence Nurrungar is a crucial element in United States' security. Since 1983 Nurrungar has been included in the US Strategic Defence Initiative (`Starwars') programme. This is, of course, despite the fact that the present Australian government is opposed to `Starwars' and has refused to allow Australian facilities to be used in this programme. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IH4">Senator JENKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it says it is. The Hawke Government has only twice made official statements in Parliament on the role of the United States bases in Australia. On June 6 1984 Mr Hawke claimed that `the removal of the joint facilities . . . would damage the capacity of the United States for monitoring and verification, so striking a very serious blow at the prospect of arms control agreements between the superpowers'. On 22 November 1988, Mr Hawke once again described the bases as important for verification and claimed that `verification was the key issue in reaching the INF (Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces) agreement last year, and verification will be the key to any START (Strategic Arms Reduction Talks) agreements in the future'. These claims were made despite the findings of a major report by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence in Federal Parliament in 1986 entitled Disarmament and Arms Control in the Nuclear Age, that the base's role in nuclear verification had been used to deflect attention from the more offensive functions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the protest over the last week, the people who attended chose to protest peacefully. By consensus the decision was made that no-one would resist arrest. These forms of peaceful protest-that is, forms of civil disobedience-are used all over the world. They were used by the Polish people in the Solidarity protests; by the Hungarians and the Czechs in their protests against Soviet Union domination; by people in the United States, Australia and other countries over the Vietnam war; and by Australian citizens who chose to protest against the Australia Card. The protesters believed that the base at Nurrungar should be closed because it is a nuclear target; it fails to acknowledge Aboriginal land rights claims; it is a nuclear war fighting base; it is a Star Wars base; it costs the Australian taxpayer at least $30m per annum to maintain; it does not contribute to arms control verification at all; and it infringes on our national sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the chain of events over the week is concerned, the protesters were stunned by the ease with which they were able to penetrate security at the base. One protester who entered the radome said:</PARA>
<PARA>I was expecting to be apprehended well before getting near the base but there appeared to be no security around. I was able to climb the fence and enter an open door into the radomes before being discovered. </PARA>
<PARA>Other protesters said they had to shout and sing to draw attention to their presence in the base in order to get arrested. Completely unfounded allegations have been made that the protesters acted violently and attacked a police horse with stones. Media coverage of the event would clearly have shown that such behaviour was impossible. The protesters were committed to non-violent direct action; indeed, they stayed true to that. I believe that the allegations that the protesters had behaved violently were made simply as a ploy to divert attention from the purpose of the protesters. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes. It is the policy of the Government and the Army that, where qualified and suitable Army Reserve officers are available, they will be preferred over available Regular officers for senior Reserve appointments, including command. The qualifications of Reserve officers are determined, in the first instance, by their Commanders at each level who report upon them annually. The Army Reserve Appointment and Promotion Advisory Committee also meets annually and makes recommendations to the Chief of the General Staff. Senior Reserve officers who make a direct contribution to that Committee are the Assistant Chief of the General Staff-Army Reserve and the Commanders of the 2nd and 3rd Divisions. Land Commander Australia, the General Officer Commanding Logistic and Training Command, the Commander of the 1st Division and the Military District commanders throughout Australia frequently consult their respective senior Reserve officers when appointments are being considered.</PARA>

<PARA> (4) Although not reflected in the Minutes specifically, the Army Reserve Appointment and Promotion Advisory Committee kept under review all Senior Army Reserve appointments and did, as a matter of course, deliberate on these changes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Brigadier Fraser did resign his commission. He also applied for transfer to the Inactive Army Reserve on the same day. He subsequently withdrew his resignation, of his own volition, in a letter to Commander 2nd Division dated 31 May 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Commander 2nd Division.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) He was advised by the Commander 2nd Division and reasons were given.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Orally in the first instance and subsequently in writing.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Brigadier Fraser had already commanded the brigade for two and a half years. It was considered that a change in command would benefit the brigade. As no suitable Reserve officer would be available for at least two years, and the December/January period is the normal posting time for Regular officers, it followed that Brigadier Fraser should relinquish his appointment at the end of the year.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Brigadier Fraser was advised formally by Commander 2nd Division on 2 December 1988 and informally on two previous occasions that, because he had already commanded 5 Brigade for a considerable time, it was appropriate that his appointment should cease in December 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The Chief of the General Staff.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) No. The procedure described in 1171 (3) the answer to Parliamentary Question 1171 (3) was adopted.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) Colonel Tait was told of his appointment by Commander 2nd Division in mid-September 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) Brigadier Fraser was not persuaded to withdraw his resignation but did so of his own volition.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) No firm proposal was made to Brigadier Fraser although some discussion on employment took place between him and Commander 2nd Division before Fraser submitted his resignation.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) No specific employment has been offered to Brigadier Fraser. He is currently allotted to the Inactive Reserve.</PARA>
<PARA> (13) In common with other officers on the Inactive Army Reserve, Brigadier Fraser will be considered for any positions which arise and for which he is considered suitable. He has not been, and will not be, subject to special treatment.</PARA>

<PARA> How can the Government and the Army reconcile the replacement of Army Reserve senior officers with regular officers with its stated policy of having `Regard to the principle of Army Reserve preferment'.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Army is a total force which relies for its success upon integration of the two components, that is Regular and Reserve, being used as a single asset. The decision to appoint two Regular Officers to command Reserve brigades does not violate the principle of Reserve preferment. At the time no suitable Reserve officers were available to command the brigades in question. A number of Reserve officers are presently being groomed for the appointment, and it is expected that both brigades will be commanded by Reserve officers at the end of 1990. Regular officers will only be used where no suitable Reservist exists.</PARA>

<PARA> (5) The report resulting from this survey is classified commercial-in-confidence and therefore cannot be made available.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) There were no computer printouts arising from this survey.</PARA>
<PARA> Answers on the second of the surveys are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) In June 1989 survey work associated with the Australian Workplace Industrial Relations Survey (AWIRS) (see Note 2 below) was commissioned and is still currently being conducted. The successful agency is required to undertake the field and data processing work involved in the AWIRS.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The cost of this survey work is $749,825 and was awarded to AGB: McNair.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Market research was commissioned in October 1988 on an occupational back pain communication campaign as part of the development of a resource kit on back pain prevention for workplaces.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The cost of this research was $21,000 and was awarded to Australian Market Research Pty Ltd through the Australian Government Advertising Service.</PARA>
<PARA> Competitive tenders were called for and 2 tenders were received. The name of the unsuccessful agency and their tender price will not be provided for reasons of commercial confidence.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The nature of this market research did not require a sample size being determined.</PARA>

<PARA> NOTE 2-The Government decided in 1988 that DIR should conduct an Australian Workplace Industrial Relations Survey (AWIRS) in response to the increasing focus on industrial relations and labour market developments at the workplace. The data generated by the survey, which are expected to be available late in 1990, will assist in the monitoring and development of policy and practices in these areas by employers, unions and governments.</PARA>
