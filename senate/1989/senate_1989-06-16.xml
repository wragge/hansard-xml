<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I served in the House of Representatives with Ray Sherry, who was the Labor member for Franklin in Tasmania from 1969 to 1975. He won Franklin for the Australian Labor Party as part of the swag of seats that we won in the 1969 election. I was shocked to hear of his death not only because he was relatively young but also because only a couple of weeks ago I saw him and his wife, Dorothy, at the ALP State Council meeting in Hobart. That was the first time I had seen them for some years. It is especially sad for his family that he did not live to see his son, Nick Sherry, take his place in this chamber, but he saw him endorsed on the Labor Senate team at that recent State Council meeting. I express my condolences to Ray Sherry's surviving family, Dorothy, Nick and Chris.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TITLE>Interest Rates</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Hawke-Keating government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many Australians out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families.</PARA>

<PARA> The members of the Australian Armed Forces who served in Vietnam from 1962 to 1973 did so with distinction, valour and professionalism, upholding the traditions of the Armed Forces.</PARA>
<PARA> After World War 2 and the Korean War the Australian Government approved an End of War List of Gallantry Medals for individual acts of bravery that were not rewarded during wartime.</PARA>

<TITLE>Health Insurance</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Senate assembled in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate that the Government is about to introduce into the Senate, legislation changing health insurance. These changes will increase the cost of health insurance to members of employee based funds and will do nothing to help the elderly, as is being claimed. Big public funds will increase their surpluses by taking money from more efficient funds. People will be forced back onto Medicare, which will not help to maintain private health insurance.</PARA>

<PARA> The Federal Government's plans to divert aircraft from Mascot to Bankstown and/or increase landing charges for peak periods will do little to relieve congestion and will place enormous financial and other burdens on commuter airlines and their passengers.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate, Assembled in the Australian Parliament. The petition of certain caring citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate, the passing from the Federal Government of the responsibility for funding the National Family Support program to the State Governments during the last Premiers' Conference.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore ask that the Senate cause the Government to reverse this decision and retain the tied funding to the States and Territories for the Family Support Program, within the National Family Support program guidelines. This will provide equitable funding Nationally and preclude potential for the availability of family support to vary between states, thus increasing the chances of achieving the Prime Minister's desire to provide all Australian children a life without poverty.</PARA>

<PARA> (b) notes that Senator Morris' preselection has caused great concern within the Labor Party, as is evident from a letter dated 8 June 1989 to members of the Administrative Committee of the ALP from Mr Tim Robertson, Chairman of the NSW Council of Civil Liberties, which says `. . . he has given nothing to the Parliament and as little as he can get away with to his party.

<PARA> (ii) this action has been condemned by the US Government as a further example of UNFPA's support for population control programmes involving the violation of human rights including coercive abortions and involuntary sterilisations,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) in August 1985 the US Congress enacted legislation which prohibits US contributions to any organisation which supports or participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilisation,</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) in September 1985, USAID issued an official declaration that UNFPA participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion and involuntary sterilisation in the People's Republic of China,</PARA>
<PARA> (v) the US withdrew all support for UNFPA, has regularly monitored its activities and has refused to resume support because there are `no significant changes either in the nature of the China population program of in UNFPA's assistance to China which would warrant resuming support for UNFPA',</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) in December 1988, in response to assurances sought by members of the AIDAB sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, that UNFPA had not funded programs which involved coercive practices, Dr Nafis Sadik advised that ``a review conducted by USAID had found that UNFPA had not been involved in coercion''. Dr Sadik failed to advise that this March 1985 USAID release was careful to note that the review had not included audits of UNFPA accounts or site visits of UNFPA field activities and failed to advise the Committee that by September 1985 USAID itself had rejected the statement in that review relied upon by Dr Sadik; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) calls on the Australian Government to immediately cease allocating aid money to UNFPA which, despite its lip service to high sounding principles, continues to be involved with the population control program of the government of the PRC which is responsible for gross and continuing violations of human rights and repeatedly holds the PRC's population control programme up as a model for developing countries to emulate.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>INQUIRY INTO ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL ECONOMIC COOPERATION</PARA>
<PARA>TERMS OF REFERENCE</PARA>
<PARA>The concept of Asia-Pacific regional economic cooperation and its application in a way that would best serve the interests of Australia and the region, including</PARA>
<PARA>(A) objectives and goals;</PARA>
<PARA>(B) framework, form and level of cooperation, including the need for a formal regional arrangement;</PARA>
<PARA>(C) suitable support mechanisms;</PARA>
<PARA>(D) Australia's part in any regional economic arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA>REASONS FOR THE REFERENCE</PARA>
<PARA>Regional economic cooperation is increasingly recognised by the countries of the Asia-Pacific region as a desirable course of action for the following reasons:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Increasing economic significance of the Asia-Pacific region and in intra-regional trade. East Asia and Pacific trade is now growing more rapidly than world trade. If this trend continues, intra-regional trade will take over from exports to the US and Europe as the major force behind the region's growth. </PARA>
<PARA> Any arrangement that recognises regional interests or results in increased regional cooperation or coordination would be desirable. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Increasing recognition that regional cooperation or coordination could usefully aim at:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Giving the countries of the region a collective voice in world economic fora;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Lobbying or countering in some way the protectionist policies of trade blocs eg EC or US-Canada;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Protecting the economies of member countries in the event attempts to liberalize world trade failed;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Providing a forum to discuss barriers to trade and to improve trade liberalization within the region. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) The resolution or likely resolution of some regional conflicts eg Cambodia-Vietnam, Vietnam-PRC, PRC-USSR, India-Pakistan, Afghanistan. Although long-standing political and economic rivalries are still present, the climate is now more favourable for the consideration of greater regional cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) Increasing needs for collective positions to be taken by countries in the Asia-Pacific region eg towards the formation of new economic and trading arrangements and relations like the EC's Single Economic Market. </PARA>
<PARA> By 1992 the European nations would have removed all physical, technical and fiscal barriers within Europe. The trade consequences of this to Australia are presently unclear. </PARA>
<PARA> (e) The need for more frequent and regular exchanges of information and views. </PARA>
<PARA> (f) The need for coordination of aid efforts to the region. </PARA>
<PARA>The benefits that accrue from greater regional economic cooperation are generally recognised. The problem lies in the implementation of the concept and on working out the type of organisation and relationships that would be best suited to advance regional cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA>A MULTITUDE OF PROPOSALS</PARA>
<PARA> Proposals for closer economic relations in the Asia-Pacific region have been discussed for at least 25 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The common strand in the various proposals is that they recognise that, despite great diversity of culture, language, history and political forms, there is an identifiable Asia-Pacific region or community made up of countries which are increasingly economically interdependent and which share considerable identity of interests. </PARA>
<PARA> The initiatives recognise also that no Governmental institution presently exists that recognises the importance of the region as a whole or helps to manage relations between Asia-Pacific countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Japanese proposals</PARA>
<PARA>One of the earliest significant initiative came in December 1978 when Japanese Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira set up an advisory body of academics and government officials. In its interim report in November 1979 the group recommended that a Pacific community be formed. The idea was endorsed in principle by then Australian Foreign Minister Andrew Peacock. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal was repeated in January 1980 during the visit to Australia by the Japanese Prime Minister Mr Ohira for talks with Prime Minister Fraser and Mr Peacock. </PARA>
<PARA> The two Prime Ministers agreed to convene a seminar to survey interest in the Pacific Community idea and discuss steps towards its development. The seminar was subsequently convened in Canberra in September 1980 as the first of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference (PECC) meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> The concept of Asia-Pacific regional economic cooperation was proposed again by former Japanese Prime Minister Nakasone in March 1988 in a speech in San Francisco. Nakasone suggested that the organisation be called the ``Pacific Forum for Economic and Cultural Cooperation''. He also called for a push for trade cooperation which he called the ``Pacific Initiative'' and called for coordination of aid to South-East Asia by the US and Japan. </PARA>
<PARA> On 28 January 1989 the Australian and Japanese representatives to the Australia-Japan Ministerial Conference agreed that officials from the Japanese Ministry for International Trade and Industry (MITI) would put to the governments of the Asian countries the Japanese suggestion for a meeting of industry ministers from about 10 Asia-Pacific countries to discuss and respond to the emergence of trading blocs in Europe and North America. </PARA>
<PARA> The Japanese still support the MITI proposal, which is for an active, ambitious programme at the political level that would shape Asia-Pacific economic affairs. In fact, MITI officials toured several Asian countries in March 1989 to sound out ASEAN leaders on a proposed trade ministers conference to be held in Tokyo comprising ministers from Japan, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, China, and some Pacific countries. </PARA>
<PARA>United States proposals</PARA>
<PARA> At the meeting of ASEAN Foreign Ministers in Bangkok in 1988, then US Secretary of State George Shultz proposed a tentative arrangement for expanded and institutionalised cooperation between the countries of the Pacific Rim in much the same way as similar organisations in Europe eg EC or NATO. </PARA>
<PARA> A similar arrangement was proposed by Secretary of State James Baker early in the Bush administration. </PARA>
<PARA> Neither Shultz nor Baker spelt out what Washington had in mind. Shultz's original feelers were later played down by American officials who suggested only that there be a consultative body linking the Pacific Rim Countries, which would be achieved by linkage on a permanent basis between ASEAN and the South Pacific Forum. </PARA>
<PARA> In December 1988, US Democrat Senator Bill Bradley proposed a new Pacific grouping to be called PAC-8 which would comprise the US, Japan, Canada, Australia, Korea, Mexico, Indonesia and Thailand. </PARA>
<PARA>Coalition proposals</PARA>
<PARA> In October 1983, Malcolm Fraser spoke of the desirability of closer identity between the community of nations in the Pacific. Asked what kind of government framework was most likely to be accepted and to be successful, he said,</PARA>
<PARA> ``At this stage we need a framework that would not commit governments to directions that they might find unwelcome but which would enable them, however, to join in a closer relationship with each other. I would suggest a development towards something like the OECD . . .''</PARA>
<PARA> The present Coalition position is contained in the Foreign Affairs Policy:</PARA>
<PARA>``A Liberal/National Government will call on governments in the Pacific Basin region to form a working party to examine this proposal. It should be given a broad charter to examine within strict time limits the economic and political issues a Pacific basin community poses, options for its framework, and the likely economic effects of such a community on member states and the world.''</PARA>
<PARA> On 9 May 1989 Andrew Peacock confirmed that a coalition government would like to see Australia play a more effective role in regional cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA> Former Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Professor Stuart Harris, commented on 16 March 1989 that any permanent institution trying to emulate the OECD would only enhance US and Japanese dominance. Australia, he thought, should work towards supporting a strengthening of PECC which has as its members most of the countries that are likely to be part of the Asia-Pacific grouping: the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, the Pacific island nations and the six ASEAN countries. </PARA>
<PARA> PECC also contains well established institutional foundations through its various standing committees and task forces. Professor Harris argues that the enlargement of PECC `would not only be a less expensive but a more effective way to go given the region's characteristics'. </PARA>
<PARA>Why past proposals were unsuccessful</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Suggestions by the Japanese and the Americans have been unsuccessful because of suspicion by countries in the region of any organisation funded, staffed or otherwise dominated by either of the dominant economic proposals of Japan or the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Wide disparity in the degree of economic development in the region has made it difficult to formulate cohesive regional policies. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Continuing political tensions within the region, including the question of Taiwan's and Hong Kong's relationship with China. </PARA>
<PARA>HAWKE PROPOSAL</PARA>
<PARA> On 31 January 1989, Prime Minister Hawke outlined in Seoul a proposal for a formal, inter-governmental vehicle of regional cooperation. The model would be provided by OECD. The proposal was put as if it was a new initiative and has since been pursued as such. </PARA>
<PARA> Hawke outlined three areas in which such cooperation could benefit the countries of the region:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) It could help improve the chances of success in the multilateral trade negotiations by having a larger group of countries pushing for trade liberalization;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) It would provide a forum to discuss openly obstacles to trade within the region; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) It could identify the broad economic interests the countries had in common. </PARA>
<PARA> However, he left no doubt that if the worst happened to world trade negotiations the Pacific OECD could provide the `building blocks' for a regional effort to protect the economies of its member countries. This move towards becoming a fortified trade bloc would in the Prime Minister's words be a `hypothetical, fall-back, worst case situation'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's proposal may have been prompted by:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The setbacks at GATT at the time. The December round at Montreal having ended in disappointment, the Government was determined to organise regionally in the event of a total breakdown of the multilateral trading system. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. The desire to have something on his trip to Asia that makes the headlines as a significant new initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor Lester Thurow's comments at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on 30 January 1989 that `GATT is dead'. </PARA>
<PARA> Alternatively it may be-as some journalists accompanying the Prime Minister on his January trip have indicated to be the case-that the idea had been conceived on the VIP aircraft en route to Seoul with no real forethought. </PARA>
<PARA> This thesis is supported by the fact that for at least a month after the proposal was made, departmental officers were not clear about what exactly the Prime Minister's proposal involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then, there have been further indications that the proposal may have been made in haste and that the Hawke Government may have annoyed some of our regional partners by springing it on them. </PARA>
<PARA> That the concept had not been considered thoroughly was admitted by Senator Evans on 17 March when he commented rather ruefully, upon the rebuke by the US, `. . . one of the consequences of taking initiatives is that sometimes it's an idea you're talking about rather than a fully worked-out proposition'.</PARA>
<PARA>PROBLEMS</PARA>
<PARA>Apprehension &amp; Suspicion</PARA>
<PARA> There appears to be continuing apprehension and suspicion on the part of some countries consulted, about Australia's part in the arrangement and of the actual arrangements. Indeed, it was said that Secretary of State James Baker was rather miffed because he had been considering such a plan himself. </PARA>
<PARA> Hawke simply picked up the ball and ran off with it as if it was his own. </PARA>
<PARA> One feels sure that the Japanese, who had been the amongst the earliest supporters, would have felt similarly insulted, although it would have been uncharacteristic of them to have expressed displeasure. </PARA>
<PARA> On 9 February after the US had expressed fear that the Australian proposal was moving towards an Asia-Pacific trading bloc the Minister for Trade Negotiations Mr Duffy had to state that the Prime Minister's call would not undermine Australia's efforts to promote multilateral trade nor did it mean that Australia was moving towards the creation of a trading bloc. </PARA>
<PARA>Officials of some ASEAN countries eg Indonesia and Malaysia are wary that ASEAN may be overshadowed and made irrelevant by a larger Asia-Pacific forum. </PARA>
<PARA>Simultaneous and Competing Proposals</PARA>
<PARA> There are several simultaneous and competing proposals and no indication that the Government has considered them thoroughly. </PARA>
<PARA> 1. Japanese</PARA>
<PARA> The Japanese Government has the parallel MITI proposal. MITI announced on 23 March that the first meeting of Cabinet ministers for a new Asia-Pacific trade group would be convened later this year, most likely in Sydney. This was done without consultation with Australia, suggesting that the Japanese are still keen to push their proposal, though DFAT Secretary Richard Woolcott has said that he thought MITI was prepared to merge its proposal with the Australian one. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. U.S. </PARA>
<PARA> Senior members of the US Congress are presently taking paths parallel to the Australian initiative, suggesting that many US congressmen are keen to assert US leadership. </PARA>
<PARA> On 13 April 1989 a group of US congressmen led by Democrat Senator Alan Cranston proposed that Congress form a ``Pacific Basin Forum'' to be hosted by President Bush. </PARA>
<PARA> On the same day, Michael Armacost, US Ambassador-designate to Japan, supported the idea of a Pacific Economic organisation. This raised the possibility that the US would announce its own Pacific idea to match that of Australia's. </PARA>
<PARA> On the same day, US-ASEAN teams coordinated by the East-West Centre in Hawaii and the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore presented to the US Government their recommendation, based on nine months of study, that the US and the 6 ASEAN members should negotiate a broad agreement for economic cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. PECC</PARA>
<PARA> On 28 April 1989 PECC offered itself as the new Asia-Pacific organisation proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> It had earlier been reported in the press that PECC was on the verge of re-constituting itself as the new Asia-Pacific organisation. According to the reports, a senior Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officer had to make a dash to the PECC meeting in San Francisco in order to ``coordinate'' the group's plans with Australia's. </PARA>
<PARA> The chairman of the PECC Standing Committee, Brian Talboys, was reported to have told reporters after the PECC meeting in San Francisco that PECC ``sees itself as being capable of being the kind of institution sought by Mr Hawke and other Pacific leaders.''</PARA>
<PARA> According to PECC delegates, a new organisation could be created by the end of the year by expanding the existing PECC. It was also the consensus at the meeting that the Hawke initiative had been badly prepared and poorly thought through. </PARA>
<PARA>Unclear membership</PARA>
<PARA> The way in which the scheme has evolved has given rise to some concern. It is not clear who the members would be, although it seems reasonable to assume that the 13 countries visited by Departmental Secretary Woolcott in April/May this year would be high on the list. </PARA>
<PARA> The list is potentially a long one. It could include the 5 developed countries-USA, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada; the 4 NICs-Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Korea; 5 other ASEAN countries-Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Burma; the South Pacific countries; perhaps even some of the Central American and South American countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, the number of potential members has blown out. Three potential members-the United States, Canada and China-who were not originally included in the Hawke proposals are now nearly certain to be included. </PARA>
<PARA> The US was not originally envisaged as a member, was not consulted and was not even invited. It had to take, in Senator Evans's own admission, ``a question or two'' from Secretary of State James Baker and Special Trade Envoy Carla Hills before an invitation was belatedly sent. Japan had apparently refused to cooperate fully unless the US was also included. However, some countries, eg Thailand are known to feel that any regional bloc should be aimed at countering protectionist measures, including those of the US, and the US should thus not be a part of regional group. </PARA>
<PARA> The USSR has now indicated that it would like to join. Senator Evans has since commented that he would also like to see Hong Kong and Taiwan join. In addition, Secretary Woolcott has said that he sees no reason why Vietnam and the other Indo-Chinese state should not also join. </PARA>
<PARA> Any question of membership would have to take into account the interests of the small Pacific countries. The sub-committee that inquired into Australia's relations with the South Pacific noted concerns expressed to the committee that in any larger association the needs and wishes of the small Pacific countries would be overridden by the larger countries. On the question of a free trade area it noted in its recent report, ``The Committee was unable to find support for it among the South Pacific countries nor identify any significant benefits to them. It further cautioned,</PARA>
<PARA>``While pursuing Australia's own economic interest, whether it be through the formation of a lobbying group based around major Pacific states, or greater ties with major trading partners, Australia also has an obligation to protect the trading interests of the smaller South Pacific states.''</PARA>
<PARA> There is a case for examining thoroughly which countries we hope to see in any regional grouping and what each could contribute to the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Unclear structure, powers, name and functions</PARA>
<PARA> The details of the proposal and the mechanics of its implementation are still being worked out and a lot of questions are yet to be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> Question marks remain over details like:</PARA>
<PARA> what form regional cooperation would take and what the economic and trade framework would be;</PARA>
<PARA> how tight, or how loose the links would be and at what level:</PARA>
<PARA> whether we would like to have a new organisation or build on PECC, or to have any form of association with ASEAN, the only governmental body for regional cooperation in South-East Asia;</PARA>
<PARA> whether the new body should have the powers to make policy. </PARA>
<PARA> its relationship with the South Pacific Forum and the South Pacific Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The concept still means different things to different people. Indeed, there is not even a common name for what we are talking about-Pacific Basin Community? Pacific Forum? Pacific Rim Community? Pan Pacific Association? Pacific Basin Cooperation Group? Asia Pacific Association? Pacific Basin Economic Association?</PARA>
<PARA>Parliamentary Input</PARA>
<PARA> This issue is heading into uncharted waters. It has the potential to yield tremendous rewards but also presents many difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government is pressing on and plans a meeting of relevant regional economic ministers is expected to take place in early November. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the importance of the matter, the fact that details are still being worked out and the impact on Australia and the region of any scheme, it is desirable that the Parliament should take the opportunity to examine the matter and present its recommendations with a view to advancing the debate in a constructive way. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Family Law Act 1975 introduced a bold new concept to the resolution of family disputes. We are all aware that the significant reforms made in 1975 have been a continuing source of community debate on matters such as the no fault concept, the establishment of a separate Family Court and the role of conciliation in the resolution of disputes. The broad range of views in the community on the manner and the extent to which governments should intervene in family matters has led to considerable parliamentary examination of the Family Law Act and to regular amendments. Since 1983 there have been three major legislative packages to amend the Family Law Act to reflect changing needs and ideas. Through those changes the basic principles of no fault and conciliation before adjudication have been maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> Most recently, the Family Law Act has been amended to improve the efficiency of the Family Court, which is the busiest Federal Court, and to broaden the range of work which the court can undertake. In addition, important changes were made, in 1987 to include ex nuptial children in four states within the coverage of the Act, and to ensure that adequate levels of maintenance are payable for the support of children whose parents have separated. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes to be made by the Bill which I am now introducing are no less significant than any of the amendments made in the past six years. They are changes which address an issue which has given rise to much of the complaint directed at the Act and the Family Court over the past 14 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments affect the most basic of family relationships-that which exists between a parent and his or her child, and will clarify the rights and obligations of parents and the rights of their children after separation. While the major impact of the amendments will be to provide force to orders, the Bill provides a mechanism to ensure that the parties, and the courts will address underlying problems in the difficult area of access to ensure that the needs of all parties to a dispute are met in the most appropriate way. The amendments will also provide a range of sanctions which are more appropriate to the particular problems created when an order concerning the parent-child relationship has been breached. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments do not recognise `parents rights' against their children. To do so would be anathema. Such rights quite simply do not exist. What parents do have is an obligation to raise and support their children. The fundamental principle in our legal system in matters affecting children is that the law should ensure that the welfare of children is the paramount consideration. Any suggestion that a `parental right' to maintain contact with a child should be enforced is inconsistent with the welfare consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, in most cases where the parent's relationship has broken down the welfare of a child will be best secured by the child retaining contact with each parent. This legislation has the objective of promoting a climate in which such contact can be maintained notwithstanding the failure of parents to communicate or agree on other matters. </PARA>
<PARA>Background to the Bill</PARA>
<PARA> Reform of the law in this area has been carefully considered by the Government. In the face of calls for reform to reinforce so called `parent rights' in relation to children the Government has fully considered the sometimes competing interests involved in developing this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In early 1983 the Australian Law Reform Commission was requested to investigate and report on the law of contempt. The Commission provided a lengthy report in 1987 in which it gave some particular attention to the problems posed by family law matters. In its report the Commission described the relationship between the Family Court's role as a `helping' court in which conciliation was emphasised and the penalties available for contempt of court as a `central paradox'. The maintenance of traditional concepts of rights and their enforcement by penalty can only preserve the existence of that paradox. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem that is posed for some parents in enforcing orders that they have access to their children was also addressed, in 1987, by the Family Law Council. The Government has been assisted greatly by the reports provided by the Law Reform Commission and the Family Law Council. In addition to those reports we have also sought and received public comment on the issues addressed by this Bill</PARA>
<PARA>The provisions of the Bill</PARA>
<PARA> The Family Law Act now provides courts with the power to punish a person for contempt or for so called `quasi-contempt'. There are two contempt and two `quasi-contempt' provisions. To some extent they overlap and there is no clear guide to the circumstances to which each offence will apply. the ``quasi-contempt'' provisions are to be repealed and replaced with a single non-compliance provision. This will clarify the law in relation to acts and omissions which amount to non-compliance with a court order and define the boundary between what is and what is not a contempt of court. </PARA>
<PARA> Where a court is satisfied that a person has failed to comply with an order and had no reasonable cause for not complying the court may impose a penalty. The penalties available include those now available for `quasi-contempt' such as fines, imprisonment, the placing of a person in a bond, delivery of documents or a document such as a passport to a court officer or sequestration of property. Two significant additions are to be made to the range of penalty options which are available to a court. </PARA>
<PARA> A major addition to the range of sentencing options is the inclusion of community based corrections, such as community service orders. There are a range of such penalties now available to the courts when sentencing a person for offences under the criminal law. The amendments will make such sanctions available in response to civil offences for the first time. The novel use of such sanctions in the civil area was recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission, and has the support of the Family Law Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The practical availability of community based sanctions will depend on negotiations with the States and Territories. Those negotiations have commenced in the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, where I have received a favourable response to a proposal that further negotiations occur. </PARA>
<PARA> The negotiations will deal with three major topics. First, it must be determined which of the sanctions referred to in the amending Bill be made available by each State and Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, there is the issue of the number of hours which a person may be required to attend under such an order. In the criminal area, in which we apply State or Territory Law, the maximum limit of a community based sentence varies from State to State. For instance in Tasmania the maximum limit is 240 hours while in Victoria the maximum limit is 500 hours. The Bill provides a mechanism to fix a common maximum penalty. I consider that it is important that the penalty which is imposed by a court should not be dependent on whether one lives in, say, the Australian Capital Territory or Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, there is the issue of payment to States and Territories for the use of their facilities. In the criminal law area the Commonwealth does not make any direct payment for the provision of such facilities. An indirect payment is made through the revenue sharing arrangements but States have a constitutional responsibility to provide facilities where a person has been convicted of an offence against the Commonwealth. A person found to have contravened a family law order will not be convicted of an offence against the Commonwealth and accordingly it is appropriate that the Commonwealth meet the reasonable cost of provision of facilities by States and Territories in an area of Commonwealth responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> An important issue for the Courts to consider in determining whether to impose an alternative sentencing option will be whether such a sanction should be an alternative to imprisonment or of an alternative to other options. In the Bill no attempt has been made to fetter the discretion of courts in this area. However, the Government will monitor the use of alternative sentencing alternatives carefully as there could be significant resource implications if an expectation were developed that sanctions such as community service orders were the standard sanction for non-compliance. In the Government's view such a sanction should be sparingly used. </PARA>
<PARA> The second addition to the range of sanctions which a Court may impose is that a Court may order compensatory access. This power is one which Courts now possess but the absence of a specific provision to make clear the possibility of compensatory access has had the effect of limiting the claims of those who have been denied access unreasonably. </PARA>
<PARA> While the provision will make a previously little used course of action more likely to be used in the future it should by no means be assumed that compensatory access will be granted every time access is withheld. As in all matters affecting children, the welfare of a child will be the paramount consideration, and accordingly compensatory access may not be ordered if there are circumstances which rule against such an order. </PARA>
<PARA> The other sanctions which may be imposed under new subsection 112ad are sanctions of a type now found in the existing contempt and quasi contempt provisions. However, even in relation to the existing sanctions some important changes have been made. </PARA>
<PARA> It will no longer be open to a Court to imprison a person for an unlimited term in order to coerce compliance with an earlier order. An order that a person go to jail until he or she has complied with an order can only be of value for a limited time. After that time the order fails to achieve its purpose and can no longer be justified. The Bill provides that the maximum period for which a person may be imprisoned for failure to comply with an order is 12 months. That limitation is, in one respect, an expansion of some existing penalties available under the Act. At present the maximum term of imprisonment for contravening a custody or access order or for breaching an injunction is 3 months. However there is no maximum term of imprisonment if a contravention is dealt with as a contempt of Court. The maximum term of 12 months is subject to an important caveat. New subsections 112ae (2), (3) (4) provide an obligation for Courts considering the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment to consider other options and to state the reasons for rejecting the other options including the additional sentencing alternatives previously mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> Sequestration of the property of a person who has contravened an order remains a sanction but may be addressed to an individual as well as a corporation. The removal of a limitation on sequestration to the assets of a company merely removes an anomaly which has restricted the coercive powers of the Courts. Sequestration is of course a traditional method of securing compliance with an order. </PARA>
<PARA>Child agreements</PARA>
<PARA> The 1987 amendments to the Act introduced the concept of child agreements, whereby parents simply file their agreement at a court registry thus avoiding the expense of a court hearing. Child agreements have been a valuable means for parties to obtain the benefit of the provisions of the Act to enforce or vary their agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> To date, such agreements have been limited to matters affecting custody, guardianship, or access. Any agreement in relation to child maintenance has been dealt with under section 86 of the Act, which has been well understood and used since 1976 and is not to be amended. However, that section applies only to agreements made by the parties to a marriage. The 1987 amendments did not include any provision for parents to register an agreement as to a child's maintenance if they had not been married. The amendments made by clauses 4, 7 and 8 will allow the parents of ex-nuptial children, in relation to whom 4 States have referred power to the Commonwealth, to register their agreement and thereby avoid unnecessary and costly proceedings for an order. </PARA>
<PARA>Information as to the whereabouts of a child</PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 5 and 6 of this Bill revise existing sections 64 (11a) and (11b) of the Family Law Act. The amendment will ensure that information as to the whereabouts of a child is provided during a period of 12 months rather than only relating to information held by the person at the time the order is served. </PARA>
<PARA> Because a broader obligation to provide information has been created there is provision made to ensure that an unnecessarily onerous duty is not placed on information holders. Accordingly, if a child is located and returned to its parent the parent is to be required to advise any person who is required to provide information as to the whereabouts of the child that the information is no longer required. A government department or instrumentality will not be required to search its records more frequently than each three months. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Institute of Family Studies</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 24 of the Bill will enable a transfer of ministerial responsibility in relation to the Australian Institute of Family Studies from the Attorney-General to the Minister for Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has carefully considered the most appropriate placement of those organisations established under the Act which provide advice in relation to family issues. Advice is provided by the institute, in relation to broad social and economic issues affecting family life, and by the Family Law Council, in relation to the operation of family law and legal aid legislation. The institute's work is in an area which has considerable impact on the social security system and it is more appropriate that the existing links between the work of the institute and the social security system be strengthened. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT (SAVINGS ACCOUNTS INTEREST) AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will have 3 important effects on the current deregulated mess that passes for the Australian Economy. The first will be to encourage savings. The second will be to offer small investors, especially the aged and those who have retired, a secure investment with a good return. The third effect will be to assist those who are currently saving to buy their first home as property prices rise or are struggling to meet their escalating mortgage repayments as interest rates rise. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will exempt from tax the first $2,000 of interest earned by anyone who deposits their money into accounts paying no more than 12% with financial institutions which lend for housing. So people with bank and building society deposits will benefit. More money will be available at a lower interest rate to those borrowing to buy their own home. This Bill will therefore make a substantial contribution to increasing the level of savings in Australia and to ensuring that people buying their own home to live in do not have to pay the massive interest rates currently dictated by unregulated financial markets. </PARA>
<PARA>Savings</PARA>
<PARA> In December 1988, the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) issued a paper entitled ``trends in private saving''. It noted that private savings have trended down since the mid 1970s and stated that ``without a significant improvement in the incentive framework for saving, private saving is unlikely to make a major contribution to the further adjustment in domestic savings that is needed''. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then, our deteriorating balance of payments problem and ever growing foreign indebtedness have resulted in economists, bankers and business people demanding that something be done to increase the incentive to save. Recently 2 Ministers of this government have been prepared to advocate publicly the need for incentives to increase the level of savings in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is it important to increase our domestic savings? Australia is buying too much from overseas countries and exporting too little. Our increasing level of foreign indebtedness and foreign ownership means that we must pay increasing amounts of rents, interest and dividends to the foreign owners of Australian assets and to foreign lenders. If we could save more in Australia, we would need to borrow less from overseas and we could reduce the rate at which we are selling off Australian Businesses and Land and Property to overseas buyers. We would therefore begin to reduce our repayments to overseas lenders and owners of Australian Assets. As Australians save more, they buy less and this means that we will buy fewer imports. </PARA>
<PARA> There is little argument about whether we need to increase our level of domestic savings. The argument is really about how to do it. The deregulationists and expenditure cutters who determine the economic policies of the Hawke Government, the Liberal/National Party coalition, Australian big businesses, and the foreign bankers who have been generous enough to lend us our foreign debt, all want to increase savings by inflicting more pain on Australians. They want us to use monetary policy (i.e. higher interest rates), fiscal policy (that is more expenditure cuts) and tax increases in the form of consumption taxes to increase domestic savings. In short, they believe that we must suffer pain in order to increase savings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats are not interested in yet another attack on the living standards of low and average income households to wrench more savings out of the economy. We oppose expenditure cuts which enable the Treasurer to gloat about the size of his domestic surplus. We oppose consumption taxes because they cannot be avoided by low income earners who get pushed further into debt and poverty. We oppose more increases in interest rates. We know that many Australians will save more if we give them a direct incentive to save by not taxing the first $2,000 of interest earned. That is what this Bill will achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> Someone with $10,000 of savings and $20,000 of other income, will currently lose money by investing in a savings account at 12%. They will earn $1,200 in interest and pay $412.50 in income tax and medicare levy, approximately $400 in provisional tax, leaving them with a return of less than $400 on their $10,000 investment. With inflation running at 7%, they lose at least $300 by investing their money at 12% given the existing tax regime. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will enable existing and potential savers to achieve a real return on the first $2,000 of interest they earn. The limit of $2,000 will mean that people with a lot of money will not get the tax concession for interest above $2,000. For all Australians with savings, but particularly for retired people and the aged, this will be a good opportunity to invest some money safely. They will not need to invest in complex bonds, trusts and elaborate tax minimisation vehicles which may be risky, to avoid the punitive taxes on savings. They will be given access to an honest, secure and simple form of investment. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, the Japanese Government began to take a 20% slice of the interest earned on savings accounts which had been totally exempt from taxes for 25 years. These tax free savings accounts, called maruyu, have been a major inducement for the Japanese to save. Japanese industry has had ready access for many years to a vast reserve of cheap capital. It was established last year that almost $US2.5 trillion were in these accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Japanese Government acted to reduce (but not abolish) the tax concession after pressure from the U.S. Government to do something to increase Japanese domestic consumption. I doubt whether the Japanese Government sought the advice of our deregulationist Treasurer or his Liberal Party counterpart. Japan acted sensibly in the first place to give a tax concession to encourage domestic savings and now under extreme pressure they are only removing a small part of that exemption. Japan was able to restructure the economy without becoming dependent on foreign investors and foreign lenders because it had adequate levels of domestic savings. </PARA>
<PARA>Housing</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will also make it easier for those who are saving to put a deposit on a home. Escalating house prices have widened the deposit gap for many prospective home buyers. If they struggle to save something, the Government taxes away their earnings. As house prices increase, they cannot save enough to keep up with inflation in general let alone the inflation in property prices in most of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill deliberately gives the tax incentive to save in such a way as to encourage people to save with financial institutions that lend for housing. This will mean that more money will move into financial institutions which lend for housing. Savings banks and building societies will be able to attract more money at lower interest rates because people will save with them to get the tax benefits. Consequently banks and building societies will be able to pass on the lower interest rates they are paying for money to those who are borrowing to buy a house to live in. Interest rates on home loans will fall. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government and the Liberal and National parties have voted to give a tax incentive to those who are buying their second, third or fourth property as investments. That is their priority. The person who owns many houses gets to claim the interest payments on borrowings as a tax deduction and can then offset any further losses against income they earn from other sources. The Laboreals can come up with exotic reasons to support tax concessions for property investors. This is the first of 2 Bills which will give the Government and the Opposition the opportunity to support tax concessions which will benefit those who are trying to buy their first home and those who are struggling to pay it off. The Australian Democrats believe that Australians wanting to buy a home to live in and those who are attempting to pay off the homes they are living in deserve a tax break too. If we cannot afford to help them, why are we helping property investors? Why are we suffering expenditure cuts and high interest rates so that wealthy Australians can buy more luxury imports and Australian companies can borrow more money overseas?</PARA>
<PARA> In looking at the cost of this proposal, we must recognise that we can save future revenue on public housing and social security payments due to the increasing poverty created when housing becomes less affordable. In terms of our balance of payments and foreign indebtedness, we will be able to make future savings on the interest repayments to foreign lenders. We can save Australia from increasing dependence on foreign investment and begin to reduce the increasing proportion of our wealth which goes in the form of rent and dividends to foreign owners of Australian assets. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of 1988, all savings bank deposits totalled $67 billion and all building society deposits totalled $19 billion. These accounts were of course in a variety of term deposits, cheque, pass book, investment and statement accounts, with varying interest rates. To calculate the possible revenue loss means making a number of assumptions. </PARA>
<PARA>First, about the proportion of current deposits that would be attracted to accounts of up to 12%;</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, about the higher rate at which new savings will grow as a result of this measure;</PARA>
<PARA>Thirdly, about the number of people earning interest who are already below the tax threshold;</PARA>
<PARA>Fourthly, about the level of interest rates in the future; and</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, about the marginal rates of tax on current and future savings and therefore what if anything the Government will deliver as tax cuts this year. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, it is impossible to come up with a precise costing because of these assumptions. </PARA>
<PARA> In June 1988, the total interest paid by savings banks was $4.1 billion. If we assume that this grows to $5 billion this financial year and about half this amount is paid on accounts that attract the concession then $2.5 billion of interest payments would not be taxed. If we assume that the average tax paid on this amount is about 30%, then the Government will lose some $800 million in revenue from interest on savings accounts with banks. If building societies continue to attract about one-third of the savings attracted by banks that would add another $270 million, making the total cost just over $1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost would be reduced when interest rates fall and the 12% limit is reduced. Similarly, the cost would be lower with lower tax rates. This cost, however, is less than the almost $2 billion the Government has given away in company tax cuts. It is also less than the cost to the Government of giving a tax concession to Australian companies which borrow overseas and use the deduction on the interest they pay on their borrowings to pay little or no tax. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it will be money well spent to encourage savings and home ownership, rather than allowing the wealthiest Australians to import luxury goods and giving tax concessions to property investors so that they can pay more for a home than Australians looking to buy a home for themselves to live in. </PARA>
<PARA>INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT (HOUSING LOAN INTEREST) AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will enable people who are buying the house that they live in to get some tax relief on their home loan repayments. The Hawke Labor Government and the Liberal and National Party Coalition, give favoured tax treatment to people buying investment properties. In this Bill, the Australian Democrats will give much needed tax relief to Australians who are struggling to pay off the homes in which they live. </PARA>
<PARA> As I introduce this Bill, interest rates are high and rising. I am sure that in the future interest rates will fall, but nobody knows when. Maybe this will coincide with an election. Yet all Australians must realise now that in a deregulated financial system, interest rates can rise at any time and when interest rates on housing loans rise, many Australian suffer. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who have recently taken out mortgages find it difficult to meet the increased repayments. Some lose their homes. People who are about to purchase a home have to think again because they do not know whether they will be able to afford the increased repayments. Without doubt, deregulation has made it more difficult for many Australians to buy a home to live in. The same cannot be said for property investors who are encouraged to buy many homes with special tax concessions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has taken some action to reduce the pressure that foreign investors were putting on home prices in Australia. However, it was little action, very late. Following this action, foreign investors can and do buy property for development. </PARA>
<PARA> There seems to be something very wrong with this Government's housing priorities. Foreign investors can still push up home prices. Australian investors who already own a home and buy another one, two or three houses as investments, are allowed to claim the interest they pay on their home loans as a tax deduction. If they are making a loss on renting out their investment properties, they are allowed to deduct that loss against taxable income from other sources. The Hawke Government, with the support of the Liberal and National Party Coalition, reintroduced this mechanism of negative gearing to subsidise at the taxpayers' expense, the losses deliberately incurred by property investors. They are prepared to give a tax incentive to people who are not living in the houses they are buying. </PARA>
<PARA> It is sad indeed that the property investor can afford to pay more for a property than the person who is buying a home to occupy. It means that investors can outbid potential owner occupiers at an auction. This is the result of giving all the tax breaks to the property investor and nothing to the person buying a house in which to live. The property investor gets to deduct the loan repayments and to negatively gear. The owner occupier faces crippling interest rates which are still rising and meet the full home loan repayment with no tax relief. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill, therefore, gives the tax benefit to Australians who are living in the houses they are buying. Australians who are currently finding it very difficult to keep increasing the payments on their housing loans while their real incomes are falling, need this help to stay in their homes. Australians who are contemplating buying a home to live in need this assurance that they will get some tax relief. Otherwise as their mortgage commitments rise, they risk financial hardship and eventually being thrown out of their homes when they can no longer afford to meet their loan repayments. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence, this Bill is similar to legislation introduced by the then Treasurer and now Leader of the Opposition, as part of the 1982-83 Budget. In those halcyon pre- deregulation days, he was prepared to deal with the problem of high interest rates making home ownership unaffordable to average Australian income earners. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will introduce a tax rebate on the interest paid in excess of 10% per annum on the first $80,000 of a housing loan. Those buying the most expensive houses will not abuse the system because the rebate is limited to interest paid on the first $80,000 of a loan. We will also prevent the highest income earners from getting the biggest benefit by applying the same 40% rebate to all owner occupiers with home loans, irrespective of their actual marginal rate of tax. </PARA>
<PARA> In Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, the UK and the USA, there is either full or partial tax allowance for interest on home loans for a principal residence. So this is not an unusual measure. Given the financial problems confronting Australians who have recently bought or who want to buy a home to live in, there is at least as great a need to introduce this legislation now, as there was when it was introduced in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of this measure will vary as interest rates fluctuate. Obviously if we get home loan interest rates down to 10%, there will be no cost. However, at current interest rates, the costs are likely to be in the vicinity of $200 million. </PARA>
<PARA> If my Bill to exempt from tax the first $2,000 of interest earned from savings accounts with financial institutions that lend for housing is passed, then money at 12% or less will become available to institutions that lend for housing. Interest rates on home loans will then drop and the cost of this tax subsidy will be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Can we afford not to help Australians buy their own home? Can we afford to have more Australians trying to find accommodation in less public housing because they cannot afford to buy a house? Can we afford to sell Australian houses to foreign investors and allow housing to become unaffordable to average Australians? Can the Labor, Liberal and National Parties afford to deny tax relief to people buying a house to live in when they have voted to increase the tax incentives for property investors to buy many houses?</PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Late last year, this Parliament passed the Privacy Act 1988. That Act provided for the establishment of the office of the Federal Privacy Commissioner and for privacy protection for individuals, both in relation to information about them held by Commonwealth agencies and in relation to their tax file numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Privacy Amendment Bill 1989 is the next step in the Government's program to introduce comprehensive privacy protection for the Australian community. The principal purpose of this Bill is to provide privacy protection for individuals in relation to their consumer credit records. </PARA>
<PARA> It is generally accepted that individuals have the right to have certain data protection principles applying to large collections of sensitive personal data. The OECD Guidelines on Personal Privacy, which Australia has adhered to, set out these basic principles. These principles are:</PARA>
<PARA> there should be limits to the collection of personal data and any such data should be obtained by lawful and fair means with the knowledge or consent of the data-subject</PARA>
<PARA> personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which it is to be used and should be accurate</PARA>
<PARA> the purposes for which personal data is collected should be specified at the time of collection and subsequent use limited to the fulfilment of these purposes</PARA>
<PARA> personal data should not be disclosed for other purposes except with the consent of the data subject or where required by law</PARA>
<PARA> personal data should be protected by security safeguards</PARA>
<PARA> individuals should be aware who holds their personal data</PARA>
<PARA> individuals should have a right of access to and correction of their personal data</PARA>
<PARA> a data controller should be accountable for complying with measures to give effect to these principles. </PARA>
<PARA> These principles were adopted in the Privacy Act for application to Commonwealth agencies and to all tax file number users. This Bill adopts these principles to provide privacy protection for individuals in relation to their personal information which is held by the consumer credit reporting industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Central credit information databanks provide information to credit providers to assist decision making on the desirability of granting consumer credit. These databases, without proper supervision, hold considerable potential for privacy intrusion. Proposed new industry practices for credit profiling of individuals would have increased the dangers for privacy intrusion. </PARA>
<PARA> At the present time, there are inadequate controls on consumer credit reporting agencies to prevent them from using their databases for non consumer credit purposes. The development of comprehensive commitment profiles would increase the danger of information held by credit reporting agencies being used in unauthorised circumstances by bodies such as employers and private inquiry agents. It would also increase the potential for use of credit records for non-credit purposes, eg insurance proposals, insurance fraud, rental housing, occupational licensing-uses that clearly breach privacy principles. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Law Reform Commission's Privacy Report, which was tabled in this Parliament in late 1983, found that many members of the Australian community saw credit reporting agencies as posing a threat to privacy. A detailed public opinion poll carried out by the ALRC on attitudes to privacy ranked credit reporting agencies at the head of the list of potentially intrusive organisations. The Joint Select Committee on an Australia Card viewed with concern the lack of regulation and the potential for infringement of civil liberties in relation to personal information held by credit reporting agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The large majority of individuals meet their credit commitments. In determining the appropriate form of privacy regulation for the credit reporting industry, what must be paramount is the fundamental right of these individuals to privacy. However, this must be balanced against both the need for businesses to operate efficiently, and the right of credit providers to protect their commercial interests. Also, the welfare of those borrowers who may get into difficulties or who are led into difficulties must not be forgotten. This Bill achieves that difficult balance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill establishes a privacy framework for the regulation of the consumer credit reporting industry. The Privacy Commissioner will be given a clear legislative mandate to develop a Code of Conduct with the industry. The Code will provide a flexible and co-operative mechanism for the industry and community to give effect to the Bill. The Bill sets out a set of provisions which will regulate the collection, storage, access to, correction of, use and disclosure of personal credit information by credit providers and credit reporting agencies. Only those businesses which are providers of consumer credit will be allowed to have access to the consumer credit reporting system.</PARA>
<PARA> All records of personal information held at credit reporting agencies and information from central agencies held by credit providers such as banks, credit unions, finance companies and major retailers will be covered by the new legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Code of Conduct will be a major feature of the regulatory scheme for the consumer credit reporting industry. The Code will apply to information held in, or disseminated from, a central database and to the transfer of information between industry participants. The Privacy Act will provide statutory backing for the Code and will direct the Commissioner, in developing the Code of Conduct, to use, as his benchmark, the Information Privacy Principles set out in the Privacy Act. The Code will be subject to Parliamentary scrutiny as a disallowable instrument for the purposes of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 and will be published in the Gazette. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will provide individuals with an enforceable right of access to, and correction of, their credit records. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will provide that a credit report, held by a central reporting agency, will only be available to a credit provider when an application for credit is made. Credit providers will have to seek the consent of a client before they can disclose personal information to another credit provider unless there are reasonable grounds to believe that fraud may exist. The Privacy Commissioner will oversight the development of appropriate forms of consent. An important aspect of the Government's proposed regulation is that there will be strict requirements for consent before consumer credit information can be sought or passed on. Such information is often passed at the moment without the consent or knowledge of the consumer. The new controls will mean that consumers will be able to have authority over information about themselves. Credit providers will be able to continue to maintain their own information on their clients. </PARA>
<PARA> The information that a credit reporting agency can hold about an individual will be set out in the Bill. Basically, a credit reporting agency will be able to hold the information that they currently hold, ie. information about an individual's previous bad debts and information about enquiries by credit providers. Over time, a credit reporting agency will be required to delete information which it is no longer permitted to hold. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also limits access to consumer credit files so that only legitimate use is made of the information stored. This will mean that some current members of the leading consumer credit reporting agency, the Credit Reference Association of Australia (CRAA), will no longer have access to consumer credit information files. Such users include private investigators, real estate agencies and insurance companies. Government departments and agencies which are not credit providers would also be prevented from using credit reference files, except by exercising statutory powers. </PARA>
<PARA>Positive Reporting</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Community concerns with the credit industry have recently been heightened by industry's proposals for the introduction of a new and much more comprehensive form of credit reporting, namely positive reporting. </PARA>
<PARA> This would have meant the development of a system reporting comprehensively on a person's credit history regardless of new loan applications or defaults on a payment. Under this positive reporting system everybody who uses consumer credit in any form, such as credit cards or personal loans, would have had a monthly statement on their account provided by credit providers to a central national database operated by a central agency. Credit providers would supply the reporting agency with computer tapes of all their customers' credit accounts. These tapes would be merged with the central database, usually every 60 days. Credit providers would receive a report listing all known credit accounts, the balance owing on each account and its currency. </PARA>
<PARA> The credit reporting agency would effectively become a central clearing house of information about the current financial commitments of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Positive reporting would constitute a major change in the level of information collected on individuals. While the notion of information collected in a centralised agency is not new, the collection of personal information on individuals' spending habits is-credit and spending profiles of individuals would have been built up through all their credit transactions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not consider that there is any proven substantial benefit from positive reporting proposals. In view of this strong privacy concerns make any such expansion impossible to condone. The Government recognises that consumer credit reporting can be a useful adjunct to sound lending practices. Such reporting is not and should not be a substitute for this. The Government therefore does not believe that the collection of much more extensive information about individuals is an effective way to reduce consumers' credit overcommitment. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, the difficulties for banks in participating in such a scheme because of the confidentiality of their banker/client relationship, and the restrictive nature of the proposed scheme, weighed against the acceptance of positive reporting by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The way to reduce consumer credit overcommitment is not positive reporting. The Government and the community must continue to focus on education, appropriate counselling and most importantly on responsible lending practices. This is even truer in a society where the use of credit is fast becoming a normal part of living, and where credit options proliferate. </PARA>
<PARA> I should make it clear that it is not the intention of this Bill to restrict the use of commercial credit information by credit providers or credit reporting agencies. The Bill will prevent a commercial credit record of a small businessman or sole trader being used when assessing an application by them for credit which is for domestic consumer purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> The Privacy Commissioner will have an array of functions to protect the individual's privacy. He will be able to investigate complaints, proceed with own motion inquiries into credit providers and reporting agencies' practices in relation to the handling of information, and undertake random audits of credit providers and credit reporting agencies' databases to ensure their adherence to the Act and the Code of Conduct. </PARA>
<PARA> The credit provider or the credit reporting agency will handle complaints in the first instance. The Privacy Commissioner will only handle those complaints that cannot be resolved by industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Privacy Commissioner has been given a range of mechanisms to enforce the privacy standards set out in the Act and in the Code of Conduct. A major role of the Commissioner will be to conciliate matters which involve a breach of the Act or the Code. The Commissioner will also be able to make a determination that an individual be paid damages as compensation by a credit provider or credit reporting agency which has misused the individual's personal credit information. There are also offence provisions carrying stringent penalties for individuals or companies that seek to obtain unauthorised access to credit records, or that intentionally or negligently supply false credit information or misuse credit information. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will provide individuals with comprehensive privacy protection for their credit records. It will provide an enforceable right of access to credit records and a practical means for individuals who have been adversely affected by misuse of the credit information to seek redress. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislative charter set out in the Bill, which will be further elaborated in the Code of Conduct, provides a balanced recognition of the interests of both lenders and borrowers. It pays proper regard to the issues of privacy and data protection. In particular, it seeks to meet data protection requirements that information should be obtained and processed fairly. It also meets the principles that information should be relevant for the purpose for which it is held, it should not intrude to an unreasonable extent upon the personal affairs of individuals and it should not be used for incompatible purposes without the consent of the individual. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate turns to debating the Resource Assessment Commission Bill 1989. The explanatory memorandum states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>This Bill establishes the Resource Assessment Commission (RAC) and defines its functions and powers. The Commission will hold public inquiries and inform and advise the Government on matters relating to the use of resources and involving consideration of conservation and development issues. </PARA>
<PARA>The job of the Resource Assessment Commission will be to assemble all reasonably available information, acknowledge those areas where uncertainty remains, take relevant viewpoints into account and advise the Government on the options it can adopt within a reasonable timeframe. Although I am addressing these remarks to the Senate, I really would have liked to address them to the back bench of the Australian Labor Party and to the members of the Australian Democrats. I say to them now that the basic concepts and objectives of this legislation have much merit but, like a lot of legislation which has been rushed into this chamber, there are flaws within the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate how many times it has held up legislation while people have been able to make representations or the Senate has referred a Bill to one of its committees for consideration, and how many times after some short delay legislation has come back into the Parliament in a much better form. I point, in particular, to a piece of legislation which will be coming up for debate later today, the Patents Amendment Bill, which was rushed into this chamber 12 months ago. We had to get it through before the winter recess. It was absolutely essential that it go through, notwithstanding the fact that it had been four years in preparation. It had to be rushed through before June of last year, but the Democrats joined with the coalition in refusing to allow the Government to rush the legislation through, and 12 months later the Government has brought it back with a lot of amendments of its own which have greatly improved the Bill. Similarly, a patents Bill was brought into this place in December of 1987. It had to be carried before Christmas. It was absolutely essential that it come into operation on 1 January 1988. Again the Democrats joined with the coalition in deferring that legislation so that representatives of interested parties could make representation. The Government did not bring the Bill back until about April or May of this year, and it brought it back with an enormous number of changes which greatly improved the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the back bench of the Government and particularly to members of the Australian Democrats that this Bill is in precisely the same condition. It needs to be considered by a legislative committee which can look at its implications and how it will operate. If the Democrats are not concerned about the issues I am raising with them, they should look at their own amendments. They should look at what is set out on the third page, in amendment (5), which is to insert certain principles. The second principle states:</PARA>
<PARA> Resource use decisions should seek to optimise the net benefits to the community from the nation's resources, having regard to efficiency of resource use, environmental considerations . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I am not arguing that anything is wrong with that, but it then refers to `ecological integrity'. I am sure that Senator Sanders knew what he meant by `ecological integrity' when he drafted his amendment or he thinks he does. Then there is a reference to `sustain- ability'. What on earth does that mean? I am sure Senator Sanders knows what he thinks it means, but is he sure that the courts will know what he meant by it when they come to interpret this legislation? The second principle then refers to `ecosystem integrity and sustainability'. Again he uses that word. I do not know whether `sustainability' is in the Oxford Dictionary, but I doubt very much whether it has been interpreted by the High Court of Australia. The second principle then goes on to talk about `the sustainability of any development and an equitable distribution of the return on resources'. I have no doubt that Senator Sanders, as I have said, knows what he means by that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats are proposing to amend the legislation and add these words to one of the fundamental principles of the Bill, but I say to the Democrats that they cannot be sure of the interpretation of their proposed legislation. Just because Senator Sanders has done some deal with the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) there is no reason for them not to reconsider that deal that has been done and say to the Government, `Well, we would like to have one of the Senate standing committees look at this piece of legislation'. We will be moving an amendment, which by now should have been distributed, to the motion that the Bill be now read a second time. The amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA> Leave out all words after ``That'', insert, ``the Resource Assessment Commission Bill 1989 be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, for inquiry and report, on or before the first sitting day in September 1989, on the meaning and implications of the Bill and its Schedules, with particular reference to:</PARA>

If the Australian Democrats wish to add to the particulars, I would be happy to consider amending them by adding some of the words indicated in their amendment. I now formally move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave out all words after ``That'', insert, ``the Resource Assessment Commission Bill 1989 be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, for inquiry and report, on or before the first sitting day in September 1989, on the meaning and implications of the Bill and its Schedules, with particular reference to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) its effects on the rights of the States in general and in relation to water rights in particular;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the ability of States or Territories to initiate a resource matter;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) whether or not the Inter-State Commission should have a role pursuant to section 101 of the Constitution;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the definitions of `resource' and `resource matter'; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) whether any qualifications should be necessary for appointment as a special Commissioner.''. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said, the coalition parties believe that the basic concept and objectives of this Bill have much merit. But there are shortcomings. I have referred to what I believe are shortcomings which the Democrats are aware of. Let me go on and talk about some of the problems which we see in the legislation. We see major problems with the definition of the word `resource' and the words `resource matter'. We believe these definitions are so broad that they must create constitutional problems. The word `resource' is defined as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> ``resource'' means a biological mineral or other material component, whether natural or not (other than a human being), and includes a permanent or temporary combination or association of components;</PARA>
<PARA>The term `resource matter' has a long definition relating to the use of a resource. As I said, these terms are so broad that in our view they may very well raise constitutional questions. Section 99 of the Constitution prevents the Commonwealth from giving a preference to one State or any part thereof. Clearly, the Resource Assessment Commission could recommend that a forest in one State, say in southern New South Wales, be logged but that a forest in another State not be logged. Would the implementation of that recommendation not infringe State rights? Would it not infringe the Constitution? If so, would the Inter-State Commission have a role in the adjudication and administration of that problem? The Bill does not face up to these questions in any way. Clause 16 of the Bill states:</PARA>
<PARA> Where the Commonwealth Government or a Commonwealth authority may, in the exercise of its powers-</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the words `in the exercise of its powers'-</PARA>
<PARA>make a decision in relation to a resource matter, the Minister may, by written notice to the Chairperson, require the Commission to conduct an inquiry into the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>Where are the Commonwealth's constitutional powers defined in relation to resources? This action is taken in the exercise of its powers. Under which placitum of section 51 of the Constitution are the Commonwealth's constitutional powers in relation to resources? I refer to another problem. Water is clearly within the definition of resource in this Bill, but section 100 of the Constitution provides:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade or commerce, abridge the right of a State or of the residents therein to the reasonable use of the waters of rivers for conservation or irrigation. </PARA>
<PARA>What happens if there is a recommendation in relation to the use of waters or rivers? What happens if that recommendation abridges the right of a State or the residents of a State in relation to the use of those waters for those purposes? The Bill does not address that problem. It is a matter which ought to be taken into consideration. Further, nowhere in the Bill is there any recognition given to the sovereignty of the States. Although the Minister claims in his second reading speech that the Bill provides opportunities for participation by all interested parties, including States, the Bill makes no provision for a State exercising its sovereign rights to initiate an inquiry or reject the recommendations of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> What happens if a State, acting constitutionally, chooses to reject a Commonwealth decision? What happens if the Minister refers a resource matter to the Commission without consultation with the State government and it decides not to cooperate? This Bill does not provide the answers. I ask the Minister whether the Commission will have the power to subpoena a State Minister to give evidence under clause 36. What is the position if the Commission seeks confidential State Cabinet documents? What is the position of, say, a State director of forests or mining if he or she is subpoenaed to appear before the Commission but is then ordered by the State Minister not to appear or not to supply documents? The Bill does not indicate the answers to those problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Are the special commissioners not required to have any qualifications? That is not set out in this Bill. Is that right? Should they not have any qualifications? These are matters which a Senate committee could apply its mind to. In regard to confidentiality of State Cabinet documents, should there not be some protection for commercial in-confidence documents or evidence being provided by businesses? They may have to give evidence about capital investments. They may be required to give evidence about their projected profits. Should that not be treated as a commercial in-confidence matter? Should they not be protected by the Act? I know what the Minister will say. He will say, `It will be up to the Chairperson of the Commission to make that decision'. Does the Minister really think that that is adequate? What about evidence relating to new technology or techniques? Some companies may have new ideas about the use of a resource and they may not wish to disclose that publicly. It may be a type of technique or technology which they do not want to patent but which they wish to keep confidential. How will they be able to do that under this Bill? Again, I suppose the Minister will say, `That will be up to the Chairperson'. Is that correct? Are we going to subject Australian businesses to the whims of the Chairperson in this matter or are we going to provide in the legislation protection for these people?</PARA>
<PARA> I am not telling the Minister what the answers are. I am merely saying that these are the sorts of problems which the Government has not addressed. Once again, this Government has rushed in this legislation in order to be seen to be doing something before the next election. It is panicking. It is saying, `There is an election coming up and we are down in the polls. We look as if we might get beaten. Let's do something. There is a greenie vote out there. Let's rush out and grab the greenie vote. How can we do that? We will do that by introducing this piece of legislation. It will solve our problems in the forests'. What about the Democrat amendment, which I understand the Government has accepted, which seeks to ensure that only sustainable resources can be used? Does that mean we will not be able to mine gold because once it is taken out of the ground, it has gone? I can understand that in relation to--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Sanders" NAMEID="1J4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1J4">Senator Sanders</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What is it doing to the environment? That is the whole point.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sanders is saying, `That is the whole point'. So he is going along with what I am saying. If we take the gold out of the ground, it is finished. I can understand Senator Sanders saying, `You do not cut down trees unless you are also planting trees'. That would make that resource sustainable. But what about resources that are mined? No-one would have any clue as to the meaning of the words `the sustainability of any development' used by Senator Sanders in his amendment. He wants this to refer to ecological integrity and sustainability. Dear, oh dear! They are words which ought to be looked at by a parliamentary committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is it reasonable that the Parliament should enact this legislation without addressing these questions? Of course it is not reasonable. But, as I have indicated-and it is clear from the interjections from Senator Sanders and Senator Richardson-the Australian Democrats have done a deal with the Government to pass this Bill with a few amendments-amendments which will add to the burden of Australian taxpayers. This enables the Government to avoid addressing matters of great importance and may very well assist Senator Sanders in his next election campaign in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). We understand that he is to become No. 2 on the Australian Labor Party (ALP) ticket for the ACT. This deal probably has much more to do with Senator Sanders's deal with the ALP for the next election than with the resources of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, the Democrats are enabling the Government to get away with a badly drafted Bill which ignores many fundamental questions. This legislation, in its imperfect form, with the hard questions left unresolved, is more likely to end in costly litigation and bitter wrangling between Federal and State governments while extremists exploit the Australian Democrat amendments to feather their own nests. The coalition parties believe that a Senate standing committee is the proper body to look at the questions I have raised. Accordingly, I have moved the circulated amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a lot to reply to in what Senator Lewis said. I will start off with `sustainability'; that seems to be one of his sticking points. Perhaps he is right. Perhaps it would be a good idea to have a committee look at one thing-not necessarily the Resource Assessment Commission Bill but the concept of sustainability and other matters, as has been presented in a book entitled Our Own Future, of which apparently Senator Lewis is not aware. This is actually the report of the Royal Commission on Environment and Development. It is called the Brundtland report; it is named after its Chairman, Gro Harlem Brundtland, who is the Prime Minister of Norway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This book is universally considered to be a well reasoned plan for the survival of the human race in the late twentieth century and beyond. It spells out `sustainability'. I quote from chapter 2 on page 43, headed `Towards Sustainable Development':</PARA>
<PARA> Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It contains within it two key concepts:</PARA>
<PARA>the concept of `needs', in particular the essential needs of the world's poor, to which overriding priority should be given; and</PARA>
<PARA>the idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organisation on the environment's ability to meet present and future needs. </PARA>
<PARA>We are trying to preserve the environment not for its own sake but so that it can support us, or provide a habitat for human beings. I am sure that Senator Lewis would like to continue to live on this earth and I am sure that his children and his children's children would like to live on this earth. But it is becoming increasingly obvious that what we are doing to our habitat is not sustainable; that it will not sustain our life. I think Senator Lewis would agree with that. That is the definition. There is no argument with that. </PARA>
<PARA> `Ecological integrity' is the same. We have a definition for that. We do not need to have a committee. I rather doubt that a committee could arrive at decisions of these sorts. I do not think a committee would be capable of it. </PARA>
<PARA> As I read the amendment that Senator Lewis has moved, I find it basically preservation of States rights. If there is any one single factor that has kept Australia from becoming a major nation on the face of this earth it is States rights. We really need to eliminate the States and get on with the job of running this country as a single country. After all, its population is only 17 or 18 million people. Can we afford the luxury of all these petulant little States competing with each other to give away our resources, to sell off our woodchips, to sell off coal at the cheapest price and to sell off power? No; we need a federally planned economy and environmental policy to deal with the problems. These problems do not stop at State borders. They cross State lines and they should be dealt with federally. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know where the shadow Minister for the environment and the arts is during this debate. Where is Senator Puplick? Senator Lewis is capably carrying this debate but I thought Senator Puplick was interested in the environment and was hoping to become the Minister for the environment in the Liberal Government, if there ever is one. I expected him to be speaking in this debate but he is not. The Opposition has moved an amendment. The Australian Democrats will not support it. We feel that it is nothing but another sop to those who would put States rights ahead of the development of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me get on with the Bill itself. We feel that the Bill is a step in the right direction. To be completely on the right track, the new commission should not be called the Resource Assessment Commission; it should be called the Environment Assessment Commission. I think it is time that we reversed the onus of proof. We are still getting into the situation where development is assumed to be a good thing. The environmental arguments then have to be put up to show that the environmental damage will be so great that the development should not go ahead. I think the environment should be put first. Any development should be considered to be harmful to the environment, which it is, and the developers should be forced to argue their case rather than the environmentalists mount their argument. This Bill is a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment, Government decisions are often based on data which is not complete and is often biased. Much of the data that the Government receives is from industry because it has the facilities and it can hire the consultants. Much of the information comes from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy rather than the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. This means that it is biased, and rightly so. If the Department is in the business of promoting industry, and if primary industry is part of the Minister's portfolio, why not be biased in the direction of industry? It is biased in this direction. It is up to the environment movement to lobby as hard as it can on every issue to try to get some balance. This decision to set up the Resource Assessment Commission (RAC) will, I hope, redress that by allowing another agency to look at these decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> We in the environmental movement have had a number of misgivings about this Bill. One of the greatest ones was that the mining and timber industries and the National Farmers Federation seem to support it wholeheartedly. This is a worry. I do not think it is enough of a worry to vote against the Bill merely because these people support it. Maybe they do not understand it fully. Another worry to the environmental movement is that we would be put in the position of continually making submissions, as in the case of the Helsham Committee of Inquiry into the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests, which saps the strength and the financial resources-which are somewhat meagre-of the environmental movement. We do not want to have to be put in the position where we are constantly responding to the requirements of a commission for information. Another worry was the pro-development bias on the commission itself. Under the Act, the Industries Assistance Commission and the Australian Science and Technology Council would be involved in appointing the commissioners. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industries Assistance Commission by its very name is development oriented. The Australian Science and Technology Council has often shown itself to be development oriented. We addressed these problems and approached the Government. We arrived with a package of amendments, which will be moved in the committee stage, which go a long way to convincing us that this will be a worthwhile commission once it is established. One of our major amendments is that when a matter relates to the National Estate, the Australian Heritage Commission shall give evidence about the matter to the inquiry. This is a mechanism for giving the Australian Heritage Commission, which is very much concerned with the environment, an input into the Resource Assessment Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Another amendment involves creating a mechanism so that people who testify before the Commission can be reimbursed for their expenses in travelling to the hearings and, in certain cases, can be remunerated for the development of data. It reads expressly:</PARA>
<PARA> If the chairperson considers it appropriate a person who gives evidence to or produces documents at an inquiry may be paid such remuneration as is prescribed for the performance of work involved in collecting and preparing the evidence or documents. </PARA>
<PARA>This is very important because, unlike the mining industry, the timber industry and all the development interests in general, environmentalists work in their spare time. They have to have other employment to support themselves. They cannot just pay vast amounts of money, as the developers can, for their data. They cannot hire consultants. So this amendment goes a long way towards making the fight more fair so that the environmental movement can come up with information to counteract that of the developers. </PARA>
<PARA> The other set of amendments has already been referred to by Senator Lewis. They involve the concepts of sustainability, ecological integrity and the other things I have already mentioned which basically flow from the Brundtland report. After all, this is only common sense. If we intend to live on this earth for any length of time, we must take care of our habitat. We have not been doing so to this point. </PARA>
<PARA> The Resource Assessment Commission will go a long way towards resolving our difficulties. It should come up with enough data so that we can finally resolve the difficulties inherent in the timber industry. The first reference, I understand, will be a reference about the timber industry, to look at sustainability, to look at plantations, to study alternatives to present practices. This is imperative because, although what is happening in the south-east forests of New South Wales is at the focus of our attention now, forestry all over the country needs to be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is timely. We have entered a new environmental era. The people of the world are demanding environmental action. The days of confrontation may be coming to an end. I sincerely hope that they are. I do not like going out and getting arrested in forests. No-one does. Confrontation is a stopgap measure. It is not the final solution. We must feel that we are working together on these matters. The RAC will give us that opportunity. Our present environmental problems are now so serious that we have to try every possible mechanism to halt the destruction of our habitat. We support the Bill. We do not support the Opposition amendments. We foreshadow amendments in the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I strongly support the principle of the Resource Assessment Commission Bill but I have some problems with the content of it, particularly now that the Government has done a pretty sordid deal with the Australian Democrats to make this Bill, it seems to me, much less effective and certainly much more subject to absurd pressure in its amended form. The deal done with the Democrats underlines the need for this otherwise sound proposal to be subjected to the detailed scrutiny of a Senate committee. There is no doubt that the significant changes being imposed on the Bill by the Australian Democrats as part of the deal to get it through will disadvantage those projects that should proceed and disadvantage the structure of the proposed Resource Assessment Commission (RAC). Some of us took the initial response that the Resource Assessment Commission proposal must be a good idea because Senator Sanders in particular initially vehemently opposed it. If Senator Sanders opposes something it is per se clearly of benefit. I quote from Senator Sanders's press release earlier this month on the Resource Assessment Commission Bill:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is obvious that the RAC would be of great benefit to the developers in their efforts to rip off Australia's environment. The Opposition has always supported the developers rather than the environment. It looks like they are running true to form. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Sanders pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the RAC would enable the Government to side-step difficult environmental decisions by referring them to a Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the same Senator Sanders who has just given a speech in support of the proposal. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Sanders" NAMEID="1J4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is absolutely right. Senator Sanders did a deal which damages the fabric of the legislation. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Not only will the RAC protect the Government from public pressure, but the RAC itself will inevitably be development oriented through its Commissioners being appointed by the Industries Assistance Commission and the Australian Science and Technology Council. </PARA>
<PARA>Quite frankly, the amendment that the Australian Democrats have moved does not change that part of Senator Sanders's objection. For him to come in here and say, `We have done a deal' which makes the Bill acceptable to him means that we have to examine very closely indeed the vehement original objection which has now been replaced by his endorsement. That is one of the reasons why it is absolutely vital that this legislation which, as I have said, was sound in principle and which in fact embraces quite a few of the policy thrusts of the coalition's resources policy, must now be sent to a Senate committee to find out, apart from anything else, why Senator Sanders is so happy about it. All Australians should twitch every time Senator Sanders comes out in strong support of something, particularly something that until very recently he has strongly opposed. Those changes must be examined. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the industries involved are in favour of a Resource Assessment Commission, and sensibly so. They have been mucked around and the people of Australia have suffered the financial consequences of a succession of irresponsible, unfounded and unsustainable attacks on almost every development without those attacks being presented and judged in any competent forum. One can hardly call the Cabinet room of this Government a competent forum, because that is where the decisions have had to be taken. </PARA>
<PARA> This Commission will require those people who make these mad protests, and whose volume of noise has been the prime factor in influencing decisions, to come before a skilled forum where their case will be examined by people who know what they are doing. The bluster and nonsense we continually hear from Senator Sanders and his friends in this place will be tested in that forum. I hope the volume of noise and of political expediency which has been so prominent in the past will no longer be a factor. The Resource Assessment Commission will simply be an adviser to the Government, which can then continue to take its politically expedient decisions as it does. But at least the case will be argued, as with the Industries Assistance Commission, on the public record for people to see just how expedient the Government has been in making a decision which is not in line with the recommendations of the RAC. </PARA>
<PARA> To give an indication of the sort of support for the principle of the thing, it is evident that the National Farmers Federation, for example, has consistently sought a formal balance in the way land use decisions are handled by the Government. It welcomed the decision of the Government to establish the Resource Assessment Commission. The same goes for the National Association of Forest Industries and the Australian Mining Industry Council (AMIC). </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, the key point is that Mr Kerin and Senator Cook, the two Government Ministers having resource portfolios, had to do something to create order out of the chaos being created by Senator Richardson in his sudden discovery of the joys of being green. Knowing Senator Richardson's background, his motivation is no doubt closely connected to his capacity to count the numbers. Senator Richardson is renowned throughout Australia as a very competent political animal. He has recognised the political reality of the need to attract votes from those people who quite genuinely are concerned about the environment. But on the other side of that coin Mr Kerin and Senator Cook who are responsible for Australia being able to survive the economic crisis it is now in-and that task will be difficult-have recognised that there is a clear need to reduce the impact of electoral environmental policies on issues of national economic importance so that they can be discussed and decisions taken in a rational and coherent way which examines the sometimes hysterically false, but nonetheless on the surface plausible, case being put up by people like Senator Sanders, who are much more full of noise than fact in so many of the matters that they raise. </PARA>
<PARA> As the National Farmers Federation said, clearly the Bill does not stem from Senator Richardson's office. It certainly does not reflect the hand of the environmental movement which widely attacked it. The Australian Conservation Foundation and other conservation groups did not even accept an invitation from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to attend a review of the draft legislation. There were some problems with the legislation even before the Australian Democrats made such a mess of it in this deal with the Government. Clearly, there is an attack on States rights--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crichton-Browne says, `You're not wrong'. Many people take the view, as I certainly do, that it is absolutely vital to maintain States rights, not for any historic reason but because of the simple practical fact that it is vital to divide power in Australia and not let it be concentrated in one set of hands. The old axiom of Lord Acton that power tends to corrupt and absolute power tends to corrupt absolutely is as apposite now as it was at the beginning of the century. It is notable that when States have powers in a federal structure there is a diminished prospect of centralised power being used improperly and dictatorship emerging. It is notable that after the war the Americans imposed a federal republic structure on West Germany to ensure that power would not be centralised in one set of hands. I must say that there are some people in this Government I would not like to see with absolute power.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even with the little they have they are dangerous enough. The discussion about whether or not there should be States rights must be seen in the context of whether Australians want people such as Mr Keating to have absolute power over all governmental activities in Australia, or whether they would rather have perhaps a slightly less efficient system under which power was limited and those politicians who sought to exercise that kind of absolute power-sometimes, one feels, not necessarily for the benefit of the people of Australia-were prevented from doing so. Every member of this Parliament should recognise that there is a real need to preserve and protect the institution of State governments to ensure that power is spread and not allowed to collect in too few hands, enabling it to be exercised to the disadvantage of Australians in an authoritarian way. So often we see that governments around the world-for example, the Government of China-have centralised power: no effective State system and no splitting up of the power. For instance, in Australia the police are under the control of State governments but the Army is under the control of the Federal Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no doubt in my mind that the Bill impinges on the rights and powers of the States. I believe it is wrong that the Bill does not require at least consultation with the States on this matter because, after all, the States do have and must have the right to determine the use of their resources. There are some problems in that area. That is another matter that the Opposition proposes, quite properly, to refer to the Senate committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is concerned about the confidentiality provisions. We do not think that they have been coped with adequately. That matter will be dealt with at the committee stage of the Bill. There is one thing I would commend in view of the fact that the Government's organisations have behaved so appallingly in reporting to the Parliament-that is, the Bill requires that the Commission prepare an annual report and that the Minister table the report within 25 days of its receipt. That is a much overdue change for the better and I hope that the Commission will meet that obligation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Resource Assessment Commission Bill does not even recognise the primary role of the States in land use questions, let alone allow them a role in referring projects for inquiry, or even helping in the selection of special commissioners and consultants. The States, therefore, are concerned that the terms of reference could be loaded. The Bill imposes yet another layer of bureaucratic delay on resource industries. Nonetheless, the thrust of the legislation is to the advantage of the resource industries in the sense that they can discuss these matters in a clear forum and a balanced and non-emotive assessment of land use issues in such a forum is certainly, as the AMIC pointed out, far preferable to the ad hoc approach which has prevailed under this Government in recent years. The Mining Industry Council says that there have been:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . outrageous claims in relation to environmental impact, without any risk that those claims will have to be justified before an independent scientific inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>That was evident in the Wesley Vale pulp mill debate. AMIC says:</PARA>
<PARA>This has resulted in a series of increasingly important setbacks for the resource industries, including exploration rights in Kakadu Stage I, Stage II and most of Stage III; the Queensland Wet Tropics World Heritage Listing, and the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests decision. Areas currently under siege include the Kakadu Conservation Zone, the New South Wales Southern Forests, the Nullarbor and the Kimberley. </PARA>
<PARA>AMIC considers that the prospect of balanced land use decisions reflecting multiple land use philosophies and the concept of sustainable development would be enhanced by the establishment of the Resource Assessment Commission. I agree with that, provided that the Commission's behaviour is rational and it is staffed by Mr Kerin and Senator Cook and not Senator Richardson. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Crichton-Browne says, it is only the behaviour of this Government that makes it necessary to introduce such a Bill. As AMIC points out, the behaviour of the Government in the last few years has created the tensions and uncertainties that make the Bill necessary. The Opposition, as I said, is concerned about questions of consultation with the States and confidentiality of evidence at the request of the witness. AMIC says it supports these amendments. It should, because they are sensible and would improve the working of the Bill. The Australian Democrats change of heart on this should be a matter of major concern to all Australians because they had indicated clear opposition. Their motive for opposing it at that time was undoubtedly, as AMIC says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . their awareness that the intellectual capacity and effort needed to establish conservation arguments within the context of better mechanisms is far greater than that involved in gaining media exposure, organising demonstrations and making extreme and unchallenged claims. </PARA>
<PARA>That is one of the reasons I strongly support the principle of this Bill. One would hope that environmental issues, when they affect development, would be discussed in an environment in which rational and coherent behaviour would predominate, rather than the argument of the demonstration, the noise, the extreme and the unchallenged claims which simply cannot be sustained. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point with respect to the requirement for such a Bill is that it is always open to the Government to initiate an environmental inquiry under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. That Act contains none of the safeguards provided for the Resource Assessment Commission. There is no doubt that the Commission is a better way of dealing with the matter than the legislative arrangements presently available to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to deal very briefly with the amendments proposed by the Australian Democrats which are absolutely ludicrous. For example, there is no definition of the word `sustainability' in the Bill. Sustainability is a matter of such substance that Senator Sanders directed our attention to a book in which it is defined. When Senator Sanders gets around to defining sustainability in the legislation so that it has some binding effect, we could look at his amendments with a little more equanimity. We have no idea what is meant by that. We have no idea of what is meant by an `equitable' distribution on return of resources. The questions raised by these amendments are so great that they must be referred to a committee for this legislation to be coherent. For example, the amendment says that a person who gives evidence to or produces documents at an inquiry may be paid such remuneration as is prescribed. I ask who will prescribe it and, further, why is the word `reasonable' excluded from that part of the amendment. The word `reasonable' appears in the second part where it says that a person should be reimbursed such expenses, or compensated for such losses, as were reasonably incurred'. There need be no reasonableness about the remuneration prescribed. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a real risk of an open-ended cheque-basically an employment cheque-to be given to environmentalists to generate a profession of objecting to proposals. Those professional objectors will be paid for by the taxpayers of Australia. It is absolutely incredible. Already the Government provides multi-millions of dollars to the conservation movement in one way or another--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Some of the money has been washed through other conservation bodies and appears in campaign funds for elections, being used against the Opposition. In recent cases I understand that it also has been used against the Labor Party. It seems absolutely ludicrous that we are generating a profession of paid agitators who will receive a benefit by objecting to development projects in Australia, projects which are in the best economic interests of the people of Australia and which will, under this proposal, be subject to proper scrutiny. Why the Government should have agreed to allow for the payment of professional stirrers is beyond me. Surely there are better ways of making certain that the environmental case can be presented effectively rather than by this pay-off deal which has been done with the Democrats in order to pass this legislation without it being examined closely. This is an absolute disgrace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am disappointed that at this stage the Commission does have the appearance of being excessively legalistic. I have no derogatory comments about Mr Justice Stewart who will chair the Commission; the problem seems to be that a judicial appointment to that position is not necessarily an appropriate one in this area. To my knowledge Mr Justice Stewart has no professional expertise in resource matters. I would much rather have seen the appointment of a chairman who had general expertise in the resource use and planning area. As the chairman will be required to provide continuity between inquiries, it clearly is a vital appointment. The appointee needs to be more than impartial and experienced in the conduct of judicial inquiries. The chairman should be seeking to bring consensus. We have seen the outcome when there was not consensus in the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests Commission of Inquiry. The minority and majority reports meant that the Government was given very little guidance. The Government has to think more effectively about what it is trying to achieve with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks by saying that I strongly support the concept of the Resource Assessment Commission. I regret that the Labor Party has now so destroyed the integrity of that proposal by accepting the Democrats amendments to it that the matter should be sent to a committee for examination, even though that would cause delay in the passage of the legislation. It is such an important issue that we should be concentrating on getting it right, rather than on getting it through, no matter what the cost. That is the approach the Government has taken-getting it through no matter what the cost-by doing this deal with the Democrats. It has damaged the fabric of this legislation so significantly that Senator Sanders and his colleagues who totally opposed it at the outset are now prepared to support it. That is sufficient evidence to dramatise the importance of the Opposition's amendment referring the matter to a committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like my colleague Senator Michael Baume, I believe that the establishment of the Resource Assessment Commission has some merit. The concept of the Commission is to be supported as it embraces a great many of the coalition's own environmental policies. The Government should acknowledge that it has the support of the coalition as far as the concept and the objective of the Commission has been defined. However, the Resource Assessment Commission Bill 1989 has been brought into the Senate in haste. There are many gaps in the legislation. The drafting of it has been born out of the wrong reactions and for wrong reasons. Add to that the Australian Democrats' amendments, which I believe the Government will support, and the Bill has changed face. As the coalition amendment recommends, the matter should be taken to a Senate committee to answer many of the pressing questions, such as States rights. That is one of the most important unanswered questions in this Bill on which we are not satisfied. The Government should realise that there can be across the board support for the establishment of this Commission but, first, we must get it right; we must take it to a Senate committee and bring that committee's report back to this Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many questions have to be asked about the Democrats' proposed amendments. The coalition rejects them out of hand. In particular, I draw the Senate's attention to the payment by the Commonwealth of such expenses as travelling expenses and other costs-the costs of putting submissions together; the costs of who knows what-which should be examined by the Senate committee. Exactly how far and wide will these costs be? What are the limits? As Senator Baume pointed out, this has damaged the whole fabric and intent of the Commission. It is now not the same Bill that the coalition would support or, indeed, which the resource industries would support. </PARA>
<PARA> The resource industries got behind the basic concept of the Commission but now must also question its establishment, should this legislation be passed today. The reported role of the Commission in the early days was to hold inquiries in a similar manner to that of the Industries Assistance Commission. We have no argument with that. The aim was to establish and report to the Government on a far more balanced use of resources and to consider the question of genuine environmental concerns. In other words, the principles underlying the Commission stress the need for an integrated approach-something that Senator Sanders might have to come to grips with in the years to come-between the efficient use of our resources and the genuine, not extremist, conservationist concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> This Commission had a chance to integrate those two worthy concerns. Above all, it had the task of tackling these issues early before they came onto the political agenda, exploded into the media and political opportunist like Senator Sanders took hold of them in the spotlight of television-the 30-second grab-utterly distorting the argument. The Commission had a chance to be able to stop those types of media explosions, to get a proper, balanced and integrated argument on the table and be able to produce the facts and not the 30-second grabs on television. The Commission was going to be pro-active rather than reactive. This present situation is a product of the mess that the Government has created by allowing the environmental question to get right out of hand. The Government has been unable to mesh the two major concerns-to promote development and sustain the environment. Too often the Labor Government has found itself caught, due to its lack of cohesive national strategy, in a media war between the environmentalists and the mining or forestry industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been quite satisfied to lurch from issue to issue according to the political climate, making its decisions according to the political climate and what State or region the issue happens to be in. Almost invariably the extremist element of the conservationist movement has taken hold of the debate in a senseless manner. Each time, led by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) the Government has caved in to their demands and their radical claims. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth again pointing out to the Government that the resource industries originally believed that the whole concept of this independent assessment commission was quite worthy. That is what we are looking for. That is what both sides of the chamber are looking for. </PARA>

He was the one who said he wanted to be on the gravy train. Let us go back and look at Hansard. I want to get back to this Bill. I do not want to be distracted by such irrelevancies as Senator Sanders. The types of groups that were interested in an independent commission were the National Association of Forest Industries, the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association, the Fishing Industry Research and Development Council, the Australian Mining Industry Council and the National Farmers Federation. That is a pretty worthy group to support the independent commission. Their support was based on the fact that we would get a level headed forum where both views could be put on the table and the arguments could be studied intricately, properly and out of the heat of the media debate. That would certainly reduce the influence of the politics of opportunism which surrounds the conservation issue today and would reduce many extreme tactics of conservationists who attempt to simplify the argument within the 30-second grab on television or on the doorstep.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commission was born out of the Wesley Vale debacle, in which probably sensible heads within the Government-the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, and even the Minister for Resources, Senator Cook-believed that this country could not afford such senseless and simplistic disputes again. We simply could not afford it all because of our current account crisis. We had to address these problems to get the proper balance between the two parties. The result is a major defeat for Senator Richardson and his extremist greenies. There is no question about that. This Commission was a major defeat prior to the Democrats' amendments. One could say that Senator Richardson has come back from the grave now because the Government has turned this Commission into nothing more than the financing arm of the extremist greenies.

<PARA> The second matter that has already been mentioned is States rights. Certainly the States have not even been properly consulted on this Resource Assessment Commission. Their views have not been heard. The role of the Commission has not been properly explained to the States. So there is a concern, particularly when one thinks that the Resource Assessment Commission will be going into State areas, crossing the boundaries and touching on very sensitive areas, projects and State jurisdictions; and so the list goes on. The whole question of States rights is probably the most important point that the Senate committee should address. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point that should be addressed by the Senate committee is the confidentiality requirements. This is very important, especially for the resource companies. No resource company would wish to give a full account of the viability of a project if it knew that its competitors were able to view its case. There must be a degree of confidentiality by the Commission so as to build a confidence in its work. That is not too much to ask for. That is something that the Senate committee should look at. It would really add a great deal of strength to the Resource Assessment Commission, should it be established, and would allow the resource companies to come to the Resource Assessment Commission in full confidence. Otherwise we will witness a disintegration of the so-called environmental debate into opportunist politics and media spectacles, at a great loss to the development of our resources.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recognise the fact and the coalition recognises the fact. We have been trying to tell this Government and Senator Sanders's loonies for the past four to five years that Australia faces its most grave economic crisis. What we should be attempting to achieve is a balance between the development of our resources and the environmental issues. There are genuine concerns. No-one argues that. It is when the extremists take hold of the debate that I am concerned. Australia's standard of living is affected by such extremist attitudes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia has enormous reserves of wealth that need to be called upon in these times. The exploitation of these resources must be determined by careful assessment of the environment and economic considerations. For example, Australia has vast untapped uranium resources. Australia has almost one-third of the world's uranium supplies and deposits, yet it markets only 10 per cent onto the world market. On the other hand, Canada has 10 per cent of the world's reserves but almost one-third of the world market. The difference between Australia and Canada directly results from Australia's three-mine policy. </PARA>
<PARA> A rational uranium policy fostered by the deliberations of a group such as the Resource Assessment Commission could increase exports by at least $1.6 billion per year. The Government's Bureau of Mineral Resources has estimated that onshore oil explorations alone have the potential to unearth 200 million barrels in the next 10 years. At $20 per barrel that amounts to $4 billion, which is a highly significant figure in the context of the forecast of $5.5 billion annual bill for oil imports by 1998. The $5.5 billion annual oil import bill will be the result of a drop in Australia's crude oil self-sufficiency from 96 per cent in 1986 to only 28 per cent in 10 years time. Oil reserves are available in Australia to at least reduce, if not prevent, this blow-out. An innovative and efficient petroleum industry exists. What does not exist is a government prepared to take the tough decisions now that will benefit Australians for generations to come. </PARA>
<PARA> The list of untapped resources goes on. It includes coal of all types, $500 billion; mineral sands, $1,000m; copper, $32 billion; uranium, $36 billion, as I have already mentioned; gold, $20 billion of untapped resources; bauxite, $57 billion worth of untapped resources, and iron ore, $316 billion worth of untapped resources. </PARA>
<PARA> I recently served on the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts which was inquiring into the Kakadu National Park. The report entitled The Potential of the Kakadu National Park Region outlined the outstanding resource base of that region. It is well known to this Senate that the Jabiluka deposit contains a known uranium resource twice as large as Ranger. Its gold deposits are the highest grade of any Australian mine. Pancontinental Mining Ltd, which holds about 65 per cent interest in the joint venture seeking to develop the Jabiluka project, told the Committee that the gross value of resources was in excess of $20 billion. The Koongarra project also has some equally stunning figures which show the damage being done by not proceeding with these projects with due concern for the environment. We are missing out on valuable exports. If it is any consolation to this Government, it is missing out on some valuable taxes. I know how interested it is in taxes. It seems to be more interested in taxing the households of Australia than in taking advantage of our mineral resources and taxing some companies legitimately. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am still referring to Kakadu National Park, one of the most interesting statistics and lost opportunities is that the local Aboriginal people, by not developing these projects, are missing out on an estimated $256m. </PARA>

It is absolutely necessary to have this debate, otherwise Australians will face an ever decreasing standard of living. It is no joke any more. The Government had the chance, with the support of the coalition, with the support of the resource companies, and with the support of the more sensible environmental groups, to really balance this debate, to bring the parties together; but now that chance has been ruined, and sadly so. A properly composed commission could prevent some of the crazy political green groups from springing up. I want people to understand what I mean by that. I am talking about extremists.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Resource Assessment Commission Bill 1989, which comes to us as a result of the internecine machinations that have been taking place in the Australian Labor Party and more particularly in Cabinet in recent months, and as a result of particular and direct conflict between Senator Richardson and Mr Kerin and, to a lesser extent, Senator Cook. It is as a result of the conduct of this Government that the Bill is necessary in the first place. I observe that the major industry bodies have given their tacit but, I suggest, reluctant support to the legislation. They are of the view that the only way that the economic rationalists in the Government are going to start to win some of the arguments is to have the arguments on the table, to have them examined as objectively as possible by the Resource Assessment Commission, but that very much depends on the composition of the Commission-and I will come to that in a minute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clearly, industry is gravely disturbed-perhaps from Australia's economic point of view-by the pyrrhic victories that Senator Richardson has been having to this point over the more sensible and economic rationalists in the Government. We have on one side those who are making hard-headed, brutal and crude decisions as to what is in the best interests of this Government as distinct from what is in the best interests of the country pitted against what one might describe as the political realists on the other side, those who are able to make measured judgments about what is good and necessary for this country. </PARA>
<PARA> That was highlighted in the Wesley Vale pulp mill debate. Some members of the Government understood the intrinsic virtue and the economic value of the Wesley Vale project but Senator Richardson and others were concerned primarily with votes and what was in the best interests of this Government. A fundamental economic base has been lost to Tasmania and to Australia as a result of the interference of the Federal Government, using a head of power that the founding fathers never conceived would be used by any government for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the Resource Assessment Commission will become the chief decision maker on all major resource development projects. It will be but another layer of bureaucracy imposed upon those who are trying to get on with the job of developing the abundance of natural resources with which God blessed our country. I rather wonder, for instance, whether the massive iron ore projects in the north-west of Western Australia would ever have got off the ground if in those days we had had a Resource Assessment Commission. It was only as a result of the diligence, efforts and dedication of the Western Australian Government at the time that those projects went ahead. They went ahead in spite of the Federal Government, which was saying that they could not and should not go ahead because Australia had limited iron ore reserves. Of course, once they got the go ahead and started to exploit and explore more they discovered, because of the incentive provided to them, the enormous reserves of iron ore in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen what this country offers to us even when the Government has limited control over the resource potential. We only have to look at the Kakadu region in the Northern Territory where the Federal Government has retained the management of those resources. We have seen the uranium industry in which Australia has 30 per cent of the world's known low cost uranium reserves but 10 per cent of the world market. We can compare that with Canada, which has 10 per cent of the world's known low cost uranium reserves but 30 per cent of the world market. Why is there that imbalance? It is because the Federal Government intervenes, imposes its will and seeks to make commercial decisions which are better made by industry at the coal face. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the Government telling us that we can sell uranium only at a floor price which is above the world market price. Inevitably, we miss contracts. We now find that Energy Resources of Australia Ltd has had inflicted upon it for the renewal of its uranium contracts floor prices that are above world prices. This means that potentially we will lose $1.1 billion worth of contracts, because this Government knows better than the marketplace! I fear that that will be the result for others now that the Government has taken the final quantum step of seeking to legitimise its involvement in resource areas and those areas that are fundamentally and historically State responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat the point made by Senator Michael Baume in his address when he referred to the heavy emphasis on the legalistic nature of this Commission. It is certainly no reflection on Judge Stewart when I say that I think he is an inappropriate appointee as Chairman. He has a fine background in those areas where he has experience and knowledge, but in no way does his experience relate to making judgments on and balancing the resource demand imperatives on the one hand and conservation considerations on the other. At the end of the day the composition of this Commission will be fundamental to its decisions, deliberations and determinations. I note that clause 11 determines-as is not unusual in these types of commissions:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioners shall be appointed by the Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA>That simply means that they are Government appointments. If, in the scales of the deliberations, the Government has, as I suspect it will, a heavy emphasis in its appointment of commissioners on people who have a known concern for the environment, we can expect that the decisions will be distorted to that extent. I would have thought that under the circumstances somebody much more appropriate than a judge should head this Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 16 (1), when referring to resource matters being referred to the Commission, states:</PARA>
<PARA> Where the Commonwealth Government or a Commonwealth authority may, in the exercise of its powers, make a decision in relation to a resource matter, the Minister may, by written notice to the Chairperson, require the Commission to conduct an inquiry into the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>That clause states `may, in the exercise of its powers'. The Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), who is at the table, would know better than most that there is a difference between the exercise of powers which are visited upon it daily and the exercise of those powers which it seeks to pursue by redefining and reinterpreting the provisions of the Constitution, which this Government has done over the last six years. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 51 of the Constitution is a good example. The external affairs power was never intended, never imagined and never proposed to relate to conservation and the environment. How could our Founding Fathers, when they were drafting those words, have ever imagined that an external affairs power could be used by a government in the future to take unto itself residual powers previously intended for the States in respect of conservation? So, when the Government talks about `in the exercise of its powers', it is really talking about powers by pursuit-powers that it has taken unto itself as a result of its own endeavours and extending the Constitution to the very limit.</PARA>
<PARA> My other concern in terms of logistical problems with the Commission is that there will be another gap between companies looking at projects and ultimately being able to make decisions. I am reminded of the Western Mining Corporation's often repeated example of Kambalda, where I think two State government agencies were required to grant approval for the mining of nickel. I think that in the State Government alone about 35 agencies are now required to give approval before a project can commence. Operators will now have imposed upon them the Resource Assessment Commission, which no doubt will be directed to give consideration to and make deliberations in respect of all major resource projects. Because of the inevitable backlog of work, there will be a considerable delay between the time a company decides to commence a project and when approval is given to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I am absolutely stunned when I see the Australian Democrats amendment that the Government has agreed to. It is absolutely breathtaking in its audacity. In part, it states:</PARA>
<PARA> (3) If the Chairperson considers it appropriate, a person who gives evidence to, or produces documents at, an inquiry may be:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) paid such remuneration as is prescribed for the performance of work involved in collecting and preparing the evidence or documents . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Can honourable senators believe it? It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>or (b) reimbursed such expenses, or compensated for such losses, as were reasonably incurred in collecting and preparing the evidence or documents;</PARA>
<PARA>or both. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an open cheque for every looney organisation in this country to spend a fortune constructing their arguments against the exploitation and development of every single project in Australia at any given time. </PARA>

Every time a project is about to get off the drawing board, whether for uranium, oil, bauxite or gold, there will be pressure on the Federal Government through this minority, this lobby group-albeit vocal, effective and articulate-upon the Resource Assessment Commission to take it as a term of reference. At every turn the whims and the wishes of these groups will be accommodated by this Government as they have been in the past. The Government has turned itself inside out to attract their vote.

It has finally discarded the pretence of being virginal. It has now plunged headlong into areas that, as I say, historically, intrinsically and inherently, have been intended for the States and were written into the Constitution in those clear and precise terms.

There is something fundamental and human about the belief in the devolution of power and the transfer of power nearest to the people to ensure that decision making is made and implemented in areas where it is most effective. This Government has adequately demonstrated what happens when we have a centralised decision making process by a government in Canberra, insulated, isolated and removed from the daily affairs of men. It is inevitable that those from Victoria, such as Senator Button, and those from New South Wales will not understand the subtlety of State responsibilities because those two States combined have more members in the House of Representatives from outer metropolitan Melbourne and Sydney alone than the total representation of the less populous States. So it is natural that they are insensitive to the concerns of people from the less populous and more remote States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We see this Bill, which, sadly, is going through in such a short time, as redefining and reshaping State and Federal responsibilities. The Bill before us deals exclusively with Australia's resources in whatever form they might be. The Bill sets up a commission to examine resources and competing interests, to examine whether exploitation of those resources collectively or individually is the best economic decision for Australia. The Bill has been set up to weigh all those things-if one is an altruist. The Bill does not once mention States or State governments. It does not accept, acknowledge or respect the sovereign responsibilities of the States. There is no provision in the Bill that requires cooperation or consultation with the States. The Bill enshrines for the Federal Government all responsibility for all decisions regarding the examination, development and exploitation of Australia's resources. I find it absolutely stunning that this Government has become so remote, so aloof, so arrogant and so detached from reality that it no longer even has a pretence or a facade of purporting to cooperate with the States. It no longer even acknowledges or recognises their rights. </PARA>
<PARA> As a lawyer, Senator Button would know that the Constitution, in terms of its separa- tion of powers, quite explicitly-not implicitly-provides that the resources and the resource potential of each of the States are exclusively a right for and responsibility of the States. There is no provision in the Constitution for any second-guessing or determination in respect of any matters affecting the resources of the States. But this Federal Government is using High Court decisions-the decision in the dams case is the benchmark, the watershed, in respect of the matter-to give it powers to interfere. As I say, this legislation is born out of the imbroglio that this Government has got itself into in terms of its domestic, in-house politics, the competing and conflicting debate that goes on regularly between the economic rationalists like Mr Kerin compared with the political hardheads like Senator Richardson. We now have before us this piece of legislation to resolve a domestic problem. It is not derived, determined or arrived at for the good of Australia, for the good of the economy or for the good of its people.

Senator Richardson has been winning most of the battles. At the end of the day, looking at where the votes are, it is the noisy, radical minority groups that have been winning the battles and losing the war for Australia. The industry has lobbied me, and presumably most of my colleagues, to support this Bill, not because it wants it, not because it thinks it has any intrinsic virtue and not because it thinks it is in its best interests, but simply because for the moment it is its best bet.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry I am so obviously inarticulate. I have spent 25 minutes explaining why I am opposed to it. I am setting out for the benefit of the Senate why, as they say in the vernacular these days, the industry is between a rock and a hard place. The reason the industry is supporting the Commission is that it judges that, at least if there is a commission, it has got half a chance of having its argument heard. It perhaps has some forlorn hope-I do not know; I hope not-that if a commission is set up it will be able to put its arguments up with equal weight, force and influence to that of the environmentalists who right now, because of the votes they carry in their bags, are winning all the battles. The industry judges that with this Commission it will all be out on the table. It will be heard in equal measure with the conservation lobby. At the end of the day, the economic rationalists in the Government hope that the Commission will deliver unto them logical and reasonable arguments in support of these projects which, so far, have been falling over the edge in the desperate scramble and in the dying days of this failed Government, which hopes it is going to survive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has prostituted Australia's resources, the welfare and the best interests of this country in a desperate last grab to survive in office. That is why I suspect that at the end of the day we will end up with a half Senate election so that the Government can postpone the election day until November 1990. I was going to say that the Government hopes to God that something will turn up, but it cannot do that because we have a Prime Minister who is an atheist. He hopes to somebody that something is going to turn up, that something around the corner will come along and that something will happen to the Opposition. At the end of the day, we are all afflicted with the Resource Assessment Commission Bill. We are moving that it should be sent to a committee to give that committee the opportunity to consider a number of matters which we believe go to the heart of our concerns about the Bill. We have two amendments that Senator Austin Lewis will be moving in the committee stage. One touches upon the States rights responsibilities--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to discuss the need for a national approach to major, complex and contentious resource use issues, as most resource issues do not observe State borders and would benefit from a unified approach to management, which is the stated intent of the Resource Assessment Commission Bill. Therefore, I will not be supporting the amendments to be moved by the Opposition. I think the community would also welcome a balanced approach to resource management. It would also welcome access to resource information currently held by industry, which would allow members of the public to make more informed decisions about public resources. Senator Lewis would have this information enshrined in commercial in-confidence provisions and so perpetuate the biased basis of resource decisions. That is a problem that we have had in the past. That needs to be changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is also a rising wave of support in the community for a change in economic direction away from unnecessary environmental degradation for the quick buck and towards more sustainable forms of economic activity. The other measures announced in November last year in concert with this Bill, regarding increased resources for the Australian Heritage Commission and establishing new consultative processes with conservation and industry groups, are commendable steps towards redressing this imbalance. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Resource Assessment Commission Bill, stated by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, in his second reading speech, is to inquire into, and report on, the environmental, cultural, social, industry, economic or other aspects of resources and their uses. The Minister went on to say that the Commission would be expected to consider how resources may be used at present or in the future, looking at the kinds of values that individuals or groups in the community place on the resource or on the uses that can be made of it, including who will gain and who will lose in both material and non-material ways. Minister Kerin was reported in the Australian on 14 February to say that the investment climate for forestry had never looked better, thanks to, among other things, the proposed Resource Assessment Commission (RAC). It is not surprising, then, that industry groups have supported the proposed Commission and that conservationists are wary about its real purpose-a creation, as it is, of the development orientated Department of Primary Industries and Energy. </PARA>
<PARA> The utilitarian view of the environment is reflected in the definitions adopted in the Bill. For example, the word `sustainable' is not applied in relation to the definition of development. Instead, it is included in the definition of `conservation' as being `. . . the greatest sustainable benefit to present generations while maintaining its potential to meet the needs and aspirations of future generations . . .' The definition of conservation would have been improved if it went beyond strictly human use of the environment and made specific reference to the maintenance of genetic diversity in species and ecosystems. For as long as the attitude persists that the elements of the natural environment have value only in so far as they can be used by humans, there is a danger that we will continue to use them and lose them from under our noses. </PARA>
<PARA> The three policy principles which would guide the Commission in resolving competing resource use claims also raise concerns about the lack of ecologically based principles. The amendments put forward by the Australian Democrats address this imbalance and therefore should be supported. In the first guiding principle we are told that there should be an integrated approach to conservation and development. In an ideal sense, a balance sounds great. What is out of balance and has been out of balance since the arrival of white settlers in this country is our attitude to and treatment of the natural environment. Soil erosion figures of 90 million tonnes per annum, native species losses and dwindling native forests provide ample testimony to that. States rights have not been successful in redressing these problems. A national approach is absolutely essential. </PARA>
<PARA> How will the balance be restored through the Resource Assessment Commission? In the original Bill commissioners would have been appointed by two industry advocate groups: the Industries Assistance Commission and the Australian Science and Technology Council. Neither agency is known for its expertise in conservation matters. Such structural bias does not abide by the first principle of an integrated approach to conservation and development. The amendments to include the Australian Heritage Commission, which is known for its expertise in conservation matters, go some way to restore a semblance of balance to the nominating committee, though it is still not exactly even Steven. Here I must make mention of Senator McGauran's derogatory remarks about the Australian Heritage Commission. They cannot go unchallenged. He referred to the Commission as a mole as part of the RAC. Maybe that is not such an insult after all because moles, with their burrowing under the soil and their constant turning over and aeration of the soil, certainly understand the notion of sustainability, even though it is not understood by Senator Lewis, by his own admission. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IG4">Senator VALLENTINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. So maybe to call the Australian Heritage Commission a mole was not such an insult as Senator McGauran intended. Senator McGauran's comments about extremist greenies also show how out of touch he is with mainstream thinking in the Australian community at the moment. Conservationists are no longer seen as extremists. The things that have been said by the conservation movement for many years are now being accepted as mainstream community views. To call people who are concerned about the long term view of Australia's environment and the global environment extremists shows just how out of touch with current thinking some members of the Opposition are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps the most serious reservation about the integration principle is that it could be used to impose an integrated mix of conservation and development on those few areas reserved for the primary purpose of conservation-our national parks and nature reserves. This apprehension also applies to the third guiding principle of the proposed Resource Assessment Commission, that of providing for uses additional to the primary resource use to take place concurrently or sequentially. Concurrent use is commonly know as multiple use. The concept of multiple use has been abused in the past and is eagerly adopted by the mining industry to legitimise mining in areas of high conservation value. According to an article by John R. Burton published by the Australian Mining Industry Council, `multiple use invariably involves a trade-off between competitive uses and the working out of a compromise mix of uses'. </PARA>
<PARA> We know from history and the current orientation of most government ministries, including that of Primary Industries and Energy, that conservation rates a very low second in the majority of competitions for land use because it does not deliver an immediate return in the form of a fistful of dollars. The operation of the Resource Assessment Commission will be watched very carefully in this regard. Senator McGauran's comments reveal an attitude which is becoming obsolete in the community, that is, of an economy driven by dollars being ahead of all other considerations, particularly environmental considerations. That line of thinking does not count the cost of the environmental clean-ups that are necessary after many developments which wreak havoc with the environment. We have only to look at soil degradation in that regard. That example alone proves the point that the economy approach, driven by a dollar reward as the first and primary consideration, is very expensive in the long run. That has to be acknowledged. It is too expensive to take a dollars first attitude any longer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Another issue very clearly raised by Senator McGauran and Senator Crichton-Browne was that of uranium mining. That used to be a classic case of, `If there is a dollar in it, let us do it'. It is no longer so clearly the case now because the markets are in jeopardy. However, it is still the exploitative approach and that is what I am challenging. Uranium mining is totally environmentally unacceptable. I do not believe that an expansion of the mining industry in Australia will be allowed, because public opinion now is so firmly against the expansion of that industry which is seen to be environmentally very damaging. Forget about the possible use of uranium in dangerous nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons; look at the end result of uranium mining-the production of the most toxic kind of radioactive leftovers known to humanity. It is environmentally totally unacceptable. For people still to push uranium mining reveals their total lack of understanding of current thinking about environmental issues.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has Senator McGauran not heard about the greenhouse effect? Has he not heard that greenhouse gases are spewed into the atmosphere by coal fired power stations? I must say that he is not the only one who has not made that connection. The Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), who is in the chamber, also made the mistake of not acknowledging that connection of coal fired power stations having an impact on the greenhouse effect globally when I asked him a question about the proposed Mount Lesueur coal project in Western Australia. He said it was a matter for the States to look at, which again points up the necessity for this Resource Assessment Commission. The States are not responsible in making decisions about the global environment if they are driven by economic interests very close to home which do not take into account enough of the total and long term effect of the projects under consideration. That exploitative model must stop. If members of the Opposition have not yet tumbled to the fact that the people of Australia-indeed, of the globe-no longer accept the exploitative model, they relegate themselves to the Opposition benches for a very long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne mentioned that the RAC will be another layer of bureaucracy to stop people from getting on with the job. He is talking about the job of exploiting our resources. Wise management is absolutely essential. That is what the Commission is about: looking at possible projects; having an overall view of what the resources are; and considering the wise management of those resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne said that the legislation is not good for Australia; it is not designed to enhance our economy or the well-being of the people of Australia. These kinds of comments reveal, as has often been said, that politicians are often the last to pick up on changes in community attitudes. Perhaps it is because politicians far too often remove themselves from the thinking of people in the community. Senator Crichton-Browne called himself an anachronism. I am not saying anything about him that he has not said about himself. He revealed that his attitudes are totally illogical and that he is misreading the current climate of opinion in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that various industries support the Commission because they understand the reality of the need to negotiate about resource management better than the coalition does. The industries realise that no longer can they have it all their own way, which has been the situation in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> My final comment is in regard to public participation in decisions affecting public resources and the opportunities for necessary input into Resource Assessment Commission inquiries by groups representing the conservation interests of the community. These have been improved. They need to be very carefully watched. For public participation to have any real meaning, it must be facilitated early in the process when the terms of reference for inquiries are being determined. Otherwise community concerns about resource use and its long term implications will be too easily dismissed as being outside the official terms of reference, as they so often are in specific project impact assessments. I am disappointed that this is not included in the amendments accepted by the Government. It is at that early stage that community input is absolutely vital. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall the process embodied in the Resource Assessment Commission Bill-that of a more balanced approach to resource use in this country-will provide a more focused approach to problems such as land degradation, native vegetation retention, energy production and native species loss. I support the Bill and the amendments put forward by the Australian Democrats because I believe that, if managed wisely with a long view of development projects and their effects on the environment, the Resource Assessment Commission will begin to address seriously the issue of sustainability which is fundamental to our survival. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In replying to the second reading addresses of honourable senators, I do not wish to take up much time of the Senate other than to reassert that we are debating the Resource Assessment Commission Bill 1989. It is a Bill the Government has brought forward with widespread support of the community and industry organisations. It is a Bill that is based on our view of what the national conservation strategy for Australia requires governments to do. It is a Bill consistent with the report of the Brundtland Commission, Our common future, and the need to balance environmental aspirations of the community with those of the economic and developmental sectors. The purpose of the Bill is to provide an information base which makes the contending arguments clear, understandable and settled as far as they can be so that there is a platform for good decision making by government and so that good decision making can concentrate on finding win-win outcomes; wins for the environment and wins for the economic well-being of the community. It is desirable that, where it is in the public interest, those decisions be constructed so that both sides benefit. Where those outcomes cannot be constructed in that way, governments have to make decisions. It is important that they make decisions based on the widest canvassing of arguments, the widest understanding of contending points of view and a clear common understanding of the issues. I commend this Bill to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is now urgent to pass this legislation because, increasingly these days and more so in the future, governments will be judged in terms of their performance in office not only on how they handle economic management but also on how they handle development and environmental issues. That will be a hallmark of good judgment and good government in future. It is important that we equip ourselves with the instruments to conduct government in that way from now on, urgently. Thus, I reject the coalition motion to refer this matter to a committee. I indicate that the Government will be supporting the amendments to be moved by the Australian Democrats to strengthen the Bill but rejecting those to be moved by the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) Page 5, clause 14, line 5, paragraph (b), insert ``the Australian Heritage Commission,'' after ``of''. </PARA>
<PARA>I move this amendment for the reason, as I mentioned in my speech in the second reading debate, that the Australian Heritage Commission is concerned with the environment and should have an input into the system. While I am on my feet, I point out that some of the speakers in the second reading debate mentioned concern over the insulation of the Government from the public pressure in the Resource Assessment Commission Bill. This worried the Australian Democrats. I believe that the Government has a responsibility to make decisions itself. Often governments of whatever political stripe will send something to a commission or a committee to avoid making responsible decisions. This was a worry with this Commission, but I think on balance the public-and the mining industry for that matter-will still have input into the system. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the system can be made to work. It still requires a public scrutiny, but everything any government does requires the input of the people. The Australian Democrats and, I think, the environmental movement are willing to let the facts speak for themselves. We are not worried about what the minerals industry or the woodchipping industry can come up with in terms of information. We believe that when the facts are evaluated in a dispassionate light, justice will prevail. We are not afraid of that. </PARA>

<PARA>This is a very simple and clear amendment. It is obvious that, in the assessment of resources of this nation, the States play a sovereign role. The Constitution provides that the States shall have their responsibilities and obligations and their rights. The Resource Assessment Commission Bill ignores those rights and responsibilities. All we are saying to the Government in this amendment is that the Minister for Resources should consult. We are not saying that the Minister should obtain the agreement of the government but simply that he should consult with the government of each State or Territory that may be affected before requiring the Commission to conduct an inquiry. It is a simple amendment and I put it to the Senate that it should be accepted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will not accept this amendment. What Senator Lewis has said about the need for consultation is a fair point, but the Government believes that such consultation would be conducted, where appropriate, in any case, and that there is no need to put such a provision in the Bill. The Commission is not a body which need create anxiety or worry in terms of State constitutional rights. I suspect that the reason we are being asked to enshrine in legislation a provision compelling consultation on all references is a worry that somehow or other this may be an intrusion by the Commonwealth into the constitutional domain of the States. The body that I could draw a parallel with is the Industries Assistance Commission. To the best of my knowledge, that body conducts inquiries into matters which affect the economic well-being of Australian industry, and thus it affects industry in the various States. But in framing references to the IAC, the Government is not required, as I understand the Industries Assistance Commission Act, to consult the States. We are looking at a national industry view. The sorts of references that the Government contemplates would be referred to this Commission are those that will look, by and large, at a national perspective and thus, in the normal course, would run across the margins of States, involve several States or Territories and not be likely to be merely a focus of a particular State or part of a particular State on which States would want, therefore, to jealously guard their rights to affect any reference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that the point about consultation, by and large, is fair. This Government has a good record on consultation. It is not necessary to go to the extent of putting special provisions for it in the legislation. Indeed, if the motivation for wanting to do that is a widespread fear-to put it in the terms in which it is flung back at us-of a grab from Canberra for national control over State rights, I think that is a misplaced fear in the circumstances. The model, after all, is close to that of the IAC, and that working model has been effective. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister: Has he seen the claims made yesterday by the Prime Minister that it was ignorant to indicate that Australia's debt should be spoken about in any sense as being a debt related to each individual Australian man, woman and child? Does the Minister recall his own comments in the Senate on 29 May to precisely the same effect that somehow it was wrong to characterise debt as being related to each individual Australian?

<PARA> I told you of the disastrous drop in the prices of our exports-a collapse in world trade that has now cost every Australian family $2,000.</PARA>
<PARA>Can the Minister indicate why it is ignorant to talk about Australia's debt in terms of the debt owed by every man, woman and child, whereas the Prime Minister is able to talk about the collapse in world trade having cost every Australian family $2,000?

The remarks made about characterising Australia's debt as being a personal debt for each man, woman and child in Australia have always been seen as extremely simplistic and, if you like, a politically motivated view of the situation. That is what can honestly be said about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the more general issue: Senator Puplick would realise that all the statements made in June 1987 or, for that matter, in June or August 1988 by political commentators, economists, government spokesmen and indeed opposition spokesmen indicated a misunderstanding of the level of growth in the Australian economy, and the consequent problems which have flowed from that were not foreseen at the time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Has the Minister noted an account in yesterday's edition of the Australian of the Emperor of Japan buying a consignment of Tasmanian sheep to improve the bloodlines of his imperial flock? Does this royal endorsement open an opportunity for the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC) to upgrade its promotion of our lamb in a bid to increase exports to Japan over the current level of 18 million a year?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I noticed in yesterday's Australian under the heading `Tasmanian lamb gets imperial imprimatur' an article which said that His Imperial Highness, the Emperor of Japan, was purchasing lambs from Tasmania, the finest Suffolk sheep in the world, to improve the bloodlines of the royal flock. I must say I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Jones that the selection of Australian sheep for this purpose only serves to emphasise the quality of the product available from Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will pick up the interjection by my colleague from Tasmania Senator Tate who said that I should say `Tasmanian'. I must say that I acknowledge his enthusiasm for his own State but I recognise that Tasmania is part of Australia and, therefore, I will say that it is Australian sheep that the Emperor has selected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to the second part of the question from Senator Jones. The central problem facing the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation in promoting Australian lamb in Japan is that it has a somewhat exotic image. The AMLC is attempting to address the problem through a comprehensive promotional campaign involving restaurant and supermarket promotions, public relations activities, trade activities, promotions along the lines of the beef shortcuts advertisements that we see on television and the provision of recipes and other cooking advice to Japanese householders on how they should experience obviously the succulent delicacies of Australian lamb Japanese style.</PARA>
<PARA> The purchase of Australian sheep, sourced from Tasmania, by the Emperor serves to highlight the standards of Australian sheep and Australian sheep meat in Japanese eyes and thus is a recognition of the standards we have achieved and is beneficial to our broad image in Japan. But it is the type of promotional campaign that the AMLC is running that will ultimately mean that more Australian sheep meat turns up in Japanese pots in the future. Our trade balance will improve as a result. Nonetheless I acknowledge the Emperor's discernment in selecting Tasmanian sourced Australian sheep.</PARA>

The same report notes that at another campus, the total student time was overstated by 48,000 hours.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the report. Assuming it is fundamentally accurate, it is not entirely clear whether the fraud was being perpetrated in a centralised way by the State Government or whether it was decentralised fraud being perpetrated by one or more TAFE colleges. The enrolment statistics for TAFE colleges are not supplied directly to the Federal Government by the colleges. In the case of Queensland-and I think in the case of all the other States-the statistics are supplied to the Commonwealth Government by the Queensland Department of Employment, Vocational Education and Training. Of course the Commonwealth will be taking this issue up with that Queensland State Department. Commonwealth TAFE grants, however, are not provided on a per capita basis and are supplementary to the State's own funding. However, grants to the States for TAFE are made available under the States Grants (Technical and Further Education Assistance) Act 1989. Under the accountability provisions of the legislation, States are required to provide audited statements of expenditure certifying that the grants were expended for the purpose for which they were given. Therefore, the Queensland Department will be obliged under that condition to supply the Commonwealth with a report on the matter. One would hope that it will be a truthful and accurate report, although perhaps some people might not be entirely confident that that condition will be met.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Is it not a fact that the depth of our economic crisis and the toughness and duration of the measures needed to get us out of the mess are much more serious than the Australian public yet seems to realise? Is not the only economic weapon the Government has left itself-high interest rates-a very blunt instrument, with very undesirable side effects in harming individuals, discouraging essential investment and, by keeping the Australian dollar artificially high, hurting our exporters and import replacers? Is it not obvious to any dispassionate observer that we must use much tougher tax and wage policies and reductions in government expenditure to restrain demand until we can improve productivity sufficiently to justify our higher standard of living, and that we urgently need a proper consumption tax to encourage savings? Is not the problem for this Government-and indeed for any government-the fear of voter reaction to difficult measures, not fully understood, particularly with an election imminent? In view of the gravity of the national economic crisis, will the Government approach the Opposition with a view to working out a joint national policy of economic recovery?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Button has reminded me that John Howard might be worth listening to if the Government were looking for ideas and suggestions on economic policy from the Opposition. My own subjective judgment, which is the same as Senator Hamer's, is that the public does not realise the situation fully. I have been asked whether the only economic weapon the Government is using is a tight monetary policy. The answer to that is no; it is not the only weapon. We will be continuing with a fiscal policy which would have previously been regarded in Australia as being unbelievably tight. We have a Budget surplus this year of close to 2 per cent of gross domestic product and a Budget surplus next year of about the same size-possibly a bit lower as a proportion of gross domestic product-and a public sector borrowing requirement figure of about one per cent of GDP negative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to go into any great detail on the question of a consumption tax, but I think the arguments about the mix of the tax system should stand on their own merits or demerits, and that those people who believe that changing a tax mix from income taxes towards consumption taxes will significantly alter behaviour are wrong. An increase in consumption taxes, accompanied by a commensurate reduction in income taxes, would, at least on average, mean that the same amount of income is available to purchase the goods that people believe they need or want. While it would not affect all groups equally, it is self-delusion to believe that savings behaviour would be markedly changed by a shift in the composition of taxes from income taxes to consumption taxes.</PARA>

If we apply that to the present situation, we will see that monetary policy has been very tight, but nobody knows at the moment the extent to which that has affected what is going on in the economy.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answers to the questions are yes, yes and yes. Let me now explain. I am aware of fire blight. Fire blight is a bacterium which infects the blossom of fruit trees of the apple or pear variety, leading to twig dieback, ultimately trunk or branch dieback and, in extreme cases, the death of the tree and thus the wiping out of it as fruit bearing growth. The fruits that it affects are mostly pears, although Senator Cooney has referred to nashi fruit. Nashi fruit is a cross between apples and pears. It affects that fruit as well as ornamental trees based on the family of apples and pears or their crosses. It is true that the farmers of Shepparton have expressed concern. In fact, a delegation of them is coming to see me today. It is also true that the President of the Waterside Workers Federation in Port Melbourne, Jim Beggs, has today contacted my office to express support for the farmers' delegation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The origin of these concerns is that recently a consignment of 248 boxes of nashi fruit-the apple-pear cross-was imported from New Zealand and was inadvertently released on the Australian market for sale. I understand that the consignment was admitted after inspectors of the New South Wales Department of Agriculture had cleared it. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service believed that there may have been an infection of fire blight and at least one-fifth of the consignment was retrieved. On a piece by piece basis, 200 fruits have been examined.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Attorney-General. It also refers to the suppression by a Perth magistrate last week of the evidence of former Rothwells Ltd solicitor, Mr Leon Musca. Is the Minister aware that counsel for media organisations challenging the suppression order has told the Supreme Court that Mr Musca's evidence should be released because it raises questions about the frankness and credibility of Premier Dowding concerning his role in this matter? Does the Minister agree that the people of Western Australia have a right to know the full story of the involvement of their Premier and possibly other senior Ministers in the Rothwells scandal? Does he further agree that it should be possible to make public, as was done with the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) Rothwells report, a version of the Musca evidence which would not prejudice the outcome of the legal proceedings pending against Mr Tony Lloyd, Mr Kevin Edwards and Mr John Hilton? Does the Federal Attorney-General have any authority in this matter? If so, will the Minister ask the Attorney to intervene in support of disclosure of non-prejudicial facts when the challenge to the suppression order comes before the court again next week?</PARA></TALK.START>

I do not know whether that is speculation by the media or an unauthorised report by the media, which perhaps falls outside the terms of the suppression order.

Whether it is a sufficient factor to counterbalance the interest of a national organisation such as the National Companies and Securities Commission is something that I am prepared to try to find an answer to.</PARA>

At 9.58 a.m. on Monday, 12 June, Interpol Australia, in accordance with its usual process of notifying transit of requesting countries, provided to Interpol Tokyo and Interpol Santiago advice of Mr Buschmann's departure details from Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of those press reports and I am aware of their being sourced to Senator Knowles. As I said last Friday, one has to be careful in dealing with matters of this nature. For laypersons to make allegations about the properties of drugs is a risky thing. What worries me about the allegations that are being persisted with is that it would seem that claims about outcomes for certain forms of drug treatment are coming from people not qualified to draw those conclusions. They fly in the face of findings by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council and by the National Heart Foundation. Senator Giles asked me whether it was true that Senator Knowles has said that Australia is the only country in the world which bans the use of EDTA for a form of treatment. I have before me the Senate Hansard of 9 June in which Senator Knowles is reported as saying by way of interjection:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Why is Australia the only place in the world which does not allow it?</PARA>
<PARA>She was referring to the use of the drug. Australia is not the only place in the world whose drug evaluation authorities have made this decision. The United States Food and Drug Administration has a similar view to that of the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council. It does not permit the use of this drug for the form of treatment referred to by Senator Knowles.</PARA>
<PARA> This is a sensitive matter. People suffering from heart disease obviously want to use whatever means are possible for treatment. It is for the professionally qualified advisory bodies of the Government to assess forms of medical treatment. Unless there is evidence from professionally qualified bodies-and if that evidence exists it should be presented to the proper people to make the evaluation-that there ought to be further re-examination, then proselytising in the community that a wonder drug exists when the drug has been evaluated and has not been approved for that treatment is the worst form of `comfort' that can be given because it raises an expectation that may not be real.</PARA>
<PARA> I am not qualified to say whether this drug should or should not be used. What I am qualified to say is that it is the properly qualified body that should make the assessment. If there is any evidence that the previous assessment of the qualified body is wrong, the matter should be resubmitted to that body. To carry on a public campaign like this is the worst sort of thing that can be done to people who suffer from heart complaints and who have a real anxiety about their futures.</PARA>

Does the Government expect that deregulation of the domestic airline industry next year will reduce parallel scheduling, a practice which would not be tolerated in any other developed country?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Western Australians, I suspect, were in the past more conscious of the inconvenience of parallel scheduling than anybody else. There used to be fewer flights. When I first entered Parliament, for example, one had the choice of coming to the east at midday or midnight. There has been a significant improvement in the last 15 years. A survey last year by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics showed that about 45 per cent of all flights in 1987-88 were parallel scheduled. However, it also found that the practice was more common on the high density routes-Sydney-Melbourne in particular, I suppose-where the disbenefits of parallel scheduling are less pronounced because the frequency of flights is much greater anyway. So the situation may not be quite as bad as the 45 per cent figure suggests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amount of parallel scheduling has been blamed-probably justifiably-on the two-airline policy. The Government has already decided to deregulate the domestic airlines. It is expected that that will lead to a greater range of service, particularly if, as some people expect, one of the new entrants is based in Brisbane and will, therefore, have a different home port from both Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines, which are both based in Melbourne. That is therefore likely to generate a different pattern of services, at least, I suspect, on the east coast.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the press reports of the announcement made by Sarich Technologies. One of the difficulties about interpreting the press reports is that the nature of the agreement, its size and such things are described as being commercially in confidence and are not included in the newspaper reports. I can say, however, that for a long time the Government has had discussions with Mr Sarich. At an earlier stage the Automotive Industry Authority indicated that it was prepared to support further development of the Sarich engine in Australia by a grant under the Automotive Industry Authority Act. But a condition of such a grant, of course, which was made clear to Mr Sarich, was that manufacturing should follow the further development of the engine in Australia. In fact, that is a condition in the Automotive Industry Authority legislation. It is fair to say, on that basis, that the offer was not acceptable to Mr Sarich. While further development work will take place in Australia supported by some of the international companies, I think it is fair to say that it is unlikely that the lead manufacturing plant will be in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Both the Federal and State governments have sought to secure manufacture of the engine in Australia. I believe that Mr Sarich has sought to do that himself, but I am not sure that that is, by any stretch of the imagination, a possibility at this stage. Work commissioned on behalf of the Government in conjunction with Sarich Technologies into the feasibility of a manufacturing plant in Australia showed that the engine could be manufactured profitably in Australia but that it would be manufactured more profitably in, perhaps, the United States.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the first part of Senator Jenkins's question about the route taken and whether Mr Buschmann was given any options is that, he was offered a choice of several possible travel routes. He chose the route that was taken. The second part of the question was whether, in view of what Senator Tate has said in Question Time today, I would outline the measures taken by the Department to guarantee the secrecy of the route. The departmental brief that I have here says that the Department discussed Mr Buschmann's route only with him and Dr Ian Alexander, in whose custody he had been placed. It would seem from Senator Tate's answer that the Department also discussed the route with some other government agencies. I shall have to inquire as to what discussions took place and the nature of those discussions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fact and would be of interest to Senator McMullan and to Senator Reid primarily as senators for the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) that such an innovation which is, as I understand it, an Australian first should occur in this Territory. The scheme involves children giving evidence on video in a separate room. That video will be shown live in court. Apparently, the idea came from the experience of magistrates in Canberra. It is the brain child, particularly, of Ron Cahill, the ACT Chief Magistrate, who indicated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In the normal court surroundings in the presence of the person involved we've had instances where it's been so traumatic the child has just completely seized up and been unable to give any intelligible evidence to the prosecutor, let alone be cross-examined.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe Mr Cahill is the patron of the National Association for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect and has a very real interest and concern in this field. For that reason, the Government was persuaded at quite considerable expense to install video equipment after 1 August in the court in Childers Street in Canberra. As indicated by Senator McMullan's question, the idea is that this be a type of active law reform rather than simply a matter of recommendations in a report tabled in the Parliament. It is intended that the Law Reform Commission will examine the operation of this video link and report on it so that together the Law Reform Commission and a contracted psychologist will provide a report which will then become the basis of law reform initiatives in other jurisdictions. Indeed, the idea is that the Canberra experiment find favour with other jurisdictions so that children about whose state or fate allegations to do with sexual abuse are made may be able to give their evidence in a way which is not as traumatic and difficult for them as apparently is the case at the moment. I believe that the experiment will have effect as a model for other jurisdictions, not only in relation to child abuse cases; it could also have far reaching implications for the Family Court of Australia as a means of obtaining evidence.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question about taxation reform in Australia is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer.

Is the Hawke Government united in its polices on the taxation of unearned capital gains?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the last part of the question is unequivocally yes. The Government is entirely united about the need to have taxes on unearned capital gains. Indeed, the Government regards it as an essential component of its taxation system. It is essential because it is necessary to have a capital gains tax as a net under the income tax system. The basis of most tax avoidance schemes was the conversion of what otherwise would have been taxable income into tax free capital gains. That, of course, refers to the bad old days of the Fraser Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has an official policy of watering down the capital gains tax so that it would not apply after a time lag of five years. Some particular members of the Liberal Party, principally Mr Elliott and Mr McLachlan, want to get rid of capital gains taxation altogether. That is because of their strong self-interest in the matter. If there were no capital gains tax, after Mr Elliott and Mr McLachlan had diddled the rest of Elders IXL Ltd shareholders by issuing themselves 1c paid shares which carry the same rights for bonus issue as fully paid shares and after they had diddled all the other shareholders by watering down the company's capital, they could then sell their bonus shares and pick up an enormous capital gain which they would now have to pay tax on. They want to get rid of the capital gains tax so that they can diddle not only the other shareholders of Elders but also other taxpayers. That is their position. On the other hand, there are some more responsible people in the Liberal Party like Senator Hill, for example. In his maiden speech on 9 September 1981, in criticism of the then taxation system, Senator Hill said:</PARA>
<PARA> It taxes income to the extent that it increases wealth but not capital gains or windfall gains . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Later, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> We cannot forever remain the only highly developed nation without some form of capital or equivalent taxation at the Federal level.</PARA>
<PARA>At the time I commended Senator Hill for having the courage to say that in the Liberal Party. I commend his speech-an excellent speech in other respects, apart from that-to all other members of the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, Mr President, I wish to table a schedule of protests that have been lodged by the Government, as requested by Senator Chaney a few days ago, to various Chinese authorities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I draw your attention to an editorial in the Canberra Times on Wednesday which commends a decision by the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Stewart West, to appoint a six-member committee to report on `any proposed works (either external or internal) which could have a significant impact on the building or its function'. What discussions did the Minister have with the Parliament through its Presiding Officers before taking this apparently unilateral decision? As the Minister stated in his press release on this matter of 9 July that the Parliament now holds the design of the new Parliament House in trust for the people of Australia, do you and Madam Speaker accept the Minister's dictate that responsibility for the building in its function as a Parliament belongs not only with the Parliament, but also with the Government? When did the Parliament forfeit to the Executive Government its right to control the parliamentary functions of Parliament House? Why is the right to appoint all six members of the proposed Committee limited to the Executive Government with the Parliament having no say whatsoever? What role, if any, will the Parliament's own New Parliament House Committee have in this matter? What action do you and Madam Speaker intend to take to ensure that Parliament retains control of its own home?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>President of the Senate</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra ACT 2601</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr President</PARA>
<PARA> I am writing to convey to you a decision which the Government has recently made about the protection of the design of the Parliament House, a national asset in which both the Parliament and the Government have an interest.</PARA>
<PARA> In April this year at the ceremony to mark the transfer of the formal gardens to the Parliament, I foreshadowed the fact that the Government was giving consideration to this issue. I believe that the arrangements which are set out in this letter complement the Presiding Officers' responsibilities in relation to the building on behalf of Parliament and recognise the importance of providing an opportunity to protect the building which is held in trust on behalf of the people of Australia. In view of the importance of this decision, I am arranging for a media release to be issued shortly after you receive this letter.</PARA>
<PARA> In essence, the Government has decided to set in train arrangements which will:</PARA>
<PARA> return to both Houses of Parliament the powers to decide on changes to the design of the Parliament House which might have a potentially significant impact on the internal design or function of the building, in the same way that the Parliament deals with building or other works in the external parts of the building and precincts;</PARA>
<PARA> establish a six member advisory panel of experts to assess all proposed capital or other works intended to be carried out within the precincts of the Parliament and to report to the Parliament on any capital or other works which it considers might have a potentially significant impact on the design or function of Parliament House;</PARA>
<PARA> as its first task, make the panel responsible for advising on regulations which would provide a detailed definition of those categories of works which are to be regarded as having a potentially significant impact.</PARA>
<PARA> I have set out at ATTACHMENT A to this letter the details of the Government's decision. The background to the decision and further details about the issues involved are at ATTACHMENT B.</PARA>
<PARA> There are some aspects of the decision on which I would particularly wish to comment.</PARA>
<PARA> In agreeing to these arrangements, the Government has been concerned to avoid circumstances arising where unregulated alterations to the building's design would occur, comparable in quality to the kind of alterations made to the Provisional Parliament House. A lessening of the Parliament building's value as a national asset would inevitably occur. I am sure you would join me in wishing to avoid the possibility of any resulting criticism of the Government's and the Parliament's failure to act to protect the nation's billion dollar investment.</PARA>
<PARA> I should make it clear that the arrangements are to be applied to the entire building, including the Ministerial Wing. The Presiding Officers, the Minister responsible for the Ministerial Wing and the Parliament itself will all have access to professional expert advice on proposed works which may affect the integrity of the building's design.</PARA>
<PARA> The arrangements involved are to be given effect through amendments to the Parliament Act 1974. The Government intends introducing the amendments as soon as possible, with a view to securing their passage in the 1989 Budget Sittings.</PARA>
<PARA> The decision provides that the appointment of three members of the panel should be a matter for agreement between the Presiding Officers and the Minister responsible for the Ministerial Wing. I believe it would be helpful, as a preliminary step, for us to confer on the process of selecting these members as soon as possible, in the knowledge, of course, that the formation of the panel is subject to the legislation to be put before the Parliament. For my part, I am arranging to approach both the Institutes of Architects and Engineers seeking their cooperation in providing a list of suitable nominees from whom we can make a selection. I would also expect that we could agree on the selection of one of the three professional experts for appointment as the panel's chairperson.</PARA>
<PARA> Once the advisory panel is formed, the Government feels that the provision of the necessary secretariat support for its operation should properly reside with the Parliament. Whether this should be through the Joint House Department or some other suitable arrangement is a matter for your judgment. The Government has agreed to funding of $100,000 a year for the panel's operation. This is based on an assessment that the panel would probably need to meet three times a year to consider proposed works.</PARA>
<PARA> I am writing in similar terms to Madam Speaker.</PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely</PARA>

<PARA>ATTACHMENT A</PARA>
<PARA>PROTECTION OF THE DESIGN OF PARLIAMENT HOUSE-SUMMARY OF THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The Government has decided that amendments to the Parliament Act 1974 are to be proposed to provide for the following:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the establishment of a six member advisory panel</PARA>
<PARA> (i) having the functions of considering and assessing all proposed capital or other works intended to be carried out within the precincts of the Parliament (as defined by the Parliamentary Precincts Act 1988;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) reporting to the Parliament on any capital or other works considered by the panel to have a potentially significant impact on the design or function of Parliament House (see paragraph 2 below);</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) comprising the Chairpersons of the Australian Heritage Commission and the National Capital Planning Authority, both on an ex officio basis, a representative of the Department of Administrative Services, and three other members recognised as being among the most experienced and respected in Australia in the professions of architecture and engineering, and with legislative provision to enable the group to co-opt other professionals whose expertise is not already represented on the group; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) whose members are to be appointed for three year, renewable terms, with membership to be agreed between the Presiding Officers and the Minister responsible for the Ministerial Wing of Parliament House (currently the Minister for Administrative Services).</PARA>
<PARA> (b) for any proposed capital or other works within the precincts (as defined by the Parliamentary Precincts Act 1988) which are the subject of reports made in accordance with sub-paragraph 1 (a) (ii) above</PARA>
<PARA> (i) reports from the Presiding Officers or the Minister responsible for the Ministerial Wing, are to be laid before each House of Parliament at the same time as the reports in sub-paragraph 1 (a) (ii) above; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) each House, by positive resolution, is to approve of a proposal for capital or other works before proceeding with the works.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The Government has also agreed that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the detailed definition of those categories of works with potentially significant impact (see sub-paragraph 1 (a) (ii) above) should be considered by the panel at its first meeting;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) regulations defining the relevant categories of works should be prepared after advice from the panel, and be considered by Government before being made; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) costs for remuneration, travel and expenses for advisory panel members should be set at $100,000 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA>ATTACHMENT B</PARA>
<PARA>PROTECTION OF THE DESIGN OF PARLIAMENT HOUSE</PARA>
<PARA>Background to the Government's Decision</PARA>
<PARA> 1. During the design and construction of the Parliament building, both Houses of Parliament were empowered by the Parliament House Construction Authority Act 1979 to approve the design of the building and its surrounds. The ultimate decision on the building's design lay with Parliament itself which had access to professional expert advice from the Parliament House Construction Authority (PHCA) about design and construction issues.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The situation now is that some aspects affecting design require Parliament's approval; some involve the Presiding Officers only; responsibility for others is unclear. No provision exists for expert assessments of any proposed capital or other works in the building or its precincts.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The provisions of the PHCA Act empowering both Houses to approve internal design charges were superseded by proclamation of the Parliamentary Precincts Act in August 1988. Responsibility for decisions on changes within the building thereby passed from the Houses of Parliament to the Presiding Officers.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Power to change the design of the outside of the building and external precincts still lies with the Houses of Parliament through the Parliament Act 1974 which provides for positive resolutions of both Houses before carrying out building or other work. Whether internal courtyards are covered by the Parliament Act is not immediately apparent.</PARA>
<PARA>Issues Considered</PARA>
<PARA> Where should responsibility lie for approval of capital or other works with the potential to alter significantly the building's interior or exterior design or precincts</PARA>
<PARA> 5. During design and construction, PHCA balanced two objectives: producing an efficient, functional national Parliament; and producing an asset forming a premier part of Australia's national estate and heritage.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Responsibility for maintenance of the first objective has passed from PHCA to Joint House Department (JHD). Continuing responsibility for the second has not passed to any organisation. Five parliamentary departments and the Executive can decide to alter the building or its precincts and in doing so perhaps compromise its value as a national heritage asset. None of these organisations is responsible for retaining or protecting the design of the building as approved by Parliament, or for maintaining a balance between the two objectives.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. Protection of national heritage assets is well recognised through both practical and legislative means but such assets are often not given adequate protection until they have acquired historic significance by which time they may have been irrevocably altered. Effective protection arrangements need to be instituted for Parliament House before any significant alterations are made.</PARA>
<PARA> 8. The Government believes that the Parliament is the most appropriate body to be responsible for future decisions which might have a significant impact on the building and its surrounds. It has therefore decided to revert to the arrangements applying before August 1988, when positive resolutions of both Houses were required to approve actions that could result in significant changes to the design of the building. The Parliament Act 1974 provides for such resolutions with regard to buildings or other work in the external parts of the building and precincts; it is logical therefore to extend its scope to cover the interior of Parliament House.</PARA>
<PARA> 9. Only those few proposals judged as likely to have a significant impact on the building's design should come before parliament itself. The situation would be comparable to the ten year design and construction period during which Parliament considered the design and its development on no more than 4 or 5 occasions.</PARA>
<PARA> Whether it is possible to retain the building's and precinct's design integrity as completed, by ensuring professional expertise is used to design and assess proposed changes</PARA>
<PARA>10. While changes to the building will be required over time, works carried out through JHD are not assessed qualitatively or against the existing design. Advice similar in range and expertise to that available to PHCA during the design/construction phases is not available for JHD to use in assessing proposals. The Government is aware of an arrangement between JHD and Mitchell/Giurgola &amp; Thorp Architects whereby their advice is sought on how best to implement changes. This does not appear, however, to extend to assessments of the impact of changes on the existing design. Nor is there a regulatory requirement for the advice from the Architect to be sought, acknowledged, heeded or reported to Parliament. In any event, the arrangement is only part of a much larger structure needed to encompass properly all changes to the building.</PARA>
<PARA>11. Just as it was essential for PHCA to have access to and use a range of architectural and engineering expertise to develop the design and construct the Parliament, the Government considers the same should hold for any future capital or other works. That is, Parliament will need access to a similar or expanded range or expertise and it will need to be required to take that advice into account if the integrity of the building design is to be maintained effectively.</PARA>
<PARA>12. The Government has determined to establish by legislation an advisory panel of experts to report to the Presiding Officers and to the Minister for Administrative Services (in his capacity as Minister responsible for the Ministerial Wing) on all proposed capital or other works in the precincts, inside or outside the building. The advisory group is to comprise three professional experts drawn from the spheres of architecture and engineering and the Chairpersons of both the Australian Heritage Commission and the National Capital Planning Authority on an ex officio basis, as well as a representative from the Department of Administrative Services. The panel will have power to co-opt other experts where this proves essential to its function.</PARA>
<PARA>13. The Government has decided that the panel's membership is to be agreed between the Presiding Officers and the Minister responsible for the Ministerial Wing.</PARA>
<PARA>14. The legislation will make it mandatory for the panel to report to Parliament whenever it considered proposed capital or other works might significantly affect the master plan of the building's design as embodied in the developed design report on new Parliament House approved by parliament in November 1986, and as embodied in the building formally handed over to Parliament during 1988. Mandatory, tabled panel reports, together with reports from the Presiding Officers seeking positive resolutions of both Houses of parliament to undertake such significant capital or other works anywhere within the precincts would thereby enable Parliament to take informed decisions on proposals with potentially significant design impacts.</PARA>
<PARA>15. By requiring panel scrutiny of all proposed capital or other works (regardless of their purported significance) all parties with powers to propose works would be obliged to use appropriate expertise either to prepare or advise on proposals before they are subjected to the mandatory panel scrutiny. To neglect such steps would run the risk of the panel declaring the proposal's impact significant due to poor or amateur design and results in reports to Parliament. Obliging the use of appropriate expertise should promote the avoidance of ill-considered, and often unsightly alterations that were the result of 60 years of unregulated modification of the Provisional Parliament House.</PARA>
<PARA> The guidance which could be given on alterations which might have a potentially significant effect on the building's design</PARA>
<PARA>16. Many elements make up the integrity of the building's design. Affecting any of them potentially affects the whole. Rather than attempting to define `potentially significant effects' immediately, the Government considered that a more practical alternative would be for the panel to start with the approved design as constructed and fitted out and to assess detailed definition of categories of works to be covered, having in mind the following specific aspects:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) quality of design and the finishes of the building and precincts which comprise the national asset;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) ceremonial or public areas or those seen by official parliamentary or government guests-broadly, the areas within the curved walls and along the east-west axis across the House and Senate entries;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) main fitout features including artworks (internal and external), furniture, light fixtures, signage;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) displays and display areas.</PARA>
<PARA>17. Once the Government has considered the panel's assessment regulations will need to be made defining the categories of work.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday at Question Time I was asked a question by Senator Michael Baume in relation to Imam Sheikh Al Hilaly. The Imam has a temporary entry permit expiring on 30 June 1989. On 4 May 1989 he applied for a change of status to that of permanent resident. His application is now being examined by the Department. A submission is being prepared for the Minister's consideration on his return from overseas. This case has a long history and from time to time has aroused strong sentiments in some areas of the community. On occasions it has attracted attention in the media. It would not be appropriate for any of the issues, which must be considered by the Minister in making his decision, to be canvassed by me at this point. Privacy issues must be considered as well as the impropriety of such an action when a decision is pending. The Government is well aware of the interest in the community in this case and the need for full and proper consideration of the issues before a decision is made.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier in Question Time I was asked a question by Senator Newman concerning the Defence Housing Authority. It is correct that a spouse representative has had full observer status on the Defence Housing Authority since the beginning of 1988. It is also correct that the Defence Housing Authority Act was amended in November 1988 to formalise this representation. Pending the appointment of a formal spouse representative, the nominated spouse observer, Mrs Lorraine Sanderson, has continued to attend meetings of the Authority. Mrs Sanderson has participated fully in the deliberations of the Authority. Much of the Authority's discussions are largely informal, with decisions being reached by consensus. Thus, the lack of voting rights has not impeded Mrs Sanderson's very considerable contribution to the Authority on behalf of Service spouses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendment to the Defence Housing Authority Act allowed for the appointment of two additional members to the Authority. The delay in the formal appointment of the spouse representative has been due to difficulties in settling on the second additional member and a perceived need to go forward to the Executive Council with proposals for both appointments at the same time. Mrs Sanderson now has indicated that, for personal reasons, she will be unable to continue on the Authority. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has been in consultation with the National Consultative Group of Service Spouses with a view to identifying a suitable replacement. That selection and formal appointment process will be finalised as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the last part of Senator Newman's question, the spouse representative will be provided with funds to enable travel to meet with spouses' groups and to examine defence housing issues. Mrs Sanderson's travel costs throughout her time with the Authority have been met. She has travelled at government expense, both with the Authority and separately, to represent spouses' interests on defence housing issues.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports the Bills. They represent five major areas of reform. The first and most significant relates to share buy backs. The Bill is long-awaited and has been strongly supported by the business community. The Opposition has, been calling for it for two years. Nevertheless, we are pleased that it has finally reached this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second major part of the package relates to a flexible accelerated security transfer system. The Bill provides for the pilot testing of the Australian Stock Exchange's proposed scheme for a flexible accelerated security transfer system in an effort to ensure that backlogs do not develop and delays are kept to a minimum in the transfer and registration of securities. </PARA>
<PARA> The third area relates to the licensing of participants in the securities and futures industries. These provisions prevent the enforcement of a contract by a person acting as adviser or dealer without a licence. Securities dealers, futures brokers and advisers will still require licences but their representatives will not. Brokers and advisers will be made more fully liable for the conduct of their representatives. While supporting this deregulation, we will be watching to ensure that investors are adequately protected under the reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, the legislation will facilitate computerisation of corporate affairs commissions (CACs). Original documents will not always be made available for inspection. If the CAC can provide a computer print-out or visual display, access to the original will not be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth area relates to a user-pays system for the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) and amends the fees Acts to companies, companies' acquisition of shares, the futures industry and the securities industry code. A new Companies (Fees: Taxation Component) Bill accompanies each amendment to the fees Act to ensure that there is no power to impose fees that might contain an element of taxation. There is provision for the NCSC, among other things, to charge a fee when computer related documents are issued; increase the limit on the size of the fee; and charge a deposit where the fee cannot be ascertained straightaway. Fees, in monetary terms, may not exceed $5,000-an increase from $1,000-but they may be described in percentage terms. The Opposition supports that proposal. As I indicated, the Opposition supports the package of Bills and wishes it a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Four significant changes are encompassed within the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. The first concerns computer crime and implements recommendations of the Gibbs committee. We support this reform which creates offences in relation to access to and damaging of data. The second significant change relates to penalties. The Bill provides for imposition of pecuniary penalties and imprisonment and increases fines substantially. We support that part of the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third area of significant change relates to spent convictions. This has been an area which has caused the Opposition concern and about which two amendments of substance were moved in the other place. It seems to us that some of the obvious exclusions-that is, convictions which should not be capable of being spent under such schemes-are set out in the Bill but others are not. There is a catch-all provision that says that other cases may be dealt with by regulation. Therefore, we proposed an amendment that the Bill not come into operation until the full range of exceptions has been set out. We also proposed an amendment to new section 85zw which provides for a person whose conviction is spent to make a positive assertion that he has not been charged with or convicted of an offence. I will come back to the matter of spent convictions which is our principal concern in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth area of significant change relates to the powers of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). The Bill gives the DPP power to grant wider forms of indemnity to witnesses than he has presently and we support that change. The Bill also gives the DPP an unlimited power to issue ex officio indictments. We concluded that that was justifiable, except in the case of war crimes, and we moved an amendment in the other place which the Government agreed to. We are pleased that by that process war crimes became an exception. I think that it is unnecessary at this time to go through the reasons; I just make the comment that there was a long and difficult debate in this chamber and the Government seemed to take a different position from what it finally concluded. Nevertheless, we are pleased that it accepted our position in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me back to the question of spent convictions and our amendments which we regard as of importance. We recognise, however, that a number of the amendments, particularly to part 8, as I understand it, of the National Crimes Authority Act, are to commence on 1 July 1989. We are anxious that we do not in any way delay the implementation of these provisions and the others that I have indicated we support. </PARA>
<PARA> We had negotiations with the Government as to whether the Bill might be proceeded with on the basis that the spent convictions part was removed. That was not our suggestion because we support it in principle. We just had the reservations that I have outlined. However, for a while there was a suggestion by the Government that it would remove the whole of that package. That day has now passed and it decided not to do that. It was put to us that the Government would withdraw the whole of the Bill rather than have it dealt with without the spent convictions provision. We were unhappy that that would occur and, therefore, decided to facilitate passage of the total Bill today. </PARA>
<PARA> In doing so, we stress that we stand by the amendments that we moved in the other place and the merit of those amendments. We still put them to the Government for its consideration in the future and indicate to the Senate that, upon coming to government, we will also reconsider the provisions in relation to spent convictions and at that time consider whether the law should be further amended to encompass the areas of concern that we put down in a much more comprehensive form in the other place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-The point that Senator Hill made this afternoon is one that was, as he said, made in the House of Representatives. In response to that the Government has made some concessions, as I think Senator Hill would acknowledge. Without reading the whole page in detail, page 8 of the second reading speech reflects basically the Government's position in that we have accommodated some of the principle involved. I quote from that part of the speech which is relevant to this point:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The spent convictions scheme itself will not, however, come into force until proclamation or, failing that, 12 months after royal assent. The privacy commissioner has indicated that he will be able to advertise for applications for exemption, consider any applications received and recommend any appropriate exemptions to the Minister to enable regulations to be made within the 12 month period. The Attorney-General has undertaken that the privacy commissioner will consult with opposition parties on proposed exemptions. </PARA>
<PARA>As I say, we have gone some way in accommodating part of the principle about which Senator Hill spoke. It should be stated, however, that there are conflicting interests, one of which is that the Senate insists continually that legislation should commence within six months of assent. That was very much in the forefront of the Government's mind also. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is commencing its debate on the Patents Amendment Bill 1989 but I understand that we will deal only with the second reading stage because there are some amendments to be moved at the committee stages. Currently, Australian patents are granted for a term of 16 years. Applications may be made to the courts on two separate grounds for extensions of up to an additional 10 years. The Bill will change all of that procedure. The Bill was first introduced into the House of Representatives on 3 June 1988 and, more than 12 months later, it has come back with a number of Government amendments which make it a much better Bill: the Government's amendments improve it. The Bill arises from a report prepared in August 1984 by the Industrial Property Advisory Committee which recommended that all extension of term provisions for patents be abolished.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill abolishes existing provisions for extensions for all inventions but introduces a new scheme to enable extension of patent term for pharmaceutical products. The Government decided on special treatment for pharmaceutical patents as part of a plan to develop the pharmaceutical industry in Australia. However, I note that that plan appears to be faltering. I observed in an article in the Australian of 13 June this year that Dr John Stocker, the Managing Director of AMRAD, one of a tiny group of Australian companies successfully developing new pharmaceuticals, recently addressed a science and industry forum in Melbourne and accused the Federal Government of sabotaging its own pharmaceutical industry development plan through conflicting aims, too much regulation and tax disincentives. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very interesting that he chose those three points about which to criticise the Government in relation to its pharmaceutical industry development plan when just this week we have had tabled a draft report of the Industries Assistance Commission which makes similar criticism of the Government for not looking to the proper development of industry because of conflicting aims, too much regulation and tax disincentives. It appears that that pharmaceutical plan is faltering and Dr Stocker has said that unless urgent measures are taken to encourage investment in the industry and remove hindrances, the plan might actually falter. </PARA>
<PARA> There were serious defects in the original Bill. For example, it provided for extensions of patent for imported pharmaceutical substances, but not for those from within Australia. So overseas interests were looked after but Australian patentees were not. Many important bodies complained about the serious defects of the Bill. The extension of term provisions in the Bill were fundamentally flawed and required substantial amendment to correct the problems. The Government was clearly in trouble. It took the Bill away for nearly 12 months and now it has brought it back in an amended form. Those amendments address many of the concerns raised by industry but not all the defects. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition parties will move two amendments in the committee stage-one to change the effective commencement date of the Bill with regard to applications for extensions of patent terms by non-pharmaceutical patentees, and a second to reduce the opportunity for a kind of blackmail in the circumstance arising in section 12. I will explain these further in the committee stage of the debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak very briefly to the Patents Amendment Bill 1989. It gives effect to the intention announced some time ago by the Government to change the arrangements for patents on pharmaceutical substances, which currently have a life of 16 years. Patentees have been able to apply to the court for an extension of up to 10 years. It has been up to the court to decide whether an extension will be granted. That arrangement is being replaced with what is essentially a guaranteed four-year extension.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason for this change relates to the very long period during which a number of pharmaceutical products are exposed to a testing program and an assessment of the results of that testing program. It has been pointed out by a number of pharmaceutical manufacturers and marketers that as soon as a company has a product which it thinks has potential, in order to avoid the possibility that another company may get aboard the bandwagon or lodge a patent before the first company can do so, at that stage, the company should patent the substance. There would be a lot of in-house testing to find out whether the substance was effective for the purposes for which the drug was being developed, and also some preliminary work on safety. It may take some considerable time before the company is sure that it has a product that it wants to go ahead with developing. Following that, of course, there is a much more extensive period during which a whole battery of acute, chronic and delayed toxicity tests are carried out. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, by their very nature, the delayed toxicity tests involve carcinogenicity tests which, in the standard protocol, involve tests on a large number of animals being followed for two years. Normally two species of animals-rats and mice-are watched for at least two years. Autopsies are then conducted and every tissue from every animal is submitted to pathological examination to see whether there are any tumors; the tumors are counted and statistical work is carried out. So the tests, by their very nature, take at least three years. When one adds the other tests, one is often looking at six or eight years before a product which has been patented reaches the point where the company is prepared and able to submit that substance for registration and regulation as a pharmaceutical agent in the market. </PARA>
<PARA> Once that substance is submitted, it goes through the assessment procedures by a particular body in each country. In Australia there are various committees that operate under the National Health and Medical Research Council. That process takes quite a long time. It might be eight or even 10 years between the time that a product is patented and the time that it actually appears on the market. For that reason a number of these companies have pointed out that the time frame between that eight or 10 year period and the expiration of the patent after 16 years is perhaps insufficient for them fully to recoup their development costs. In the case of totally new products, that cost is very considerable, for the reasons that I have mentioned. In particular, the carcinogenicity costs run into many hundreds of thousands of dollars just for one battery of tests. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the system at the moment, of course, at the end of the 16-year period the company can apply to the courts for an extension of up to 10 years, there being no certainty that that will be granted, there is the possibility that the extension granted may be for less than 10 years. There is also the problem of a lengthy court procedure. This Bill essentially guarantees to the company that it can get a fairly automatic four-year extension. In other words, the patent can be extended up to 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the way in which we operate, the Australian Democrats can see no problem with that procedure. It certainly streamlines the proceedings. I signal that the precedent which this has created is likely to be followed, or attempted to be followed, by the manufacturers of veterinary and agricultural chemicals. Indeed, the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia has already received evidence along those lines, both for and against a similar extension of four years for such products. There are arguments for and against such an extension. I am sure the Government will be put under pressure to extend these provisions to that area. Mention might even have been made of that by the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) in his second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA> I have some difficulty with the general philosophy of patents. It is implied that the person who develops an idea, in this case a chemical, should have some proprietary rights over that product. These products, by their nature, are products designed to improve the health status of individuals. It concerns me that people in this position are often, of necessity, highly educated people who have been through a public education process. A great deal of their education has been paid for by the community at large. The facilities which they have used during their education have been paid for by the community at large. Even the skills that they bring to bear in pursuing their education are not skills for which they themselves are responsible. Some people have the intellectual equipment to avail themselves of this high level of education and, as a consequence, are able to advance medical knowledge. But to say that that knowledge should be completely privatised, that the person who developed it has the exclusive privilege to exercise a legal proprietary right to exploit that knowledge, is something that needs to be questioned. </PARA>
<PARA> I would certainly prefer to see a great deal more public support for research and development. That knowledge, and the products which come from it, should remain in the public domain for the public good, and not be privatised. Although I have some fundamental difficulty with this type of legislation, given the system under which we operate, it seems to me that what the Government is proposing provides at least an administrative improvement on the system as it is at the moment. Therefore, the Democrats have no objection to this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators for their contributions to this debate, and particularly for the shortness of their contributions. I note Senator Coulter's general conceptual difficulty with patents. Otherwise, I agree with his comments in relation to the Patents Amendment Bill 1989. Senator Lewis has given notice of two amendments on behalf of the Opposition which the Government will not accept. In respect of one or two comments that he made, he relied on an article in the Australian of Tuesday, which claimed that the so-called pharmaceutical plan was faltering. That article quoted a speech by John Stocker, the Chief Executive of AMRAD, at some conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The pharmaceutical industry in this country is not subject to a plan. Historically, the problem with the pharmaceutical industry has been that it has always been foreign owned and has been tailored, as it were, to provide product for a captive market provided by the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. It is an industry which has some hangover, as it were, from the previous Government-that period of 30 years during which Opposition senators were in government-industries were encouraged to set up establishments here without any requirements in respect of research and development, exports, or development work to be done in Australia. The Government has looked at the pricing of pharmaceuticals under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Roughly, the prices obtained by drug companies in Australia are about 60 per cent of world market prices. That might be regarded as a success in terms of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme; it is not, of course, a success in terms of manufacturers and people who want to produce and export drugs and other pharmaceutical products from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We have recently introduced a scheme whereby pharmaceutical companies will be guaranteed higher prices under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme in return for commitments relating to research and development and exports from Australia. We are turning what one might describe as branch office companies, and the moribund nature of those institutions, into significant producing companies in Australia which will do research and development here and export goods from here. Four companies have already taken advantage of that scheme and have been awarded higher prices for their products in return for commitments in relation to research and development and exports. </PARA>
<PARA> These things will lead to a substantial expansion in the Australian pharmaceutical export capacity and the research and development which is conducted in Australia. Of course, that is what we have to be about in this country. We have to turn pro-active industrial activities into ones which are capable of contributing to the Australian economy in a realistic way. Some of Dr Stocker's remarks may have related to the generic pricing policy which is a different issue and is subject to further discussion by government. I wanted to comment on Senator Lewis's remarks. </PARA>

<PARA>(1) Page 7, clause 10, lines 24 to 31, leave out the clause, insert the following clause:</PARA>
<PARA>Continued operation of</PARA>
<PARA>Part IX of Principal Act</PARA>
<PARA> ``10. (1) Part IX of the Principal Act continues to apply to any proceedings that are pending under that Part at the commencement of this section. </PARA>
<PARA> ``(2) No proceedings are to be commenced under Part IX of the Principal Act after the commencement of this section.''. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Page 9, after subclause 12 (7), add the following new subclause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(8) In this section `person interested' means a person who, not later than 3 months after the commencement of this section, lodges, or is given leave by a prescribed court to lodge, a caveat in the proceedings that were pending in relation to a patent under Part IX of the Principal Act.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The first amendment does not affect pharmaceutical patentees who have been operating under the assumption that the new four-year extensions regime has been operating since 3 June 1988. What it would do if it is supported by this chamber is that it would give some breathing space to other patentees who might have been commencing proceedings when the Bill was introduced. I believe-I am sure the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) understands-that there would be a number of people who, at the time when this Bill was introduced, with its reference to a cut-off date, would have been in the process of having their patent applications prepared; they would have engaged their patent attorneys and their lawyers; and they really ought to have been given some sort of introductory period. I put it to the chamber that there would not be a flood of applications for extension because of this amendment. Preparing and pursuing an application is expensive. It has been estimated that a maximum of 10 patentees might be affected by this amendment. I put it to the Committee that it would be worth while carrying this amendment for their sake. </PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment will ensure that objectors to pharmaceutical patentees transferring to the new four-year extension provisions are bona fide objectors. I point out that clause 12 gives pharmaceutical manufacturers whose patents expired up to two years before introduction of the Bill the opportunity to switch to the new provisions if court proceedings for extension were pending as at 3 June 1988. To preserve the rights of objectors, the clause also gives an interested party the right to object to the switch and, if this objection is not withdrawn within three months, the patentee cannot use the new provisions. Patentees argue that this leaves them open to a form of blackmail because the interested party does not have to give grounds for objecting. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment proposed by the Opposition will give only those parties who have expressed objection to an extension of patents through the courts the right to object to the patentee switching to the new provisions. This preserves the right of bona fide objectors and, indeed, gives objectors a three-month period of grace in which to establish their credentials, while not allowing any interested party to object to the switch for nuisance reasons or simply to gain some advantage in some way or other. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicated earlier that the Government was not disposed to accept the Opposition amendments. I make one or two general points. The delay in implementing the Government's policy and the possible cost to the Commonwealth of departing from the 3 June 1988 cut-off date for commencing judicial extension proceedings would create difficulty. There are other objections of a general kind, but I will make one observation about the nature of the amendments. On the one hand, the changes that are inherent in Senator Lewis's amendments find favour with the Law Council of Australia. On the other hand, they do not find favour with the clients. The Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, which represents the industries which this legislation is designed to help, has expressed the wish that the Bill be passed without amendment as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will make a couple of points about amendment No. 1. The opportunity for pharmaceutical manufacturers to commence a judicial extension, which is denied by the Bill from 3 June 1989, is offset by the new provisions enabling an almost automatic extension of four years. That is what they want. The Bill trades a very uncertain possibility, of up to 10 years extension under the old system, involving high legal costs, for an almost certain four years extension with negligible costs. This is about reducing the costs to industries which have very high costs in terms of drug development, for example. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but Senator Lewis's amendment does not, in terms of cost. A strong argument against amendment No. 1 is, of course, the possible cost to the Commonwealth as well. The Department of Community Services and Health wants the 3 June 1988 date because it was stipulated to prevent a rush of protective patent extension applications under the old Act, regardless of the current age of the patent. The costs involved for the Department are very big. The legal costs would be in the order of $150,000 to $200,000. There could also be costs under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme wherever patentees were granted an extension of five or 10 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am advised that determination by the courts of all the outstanding proceedings which could result from the Opposition's amendment could take up to a decade. Senator Lewis is always lecturing me about the pace of change. Every day he tells me that this Government is too slow to do things, yet he has moved an amendment which could involve an industry in that sort of process. It is great for the lawyers! Implementation of the Bill's policy could be delayed for years if Senator Lewis's amendment is carried. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the second amendment relating to the definition of a person interested, the question is really whether the amendment's additional deterrent effect on vexatious objectors would outweigh the burden on genuine objectors who would be obliged to intervene in the judicial proceedings. We must bear in mind that patentees can already attack an objector's standing as a person interested. In those circumstances there seems to be little merit in the amendment. For those reasons the Government does not accept the proposals put forward by the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It should be understood that the question of whether we can complete the committee stage of this Bill today will depend on whether the Australian Democrats indicate where they stand in regard to these amendments. I say to the Minister, with all due respect, that one of his arguments always is to try to frighten people. He is saying, `I tell you this in terrorem: there has been an estimate that this might extend the period in which these matters can be dealt with by 10 years'.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me explain to the Minister why it is bunkum. The operating date was 3 June 1988. I think the Minister is saying `A patent application which was lodged on 2 June 1988 may take 10 years to complete, then I accept that a patent application lodged on 3 June-the day after-may take 10 years to complete'. I think that is what the Minister is saying, because these matters frequently take a long time to be completed. But the Government's cut-off date cuts off applications at the knees at that stage. It did not matter how well prepared an application to the Patent Office was at that stage; if it had not been lodged on 3 June, it was cut off. All I am saying is that, clearly, at that stage, there would not have been a large number of patent applications; we understand there might have been 10 patent applications at that stage which were well prepared and could have been lodged almost immediately-within a week. If the original Bill had stated, `Today, 3 June, is when we are introducing it, but we will make the cut-off day, say, 30 June or 10 June, or something of that nature', it would have given those people who had their applications well prepared a chance to lodge them. This amendment would grant that extension. It is as simple as that. The Minister should not try to adopt these arguments which frighten people, because they carry no water with us. Of course, they might carry some with the Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will not support these amendments. I do not know where that leaves this debate; whether it means that it has become contentious and we cannot complete consideration of it. It seems to me that when one is dealing with a change in the law which involves something like patents-and some of these patents are attached to pharmaceutical agents, which are extremely valuable to the particular companies-necessarily, there will be a requirement to act at a particular time and to act decisively, so that those who attempt to use knowledge about the change to get a pecuniary advantage are unable to do so. It seems to me that what the Opposition is attempting to do is to put the clock back so that some people are allowed to take advantage of something which was not knowledge at the time, but which is knowledge now, and allow them to start a process which could involve the granting of an extension of patent for up to 10 years. However long the legal process took, the patent could be extended for that length of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We certainly accept the Government's position that it is much tidier to introduce this legislation fairly quickly; to make it clear that the uncertain 10-year period is replaced with a reasonably certain four-year period. That is fairer; everybody knows where they stand. My understanding is that there may be as few as two companies that may be involved in the process of actually preparing a case at the relevant time. I think the degree of penalty which is being imposed is quite small. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Two weeks in a row, in answer to questions by Senators Beahan and Giles, Senator Cook misrepresented my public statements on the benefits of chelation therapy for people suffering from cardiovascular disease and other circulatory problems. Firstly, Senator Cook said that my statements were based on anecdotal evidence. They are not. They are based on extensive research conducted by the Cypher Corporation in the United States of America and by cardiovascular surgeons and general practitioners-to name just a few.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Cook admitted that the Government permits ethylene diamine tetra acetate for the treatment of patients with heavy metal poisoning. Yet he claimed that I am promoting a dangerous substance. Senator Cook's statement is contradictory and simply untrue. Senator Cook also claimed that I am promoting a miracle cure or wonder drug. That is not so. I have always maintained that all research shows that it helps only between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of patients which, I might add, is a very high percentage. Senator Cook also claimed that the only way for it to be approved was by proper trialling. That is not so. Penicillin and Digoxine did not have double-blind trials done in Australia before approval. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook also claimed that I said that Australia was the only country in the world not allowing chelation. He quoted a Hansard interjection from 9 June. However, try as hard as Hansard does, not all interjections are reported totally accurately. I have never said that. I would never say such a thing as I know more about the subject than the Minister for Resources is ever likely to know. That statement is simply not true. What I have said is that it is used widely all around the world: in the United Kingdom, Europe, the United States of America and New Zealand-just to name a few. Senator Cook also stated that I should provide to the relevant Minister any information that I have available, as if I had not already done so.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House of Representatives has returned to the Senate the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 indicating that it has agreed to three of the four amendments made by the Senate: the two related to the introduction of the vocational register and differential payment of fees to general practitioners and the introduction of the 008 number for access to departmental officers, and the provision whereby a sunset clause was to be imposed upon the new health reinsurance arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition is very pleased that the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) has indicated that he accepts the amendments made in relation to general practitioners and is very grateful for the indication by the Minister of the Government's willingness to cooperate with the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance which has been established. I heard the Minister in the course of his remarks in the House of Representatives refer to the question of possible extension of the terms of reference of that Committee in respect of the work that it needs to do in looking at insurance and reinsurance arrangements. I indicate to the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) that the Opposition will be more than happy to facilitate at some later stage any expansion of the terms of reference in line with the comments that the Minister made in the House of Representatives. Nevertheless, we are very pleased that amendments Nos 1 and 2 have been adopted. We believe that they will substantially improve the health care system in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The House of Representatives has disagreed to amendment No. 3 for the reasons which are set forth in the schedule attached to its message. Basically it says that the Government does not believe that it could respond to the Senate committee report between the time of its reporting in March and the operation of the sunset clause on 1 July. We do not believe that the Government cannot respond within that period of time. </PARA>
<PARA> The House of Representatives committee of reasons then says that uncertainty would be created for health funds and that proposed benefits would flow to contributors. We believe that it is a quite specious argument for the reasons that were set out at some length in the course of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the House of Representatives says that the threat of a possible return to the current reinsurance arrangements will undermine the reinforcement of the community rating principle which the legislation is designed to achieve. We reject that as an argument. We have consistently said-and I repeated it in the debate yesterday-that the Opposition is fully in support of the principle of community rating and has not sought in any way to derogate from the principle of community rating. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the Opposition has throughout made it clear that it wishes to see passage of this Bill. It contains a number of desirable elements, including those related to pathology tables and services and amendments to the Nursing Homes Act. We have two Senate inquiries as a result of the passage of this Bill: one by a standing committee which will deal with certain nursing home matters and one by the select committee which has been established and to which amendments Nos 1 and 2 to which the House of Representatives has now agreed relate. Because we wish to secure the passage of the Bill and believe that it is important, although we reject each of the three reasons given by the Government in disagreeing with the Senate amendment No. 3, it is not the intention of the Opposition to press the amendment calling for the sunset clause and I therefore indicate that the Opposition will support the motion moved by the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats are disappointed that a deal has been done between the Government and the Opposition on this matter. The arguments which Senator Puplick has just brought out are certainly those that he used yesterday to support the sunset clause. I would again like to run through the three reasons which the House of Representatives gives. I suppose it is more proper to say that the Government members of the House of Representatives gave those reasons because I do not imagine that the Opposition there supported them. It would have been Government members of the House of Representatives who put forward the reason that there was insufficient time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has three members on the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance. Those three members presumably will speak with their colleagues during the time that evidence is being taken and will indicate the way that evidence is pointing. The Government will also be aware of that evidence and, even before the Committee reports, presumably will be shaping up towards some sort of a reconsideration of what could be put in place to better serve the interests of both the public and the private insurance industries. The requirement for some continuing access to the existing arrangements would be quite easily met, if the Government did not have sufficient time, by merely bringing in an amending Bill which would contain clauses 37 and 38 and give an extension of time to those. There are a number of ways in which the Government could adequately deal with that time constraint. </PARA>
<PARA> I pointed out yesterday that the uncertainty for the health funds has been created by the Government itself, which has repeatedly and consistently changed the rules over all the years that it has been in office. Through doing that it has made it very difficult for private insurance companies to properly calculate their actuarial scales, to set packages of private insurance and calculate the premiums. The creation of the Committee which is reconsidering this matter is itself the mechanism which ensures the continuing uncertainty of that for a time. But, hopefully, within 12 months one will get out of this consideration by the Committee something which would better serve the health insurance industry, both public and private, so that at least a time limit is set on that uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA> The deletion of the sunset clause has the effect of extending the period of uncertainty. If we are right, what the Government is now doing is simply applying a bandaid to the industry without any long term benefits. Unless the Government acts quickly the uncertainty will be extended by the deletion of the sunset clause. In relation to a threat to a possible return to the current reinsurance arrangements, the Bill ignores the fact that those arrangements include the principle of community rating. The Government has chosen to extend that principle in a particular way. There are other ways in which the community rating principle could have been extended. Hopefully, those possible alternatives will be looked at by the Senate Select Committee and recommendations will be made to incorporate the community rating principle. Like the Opposition, the Australian Democrats totally support that principle, but would extend it in a way that would better serve both public and private insurance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying when this debate was interrupted earlier, this amendment is a very simple one. It just requires the Commonwealth Minister to consult with the governments of the States or Territories that may be affected by the inquiry. The Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) has, in effect, acknowledged that that is reasonable but claims that he will do it anyway. I put it to the Minister that in a federation where one has a constitution which sets out the rights and obligations of the Commonwealth and the States it is not adequate for the Minister to just say, `Well, of course, we will do that anyway. We are dealing with this Bill in a situation where we could easily put this amendment in and it would be acceptable'. I must refer to something Senator Sanders said in relation to this matter during the second reading debate when he said in effect-I cannot quite recall the precise words; but I think he would acknowledge this-that the best thing that could happen in Australia was the abolition of the States. I see that Senator Sanders is nodding his head and giving me the thumbs up sign to indicate that he supports that.</PARA></TALK.START>

Let me go a step further and say to the people of the Australian Capital Territory that Senator Sanders will be putting himself up as a candidate for the Australian Capital Territory at the next Senate election. Clearly he wants to abolish the States. The people of the Australian Capital Territory should be aware that he will no doubt also want to abolish the Territories, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. He signals that he approves of that. That will be the policy that he will put before the people of the Australian Capital Territory at the next election-if elected he will support the abolition of the Australian Capital Territory. I hope that my colleague Senator Reid has noted that for her campaign speeches.

They would need to be, in my view, a legitimate, bona fide organisation, or a person with a national reputation, that is worthy of consultation. The Government is saying that before it would refer those references, it would consult broadly. Senator Sanders asked whether that includes environmental organisations as that is of particular interest to him. My answer was that yes, it does. Senator Panizza asked me whether it included industry organisations, be they primary industries or mining industries. My answer is that yes, it does.

<PARA> (b) the evidence, statement or document, contains information of a kind referred to in subsection 32 (3) of this Act.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The main purpose of these amendments is set out in amendment No. 7, which relates to the addition of proposed new subsections to be inserted after subclause 32 (2). Amendment No. 8 is a qualifying amendment. The change sounds fairly complicated but it really is fairly simple. The truth is that we are trying to protect commercial in-confidence evidence and commercial in-confidence documents which witnesses who come before the Resource Assessment Commission may be required to give, or may give voluntarily, which, of course, is the best way for it to be given, but given on the basis that they know it will be kept confidential to the Commission. There is ultimately an overriding provision which would enable the Minister at the end of the day to disclose the information if it was believed to be essential in the public interest. Actually, it is put in the reverse: that it would not be contrary to the public interest for information not to be disclosed. In any event there is an overriding clause. </PARA>
<PARA> We put it to the Committee that there will be evidence of capital investment, that there will be evidence of profits, that there will be projections of profits by some companies, and they may wish to keep it commercially confidential. As I indicated during my speech on the second reading, there may be new techniques or new technologies which they may wish to use. One can imagine that, as the years go on, further techniques will arise in the mining industry in particular, and that there may be some commercial advantage in the companies keeping these techniques or technologies secret until such time as they have entered into the public domain. </PARA>
<PARA> We put it to the Committee that it would be reasonable and proper that the Bill enable this sort of commercial in-confidence material to be kept so by the Commission. I am sure that it would be to the advantage of the Commission to be able to assure witnesses that their information could be kept commercial in-confidence to encourage them to be quite open about the sort of evidence they would be prepared to provide to the Commission. It is the sort of thing that we believe should have been considered by a Senate committee in the first place, but as the Government and the Democrats have combined to prevent the referral of this Bill to a Senate committee, the Opposition has put forward the amendments at this stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats do not support these amendments. In the past we have often been involved in situations where the excuse of so-called proprietary information has been used to prevent valuable data, which was essential to the discussion of the resource, from being made public. I can quote two instances, one being the case of the Hydro-Electric Commission in Tasmania during the dams dispute. It never did reveal the price of power to the major users of power. When it finally did come up, it turned out that it was well below the cost of generation; it was a massive subsidy to Comalco Ltd, Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd and all the other major users in Tasmania. Obviously, if we are to have a resource/environment discussion we must know the basic economics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another instance, which is more current, is that we still do not know how much the Japanese are actually paying for the woodchips taken out of the south-east forests of New South Wales. This is so-called proprietary information. But, if we are going to frame an argument or discussion about the value of an industry in economic terms versus the environmental damage, we must have this information available in trying to come to some rational conclusion. It must be public information. For that reason we are not supporting these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is sensitive to the issue about commercial confidentiality that has been raised by Senator Austin Lewis. I will quickly say why we wish to keep the present arrangements and reject these amendments. First, we are relatively sure that industry is relaxed about the present arrangements. We have consulted, as best we can, a number of bodies in the period since we became aware of these amendments. None of them have raised any serious difficulty. From that point of view, we believe that the existing proposal is adequate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, the existing proposal matches that already operating in the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC). The IAC has been around for about 20 years. There have been no problems about its observance of commercial confidentiality. There has been no scandal. We think that that is a reasonable model and we see no reason to change. We cite a further reason. Some of the users of this Commission may be people who are used to the IAC procedures. A degree of familiarity with those procedures is probably an advantage in that, if there is a congruence between both, at least people who use both know what those procedures are and they are clear. For those reasons, we reject the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA>The first amendment relates to the annual report. Clause 56 (3) on page 18 of the Bill states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister shall cause a copy of the report to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 25 sitting days of that House after the day on which the Minister received the report. </PARA>
<PARA>Twenty-five sitting days is an enormous amount of sitting days. After all, we sit only eight days in a four-week period. So we are really looking at a possibility of the report being tabled 14, maybe 16, weeks after the Minister gets it. I see no reason why the Senate should wait 25 sitting days. Accordingly, I have moved the amendment for a requirement that the report be tabled within 15 sitting days. The Minister would then have up to two months in which to table the report. That would be a much more reasonable time for the Senate and the other House to receive the report. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendment is to correct what is really a mistake in some draftsman's book of precedents. A Bill has a title; it does not have a long title. It happens to have a short title as well. But it does not necessarily have a long title just because it has a short title. Occasionally we tend to call it the long title but we really mean the title to the Bill.

<PARA>Amendment No. 2 is basically a continuation of my first amendment, which related to the Australian Heritage Commission. It would allow that Commission to be involved in a matter before the Commission which relates to the National Estate. Amendment No. 3 relates to giving people who have appeared before the Commission or who have prepared material for the Commission some recompense or remuneration for their activities. Amendment No. 4 is also related to that. Amendment No. 5 involves lofty principles. I shall not go through them in detail. They involve the idea of sustainability, ecosystem integrity and other such concepts which, I am glad to say, can now be included in legislation. For too long we have had legislation which was divorced from the real world. The concept of sustainability and ecological integrity will become a standard clause in Bills, I believe, as we learn more about the workings of our environment and how fragile it is. I commend these sentiments and these amendments to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister to give the Committee an explanation of what he believes is the Government's explanation of the language which is adopted in these amendments. This is important from the point of view of statutory interpretation, now that the courts are entitled to take into consideration the debate in the chamber on the meaning of words. In particular, I refer to Democrat amendment No. 5 about the principles to be inserted in the Bill. In principle No. 1 of Schedule 1, the main change is to include after the word `conservation' the words in brackets `including all environmental and ecological considerations'. That also occurs in principle No. 3. Principle No. 2 of Schedule 1 refers to words we heard Senator Sanders tell us during the second reading debate are words that everyone knows the meaning of because they are used in some book that he referred to. I would be very interested to know what the Minister thinks the High Court of Australia would interpret them as meaning. In particular, I find the word `sustainability' fascinating. I have my doubts as to what its meaning might be. I ask the Minister to express his views as to the meaning of the words. What does `ecological integrity' mean? What does `ecosystem integrity' mean? What does `sustainability' mean? What does the Minister consider to be the meaning of the phrases `the sustainability of any development' and `an equitable distribution of the return on resources'? I think there will be great arguments before the High Court of Australia in due course as to the meaning of all of those words and expressions. I would be interested to hear what the Minister thinks they might mean.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to ask a few questions and make a few comments on these amendments. Amendment No. 1 moved by the Australian Democrats seeks to insert `the Australian Heritage Commission' into clause 14 of the Bill. We got rid of that amendment. Amendment No. 2 inserts a new clause regarding the Australian Heritage Commission. The amendments seek to put the Australian Heritage Commission in a privileged position, above many other organisations. Amendment No. 3 concerns `remuneration as is prescribed for the performance of work involved in collecting and preparing the evidence or documents'. I note that this applies only if the chairperson so agrees or considers it appropriate. The obligation to consider whether it is appropriate certainly puts a load on the chairperson.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This could be an open cheque book for anyone who may wish to prepare a case to put before the Commission for any reason whatsoever. Most of the radical splinter groups, which will be putting submissions before the Commission, will be doing so only for the purpose of locking up resources, not opening them up. I would like to know what sort of an open cheque book will result from these provisions and whether they will result in open slather for these radical splinter groups to stop Australia's progress. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lewis asked the Minister for an interpretation of the words in amendment No. 5 `including all environmental and ecological considerations'. If one wants those principles to apply, other principles should also be included in the legislation, the main consideration being the return to the Australian people on Australia's resources, resources which under this legislation we will not be able to make use of. Plenty of others could do so. Senator Lewis questioned the meaning of the word `equitable' in this amendment, as part of the phrase `equitable distribution'. I question the word `distribution'. Who do the Democrats have in mind that the return on resources be distributed to? It could be distributed widely. I probably have different ideas from the Minister and the Democrats regarding how the return on resources will be distributed. </PARA>

We are interested in reconciliation. For all of those obvious reasons-reasons for which we are well known-we accept the amendments. Let me go to the questions that have been asked by honourable senators opposite. A series of different amendments has been moved. It would be convenient for me to take them in the order in which they appear on the paper, which means that I will start with the questions raised by Senator Panizza and conclude with questions raised by Senator Austin Lewis. The first question Senator Panizza asked was why the Australian Heritage Commission is being required to be consulted.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have dealt with the first part of that amendment. Let me deal with the second part of it. The Australian Heritage Commission is required under amendment No. 2 to appear before and make submissions to the Resource Assessment Commission when matters of the National Estate are being dealt with by the Resource Assessment Commission. We support this amendment. Whether this amendment were to be enforced or not, almost always the Australian Heritage Commission would wish to appear at such hearings. However this amendment, if enacted, would impose upon the Commission a statutory obligation to do so. In our view it is to the point that it should. The National Estate is something that the Australian Heritage Commission assesses. By undertaking that assessment and declaring areas or properties on the National Estate it tells Australia and the world what areas or properties of national significance in Australia ought to be conserved or protected. There is a whole body that argues whether the Commission makes the right judgment. I do not propose to enter into that argument. But the Commission is a government authority and is independent of ministerial direction. It makes its decisions on the evidence that it adduces and the scientific studies that it conducts. It seems appropriate, therefore, that it should have a statutory obligation to appear before the Resource Assessment Commission. We accept the amendment because of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we go to amendment No. 3, the second point made by Senator Panizza is that an awful load is put on the Chairperson of the Resource Assessment Commission in determining whether people are entitled to payment or not. At first blush, it may appear to be true, but we appoint at a good salary people with a lot of experience and who have prestige and standing in the community to make responsible decisions. The least important decision that the Commission will make is whether people should be paid for coming before it. All its other decisions on how to balance environmental concerns and developmental concerns are of vastly greater importance in terms of the national good. So I do not think we can quibble with the quality of people who will be making these decisions. Therefore, I do not accept the argument that these people will not be able to make this particular class of decision. In the case of this particular class of decision, clearly the type of material that they present and its value to furthering the interests of the inquiry will be something to be taken into consideration when deciding whether they ought to be paid for preparing or presenting that and appearing to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that we have got a wide range of organisations with various economic and financial capacity, from perhaps major mining houses on one side to a voluntary regional environmental group on the other, there should be some equality in being able to present an argument to the Commission and adduce information and facts. Because financially a local regional body may not have the capacity of a mining house to do that, there ought to be some means of evening up the scales so that the Commission can hear all the evidence. Let me now turn to the question of the meaning of these words--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House of Representatives is waiting, but the Senate is used to causing it to do so. However, I will not delay the other place any further. This is an important question. I thank Senator Lewis for asking it. I now propose to answer it. In our view, there is no distinction or particular point to be drawn from the fact that some words that have been added appear in brackets and other words do not. The words that appear in brackets and the words that have been added that do not appear in brackets are, in our view, a more current usage of the language. The language that was in the original Bill was language which was drawn from the Australian conservation strategy. That is a document of some years back. The usage of terms in this area has altered since that time. It seems appropriate to us that we recognise that that is so, but we say that it does not add to the meaning of the words that are there. It expresses that meaning in a more modern or more current way.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does the Minister believe that under amendment No. 2 the Australian Heritage Commission could in fact delay or hold up the inquiry if ever it refused to give evidence? This amendment says that it `shall give evidence about the matter to the inquiry'. That might very well put the Australian Heritage Commission in a situation where it could say, `Well, you're not going to complete this inquiry. We are not going to give evidence and, therefore, you cannot complete it'. That is the first point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point is that this greedy amendment will enable people perhaps to spend three months at the Franklin River on the dole and then turn up at this inquiry and say, `Look, during that three months I spent at the Franklin River I gathered all this information about movement of the river and whether the water runs straight or crooked as it goes around bends. I want to give all this evidence to you'. At the end of that day, he can then take a payment. It has been put to me that what Minister Kerin was saying is that the Resource Assessment Commission would ask people to go away and collect evidence. Clearly, if they were to do that, I would have no objection to their being paid. But it was put that this did not mean a payment for past work that was not asked to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment moved by the Australian Democrats makes it quite clear that they may be reimbursed for such expenses or compensation for such losses as were reasonably incurred in collecting and preparing the evidence or documents. Such evidence might have nothing whatsoever to do with the sort of evidence that the Commission may have wanted. But the Commission would have to hear the evidence first. The Minister said that the Chairperson could reject these applications. With all due respect, can one imagine the Chairperson, on his or her very substantial salary, saying to these people, `We have heard your evidence and we are not going to allow you some claim for compensation.'? It is just defying the imagination. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Okay. The first question was: can the Australian Heritage Commission, by not being ready, seek to delay or hold up indefinitely the proceedings? The word `shall' should be read as meaning that it shall do what is required by that provision. Whether it wants to or not, as Senator Panizza says-I draw the same conclusion as Senator Panizza; it is probably in the interests of the industry rather than the interests of the environment that it be heard-the Australian Heritage Commission is an authority set up under an Act by the Commonwealth with particular purposes. Its purposes are to decide what is and what is not the National Estate and declare those areas or properties as part of the National Estate. It is entirely proper that there be a compulsion or a statutory obligation on that body to make any information about its assessments or views available to the Commission. I could not imagine that it would act capriciously to withhold, delay or adjourn indefinitely any of those matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Lewis's second question was about the provision of allowances or disbursement for witnesses. Again, Senator Lewis put forward a proposal which, it has to be said, is an extremely unlikely scenario. We propose to appoint a distinguished Australian judge to head the Commission. He will decide whether material presented to it is frivolous, is of no value to it, or has been prepared in the expectation of funding some work that has no utilitarian value to the inquiry. To suggest that he would make a wrong decision is not fair. In such circumstances in the past it has not been found that projects that are not of use have been funded in a frivolous or silly way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the deferral of consideration of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1989 by this chamber we were primarily concerned with those clauses which confer on the Commissioner of Taxation a discretion to make available to certain specified law enforcement agencies information which may be useful to those agencies, both with regard to investigation of a serious offence and in regard to following up what is known as the proceeds of crime, that is, the profits which unscrupulous people make from their criminal activities; such information not to be voluntarily or compulsorily disclosed in court, except in relation to post-conviction proceedings relating to the proceeds of crime, but nevertheless, material which could be of use to those law enforcement agencies in their investigations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the request of Senator Macklin and Senator Stone I undertook to write to the Privacy Commissioner, Mr Kevin O'Connor, to obtain from him an assessment of these provisions in light of the privacy principles which this chamber thought were important when it passed the Privacy Act late last year. Mr O'Connor has responded and I circulated the response to both Senator Macklin and Senator Stone a couple of days ago. Mr O'Connor indicates that the proposed amendments meet the requirements of the information privacy principles. I seek leave to incorporate Mr O'Connor's response in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA>Minister for Justice</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>My dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter of 9 June 1989 requesting my advice under section 27 (1) (b) of the Privacy Act, in relation to proposed amendments on access to taxation information forming part of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1989 currently before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Privacy Act sets down standards governing the disclosure of information in Information Privacy Principle 11 set out in Section 14. </PARA>
<PARA> That Principle acknowledges that it is permissible in certain exceptional situations for a government agency to disclose personal information for a purpose other than the one for which it was collected. The two exceptions of relevance to the present amendments are exceptions (d) and (e) of IPP 11.1, i.e.,</PARA>
<PARA> ``(d) the disclosure is required or authorised by or under law; or</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the disclosure is reasonably necessary for the enforcement of the criminal law or of a law imposing a pecuniary penalty, of for the protection of the public revenue.''</PARA>
<PARA> Disclosures for law enforcement or public revenue reasons must be logged. IPP 11.2 states:</PARA>
<PARA> ``Where personal information is disclosed for the purposes of enforcement of the criminal law or a law imposing a pecuniary penalty, or for the purpose of the protection of the public revenue, the record-keeper shall include in the record containing that information a note of the disclosure.''</PARA>
<PARA> Moreover the recipient of personal information disclosed under one of the exceptions must not make any further inconsistent use of that information. IPP 11.3 states:</PARA>
<PARA> ``A person, body or agency to whom personal information is disclosed under clause 1 of this Principle shall not use or disclose the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which the information was given to the person, body or agency.''</PARA>
<PARA> In my view the proposed amendments (see clauses 26 and 28 of the Bill) meet the requirements of the Information Privacy Principles. They, in effect, require logging or notation of any disclosure by the Commissioner of Taxation, who is required to report to Parliament. They restrict use of the information to criminal intelligence purposes with two exceptions: the information may be made available to the court after conviction in proceeds of crime cases and in prosecutions for tax related offences. Unlike a number of disclosure provisions currently found in federal legislation, the amendments define clearly the category of information that may be disclosed and identify who may be a recipient. Furthermore it is an offence for a law enforcement agency to misuse information (proposed Section 3e (7)). This is an improvement on the position under IPP 11.3 which contains no sanction for misuse of information by a non-Federal recipient. </PARA>
<PARA> While any statutory exception allowing disclosures of this kind is at odds with the strict meaning of privacy, I must observe that Parliament, in enacting the Privacy Act and frequently at other times in bringing forward legislation, has allowed exceptions to the strict principle for law enforcement and revenue reasons. I have indicated in a number of public statements since taking office that I will, over time, be reviewing all Commonwealth statutory personal information disclosure provisions in particular the terms of the authority they confer on Ministers or administrative officials. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have indicated, I consider that the present proposed amendments conform to the Information Privacy Principles. In addition, I should note that I have extensive powers to monitor and audit agency compliance with the Act. I intend giving priority in exercising my audit responsibilities to certain areas. Those areas include the use by agencies of statutory release discretions especially where exercised for law enforcement purposes. In auditing those releases, I will give special emphasis to releases of particularly sensitive data such as would be likely to occur in the present case. I will be reporting on the nature and extent of those releases in my annual reports to Parliament and, if necessary, drawing attention to any practices which I regard as unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> I am available to discuss this advice with you or other members of the Senate, as desired. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The important parts in that response dealt with his view that the proposed amendments-clauses 26 to 28 of the Bill-meet the requirements of the information privacy principles. He emphasises restriction of the use to intelligence gathering functions of the law enforcement agencies. He notes that the legislation defines clearly the category of information that may be disclosed and identifies who may be a recipient. He notes that it is an offence for a law enforcement agency to misuse information. He also notes that this is an improvement on the position under the information privacy principles which contain no sanction for misuse of information by a non-Federal recipient. It is an advance on the information privacy principles which commended themselves to this chamber late last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition Mr O'Connor notes, as I explained to the Senate, he has extensive powers to monitor and audit agency compliance with the Act. He emphasises that he intends to give priority in exercising those audit responsibilities to areas including the use by agencies of statutory release discretions especially when exercised for law enforcement purposes. He refers to this provision as allowing the disclosure of particularly sensitive information. He will be taking special note and using the notation provisions to ensure that his audit is comprehensive in order to enable him to report to the Parliament and, if necessary, to draw the Parliament's attention to any practice he regards as unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> On the same day as I received that advice from Mr Kevin O'Connor, I received from the office of the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police (AFP), because that office had been noting the way in which the debate had been developing, an interesting brief relating to a recent case in Sydney which highlighted the need for police access to taxation information relating to illegal activities. On Tuesday 6 June, the Australian Federal Police was made aware by a reporter from the Manly Daily that a Mr Ferguson had pleaded guilty in North Sydney court that day to understating his taxable income. Mr Ferguson also admitted that the money in question had been derived from the importation of hashish into Australia. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) had not informed the AFP of this case. When the Assistant Commissioner of the AFP's eastern region contacted the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation about the matter he was informed-quite properly-that the ATO could not pass information to the AFP because of the secrecy provisions of the legislation under which it works. The AFP, which, nevertheless, had been alerted by the Manly Daily reporter, located Ferguson-the person concerned-on Saturday 10 June as he was preparing to fly to India. He was charged with importation of hashish under the Customs Act. There are further proceedings so I will not elaborate further. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a good instance of a case where quite clearly the Commissioner of Taxation had information available from interviews of a person who was understating his taxable income. The ATO had admissions from that person, apparently, that the non-disclosed income had been derived, at least in part, from drug dealing but the Commissioner of Taxation was prevented from passing that information to the AFP, which, by luck, managed to locate the person concerned as he was preparing to fly to India. That instance indicates how useful, if carefully monitored by the Privacy Commissioner, reported upon by this Parliament, the exercise of that discretion in the hands of the Taxation Commissioner could be. </PARA>

This fund was admitted to the gift provisions on the merits of its objectives. The fund exists to promote peace, culture and charity-a formidable task-in Ireland, North and South. The fund's objectives are achieved through the provision of specific grants to help the genuinely needy. I refer to a letter from Allen, Allen &amp; Hemsley, solicitors and notaries, who made the application on 18 November 1987, which indicates the purposes of the fund. </PARA>

<PARA>Commonwealth of Australia,</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA>THE AUSTRALIAN-IRELAND FUND</PARA>
<PARA> We act for The Australian Ireland Fund a trust fund devoted to charitable purposes which benefit the communities of Ireland and Northern Ireland. A copy of the proposed Declaration of Trust whereby the Trustee, the Australian Ireland Fund Limited will hold the Fund for the charitable purposes set out in Clause 1 (1) (e) of the Declaration is enclosed together with a copy of the proposed Rules of the Fund. We understand that this Declaration and the Rules will be executed by the Trustee as soon as the appropriate resolution has been passed by the Company. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of our client, we wish to submit that Section 78 (a) (1) of the Income Tax Act 1936, as amended (the ``Tax Act'') be amended by adding to the list of funds, authorities and institutions therein appearing, the name of The Australian Ireland Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> Neither the Fund nor the Trustee will be associated with any political party or group in Ireland or Northern Ireland. Additionally, the administration of the Fund will be non-sectarian. It is intended to use donations to the Fund to fund programmes which will foster peace and harmony in and between these countries and improve the general living conditions, welfare and quality of life of the people living therein as detailed in the proposed Declaration of Trust. </PARA>
<PARA>It is envisaged that the Fund will appeal to a large section of the Australian public, particularly those of Irish background. It is the intention that the public will actively canvass for contributions to the Fund. Obviously any such appeal for donations will be greatly enhanced if donations to the Fund are tax deductable. </PARA>
<PARA>The founders of the Australian Ireland Fund in Australia, in addition to Mr M. A. McGrath, and his wife include Charles P. Curran A.O. of Sydney the Chairman of St Vincents Hospital, Sydney and amongst whose many directorships are included the Royal New South Wales Institute for Deaf &amp; Blind Children, Peter M. Cosgrove of Sydney, Company Director, prominent in advertising and media circles, and Patrick J. Lynam of Sydney, Merchant Banker. Additionally, Mrs Margaret Whitlam, the Earl of Portarlington, Ambassador James Sharkey and Sir Sidney Nolan have agreed to be directors of the Fund. It is anticipated that some of these persons will be directors of the company acting as trustee of the Fund (viz., The Australian Ireland Fund Limited) (a company limited by guarantee) and/or Governors of the Fund as provided in the Rules. The Fund will therefore be controlled by persons of standing in the community. </PARA>
<PARA>As you will appreciate because the Fund is nascent public contributions have not yet been solicited. The first function on behalf of the Fund will be held on 1 December 1987 at which time donations will be solicited. Accordingly it is respectfully submitted that the requested amendment to the Tax Act be made retroactive to today's date, being the date of incorporation of the Trustee. </PARA>
<PARA>A copy of the Memorandum and Articles of Association of The Australian Ireland Fund Limited is also enclosed for your information. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If we have disposed of that particular issue for this particular session of the Parliament, perhaps we may return to the four Opposition amendments. I listened carefully to what Senate Tate said today in respect of the matter which he reported to us and I have read the letter from Mr O'Connor. I thank the Minister for providing me with a copy at an earlier stage. I want to say a few things about the situation we appear to have reached on these amendments. The first thing is that, while obviously I accept everything that Mr O'Connor says in his letter, I do not find it as persuasive in respect of the Opposition amendments as the Minister appears to do. I note, for example, that Mr O'Connor very precisely says that the proposed amendments-that is, the Government's amendments in the Bill:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . restrict use of the information to criminal intelligence purposes, with two exceptions: the information may be made available to the court after conviction in proceeds of crime cases and prosecutions for tax related offences. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are fairly large exceptions, particularly the second of them. I somewhat raised my eyebrows at another passage in Mr O'Connor's letter where he said:</PARA>
<PARA>While any statutory exception allowing disclosures of this kind is at odds with the strict meaning of privacy, . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There is certainly no doubt about that. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>I must observe that Parliament . . . has allowed exceptions to the strict principle for law enforcement and revenue reasons. </PARA>
<PARA>That is perfectly true, as we are all well aware. The position of the Opposition on this matter is not in any way to question that such an exception should have been made in the past or, indeed, that some further exceptions should now be made in that respect. The thrust of the Opposition's amendments is not to question that basic point but rather to lay down some mechanics for the manner in which that exception is given effect. As will be clear from reading our amendments, their principal thrust is to change, so to speak, the onus of action from the Commissioner of Taxation, in respect of whom this Bill places the onus, to provide information of this kind to the law enforcement authorities when, in his judgment, it is appropriate to do so to an onus where it is open to the law enforcement agencies to seek information where, in their opinion, they have grounds for doing so and where, in the opinion of a Federal Court of Australia judge, those grounds are sufficient to form the basis of an application to the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> Rightly or wrongly, it is the view of the Opposition that we are dealing here with a question of principle. I want also to say in relation to that that I am somewhat concerned about the position into which, as far as I can see, the Australian Taxation Office and the Commissioner of Taxation are now getting themselves-or, I should say, being put by the government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> In a moment I will come to the example the Minister gave of a court case somewhere in Sydney. I want to say something about that too. I think there is a situation where, before very long, we will have the Commissioner of Taxation or the Taxation Office being described as the office of pimps, the office of informers or something of that kind. I do not make those comments lightly or frivolously. There is a very serious question at issue here. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation and his officers have, since the Taxation Office was first set up, I believe-notwithstanding some criticisms they have naturally received from time to time; tax gatherers are never popular-generally received a good deal of respect from the Australian tax paying public. They have earned that respect, for the most part, as I say, with very few exceptions, by maintaining a proper sense of decorum and propriety in their dealings with the public. I can certainly remember many occasions in my previous capacity when, in discussions about this kind of matter with the present Commissioner's predecessors and their officers, the point has been very forcefully argued from the point of view of the Australian Taxation Office that it is essential to the prosecution of its normal day to day work that its officers should not be seen to form a body which passed onto other possibly quite properly interested agencies information of a taxation confidentiality kind coming into their possession. </PARA>
<PARA> It has always been a question as to how to weigh up the pros and cons of that. I think in recent years the balance of that weighing process has swung towards saying that it is appropriate under certain circumstances for the Commissioner to make information available in certain specified circumstances because of the strong and increasing concern in the Australian public, a concern which the Opposition fully shares, about the growth of organised crime in this country. There is a feeling that we need more weapons against that and that it is wrong of us to forgo a possible weapon through the use of information coming into the possession of the Commissioner of Taxation for other reasons. I understand all that but at some point we have to consider drawing a line. The Opposition is not at all satisfied that the Government has drawn that line in the proper place. On the contrary, our position is that we believe that the Government is now stepping across that line and, as I say, is in the process of turning the Taxation Office into an office of informers. I think that will redound, not to the discredit so much of the Taxation Office or its staff-although that is probably the case as well-but, more importantly, to the lessening of its effectiveness as a revenue collection agency, which, after all, is its primary purpose. I have not sought to discover what the view is within the Taxation Office itself of the likely effects of the passage of this provision in the Bill before us but I would be somewhat surprised if there were not serious misgivings in the Australian Taxation Office on that score. I leave that matter there. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister quoted a particular case in support of the view that he put to us that we should not object to the provisions of the Bill to which we are objecting. There was a case of a drug dealer being convicted in a Sydney magistrates court for taxation offences. This led to the information becoming publicly available that he had obtained his ill-gotten gains through drug dealing and that this information, which has been in the possession of the Commissioner, had not previously been made known to the police. As the Minister quite rightly observed this had not previously been made known to the law enforcement authorities, to the police, and that only for the court case they would never had known about it. I understand the Minister's example. Of course, one would be thoroughly approving of the action taken in that case by the police force concerned to catch up with the gentleman, if that is the right word, in question. I have to say-I am sure that the Minister would agree with this-that hard cases make bad law. The Minister can come in here, I am sure, and quote a number of such cases where had this provision that the Bill would now insert in the law been in force we would undoubtedly have caught up with a number of people who deserved to be caught up with. I can assure the Minister, through you Mr Temporary Chairman, there would not be any dissent from that on this side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Opposition is saying is that that is not a costless process in terms of our civil liberties and in terms of privacy considerations within the community as a whole. While, of course, we are totally supportive of measures which set out to strengthen the hands of the law enforcement authorities in the ceaseless battle that they wage against criminals of one kind or another, we cannot be forgetful of or oblivious to the potential costs of doing so. We have said in these amendments that, in this case, the Government has gone too far. We are not seeking to deny the law enforcement authorities more capacity to attain access to information of this kind. But we have, so to speak, put the onus of action on the law enforcement authorities rather than on the Commissioner. We have interposed a judicial process approach supported by written application-by affidavit et cetera-to a Federal judge in order to buttress that changing of the onus of action. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say that so far at any rate nothing said by the Minister convinces me that the Opposition has been wrong in this regard. I say to the Minister that, while I appreciate the action he has taken in getting this letter from the Privacy Commissioner, I do not find that letter persuasive either, and the Opposition wishes to persist with its amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendments which we were discussing on a previous occasion and are now returning to in this particular Bill go not so much to whether anybody wishes to protect criminals but rather to the method by which information will be delivered to various agencies so that those criminals may be apprehended. It is a matter of probably careful judgment as to how far one would wish to go in this regard. It was the same last time we were discussing this matter. There is a trade-off between two principles; that of the privacy principle and the principle that people who break the law ought not to be able to do so with impunity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister raised a couple of points. The first point that was of concern to me last time relates to the functions of the Commissioner under section 27 (1) (b) of the Privacy Act. I am concerned that this particular proposed enactment was not referred to the Privacy Commissioner. I wonder whether the Minister would wish to respond as to whether the Government intends this particular portion of the privacy legislation to actually have some effect. Is there going to be-I would have thought there ought to have been since it was the Government's own legislation-a policy in place which of necessity means that any Minister who brings in any piece of legislation that has items such as this in it should before they do so seek from the Privacy Commissioner any comment that the Privacy Commissioner might wish to make under section 27 (1) (b). If it does not, why did the Government put it in its own legislation?</PARA>
<PARA> Hopefully it was not put in to simply quieten us all down at the time that this particular legislation was going through. Hopefully it was meant to be a genuine exercise whereby additional legislation would come under the scrutiny of the Privacy Commissioner. I do not know why this was not enacted in this legislation. It was the first major item of departure from the principle of strict privacy on taxation matters that we have had since the Privacy Bill was passed. That being the case, one would have thought that as a matter of course it would have gone off. It seemingly has not done so. That to me is of great concern. I am not talking of the Minister for Justice, who is in the chamber, because I know he has a very deep personal interest in this matter; I am talking here of the Government in general. It worries me because, in response to Senator Stone's amendments, my initial reaction was a positive one. But on later reflection my concern was that it may run across the work of the Privacy Commissioner in hopefully building up the importance of the Privacy Commission in the work that it has to do, which, as I think we are all very much aware, will become more difficult particularly as the growth of technology provides information flow at an ever increasing rate. </PARA>
<PARA> My confidence in not accepting Senator Stone's amendment has been very much dinted by the way that the Government has dealt with this matter. Unless the Minister is able to assure the Committee and, in particular, my Party that the Government has the confidence in the Privacy Commissioner that it presumably did when we passed the legislation and that it does intend as a matter of course to apply section 27 (1) (b) to future departures from the privacy principle, one would have to go back and have another very close look at the propositions that Senator Stone is putting. Senator Stone's propositions are based on an alternative method of dealing with these matters. If the Government is not going to pursue its own proposition we should know fairly quickly so that we may be able to produce something else that can actually provide the privacy that most Australian citizens are entitled to. </PARA>
<PARA> I find Commissioner O'Connor's response to the Human Rights Commission's letter which the Minister has given me a copy of is an acceptable proposition. I do not find acceptable the Government's actions with regard to what it has done so far. Unless it lifts its game I am not quite sure how we can rely on the Privacy Commissioner who will not even know about these things until they have been enacted. At that stage it is far too late. The Parliament having expressed its views, it is neither here nor there with regard to what the Privacy Commissioner will do; the Parliament has already told it what it will do. The Commissioner will have no role whatsoever, whoever the Commissioner happens to be. However, if the Government intends to fully utilise the Act that was passed by this Parliament with regard to the Privacy Commissioner we would rest on that, at this particular time, as a model which we would wish to pursue and build up. The Commission has within it, certainly in terms of the way the legislation was drafted although not in the way it has been applied, all the powers that would be necessary at this juncture to protect the privacy of Australians. However, if the Government intends to pursue the course it has to date I do not think the Privacy Commissioner has a leg to stand on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I respond to that quickly because I think it is important that the Committee know the situation. I agree that steps ought to have been almost automatically undertaken in order to ensure that the Privacy Commissioner was able to undertake an assessment of those particular clauses within this Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1989. I have asked that the relevant section within the Attorney-General's Department, when it has Bills submitted to it for coordination comments, carry out quick vetting of legislation to see whether it appears to raise privacy questions; and, if so, to set in motion the necessary machinery so that a Minister can require of the Privacy Commission the assessment that section 27 of the Privacy Act looks to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I assure the Committee that I will be keen to get that machinery working in a way which does not allow legislation, which in its title does not appear to bear on privacy, slip through the net; nor will it allow Ministers perhaps to allow their privacy-affecting legislation pass through without comment. It may also be useful to ask the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills of this chamber to particularly take on, if not as a formal term of reference, the suggestion that certainly the Secretary should keep a vigilant eye open for such matters. Perhaps at an earlier stage than in the midst of the committee stage debate here we can pick up any matters which have slipped through, which after all is the role of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in the hope of denting the Australian Democrats' confidence in the replies of the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) a little further. After all, we the people invented government to protect our privacy, not to invade it. Recent events in China represent one end of the spectrum of the invasion of people's privacy. Curiously, the other end of the spectrum is exemplified by an old Chinese proverb that says that a secret is no longer a secret once two people know about it. Somewhere between the two we can get a criminal like Al Capone who could be arraigned only on a charge of tax evasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I read a letter in the newspaper about the hashish dealer who was facing a charge of tax evasion. During the trial he admitted to the Commissioner of Taxation that he was a hashish dealer. The fearless, intrepid enforcers of our Federal law noticed the article about the matter in the newspaper and went and caught their man. As I see it, all ends were served in that case. The chap got caught, and he paid his tax. It vindicates the system. Maybe if he had known that the Taxation Commissioner was going to divulge the source of his funds he would not have put in the tax return at all. That is one of the reasons privacy was insisted upon in tax matters. If people who run a business-a brothel, for example-knew that that information would be divulged, they would not put in a tax return. The matter of privacy, I am sure, takes a much higher position than catching a few criminals, with the invasion of everybody's privacy. </PARA>
<PARA> The thrust of our amendments is to make sure that the Taxation Commissioner does not, of his own volition, suddenly divulge things. We are trying to reach a position where the Tax Commissioner can be requested to supply information. That request should be distilled through an authority such as a judge who is competent to assess the request and see whether such an invasion of privacy is justifiable. I read carefully the letter from the Privacy Commissioner, Mr O'Connor. He shows in that letter that he understands the principle of privacy, yet he turns around and decides to bust it wide open. I think he has a poor attitude to the maintenance of privacy. It makes me lose confidence in the administration of the Privacy Commissioner. I lend my voice to the case against the Minister's answers to these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA> As I understood Senator Macklin's remarks, his argument was-and I hope I am not misrepresenting him; I am sure he will tell me if I am-that our amendments tend to cut across the work of the Privacy Commissioner and diminish the importance of his work. I hope that is a fairly accurate paraphrase of what Senator Macklin said. With the greatest of respect, that is simply untrue. These amendments do not cut across the work of the Privacy Commissioner; they simply define the framework within which the Privacy Commissioner works somewhat differently from the framework which will be defined for him by the Government under the terms of the Bill. They do not cut across his work in any way at all. As to the suggestion that they would diminish the importance of his work--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was saying before I was interrupted by sessional orders that the suggestion that our amendments would diminish the importance of the work of the Privacy Commissioner is quite erroneous. In no way do the amendments diminish the importance of his work. What we are seeking to do is to establish a particular framework under which information of a taxation confidential kind should be passed to the law enforcement authorities by the Commissioner of Taxation or his officers. We are seeking to establish that framework on a somewhat different basis-a basis of considerable difference in principle-from that which is proposed by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suggest that what we have got in this Bill is an example of what might be called the salami tactics of the present Government in the whole area of privacy and confidentiality of taxation information. We have had considerable invasions of section 16 of the Act already for reasons which the Parliament has considered to be good. We are now getting another invasion which, as the Minister has been forced to confess-somewhat shamefacedly; I do not blame him for this-was not referred by the Government at the drafting stage to the Privacy Commissioner for comment. This is one of the things that Senator Macklin has quite rightly been objecting to. Yet we have another piece of whittling away at the privacy of people who come into contact with-and who does not?-the Commissioner of Taxation about taxation matters. We believe that the Government's legislation goes too far. None of the arguments, or pseudo arguments, that have been put on that subject by the Australian Democrats today, in their attempt to find reasons to support the Government's Bill, persuades me to the contrary. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate endorse the findings contained in paragraph 66 of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>This report of the Committee is made in response to a resolution of the Senate on the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Chaney, on 3 November 1988, referring certain resolutions passed by the Aboriginal Development Commission in May and October 1988 and the transfer of Mr M. O'Brien from the position of General Manager of the Commission to the Committee to establish whether those actions constituted a contempt of the Senate in that they involved an improper interference with witnesses. As the report and the extensive documentation accompanying the report indicate, the matters before the Committee were extraordinarily complex, requiring considerable and detailed examination of the material that the Committee had available to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's findings, which are summarised at paragraph 66 of the report, are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 66. In relation to term of reference (1) (a) (resolution of 23 May 1988), the Committee has found that the resolution was not passed by the Aboriginal Development Commission with the intention of interfering with witnesses proposing to give evidence to a Senate committee. Therefore, no contempt of the Senate has been committed. (paragraph 39)</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to term of reference (1) (b) (presentation of papers and submissions), the Committee has found that, on the basis that members of the Aboriginal Development Commission were not sufficiently aware of the implications and ramifications of the resolution, no contempt of the Senate has been committed and that the explanation and apology, contained in a further resolution of the Commission tabled by the President of the Senate on 20 October 1988, should be accepted. (paragraph 41)</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to term of reference (1) (c) (resolution of no confidence in Mrs S. McPherson), the Committee has concluded that, in the particular circumstances of the case, a finding that a contempt of the Senate has been committed should not be made. (paragraph 57)</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to paragraph (1) (d) (proposed transfer of Mr M. O'Brien), the Committee has found that no contempt of the Senate has been committed, in that any penalty or injury caused to Mr O'Brien was not inflicted in consequence of his giving evidence to the Select Committee. (paragraph 65)</PARA>
<PARA>The reasons for the Committee's conclusion in relation to the terms of reference may be found in paragraphs 33 to 65 of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators may recall that the Committee of Privileges has reported on six other references since we received the matter on which we have reported today. This extra workload on the officers of the Senate and on the Committee has not in any respect retarded the completion of this particular reference, which has been dealt with at each of the approximately 20 meetings held over the last eight months. All Committee members have been acutely conscious of the fact that we had a duty to all concerned with this reference to deal with the matters as expeditiously as possible. We are tabling the report immediately upon its completion. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to pay a sincere tribute to the Deputy Clerk of the Senate, Anne Lynch, and to her staff. As Secretary to the Committee, her meticulous and tireless efforts have made it possible for us to deal thoroughly with the mass of material which we have tabled, every piece of which had serious significance. This was a formidable challenge to which Anne and her assistants, Christine McDonald and later David Creed, rose magnificently. The Committee is also very grateful to the Clerk, Mr Harry Evans, for his prompt and scholarly response to requests for advice and to Mr Theo Simos, QC, whose counsel was of great assistance to our deliberations. I commend the report to the Senate and seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the motion before the Senate I would like to draw attention to the fact that this report, Possible interference with witnesses in consequence of their giving evidence before the Senate Select Committee on Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, must be put in the context of what occurred in October 1988. At the time at which the reference subsequently was made-I think it was 3 November; some eight months ago-to the Committee of Privileges, honourable senators will recall, the scrutiny of the portfolio of Aboriginal affairs had reached a stage of heightened consideration and very great public awareness of a number of things that were wrong with the administration of the Department. Naturally, I have not had the opportunity to read this report which Senator Giles just handed down. Given its comprehensive nature, the fact that it is some 32 pages long in the primary section and the fact that there is a summary of the findings, which Senator Giles has just alluded to, I want to spend some time in making a very detailed appraisal of all of the issues that obviously have been addressed in the eight months this Committee has been in operation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate will recall that back in October 1988 Senate Estimates Committee E gave major consideration to various Budget proposals by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) in which things were very much out of kilter. At the same time the Senate Select Committee on Administration of Aboriginal Affairs was reviewing the administration of the portfolio and, in particular, the proposals by the Government for the establishment of a new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. Various documents were presented to the Senate at that time, which resulted in the very serious consideration that the Committee of Privileges obviously has had to make. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Giles points out, the fact that it has taken a considerable amount of work over a very extended period obviously highlights the very great degree of problem that the Privileges Committee had to face in looking at this issue. We should be well aware that, as a result of the various parliamentary considerations in October 1988, the references to the Privileges Committee were not the only resultant inquiries into the portfolio of Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that at about that same time, or as a result of the various actions of Senate Estimates Committee E, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) instituted a number of very special reports-those of Mr Andrew Menzies, the Auditor-General, the Public Service Commissioner and the Department of Finance. With the exception of Mr Menzies' report, all of the reports-those of the Auditor-General, the Public Service Commissioner and the Department of Finance-have been presented and have been given quite weighty consideration. I am surprised and concerned that the final report of Mr Menzies is not yet available for consideration by the Parliament. It will now, obviously, not be available until some time in either August or September when we are back here in the Budget session. A number of corrective measures obviously have been taken in this portfolio in the past few months. I am pleased to see-and I welcome it-that those particular considerations have taken place. </PARA>
<PARA> We should be reminded that there has been a very sorry saga of dismissal, intrigue and subterfuge, particularly with regard to the Chairman of the ADC, Mrs McPherson, and the General Manager of the ADC, Mr Michael O'Brien, both of whom were named in the terms of reference for this particular inquiry. It is not without importance that both Mrs McPherson and Mr O'Brien have since left the employ of the Aboriginal Development Commission. The subsequent series of events which led to their demise only show that there have been some very peculiar and unusual activities along the way. The recent annual report of the Aboriginal Development Commission had to be referred to another committee of the Senate which gives consideration to finance and public administration, because of what we believed was the very bastardisation of information. The reputations of Mrs McPherson, Mr O'Brien and, indeed, Mr Charles Perkins were hauled across the coals again in that annual report, either directly or by omission. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish in any way to be seen to be seeking to drag this issue out at the expense of Aboriginal people in Australia. What concerns me is that the delivery of services in this important portfolio should at all times be measured by the criteria of efficiency and accountability. That must be the basis on which we give parliamentary consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Since December 1987, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, has been attempting to get the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill through the Parliament. Nearly two years of consider- ation have gone into this matter. If one considers what can be described only as a civil war that has been created by the Minister within the Aboriginal constituency and within the broader aspects of the community, it is the Minister, Mr Hand, who must accept responsibility for the dreadful administration that has taken place under his portfolio, for the lack of attention to detail and for the fact that so many important senior staff of both the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal Development Commission have either resigned or taken early retirement, leaving a very difficult problem for those new administrators who have had to pick up the administration. </PARA>
<PARA> We referred this matter to the Committee of Privileges on 3 November 1988. As I said in my opening remarks, the fact that it has taken eight months of comprehensive and detailed consideration is a challenge now to all honourable senators to give a thorough consideration to this report. I am sure that much more will meet the eye of the reader-whether it be someone in the media, someone in the Parliament or someone else who is concerned with the administration of this portfolio-than is outlined in the summary of findings, or the conclusions, which Senator Giles read and which is only one brief part of the report that has been presented today. </PARA>
<PARA> This portfolio has had a sorry history over the past couple of years. As I have said, it has largely been contributed to by the blinkered, single-minded vision of the current Minister for Aboriginal Affairs who does not have the compassion or the depth of experience to understand the appropriate and proper slot for Aboriginal people within both the parliamentary system and the Australian community. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> I present the 297th report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts-`Management of the Antarctic Division'. </PARA>
<PARA> This inquiry began in April 1988 as an administrative review into allegations of ship tender and payment irregularities but has led to much more profound and far reaching issues especially the role of science in the Division's programs and the development of a conservation strategy for Antarctica. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's terms of reference were to inquire into the management of the Antarctic Division especially in relation to the tender procedures for ship charter services. </PARA>
<PARA> A range of allegations appeared in the press in early 1988 that a bonus payment to a ship owner was incorrectly paid, that there were irregularities in overtime payments to the same ship owner and that certain bills lodged by the same ship owner were unjustified. Another allegation was reported claiming irregularities in the tender process for the construction of Australia's new Antarctic vessel, the Aurora Australis. </PARA>
<PARA> That was not all. Further allegations surfaced once submissions were called for. These included concerns:</PARA>
<PARA> about the performance of the Division's shipping broker;</PARA>
<PARA> that Commonwealth procedures had not been followed in arranging a fruit and vegetable contract;</PARA>
<PARA> that the Lady Franklin, a vessel chartered by the division for the past expedition season was unsafe and that there were irregularities in the tender process; and</PARA>
<PARA> about staff management relations. </PARA>
<PARA> As if that was not enough the Committee was also embroiled in the resolution of a conflict over the status of the charter party of the Division's major carrier the Icebird and the circumstances surrounding the retirement of the former Director of the Division in December 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the above matters were investigated by the Australian Audit Office, the Australian Federal Police and a special committee set up by the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, the Division's parent Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee findings on these issues were consistent with the findings of the other agencies in that the Division has had a history of lack of care in some administrative matters. This kind of sloppiness generated concerns that business dealings were not conducted at arms length and that certain companies were being favoured. A concern also developed that not all available information was considered in coming to decisions on these concerns which in turn led to a lack of trust in the Division. At the same time this lack of trust was generated by Division staff leaking information to the press and running their allegations in public. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee found insufficient evidence to substantiate the allegations concerning the bonus payment, overtime, fruit and vegetable contract, tender process for the new vessel and the safety of the Lady Franklin, although there have been continuing assertions about the Lady Franklin which the Committee have sent to the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of the Icebird contract was resolved within the Icebird related companies and the potential that existed for the Icebird to be removed from service was not realised. However this issue highlighted the negligence of both the brokers and the Division in not checking the contract carefully and not monitoring all developments in the Icebird companies. </PARA>
<PARA> A close relationship has existed between the Division and their brokers since the early 1950s and the Committee is concerned that a formal relationship apply and that performance review mechanisms be exercised periodically in the event of a broker being used constantly by a government agency. </PARA>
<PARA> I now move on to issues where the Committee can be more positive. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee conducted an inspection of the Kingston headquarters of the Antarctic Division in July 1988. From that exposure in addition to the content of submissions and the experience of one of our members Mr Nehl in the Antarctic itself the Committee has been impressed by the commitment and enthusiasm by Division staff to the Antarctic and Australia's Antarctic program. However, in conjunction with that has come an awareness of the alarming state of resources within the Division. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee asked for a submission from the Division and was confronted by facts that would lead to a reduction in the Division's programs. There was no safety officer; stores and equipment were running down to critical levels; the number of expeditioners had increased significantly in recent years leading to a range of administrative strains. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is convinced that the Division must be provided with further resources for it to maintain a safe, efficient and productive program. The assessment of the Division to do this at a very basic level is an increase of 1.2 million and 20 staff. The Committee have recommended that the Department of Finance give urgent consideration to an increase in funds using this assessment as a guideline. </PARA>
<PARA> The second positive area focused on by the Committee was scientific activity. The Committee was cognisant of the important role played by the Antarctic Science Advisory Committee (ASAC). In examining ASAC's role in relation to the Committee's terms of reference the Committee was keen to encourage a broader representation on ASAC and to provide a qualified involvement with Antarctic management in so far as it impacted on the implementation of science programs.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally the Committee's inquiry has been overtaken in the last few weeks by the statement of the Government that it will not be signing the Antarctic minerals convention but rather will be seeking to implement a conservation strategy. The Committee believe this course of action will undoubtedly place further policy and administrative strain on the Division but believes this course of action will be significant in preserving the last vestige of pristine environment in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The powerful Joint Committee of Public Accounts has recommended that the Federal Government commit more funds and additional staff to the Antarctic Division at Kingston in Tasmania. I believe that if additional resources are not forthcoming not only will the environmental protection of Antarctica, particularly in our region, be at risk but also international recognition of our scientific program will be severely diminished. As honourable senators will know, Australia has had a very special relationship with Antarctica since the last century. We have had a permanent presence there for more than 60 years. Tasmania, my own State, has a special interest not only because of the location of the Antarctic Division at Kingston but also because our State maintains a high profile in Antarctic matters on the international stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Antarctic Division has a great role in nurturing and maintaining its wide range of responsibilities not only to Australia but also to the whole international community. The Committee strongly believes that the Division must not merely be a cog in the apparatus of the Public Service but should take on an educational role and establish a stronger liaison with Parliament and the whole community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee feels that Antarctica and the work of the Division should have a higher public profile under the auspices of the Minister. As is illustrated by the current debate over the Antarctic minerals convention, there is a need for the international community to have its consciousness raised about the Antarctic-how it must be preserved and its scientific profile enhanced. Because of the unique nature of the Antarctic, the Committee felt that there was an obvious need to operate the Division with some flexibility. This is an area where the risk management adopted by the previous director, Mr Jim Bleasel, and accepted by the previous department, is an appropriate mechanism of management practice. The present Department over-reacted when it insisted strictly on following Public Service processes to the letter of the law after having assumed responsibility for the Division after the abolition of the Department of Science. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee feels that the Division should be allowed to run itself, to be more autonomous. The Committee feels that the manager of the Division should be allowed to manage and that there should not be an undue restriction on delegation of authority and excessive reporting requirements which could jeopardise the efficient management of the Division, taking into account its special needs. The Division must clearly be run in a flexible manner attuned to the unique tasks it has to carry out. Yet it should not lose sight of its accountability for the efficient expenditure of public funds. I commend the report to the Senate and seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to make some remarks on the latest inquiry of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody into the death of Thomas William Murray. He died on 31 December 1983 in Bowral Hospital as a result of an excessive dose of doxepin which was self-administered earlier that day in the Berrima training centre where he was a prisoner. Whether he intended to take his own life it is impossible to say, but at least he valued it so little that he was prepared to place it at risk for no good reason. Like so many other cases that we have had presented to us in this place, he was a person with a complex of psychological problems with which his family, society at large, the prison system and, ultimately, he himself were unable to cope. One of these problems, as is stated in the report, was his inability to come to terms with being a person of Aboriginal descent in a predominantly white Australian society. He was of Aboriginal descent through one grandparent. Sometimes he identified with the Aboriginal community and at other times he did not. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's report certainly goes into some detail on his own life and the circumstances of his death. I draw the Senate's attention particularly to the latter segment of the report entitled `Underlying Issues'. It commences:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission is concerned to inquire not only as to how each individual death in custody occurred but also why that death occurred and why so many Aboriginals die in custody. This immediately leads, as an important part of the inquiry, to the question why such a large and grossly disproportionate number of Aboriginal people are in custody. </PARA>
<PARA>We are told in this section about the provision for juvenile and young offenders. Reference is also made to alternatives to custody. Many of these young Aboriginal people who find themselves in prison have come from broken families with histories of parental alcohol abuse, violence and sexual promiscuousness. Such young offenders have usually already spent time in boys homes and have abused alcohol and other drugs. So to place them in a juvenile prison system simply accentuates the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another segment on the prison medical service which comes in for severe criticism. The coronial system is criticised. I draw the Senate's attention to the following passage in the report:</PARA>
<PARA>The hearing was held on 4 June 1984. </PARA>
<PARA>This was the coronial inquiry. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Detective Sergeant Becke appeared to assist the Coroner . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Detective Sergeant Becke had been the investigating officer and the coroner gave evidence that in the absence of a police prosecutor it was the common practice for the investigating police officer to assist the coroner. It meant that Detective Sergeant Becke was in effect investigator, witness and counsel assisting. </PARA>
<PARA>The basic problem with our coronial system is that it is tied up with the police system and completely out of kilter with one of the prerogatives of the Westminster system, which is that the executive arm of government, the judicial system and the police system should be completely separate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for this reason that I have joined with the parents of Stephen Wardle in Western Australia in calling for a royal commission into Stephen Wardle's death. It is only in this way that the public can learn what happened that night in the East Perth lock-up. The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody is extremely critical of the coronial system as it stands in Australia. I believe there are some moves to improve that system in New South Wales. Hopefully, this will spread to other States. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, I raise the matter of Senator Morris, which I have raised on previous occasions. I do not know whether the message that I have sent to Senator Morris advising him that I would be raising this matter has reached him because this letter that I have received and want to raise here came into my possession only very recently. It is a letter from a Mr Pat Reeves, who is opposing Senator Morris for the position of President of the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees Union. I raise it simply because it denies allegations made by Senator Morris in this chamber about Mr Reeves and denies allegations made about me when Senator Morris said that my reason for attacking him, in his view, was because I was party to a conspiracy to take over the liquor trades union, which, of course, is arrant nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Morris also claimed that, because I was opposed to penalty rates in his industry, therefore, for some curious reason, Mr Reeves was also opposed to penalty rates in his union. I have not had an opportunity to raise this with the Minister, but I would like to table a document which clearly shows that, under the presidency of Senator Morris, penalty rates, at least in one particular respect of an agreement between the Liquor Trades Union and Pizza Hut, have been reduced substantially. I seek leave to table a document which is an agreement between the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees Union of Australia, New South Wales Branch, and Pepsico Australia Pty Ltd, which has been supplied to me. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The document shows that in 1984 the union and Pizza Hut had an agreement providing for 25 per cent loading for part-time workers, a three-hour minimum engagement and a normal finish at midnight. But in 1988, under the presidency of Senator Morris, an agreement between the union and the same pizza industry, doing the same work for the same employer, provided a 15 per cent loading rather than 25 per cent, a two-hour minimum engagement instead of a three-hour one and a normal finish at 1 a.m. instead of midnight. I am not complaining about that. I think it is very sensible that those changes should take place. All I want to stress is that it does raise serious questions about Senator Morris's claim that I am somehow involved with Mr Reeves in trying to get rid of penalty rates.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I am wholeheartedly opposed to any reduction in penalty rate provisions and conditions in any awards and to this extent am totally opposed to Senator Morris position of reduction of penalty rates in certain areas of the Liquor Industry. </PARA>
<PARA>The other specific denial is to deny Senator Morris's suggestion that the only reason why Senator Morris would not have been enthusiastic about revealing the details of the settlement on the legal matter to which I referred last week is an undertaking given in court that they not be revealed.

<PARA> That, if so required, I would authorise the terms of settlement entered into between Senator Morris and myself in the Supreme Court of New South Wales to become public. It is my intention to approach the Supreme Court for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>For Senator Morris it is really a matter of money up or shut up.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address my first remarks on the adjournment debate to the child migrant scheme. This is a scheme about which very little was known until comparatively recently. Between 1938 and 1967, the Australian and British governments arranged to resettle orphaned and abandoned children from the United Kingdom (UK) and Ireland into Australia under the Empire Resettlement Acts of 1922 and 1937. About 119 child migrant boys came to Western Australia in 1938. They went to the Christian Brothers Institution at Tardun. There were much earlier intakes into Fairbridge Boys Farm which was run under an Anglican scheme. In 1944, Mr Chifley, then Treasurer in the Curtin Labor Government, proposed a scheme to bring 50,000 war orphans to Australia. When he became Prime Minister, he appointed Mr Calwell immigration Minister and a much grander immigration policy was implemented at that time. The post-war child migrant scheme was a segment of this particular policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Catholic child migrants were transported to Western Australia under the Catholic episcopal migrant scheme of Western Australia Inc. The first child migrants arrived in Fremantle on the SS Asturias on 22 September 1947. After the formalities and fingerprinting, they were interned in various institutions. This scheme has been labelled `the last of the transportations' because in many ways these children were, unfortunately, treated like prisoners. They went to various institutions in Western Australia, various Catholic institutions such as Castledare, Clontarf, Bindoon, and Tardun which were run by the Christian Brothers. The girls went to St Josephs Orphanage, Wembley, and Nazareth House, Geraldton. The Anglican children went to the Fairbridge Farm. It would seem that New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia were the only States originally to participate in the child migrant scheme, although there are reports that girls from Nazareth House in Geraldton were later transported to a similar institution in Melbourne. It is possible that the other States could have been involved directly. </PARA>
<PARA> On arrival, the Catholic child migrants, at least, came under the complete care and control of the various institutions although control should have been vested in a department or office under the Western Australian Under-Secretary of Lands and Surveys. In about 1952, when some of the child migrants were approaching working age and about to leave the institutions, control was transferred to the Child Welfare Department which approached the institutions for details and particulars of the child migrants in their charge with varying degrees of success. Files were commenced on child migrants by the Department only in 1952-seven years after the first arrivals. In that year the British Government banned the further transportation of child migrants under this scheme, although other groups came to Australia under different schemes until 1968. I would like to draw the Senate's attention to the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Regulations. These are the Statutory Rules 1946. Rule No. 7 says:</PARA>
<PARA> An authority in respect of any State shall, in relation to immigrant children in that State, keep a Register of Custodians in which he shall enter-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the name, address, occupation and religion of every custodian;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the name of every child in the custody of each custodian;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the age, sex and religion of each such child;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the names, addresses and occupations of the parents or guardians of the child in the United Kingdom;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the date of arrival of the child in Australia, and the name of the ship in which the child arrived; and</PARA>
<PARA> (f) such other particulars as the Minister determines. </PARA>
<PARA>Now a lot of these past child migrants are adults. They are searching for their records-and, indeed, for their very identity in many cases-and the sad and sorry story is that they are simply not available. There are some very sad cases indeed, some of which have been publicised. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently in the United Kingdom a television program entitled Lost Children of the Empire was screened. This program was described by television critic Bernard Workman in the Universe on 14 May 1989 in this way:</PARA>
<PARA>The stories of these children, some old now, haunted me long after the midnight hour. </PARA>
<PARA> They were the stuff of nightmares, except who would dream that we would treat our own kith and kin so?</PARA>
<PARA> Why, right up to the mid-1960s, were we dumping these unwanted, largely unloved little ones-many under the age of 10-on uncaring societies half a world away?</PARA>
<PARA> They came from orphanages, from institutions and they were pushed out of Britain. They went with Government blessing sent by, among others, such sturdy institutions as Barnardo's, the Fairbridge Society, the Catholic Church, in the pious belief they were giving them a better start to life. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead, they were treated as slaves in Canada and Australia where they were made to work for a pittance, enduring beatings, privation and sexual abuse. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Many of these lost souls are sill searching for their roots, like the man, white haired now, weeping over his mother's grave. `I wish I'd found you while you were living . . . You could have told me who I am; that is important to me, to know who I am'. </PARA>
<PARA>On the same page of that paper there is a story about 56-year-old Gordon Grant who describes himself as being dumped at the age of one, with his six-year-old sister, in an orphanage in South Wales. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>At the age of 12, in 1946, he was told that 30 boys would be selected to go to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Our 12,000-mile sea voyage was very pleasant, good food and recreation activities we enjoyed, and the people were wonderful. But our illusions were shattered when we reached the port of Fremantle, Western Australia-within the hour following disembarkation we were all herded like cattle into a large disused woolstore where we were fingerprinted by six plain clothed policemen. The youngest children were a mere four years old. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I arrived at my new home, Boys Town, Bindoon, on 22 September 1947. </PARA>
<PARA>In the article he relates how his first couple of years were not too bad because he worked on a farm there. However, in February 1948 a new superior took over, Brother Paul Francis Keaney, the initiator of the development of a huge project for the settlement of underprivileged boys coming from the UK. Gordon Grant describes how under Father Keaney they were given the impossible task of building the whole of Bindoon Boys farm and school. Although in their early teens, they had to work very hard without proper safety regulations. This resulted in frequent cases of boys being maimed on the construction sites. John McGillion, as a 12-year-old lad, received serious spinal injuries and injuries to his legs. John Murphy had spinal injuries; Charles Penglaze had a broken leg; and Michael Sele had serious head injuries. All are now invalid pensioners. He goes into some detail of the sexual assault that those boys also suffered at that institution. </PARA>
<PARA> Another child migrant known as Geordie-his proper name is Lionel Welsh-has written a book, which I commend to honourable senators as it makes very interesting reading. Geordie was 11 years of age when he made the six-week boat trip from England to Australia in 1947. He too believed he was going to a land of milk and honey where children rode horses to school, but a rude shock awaited him also when he arrived at the desolate Boys Town at Bindoon. He ran away four years later and could never come to terms with the fact that he did not know exactly who he was, until now, because through a newly formed society, known as the Child Migrant Friendship Society of Western Australia (Inc.), he was able to trace his father. He did not actually manage to meet his father because he died before he could trace him, but through that tracing of his family he has been able to meet up with a half-brother. Geordie describes very well and graphically indeed the trauma that people go through when they have no identity that they can fall back on. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Women's Day magazine last year stories were told of other child migrants. Details were given of the suffering that they were put through in their adult life and how many child migrants have tried to hide the fact that they came to Australia as child migrants and therefore did not have an identity. Other stories have been related to me through this new society. I inform the Senate that all of these stories are tales of suffering. The new Child Migrant Friendship Society is seeking to find the records as far as is possible. The Secretary of the Society has written a letter to the Minister for Community Services in Western Australia, and the Minister replied:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . there is no record of a formal register of child migrants. There is, however, a system of Index Cards . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Secretary of the Child Migrant Friendship Society also wrote to the Federal Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray), and he replied:</PARA>
<PARA> Any individual wanting such documents may apply to the FOI section of the Department, but must do so on an individual basis, . . . </PARA>
<PARA> To form an agency to deal with child migrants as you suggest would unfortunately be impractical as the documents are scattered across many agencies, both private and public and due to the passing of time many may be in archives. </PARA>
<PARA>This is one of the problems that the child migrants have. What documentation there is, is scattered between various departments and is very difficult to find. The Child Migrant Friendship Society, which is now incorporated, has been set up as a self-help group. It has five main aims, and these are: firstly, to seek official recognition; secondly, to liaise with the Child Migrant Trust of England to locate lost family members of the child migrants; and to this end, thirdly, to set up a child migrant contact register; fourthly, to seek out and help those in need; and, fifthly, to conduct group therapy sessions. The estimation is that of the 50,000 or so child migrants in Australia, there are some 12,000 in Western Australia. The questions the society is asking and which have not yet been answered are: who exactly authorised the transportations; and why was such cruelty in the institutions condoned? It has two aims. The first is to put an end to the miserable existence which so many child migrants now have. Many of them have a history of being in and out of gaol because, having been brought up in institutions, they have found it very hard to adapt to life outside institutions. Many of them are homeless and live either on the streets or very roughly in hostels that are available. Many of them still have no identity, which leads to psychological problems. The aim is to be able to provide a comfortable hostel or home where they can all get together again-because they regard themselves as a family. </PARA>
<PARA> Their other aim is to be granted Australian citizenship. Honourable senators, believe it or not in this Year of the Citizen, these people came in as children without birth certificates and therefore without proper identification-and very often with their release from the United Kingdom signed `Mother Superior' and not by name. So no tracing was possible in that way. Many of these people have no identity and therefore, having been in Australia since childhood, seek Australian citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA> I know of one particular man who came over as a child migrant. He fought for this country in the Vietnam War. He was found guilty of some very minor offences, which actually concerned a matter of principle. I think my fellow Western Australians will know who I am talking about. This man was a street trader who fought against the Perth City Council's regulations when the council sought to ban street trading. When he applied for Australian citizenship he was told that Australian citizenship could not be granted to him for that reason. </PARA>
<PARA> Other people feel that they should be granted Australian citizenship as a right because they are Australians, having been brought to Australia as children. They seek a register, which perhaps can be put together at this stage if only all the records which are spread about everywhere can be put together. This is one of the reasons why I have chosen to talk about this group at this stage. It is really important that any organisation or persons who had contact with these children of the time and who have access to records should bring those forward. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to raise a longstanding problem which Senator Haines has raised on previous occasions in this place. Regrettably, the problem has not been resolved since Senator Haines last pressed the Government to do so, in November of last year. The Government's failure to act becomes more and more worthy of condemnation with the now inordinate passage of time. The case was a particularly unsavoury one of the sexual harassment of a female officer in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Having joined the RAAF in 1980, the woman in question suffered a considerable amount of sexual harassment in 1982. Senator Haines has recounted the details of this story before. Having reported a particular incident of attempted rape, the woman was subjected to further harassment, both sexual and otherwise. She was finally forced out of the Air Force and into private life. </PARA>
<PARA> I digress at this stage to point out that the two officers concerned in this unpleasant affair, and some other people who had been involved in the harassment, were eventually dismissed or otherwise disciplined for their actions. This clearly demonstrates that the Air Force acknowledged that the woman had been subjected to the treatment she claimed, including a smear campaign about her sexual preferences. There is no question about this. She was shown to have been correct and the people concerned were disciplined. Even worse, as has been explained to the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) before, the harassment continued after she left the RAAF and after she moved from one State to another. She was put under intolerable emotional and physical stress. Her marriage broke down and she lost a work contract as a result of the smear campaign to which I referred earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, this woman has suffered appalling. Sexual assault, improper investigation of her private life, gross infringements of her civil liberties, smearing of her character, loss of employment and promotion opportunities, and stress and mental anguish are just some of the experiences about which she is quite justified in complaining. As so often happens in the area of sexual harassment, she has been made the scapegoat for the misconduct and guilt of others. Obviously, this sort of thing cannot be tolerated. In this instance the Government is in a position to do something about it. Both the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Defence Force Ombudsman have made strong recommendations for an ex gratia payment to the woman. The woman herself has contacted the Government. Senator Haines has made repeated representations on her behalf and I do so again on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Finance turned down an ex-gratia payment in the past because he alleged that the harassment took place before the Sex Discrimination Act came into force. This rationale is absurd. As the Minister is well aware, harassment of this woman continued after she left the Air Force and, significantly, after the Sex Discrimination Act was passed in December 1983. Just to cite one example, in June 1985 she lost a work contract when the contractor made inquiries about her previous employment and was informed by the relevant RAAF personnel section that she was a homosexual. As a result, she lost considerable weekly income. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite apart from the injustice of the situation, the continued harassment should make the Minister think again. His own argument concerning the Sex Discrimination Act is shot to pieces. The evidence is before the Government, as are the recommendations for payment to which I referred earlier. If ever there were a genuine case for an ex-gratia payment, I think it would be this one. The Government's failure to have made an ex-gratia payment is bad enough, but the amount of time it has delayed the matter is intolerable. I urge the Government in the strongest possible terms to set the matter right at last; to make an ex-gratia payment to the woman; and at least to redress partly the appalling treatment she has suffered over a long period. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again Senator Michael Baume has jumped to the defence of Mr Pat Reeves. Senator Baume alleges that he has never met Pat Reeves. Yet, Mr Reeves has no more loyal and slavish a supporter than Senator Baume. It is incredible that Senator Baume has again supported Pat Reeves this afternoon. I do not know whether Senator Baume uses mental telepathy, but what we saw today was quite amazing for a person who has never met Pat Reeves. Someone must have put across points of view for Senator Baume to raise this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Baume alleges that Mr Reeves wants to go the Supreme Court to release a document. I assure the Senate that, if Mr Reeves has reached the point where he wants to release that document, I will go with him on Monday morning to ensure that it is released. That document has been kept in the confines of the Supreme Court at the request of Mr Pat Reeves's lawyers. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me move to another point raised by Senator Baume. This afternoon the honourable senator alleged in the Senate, through Pat Reeves, that some sort of deal was done to abolish penalty rates in respect of Pizza Hut employees. Senator Baume agreed with that. We all know that he does not support penalty rates. Not only do I and the Senate know that but also all the workers in the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees Union of Australia know it. Dual photos of Senator Baume and Pat Reeves are being circulated amongst the 50,000 members of that union in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us examine the Pizza Hut agreement. In 1987 Pepsico Australia Pty Ltd had workers in its new home delivery establishments who were award free-they had no penalty rates or anything. What did the union do? The union leadership-I, Ken Jeffrey, the Secretary, and Peter James, the Research Director-negotiated with Pepsico and we were able to get an agreement to cover those workers and ensure that they had an award. What were we able to negotiate for those workers? We negotiated an agreement. The management of Pepsico said that it would not have an agreement with the liquor trades union, with penalty rates; that it wanted the workers to remain award free. As a result of the liquor industries union saying that it would call a meeting of all Pizza Hut workers throughout New South Wales, the owners of Pepsico made an agreement with the union. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make clear what that agreement was. Those workers had no Saturday and Sunday penalty rates. I am pleased to say that, following the agreement that was signed by the union, those members now enjoy the same penalty rates as all other workers throughout Australia. That includes time and a half for Saturday, time and three-quarters for Sundays, double time and half for public holidays, a guarantee of a minimum of 10 hours work per week and the elimination of junior employment. Prior to this agreement we had a situation where that company could employ all juniors, which is what is done at Kentucky Fried Chicken Pty Ltd and at other establishments. We were able to get a ratio of full time employees to casual employees. At the same time we were able to get an agreement in regard to the ratio of juniors to seniors. </PARA>
<PARA> It amazes me that Senator Baume time and time again jumps to his feet in defence of Pat Reeves. Pat Reeves has no more slavish worker for him than Senator Baume. Yet he has the audacity to stand up in this Senate and tell senators and the people of this country, in an attempt to influence a union election, that he has nothing to do with Pat Reeves. If Senator Baume has nothing to do with Pat Reeves, I suggest that he must have great mental telepathy. On that note, I would like to table the document which I have referred to so that honourable senators and those journalists who are standing behind Senator Baume waiting for these documents can see it. I seek leave to table the document. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to express again my concern about the level of unemployment in the State of Tasmania. On this occasion I wish to point out that a statutory authority, Australia Post, is now contributing to that level of unemployment. It is doing so because it is embarking on a plan to further reduce jobs in the State of Tasmania by transferring to Victoria job functions which have always been performed in my State of Tasmania. It appears to have embarked on this process simply on the basis of two criteria, namely, efficiency and cost effectiveness. It is my view that it should not do that. It has a community responsibility to the people of Tasmania. It is, after all, in a privileged position-a monopoly position, in fact-in respect of many of its services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer particularly to a memo dated 31 May 1989, addressed to State head office staff, which talks about the concept of shared finance and accounting services with Victoria. According to this memo, that means that the general ledger, accounts payable and payroll functions will operate on computers in Victoria, data entry and report printing will be undertaken in Tasmania, expenditure cheques will be prepared in and mailed from Victoria; and payslips and paysheets will be printed in Tasmania. The Postmaster's financial statement systems will be run in Victoria and Victoria will distribute postal stock and stationery directly to post offices in Tasmania. That has been done since the year dot in Tasmania. I will not delay the Senate now, but there are other corollaries. I suppose one could say that there will be a devastating result, not only for the individuals concerned but also for people who are interested in stamp collections and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The accounts receivable will continue to operate in Tasmania for the time being, until that function is converted to a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) system. The wages system also will continue for the time being until that is replaced by the DEC system. In other words, Australia Post, which has a community responsibility towards Tasmania, is deciding what it will do in regard to this very important issue of employment on the basis of only two factors-efficiency and cost effectiveness. If they are its criteria, why do we not look at the monopoly position of Australia Post? It has a monopoly position in respect of certain aspects of mail delivery. Because it has that monopoly position, which this Parliament has enabled it to maintain, it has a responsibility, in my view, to ensure that the people of Tasmania who pay the piper receive some recompense for that in the way of job opportunities. It is not only the jobs of the individuals who will be directly affected that are at stake, it is a fact that those positions, forever and a day, will not be available to young people in Tasmania. It is no wonder that the rate of unemployment is so high in Tasmania. There are other factors involved, but this--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No officers on leave were employed as consultants during 1988. However, enquiries have revealed that one officer in Queensland was engaged as legal counsel on a number of occasions while on leave made up of long service leave on full pay, annual leave and leave without pay. The total absence on these various forms of leave was from 12 August 1988 to 26 May 1989. The officer was engaged under his own name. He is Mr D. O'Gorman, a Senior Legal Officer in the Brisbane Office of the Australian Government Solicitor. He was engaged to advise and/or appear in various cases. To 12 April 1989 he had been engaged in 13 matters and had been paid a total of 14137.10. There may yet be further bills lodged. The officer was granted leave, and permission to engage in employment while on leave, under local delegation to allow him to gain experience at the private Bar which would be of long term benefit to the Department.

<PARA> There is absolutely no basis to the Senator's assertion that funding levels for tertiary institutions have been reduced and that the School of Dentistry at the University of Western Australia might close due to funding cuts.</PARA>

The University of Western Australia will receive an additional $1.33 million in 1989 to increase its intake level by 150 places and further growth will be funded in 1990 and 1991. Capital funds will also be provided to enable a start to be made on a new biological science building to cost $6.24 million.</PARA>
