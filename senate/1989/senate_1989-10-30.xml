<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with deep regret that I inform the Senate of the death, on 26 October 1989, of Professor Gordon Stanley Reid, A.C., former Governor of the State of Western Australia from July 1984 till September this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Professor Reid was an officer in the Department of the House of Representatives for 12 years, for the last three of which he was the Serjeant-at-Arms. He then began a distinguished academic career during which he was well known for his writings on parliament. In 1966 he was appointed Professor of Politics at the University of Western Australia where he continued until his appointment as Professor of Political Science at the Australian National University in 1971. In 1974 he returned to the University of Western Australia as Professor of Politics and in 1978 he was appointed Deputy Vice-Chancellor for a period of four years.</PARA>
<PARA> Professor Reid was co-author of the book Australia's Commonwealth Parliament 1901-1988, a major work in the Parliament's Bicentenary publications project. This book was launched by the Governor-General at a ceremony in Parliament House on 31 May this year. Professor Reid leaves a wife, two sons and two daughters.</PARA>

I recognise that, and express sympathy to his family and friends.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I had proposed to say something on the adjournment about the late Professor Reid. Unusually, he combined service to this Parliament as a Clerk with a whole range of other things, including ultimately being the Governor of the State of Western Australia. Professor Reid achieved the support of all Western Australians in his service in that post. He was very warmly and highly regarded. I believe that Mrs Reid also contributed very greatly to the affection with which they were held in Western Australia. I know that Professor Reid put a great deal of effort into the work that he produced as part of the Bicentennial celebration and the celebration of this Parliament. He took the unusual course of accepting the governorship of Western Australia only on condition that he could continue that work which he had already commenced to undertake. It is splendid that in these last years of his life he was able to contribute in a number of different ways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My main reason in wishing to speak about the late Professor Reid is simply that he was a particularly fine man and he had a particularly fine family. I wish to express my sympathy to them at this very sad time. I know I speak on behalf of all Opposition senators when I say that. We thank his family for his splendid contribution to Australia as a serviceman-he served in the Royal Australian Air Force-as a servant of this Parliament, as an academic, as an author and, finally, as the representative of Her Majesty in the State of Western Australia. We extend our sincerest sympathy to his family on their very considerable loss. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I will speak only briefly, not out of disrespect to the memory of the previous Governor of Western Australia but because of the way in which this matter has been presented to the Senate for discussion. I knew Professor Reid as a professor of political science. One could not hope to meet a more gentlemanly, quietly spoken and presentable person. In fact, it was probably fairly unusual for a professor of political science to rise to such eminence. He was extremely well regarded by all of his colleagues throughout Australia in terms of the quality of his scholarship and presentation. Those senators who have read the book that he laboured over for so many years until last year will have seen evidence of the quality of his scholarship, combined with the ability to make a readable and presentable piece of work which can also enthral one about the history of this great country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Professor Reid had been sick for some time and finally had to resign from his position as Governor because of his illness and the pressures imposed on him by the job. His passing represents an enormous loss for the people of Western Australia, to the world of scholarship and to those of us who had the benefit and the joy of knowing such a fine, outstanding person. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to identify myself with those who have preceded me in noting the death of the former Governor of Western Australia, Gordon Reid. I had the privilege to serve on the Library Committee when we were canvassing the invitation to be offered to write a history of this Parliament and for that to be completed by our bicentennial year. I strongly urged that an invitation should go to Gordon Reid-a very well-established political scientist and historian of Australian politics. His appointments in this Parliament have already been rehearsed by those who have spoken before me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Gordon Reid was an excellent appointment as the historian to write the book in collaboration with some other scholars. When the book was completed it was launched in this building and many honourable senators were present at that launch only six months ago. I remember, at the time when the Governor-General launched the book, the glowing smile on Gordon Reid's face. I reflect on our temporary time on this earth by saying that it was with great surprise that we learnt, only weeks after that, that he had a terminal illness. In many ways it was his crowning achievement to have completed a most worthy history of this Parliament whilst he was the Governor of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I had great respect for him as a man. I think he was a fair and wonderful Australian. He had the respect of many academics for his work in universities. He spent a considerable period living in my home State of South Australia and I have got to know the members of his family quite well. I express to his family members, to his wife and children, my very sincere condolences on the death of this fine Australian. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to identify myself with the remarks that have been made by various speakers today on the unfortunate, premature passing of Professor Gordon Reid. I agree with all of the remarks that have been made about his academic standing, his role as Governor of Western Australia and his character and presence as an individual. For my part, I had all too brief a contact with him, but in the discussions I had with him he was certainly an informative figure and a man who brought a great deal of compassion and understanding to his tasks. As Governor of Western Australia I remember him telling me that for him it was a great experience to be Governor because it brought him directly in contact with Australians from all walks of life, enabled him to know and better understand the State in which he was the vice-regal representative and provided him with many warm memories. I wish to record my condolences for his wife and his family.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications. Would the Minister care to tell the Senate the truth about the carrying capacity of domestic air services? Is it the 60 per cent plus that Senator Button, the Prime Minister and the airlines are claiming? Is it the 51 per cent which Mr Willis says is more accurate if we take account of all services or is it the 35 per cent calculated by the Age newspaper in a survey at Melbourne Airport last Friday? What was the basis of the claim by Mr Willis that by mid-November the airlines would be operating at 80 per cent of normal capacity and why has he now changed that claim to make it relate to early December? Will that prediction turn out to be as nonsensical and as inoperative as the previous claims relating to in excess of 60 per cent? When does the Government believe there will be anything remotely approaching normalcy in the domestic air services-by `normalcy' I mean not having to wait for half an hour just to get through to the reservations clerk, not having to wait hours in airport terminals as hundreds of people did in Sydney on Thursday and then be told that their promised flights had disappeared and had been cancelled? When will people be able to plan and travel with any reasonable degree of certainty?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that during the June quarter of 1989 an average of 34,834 passengers per day flew on aircraft provided by all of the airlines affected by the dispute. The figure of 62 per cent was based on 21,745 seats available on 17 October compared with a demand of 34,834-the figure I have just mentioned. On Sunday Mr Willis, I am advised, was using an average number of seats per day of 40,000 which is an estimate of how many people would normally be flying at this time of the year. It is a difficult calculation to make. The figure of 51 per cent last week represents seats available of around 21,000 provided on average in the previous week compared to that figure of 40,000. Traffic levels fluctuate on a day to day basis. Last Friday capacity averaged 23,000 seats per day which represents 66 per cent of capacity using, again, the base of 34,834.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whichever measure we choose to adopt, the simple fact is that the airlines have now restored, as Mr Willis made it very clear, a substantial amount of capacity-much larger than that suggested by so-called independent observers and, of course, by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. With their moves to acquire additional leased aircraft and to operate more of their own fleet, the airlines are confident that by mid-November they will be catering for over 80 per cent of total demand. Beyond that, I have nothing further to add in response to the question.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Four Corners program last week which dealt with the marketing of breast milk substitutes? Does the Government accept that the World Health Organisation international code on marketing these products is effective? If not, what action can the Government take to ensure that the marketing of breast milk substitutes does not adversely affect the health of young children?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2486" SPEAKER="Reynolds Sen The Hon M." NAMEID="XI4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="QLD" MINISTERIAL="LOCAL GOVERNMENT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator REYNOLDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Four Corners program last week highlighted concern about the use of certain breast milk substitutes, particularly in Third World countries. Australia has supported the World Health Organisation international code of marketing of breast milk substitutes at the World Health Assembly in May 1981. The Australian Government has accordingly taken significant steps to give effect to the aim and principles of the code. It is certainly true that there is a great deal of concern that the code has been working better in some countries than in others. It is regrettable that some countries have not taken adequate steps to implement the provisions of the code.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The actions taken by the Australian Government include: the negotiation of an industry code of practice for the marketing of infant formulas; the development, through the Public Health Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council, of guidelines to promote breastfeeding; the incorporation of relevant clauses of the code into the model regulation food standard for infant formulas; and the incorporation, in 1985, of relevant clauses of the World Health Organisation code into dairy orders of the Export Control Act, to ensure that all products leaving Australia are appropriately labelled.</PARA>
<PARA> As well, Australia has drawn attention to the importance of promoting breastfeeding in Australia by highlighting the value of human milk in departmental nutrition programs, such as Dietary Guidelines of Australians-Baby's First Food. The Health for All Australians report identified among its goals and targets the need to increase the duration of breastfeeding. At present, the status of the World Health Organisation code in Australia is under further consideration by the Trade Practices Commission, with the object of ascertaining compliance with its regulations and ensuring that market place promotions are not interfering with the decisions of Australian women to breastfeed their infants.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance, both in his own capacity and as Minister representing the Treasurer. Given that the last admitted payment to help Sir Peter Abeles restructure Ansett Airlines of Australia was for a period ending a month ago, will the Minister update the amount of money that the Government has not collected from both Ansett and Australian Airlines to compensate them for keeping on staff who would otherwise have been stood down? Given also that the admitted figures, which are, as I mentioned, a month old in Ansett's case, total only just under $4m, what is the basis of the Treasurer's recollection in the House of Representatives last week that, `The cost to the Budget so far is about $30m'? What other payments are being made or what other fees payable by the airlines are not being collected, other than those to which the Government has admitted, to account for the $26m discrepancy in the figures so far provided to the Senate and the Treasurer's estimate?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As implied in the question, there are two components to the Government's compensation to the airlines. The first relates to direct payments, and up until 24 October some $3.8m had actually been paid. I am not sure until which date the contingent liability had been discharged with that $3.8m, nor do I have any actual figure beyond 24 October, although I believe that no payment has in fact been made since 24 October. I will get those completely up to date figures. The $30m figure that the Treasurer referred to, I think last week, includes revenue forgone as well as payments made. The revenue forgone-and I am not sure whether it is an exhaustive list-includes waiving charges for navigation and landing. There may be some others; I am not sure. I will get those up to date details.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the outlays side of the Budget, I can tell Senator Stone that unless there is a massive deterioration in the level of services now provided, or unless the present level of services does not increase for the next 100 years or so, the payments from the Budget will not be anywhere near the $100m figure that has been thrown around by various propagandists from the Opposition, let alone the $200m figure that even more irresponsible or ill-informed people elsewhere have said. I will get the most recent figures possible-I do not think it will be possible to get them up to the very last day because the information upon which the calculation can be based probably has not been received-both on the revenue forgone and on the outlays compensation which has been paid and will provide it, I would hope, tomorrow.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator STONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a supplementary question, Mr President. I thank the Minister for his answer and in particular for his very clear distinction between the two forms of remuneration being made available to Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines, namely, the forgoing of revenue otherwise collectable from those airlines on the one hand and, on the other hand, the actual payments being made to them, I presume by way of some kind of top-up, to make up the total amounts of payments to the staff affected. I thank the Minister also for his undertaking to provide to the Senate-I take it in the near future-full figures for those payments and the non-collection of payments, properly distinguishing between the two categories. Can the Minister, on the basis of his response, now explain to the Senate how it came about that on 5 October this year his Leader in the Senate, Senator Button, in responding to a question asked by Senator Crichton-Browne, I think the day before, purported to quote from a minute from the Department of Transport and Communications which supplied the answer to the honourable senator's question? Senator Button at that time cited the figure for an initial claim by Ansett Airlines for $701,735. In concluding his answer Senator Button said, quoting again from the minute:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This amount was waived by the Civil Aviation Authority in respect of the airlines' August account in accordance with the Government's direction.</PARA>
<PARA>Will the Minister clarify his Leader's statement at that time and indicate whether Senator Button was in fact referring to a non-collection of payments or levies on the airlines, or whether, as the answer certainly implied, he was referring to an actual payment to the airlines?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2486" SPEAKER="Walsh Sen The Hon P.A." NAMEID="TJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps there is something I should add to my previous answer on revenue forgone and that is that, whether landing charges or navigation charges were waived or not, there would be an automatic fall in revenue if the number of flights was to decline as, of course, inevitably happens when there is an industrial dispute. So there would have been some fall in revenue whether the Government had made any decision to permit the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation to waive charges or not. There would have less revenue because there would have been fewer flights. I am not sure what the breakup of that is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the $700,000 figure that Senator Button mentioned on 5 October, I do not know whether he has been quoted correctly. I think the words `charges waived' were mentioned, but I do not know; I did not have Senator Button's minute; nor did I have a copy of the minute that had been supplied to him by the Department. Having said that, I do not know whether an actual payment was made and recorded as a Budget outlay or a receipt of revenue waived. There is no inconsistency between an actual payment as a Budget outlay of $700,000 on 5 October and the figure I have just given-that is, the actual payment as a Budget outlay up until 24 October of some $4m or, to be precise, $3.8m.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable senators would no doubt have read in press reports, the largest demonstrations since the 1968 uprising took place in Czechoslovakia over the weekend when a crowd estimated at about 10,000 people gathered in the main square of Prague calling for freedom and democracy. The demonstration was violently suppressed by the authorities and approximately 250 people were arrested. The demonstration took place several days after the Government once again arrested the noted author and leading dissident Vaclav Havel. Mr Jiri Hajek, the Foreign Minister in the Dubcek Prague Spring Government, as it is known, was also arrested.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The events in Czechoslovakia are taking place against the context of a general thawing out in east Europe where very much greater freedom of political expression is being allowed in the Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary and, most recently, the German Democratic Republic. The authorities in Czechoslovakia, by contrast, appear determined to ignore these winds of change and to maintain the repressive tactics of the past 20 years. The Australian Government believes that maintaining obedience through repression is simply untenable. The Australian Government calls on the Czechoslovak authorities, accordingly, to release their political prisoners, to permit the peaceful expression of opinion and to respect internationally recognised standards of human rights. Fundamentally, we and other countries are calling for the Government in Prague simply to take into account the wishes of its own people.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have had a number of requests to institute some sort of inquiry under section 11 of the legislation. At the time I received those requests, I said that I doubted very much whether the Commonwealth under that section had any effective power to have a proper inquiry. Over the last few weeks, I have had the opportunity to have that checked and I think my initial reaction was correct. Certainly, there is no Commonwealth decision to be made or any action to be taken by a Commonwealth authority on Cape York which would enable me to hold an inquiry into the whole of the area. Obviously, there is the space port proposal. It is the responsibility of Senator Button and I have advised him that there will need to be a full environmental impact study into that proposal and there certainly will be. But to go further and take in the whole area of Cape York would not meet with the cooperation of the current Queensland Government. Given that the Queensland Government holds most of the information that would be required to make an inquiry under that section, such inquiry would have no meaning and I see no point in even making the attempt. The reality is, though, that the Leader of the Opposition in Queensland-who, I sincerely hope, will be the Premier very shortly-has indicated that his new government will immediately cooperate with the Commonwealth in having a proper land use inquiry into the whole of Cape York. Perhaps if we all devote our best efforts to seeing that he is in a position to bring that about, we will get the right result.</PARA></TALK.START>

Given Senator Hill's inability, or unwillingness, to spell out on television yesterday the implications of the Opposition's foreign aid policy, can the Minister advise what the implications would be for Australia's standing, internationally and in the region, of a cut in next year's aid budget of the order of $100m?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those of us who have some residual capacity for compassion undoubtedly felt for Senator Hill yesterday when one watched his embarrassing attempt-I can only describe it as such-to justify what is a manifestly ill-considered and arbitrary approach by the Opposition to the management of the aid program. Having harangued the Government about declining aid levels, as he and the Opposition have been doing in the last few months, his approach-or that which has been forced upon him, to give him the benefit of the doubt-is simply to hack off another $100m from next year's aid budget. If that were to come off the present forward estimates, which one presumes is the assumption, the aid to gross national product ratio would fall from its present level of 0.33 per cent, which I readily acknowledge is embarrassingly low, to an extraordinary and indefensible level of 0.29 per cent. That is the immediate implication. Australia would slide right down the league table from its present position, which is just about right on the median in terms of international aid effort, to depths of the bottom one-third of international contributors to development assistance. Even worse than all of that, next year the effect on individual aid items would be dramatically greater because, in addition to any overall cut of the kind that is being contemplated, next financial year the aid program will have to bear additional commitments to international financial institutions of some $100m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Hill interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know whether Senator Hill is aware of that; he is certainly not while he is shouting. Those commitments are already in the pipeline. The combined effect of a cut of $100m from the overall program, which has been contemplated, plus the extra $100m of commitments to international financial institutions, which are already in the pipeline, would mean that other areas of the aid program such as support for other multilateral institutions such as the United Nations, support for bilateral programs and support for cross programs such as the equity and merit scholarship scheme, would have to absorb cuts in funding of around $200m. I do not know whether the Opposition is aware of the combined impact of its proposal, but that is what is involved-cuts of around $200m to next year's aid program if it seeks net cuts from the Commonwealth's financial commitment of $100m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What would cuts of that kind look like? It depends on how one constructs these things-whether one adopts an approach which cuts out whole programs and leaves others intact or whether one adopts an across-the-board reduction in commitments to existing programs. A realistic package to meet a problem of that order of magnitude would involve something like this: a withdrawal or a very severe reduction of aid programs to southern Africa, for which the Government has a present commitment of $110m over the next three years. It would mean that the new India and Pakistan programs either would not be able to be proceeded with at all or would be under such severe funding pressure as to be barely worth proceeding with. It would mean that commitments that have been made to Thailand and Laos in relation to the Mekong Bridge, which is the most visible single aid project that we have in South East Asia at the moment, would simply not be able to be met. It would mean that commitments to the Philippines aid plan probably would not be able to be met, depending on how their timing is spread out. Certainly it would mean that there would be no capacity for any new Indo-China initiatives, should it become appropriate to initiate them over the next year or two, as we all hope it will be. It would mean dramatic damage to our relationship with Malaysia through a sharp phasing down of the brand new, recently announced bilateral aid program and, in particular, cuts to the equity and merit scholarship scheme, which is particularly focused on Malaysia. It would mean a severe reduction of aid activities in support of our international position on refugees, atomic energy, the environment and the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. In the context of the South Pacific, it would mean that aid to states in the South Pacific could at best probably be maintained only in nominal terms. Our capacity to maintain levels of aid to Papua New Guinea--</PARA>

As I was saying, our capacity to maintain those levels could come under very severe pressure and certainly make absolutely impossible any increase in aid to Papua New Guinea should its circumstances become more straitened as a result of present developments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, among all the gems in the contribution that has been made to our appreciation of the aid program was that uttered by Senator Hill yesterday when he said, among other things, that he did not want to do anything that might threaten Australia's exports. Yet that part of the aid program which is most clearly and directly tied to exports, the development import finance facility (DIFF) program, is, under the scheme that has been announced so far-and, of course, it might be changed-expected to bear fully one-half of the Opposition's $100m swipe at the aid program. The Opposition is talking about $50m coming off DIFF that could be expected to generate between, of course, around $150m and $200m in Australian exports. With just a little homework, Senator Hill would have discovered that a $50m cut to DIFF would effectively suspend that scheme for a full two years-probably more than that. It would obviously kill new market opportunities and any follow-on business that might have resulted from that initial expenditure. It will cruel jobs and manufacturing capacity right here in Australia. That is not just a matter of reducing expectations about possible levels of support in the future. What Senator Hill is talking about is actual committed programs-investment that is already in the pipeline-being totally thrown away as a result of that kind of arbitrary cut.</PARA>
<PARA> I could go on for much longer than this, but I am not prepared to waste any more of the Senate's time in addressing what is such an ill-conceived, ill-thought-out excuse for a policy document. It lacks both compassion and understanding, it lacks commonsense and, certainly it lacks any understanding of the economic impact which Senator Hill and the rest of his team opposite seem most anxious to parade their credentials about. It lacks any sort of capacity to understand the economic impact of the measures that are being proposed.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;According to information supplied to me by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission for 1988-89, 221 complaints were lodged under the Racial Discrimination Act and 496 complaints were lodged under the Sex Discrimination Act. That number of complaints indicates that there is a very real role for the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission here in Australia in those two areas alone. Unfortunately, those statistics do not include complaints lodged in Victoria as that data is not yet available. Nevertheless, one can say that there has been an overall increase of 11 per cent in the number of complaints received by the Commission since the previous year. That increasing workload indicates an increased awareness in the community of the fact that discrimination, particularly on the grounds of sex or race, is quite unacceptable in our society. People are emboldened to do something to combat discrimination that they suffer by making complaints to the Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That change in the attitude of people whereby they are prepared to take on somebody who discriminates against them in that unacceptable way is very largely due to the fact that they have confidence in the public profile that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has developed over the last several years. There have been programs of education and community outreach which have helped change and which respond to the sort of community which we wish to be as a civilised Australian community, living together in tolerant and peaceful harmony.</PARA>
<PARA> The conciliation process used by the Commission has been extremely successful with an overall figure of some 97 per cent of complaints being settled without referral for a formal hearing. From that figure of some 97 per cent not requiring a hearing it is quite clear that that type of confidential conciliation is considered by people to be preferable as a form of dispute resolution. Certainly, to have that sort of mechanism available in the community is extremely important. It is very difficult to understand how the Opposition expects these matters to be resolved without some administrative mechanism being provided by the Federal Government. To expect that matters be dealt with in a more formal dispute resolution process, perhaps even in the courts, would be to create an intolerable workload for those courts. In any case, it would be conducting the dispute resolution in too formal an atmosphere. Conciliation is far better because quite often it leads to an education of both parties as to the point of view of the other, particularly if the person against whom the complaint is made can see the unacceptable consequences of his or her act of discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA> I note that the Opposition intends to keep the Privacy Commissioner as part of its reconstruction of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. I make a plea, on behalf of all those Australians who have found that the conciliation processes provided by the Commission have been extremely useful in dealing with matters of sex or race discrimination, that those particular functions, as well as some administrative machinery, be maintained in order to provide for the conciliation of these matters, which can create great hurt and which erode the civilised way in which we deal with each other here in Australia.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the last part of the question is a very definite no. There are two other parts, though. There is, in my view, no doubt that abolition of capital gains tax, whether over a period of five years following the acquisition of an asset or immediately, would provide a powerful incentive to invest: it would provide a powerful incentive to invest in assets which produce capital gain instead of assets which produce income. Especially, of course, it would provide a powerful incentive to speculate in real estate. It would also provide an incentive for executives who have control of companies to get even further into executive incentive schemes like 1c paid shares and the bonus issues that they subsequently pick up. I will deal with that in more detail later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The abolition of the capital gains tax, whether straight out or over the five-year period, would also provide a massive incentive to change what otherwise would be taxable income into capital gains and thereby to evade income tax, because that very formula was the basis of almost all of the notorious tax evasion schemes of the late 1970s and the early 1980s. Some people believe-or at least they say they believe-that that would provide an incentive for productive investment: in other words, that it would actually change behaviour and encourage people to invest in productive enterprises which earn income. I suppose that, if people really believe that, they can believe whatever they like. But even for those who believe that, one thing which is beyond any dispute whatsoever is that behaviour will not be changed retrospectively.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition proposal is that all assets acquired after 19 September 1985, provided they have been held for five years, will be totally free of capital gains tax. The behaviour of anybody who has made a decision to invest in anything passive or active since that time will certainly not be changed by an Opposition promise to let them off capital gains tax now. I would have thought that even the dullest member of the National Party should be able to work that out.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Ronnie is right on that. I think Ronnie understands that perfectly. I have also been asked about the effect of this proposed change on recipients of 1c paid executive incentive scheme shares which subsequently attract bonus issues. We have an example, which has been referred to before-and I am using round figures here-of the national President of the Liberal Party of Australia, who over the last four years has picked up some 16 million 1c paid shares, which have attracted over the same period some 11 1/2 million bonus shares, which have the full rights of fully paid shares and which are currently worth, on present capitalisation of the company, some $35m. If those shares were sold under the existing arrangements, their holder-that is, the national President of the Liberal Party-would have to pay some $17m in capital gains tax, the reason being that the cost of the shares, that is, the bonus shares, since they were acquired pursuant to an earlier issue of 1c paid shares, is negligible. It is a good deal less than 1c. So virtually the whole lot, under the present arrangements, is taxable. Provided that Mr Elliott kept those 11 1/2 million bonus shares, valued at $35m, for a period of five years, he would not pay anything-not a cent-in capital gains tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many people-in particular, Mr McCrann, who is currently an economics writer for the Melbourne Herald-have raised from time to time the different question of the propriety of Mr Elliott watering down the value of all the other shareholdings in Elders held by all other shareholders to attract these 1c paid shares, but I am dealing at this stage just with the capital gains tax aspects of it. Indeed, I did hear on the Australian Broadcasting Commission last week a local interviewer called Matt Abraham, who I think was interviewing Senator Hill as well, refer to this proposal by the national President of the Liberal Party as taking from the workers and giving to the bludgers. He was told that he had got it wrong. He did actually get Mr Elliott's words wrong, but I do not believe that he got Mr Elliott's sentiments wrong. Mr Elliott's sentiments are to take from the workers and give to the bludgers; that is, bludgers like him who have picked up $35m-worth of bonus shares for nothing and now propose, through pulling the strings of the Opposition front bench, to get away with $17m in tax evasion as well.</PARA>

I ask the Minister: In light of current record unemployment levels in rural areas and the downturn in economic conditions in many rural industries, what consideration did the Government give to the devastating unemployment effect that this decision will have, not only on those directly involved in pig farming, but also on such industries as those covered by the Queensland Bacon Employees Union?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government made a decision to enable uncooked Canadian pig meat to be imported to Australia once it was satisfied that on quarantine grounds there was no health reason to disbar it. In her question Senator Bjelke-Petersen asked what effect that would have on employment. One of the key aspects of our decision is that Australia, as a country that advocates free trade in the world, is concerned that no artificial barriers to trade be erected to our agricultural products elsewhere in the world. It is our belief that if the importation could proceed on the basis that the assessed risk of transmissible gastroenteritis-the disease which concerns uncooked pig meat-is one in 3.3 million, that risk is negligible and there is no other reason to erect a trade barrier in our market. Were we to impose a regulated importation environment the possibility of reprisals against our agricultural exports by other countries in the world would be high and the effect consequently on employment in the rural sector in Australia would be devastating.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am having a really good day as a matter of fact. The position is that from an employment point of view were Australia to start imposing trade barriers to a competitive import, I believe we would stand to have reprisals conducted against us which would have an absolutely devastating effect on our rural agriculture and which would leave us without any arguments in the international fora dealing with the opening of trade at a time when some positive possibilities are emerging in the current round of trade talks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I say, the assessed risk by the Government for the importation of disease is one chance in 3.3 million. Another risk assessment by the Australian Veterinary Association is, as I recall, one chance in 15,500-I would need to check precisely that risk but it was a higher level of risk than we assessed. I am advised by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service that even that higher level of risk is an acceptable risk in terms of risk assessment criteria applied.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bjelke-Petersen also asked whether there was any other assessment on employment and came out with a figure of a reduction of 20 per cent. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics made an assessment that the actual effect on employment will be negligible. The only way that a 20 per cent figure could be justified is to assume that there is some massive subsidy on the Canadian end for the importation of uncooked pig meat at dumping level prices. If such a subsidy existed, Senator Bjelke-Petersen and I both know-as would the farmers concerned-that we could take action to prevent that under the customs laws.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am aware of the professor's comments. An article referring to them appeared in the Australian newspaper on 10 September this year. As to the second question, the International Maritime Organisation convention, which incorporates annex V, is the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973, as amended by the protocol of 1978, known as the MARPOL Convention. This convention and two of its annexes entered into force for Australia on 14 January 1988. However, annex V is one of the so-called optional annexes of the convention, which means that a country can become a party to the convention without becoming a party to that annex. This annex has been in force internationally since 31 December last year.</PARA></TALK.START>

Of course, both the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer imply that this Government does not tell the truth about the state of public finances-thereby demonstrating that they are in a time warp. They think that nothing has changed since 1982, when the Government that they both knew a lot about, as did Mr Howard and Senator Stone, produced a Budget which had absolutely no economic strategy, which simply had a political strategy aimed at buying off enough pressure groups to get them over an election. Most of the bribes, of course, were deferred cost bribes by way of tax concessions, which deferred the cost of the bribe until the next financial year. That was then aggravated by post-Budget decisions to buy off even more pressure groups with budget outlays, involving such things as drought relief and the national bicentennial water resources program.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very well, I am quite happy to withdraw that statement. In none of the five years during which Mr Howard was Treasurer were actual Budget outlays less than the Budget forecast. In three of the five years, the deficit, as it was in those days, was greater than the Budget forecast. This Government, of course, has imposed a great deal of discipline upon itself, as a result of which, in all but one of the six completed Budgets brought down by this Government, the deficit has been smaller than the Budget forecast or, in more recent times, the surplus has been greater. In other words, the bottom line outcome in five of the six completed Budgets has been better than the Budget forecast. In three of those years the outlays figure has been lower than the Budget forecast. So it is 3 : 3 for us on the outlays side; 5 : 1 in our favour on the deficit side; 4 : 1 against the Opposition on the outlays side; and 3 : 2 on the deficit side against the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This year I have been asked about post-Budget authorisations of outlays. The question Senator Stone asked earlier touches upon this as well. There have been some outlays authorised post-Budget. I mentioned the actual expenditure of $3.8m for airlines compensation which will ultimately be a figure somewhat higher but nowhere near as high as the figure that the Opposition is talking about, and some three other small items which add up to a total of less than $5m plus, possibly-there has been no firm decision; there has been an authorisation but there can be no costing on it yet-some payment to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd which, again, will be very much less than the Opposition suggests. So a reasonable estimate for the increase in outlays pursuant to post-Budget outlay decisions is of the order of $30m, which is quite consistent and could be accommodated within the normal underspends which occur throughout the financial year. While nobody can be certain at this stage whether this year's estimate of outlays will come in under the Budget estimate, as they have in three of the previous six years, or somewhat above the Budget estimate, there is no reason to believe that they will be anything substantially different from the Budget estimate.</PARA>
<PARA> The reason the Opposition continues to dispute this is that it does not realise that reality has changed, that this Government tells the truth and that it imposes fiscal discipline on itself. We publish Forward Estimates. Every year, and sometimes twice a year, we publish reconciliation tables which show why the final outcome was different from the Forward Estimates forecast. We have done all of those things which the Opposition never does, and never did do. Either it has forgotten that things have changed or it is just a cop-out because it is not willing to reveal its secret agenda and all the promises that it will break, just as Mr Greiner broke his promises in New South Wales. Either it is stuck in a 1982 time warp or it is just a cop-out to conceal the fact that it has every intention of breaking most of its election promises.</PARA>
<PARA> The last point that I want to make as the Minister for Finance and on behalf of the Department of Finance relates to the wicked slur that Dr John Hewson and Mr Andrew Peacock-I notice that Senator Stone has not joined in this-have cast upon the integrity and professionalism of the officers of the Department of Finance. I draw attention again to the fact that Senator Stone has not joined in this exercise. Whatever bodgie or shonky instructions may have gone out in the days of the previous Government to departments and senior officials, the only instruction that has gone out from me to the Department of Finance on costings or estimates is that the Department at all times play a straight bat-and it does.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I claim to have been misrepresented in the West Australian newspaper of 18 October. I immediately wrote a letter to the editor and would have preferred to have used that forum but as the letter has not been printed I therefore choose to use the forum in the Senate. On 18 October it was reported on page 38 of the West Australian that Senator Knowles had stated that I had suggested that foreign aid be given `to nations not suffering poverty or lack of development' and therefore that aid regarded as a `waste' `should continue or be extended'. Nothing could be further from the truth. What I said was correctly reported in the West Australian two days previously on 16 October. I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . aid must be more carefully distributed, with a bigger portion through non-government agencies and into environmentally sound projects. </PARA>
<PARA>I further stated, again as correctly printed in the West Australian of 16 October, that I, like all 11 Australian Democrat parliamentarians, have declared my `support for the One World Campaign, which is directed by the Australian Council for Overseas Aid' and which `calls on the Australian Government to focus aid on fighting poverty and restoring the environment'. I certainly made no mention of supporting waste or the wealthy, as the article purports that Senator Knowles stated. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, it is true, as was correctly reported in the West Australian, that I was critical of the Hawke Government for letting aid fall from 0.51 per cent in 1983-86 to 0.33 per cent in 1989, despite a commitment to the United Nations to aim for 0.7 per cent. Interestingly, this criticism was also levelled in September during a public meeting in Canberra. It was levelled at the Hawke Government by the Opposition spokesperson on foreign affairs and trade, Senator Robert Hill, despite his now seeking to slash aid by $100m. </PARA>

<PARA>HAZARDOUS WASTE (REGULATION OF EXPORTS AND IMPORTS BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to control the export and import of hazardous wastes in order to protect human health and the environment. The Act will enable Australia to take part in international measures to control the movement of hazardous wastes which also have this objective. </PARA>
<PARA> With the development of modern industry has come the generation of hazardous industrial and chemical wastes. These are wastes that cannot be disposed of in municipal landfill or to the sewer, but need to be recorded and tracked to special treatment and disposal facilities. In the last two decades it has become recognised in every industrial country that special regulation is needed for these materials. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, in industrialised countries such special regulation has been put in place, to protect the environment. In Australia, regulation of hazardous wastes is primarily a State and Territory responsibility and they administer appropriate controls. </PARA>
<PARA> In this area of regulation, in Australia and overseas, the term hazardous wastes does not include radioactive wastes, which have separate regulatory needs. In this country the import and export of radioactive materials are controlled under the Customs Act. </PARA>
<PARA> It became clear as national control systems were developed, that gaps existed at national borders. Well publicised incidents, such as drums of waste being `lost' at European borders, or wastes being dumped in African ports, led to the conclusion that an international control system was necessary, to protect the global environment. </PARA>
<PARA> This was recognised by the then House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation, which recommended in its 1982 First Report on the Inquiry into Hazardous Chemicals that Australia should control the export and import of these materials. Subsequently the Australian Environmental Council endorsed Commonwealth control on exports and imports of hazardous wastes. </PARA>
<PARA> I should add that there is no evidence that Australia has been involved in unacceptable movement of these materials. </PARA>
<PARA> The international body which acted first in this area was the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). In 1984 it began developing international agreements to control hazardous wastes when moved, to ensure their satisfactory disposal. However, it became clear that a global agreement was necessary, and in 1987 the initiative was taken by the United Nations' Environmental Programme (UNEP). In the light of these developments, the Government decided in March 1988 to control this trade, in order, amongst other things, to take part in international control arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> On 22 March 1989, at a UNEP conference held in Switzerland, `The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal' was unanimously adopted by all governments represented. Australia was active in drawing up the Convention. Australia can become a Party to the Convention once this legislation has been put into effect. Before becoming a Party the Commonwealth will consult with the States and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA> Fundamental features of the Basel Convention include:</PARA>
<PARA> the requirement that Parties shall prohibit the export of hazardous wastes from their jurisdictions to States that do not consent to the import;</PARA>
<PARA> the requirement that countries treating and disposing of wastes do so in an environmentally sound manner; and</PARA>
<PARA> the tracking of wastes to acceptable disposal, when moved across borders. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence the Bill before us provides for the issuing of permits to control both the import and export of hazardous wastes to ensure that they are disposed of by an environmentally acceptable method. The legislation has been designed to control the movements of wastes as required by the Convention. However, several of the obligations in the Convention, such as the requirement to minimise waste production and the provision of acceptable disposal facilities, fall within the responsibilities of State and Territory Governments. Therefore the controls introduced by this Bill will be complemented by State and Territory waste management legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, a few hundred tonnes of hazardous waste are exported from Australia each year. These wastes fall into the category of intractable wastes for which the only widely acknowledged environmentally acceptable method for disposal is high temperature incineration. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority of those wastes that have been exported have been sent to Pontypool in the United Kingdom for destruction in a high temperature incinerator. As far as is known no hazardous wastes have been imported into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned, hazardous wastes are generally defined as those wastes that cannot be disposed of in the usual way such as to municipal landfill or the sewer. They present a potential threat to the environment or human health and therefore require special treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in addition to what are usually considered to be hazardous wastes, the Basel Convention also controls the movement and disposal of wastes collected from households and residues arising from the incineration of household wastes. Accordingly, the definition of hazardous wastes in the Bill has been expanded to include these categories of wastes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that the Minister must only issue a permit for the export of wastes if he or she is satisfied, amongst other things, that the hazardous waste will be permitted to enter the proposed country of import and that any exported waste will be disposed of in the receiving country in a manner that will not be harmful to the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be necessary for the applicant for either an import or export permit to demonstrate that he or she has adequate insurance or is able to meet any liability arising in relation to the activity proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> Other matters that the Minister may take into account when considering an export application are whether there are facilities for disposal of wastes in Australia which could be used for the disposal of the exports. </PARA>
<PARA> This ground could be used to make more viable Australian treatment facilities-it is also consistent with the Basel Convention, which seeks to minimise movements whenever possible. The Minister may also take into account Australia's international relations, when considering issuing permits. Other clauses in the Bill provide for the Minister to vary, extend and revoke permits, with appropriate safeguards for applicants. Particulars of permits are to be published in the Gazette, unless there are national interest reasons not to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Bill, the Minister may make orders to deal with the wastes and recover costs, if the orders are not complied with. This power will include the power to order wastes illegally imported to Australia to be returned to the country of origin. This is consistent with the Basel Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> Principal offences under this Bill will be punishable by up to five years imprisonment. Enforcement of the Act will be by inspectors with appropriate powers. The Bill provides for appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, against the Minister's decisions whether such decisions are to grant or not to grant a permit, to vary or not to vary a permit, or other decisions relating to permits. Third parties with an interest may appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for amendment of the Customs Act, to ensure that where hazardous wastes are the subject of illegal movement under the proposed Act, they are not thus forfeit to the Crown. Hazardous wastes have a negative value, that is, ownership of them is a liability. Therefore a person should not be able to get rid of them simply by illegally importing or exporting them and then forfeiting them to the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA> There is provision for fees of up to $4000 to be paid by permit applicants. It is intended that these will cover the costs of administering the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The States and Territories have been consulted during the drafting of the Bill. Their cooperation will be needed in the administration of the Act through, for example, informing the Commonwealth authorities of suspected illegal import or export activities. Memoranda of understanding will be developed with them for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is committed to ensuring that hazardous wastes in Australia are managed in an environmentally acceptable manner. The introduction of controls on the import and export of hazardous wastes complements the domestic regulation of these materials which the Commonwealth is helping to implement through the Australia and New Zealand Environment Council (formerly the Australian Environment Council to which I referred earlier). </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth, in concert with the States and Territories is encouraging industry to minimise its production of hazardous wastes. Many companies are now finding that waste minimisation is in fact cost effective in terms of the valuable materials that can be recovered from the so called `waste' stream. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government, together with the New South Wales and Victorian State Governments, is examining the possibility of establishing a facility for the high temperature incineration of intractable wastes in New South Wales. The incinerator is proposed as a national facility but, if established, it will be operated by a New South Wales Government agency. Setting up such a facility would reduce the current need to store or export intractable wastes. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has as its near neighbours many small nations, such as the Pacific countries, which may well have relatively small quantities of hazardous wastes which they wish to dispose of safely. Australia has a responsibility to assist these countries to dispose of their wastes in an environmentally acceptable manner. It is inconceivable that these nations could justify the building of a high temperature incinerator given the small amount of wastes that would need to be incinerated. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, if the wastes are to be disposed of safely in our region it may be necessary to import those wastes into Australia for incineration. </PARA>
<PARA> Through the adoption of the measures contained in the Bill Australia will be in a position to control the movement of hazardous wastes into and out of Australia and to require that these wastes are only treated and disposed of using methods of the highest standard. In this way we can demonstrate to the rest of the world our commitment to the protection of the global environment. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS (NOTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT) BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to establish a national scheme for the notification and assessment of industrial chemicals to protect people at work, the public and the environment from the harmful effects of industrial chemicals. The scheme will be known as the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme-NICNAS. </PARA>
<PARA> This scheme will form a vital component in an overall chemicals management strategy for Australia. Notification and assessment of chemicals will improve the efficiency of other elements of this overall strategy such as labelling, provision of material safety data sheets and education and training. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill reflects the continuing priority that the Federal Government gives to ensuring safe Australian workplaces and a cleaner environment. Worksafe Australia and the Australian and New Zealand Environment Council, whose 1984 proposal was the basis for this legislation, have conducted consultations with Commonwealth Departments, State and Territory Authorities, Unions and Industry and other interested groups to ensure that the proposed scheme will take into account and achieve a fair balance between the interests of these parties. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation is to apply to industrial chemicals imported into or manufactured in Australia. It will apply to the individual chemical substances, but not mixtures or formulations. Because it is not possible to determine the hazards of a formulation unless the properties of the ingredients are known, this scheme will also provide the fundamental information with which formulations can be assessed. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation will not place controls on chemicals. This will necessarily be through the existing body of State and Territory legislation. The legislation will, however, promote the development of uniform controls by ensuring that adequate, independently reviewed information is available to State and Territory authorities, and by making recommendations about appropriate controls for national adoption. </PARA>
<PARA> Industrial chemicals are used in virtually every commodity, including textiles, paints, plastics, adhesives and cleaners, and are an integral part of modern life. Over the past several decades the number of industrial chemicals introduced by industry has increased dramatically. It has been estimated that worldwide, there are in excess of 100,000 individual industrial chemicals in commercial use. Over 30,000 of these are used in Australia and found in a bewildering number of chemical products. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is long overdue. Unlike therapeutic drugs and agricultural and veterinary chemicals, industrial chemicals are, and have been, introduced into Australian workplaces and the environment without any national assessment of their hazards. This is in stark contrast to the majority of our trading partners who have had similar legislation in place for a number of years. This legislation will ensure that new industrial chemicals are evaluated before they enter the Australian market, and that selected chemicals already in use are reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA> Control over industrial chemicals is currently exercised by the States and Territories through many and various pieces of legislation, covering, for example, the transport and storage of dangerous goods, occupational health and safety, consumer protection and environmental protection. </PARA>
<PARA> To date, standards and controls for chemicals have largely been developed on a piecemeal basis by individual States and Territories, often only in response to damage to health or environmental pollution. Differences in approach between States and Territories have led to a lack of uniformity in requirements and controls. This situation results in significant, unnecessary costs for industry, as well as increased hazard to the public and the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware of the enormous cost of rectifying the damage done by chemicals such as mercury, PCBs and asbestos. Hardly a day goes by without an incident being reported involving hazardous chemicals, whether it is a chemical fire in Melbourne or pollution of a historic waterway in Sydney. Such incidents have led to international recognition of the need to anticipate potential hazards of chemicals prior to their entry into commerce. </PARA>
<PARA> Based on extrapolation of overseas data, the cost of occupational injury and disease from exposure to chemicals can be expected to be very high. As a consequence, even modest reductions will have major benefits in monetary and human terms. For example the United Kingdom Health and Safety Executive has recently estimated that seven million working days are lost each year in the United Kingdom due to skin problems, at a cost of $A1.3 billion. Occupational dermatitis resulting from chemical exposure makes up the ``large majority'' of these skin problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The public is exposed to industrial chemicals directly through use of consumer products and indirectly by the presence of these chemicals in the environment through pollution. </PARA>
<PARA> Contamination resulting from release of industrial chemicals to the environment has many negative effects apart from those to human health. Pollution of waterways leads to loss of environmental amenity, for example, swimming or recreational fishing, and also economic loss, for example to commercial fishing industries. Accumulation of chemicals in animals, particularly those at the top of food chains, can threaten individuals and, on occasions, place entire species at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> The exaggerated fear of chemicals, has in recent years become a source of considerable cost and delay to both industry and Government. Such fears can result in industrial action against changes in workplace processes using chemicals and adverse community reaction to proposals for new chemical plants, waste disposal and destruction facilities. A persistent complaint of workers, environmental groups and the general public is the lack or inadequacy of chemicals information. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly a mechanism is required in Australia to ensure that sufficient data is provided for new chemicals to permit the adequate assessment of their potential health and environmental hazards. In this way the safeguards recommended will properly reflect both the potential exposure to the chemical and its physical, chemical and toxicological properties. Such a mechanism should not, however, impose unnecessary time or cost burdens on industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission, otherwise known as Worksafe Australia, in 1985 was early evidence of the Government's commitment to occupational health and safety. The scheme will be administered by Worksafe Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the details of the legislation, Part 2 of the Bill refers to the Australian Inventory of Chemical Substances. This central feature of the legislation is currently being compiled by the Department of the Arts, Sports, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. The inventory will list those industrial chemicals which are already in use in Australia and which therefore will not be regarded as ``new'' under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Chemicals listed in this inventory, and certain other chemicals, will be exempted from the requirements for new chemicals. These may be reviewed if they give rise to concern. New chemicals which are notified and assessed under the scheme will not be added to the inventory for a period of five years after the assessment has been completed. This will prevent others who wish to introduce the chemical from unfairly profiting from the work of the original applicant in satisfying the requirements of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 3 of the Bill describes the process of notification and assessment of industrial chemicals. New chemicals will be notified to Worksafe Australia together with a notification statement of the chemical's intended use and properties. The cost of providing this information will be borne by the importer or manufacturer. The information will be assessed to determine the potential hazard to occupational health and safety, public health and the environment. The information required is similar to the O.E.C.D. minimum premarketing set of data, which has been agreed internationally as that necessary for an initial hazard assessment of new industrial chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> There are provisions in the legislation to provide a lesser information package if it is justified on scientific or economic grounds. For example, in the case of polymers, small volume chemicals, research and development chemicals and site limited chemicals it is recognised that parts of the prescribed minimum data set may not be appropriate. These classes of chemicals are therefore subject to special consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> For chemicals which have been in use overseas and are on overseas inventories this Bill provides discretion to allow an incomplete notification statement. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, in a small minority of cases, data beyond the prescribed minimum level may be required; for example, chemicals for which there is widespread human or environmental exposure or those chemicals for which the basic data package foreshadows a need for further information. </PARA>
<PARA> To ensure that occupational health and safety, public health and environmental health hazards are considered, assessments will be undertaken jointly by Worksafe Australia, the Department of Community Services and Health and the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories respectively. For each chemical, the information package, including the material safety data sheet, will be reviewed to determine appropriate recommendations for the safe use of the chemical. A consolidated assessment report will be prepared within prescribed time frames by Worksafe Australia and distributed to responsible Commonwealth, State and Territory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> As it is sometimes necessary to review assessments to ensure that the original one remains valid, the Bill provides a mechanism for secondary notification. For instance, secondary notifications may be required for chemicals if they are used in a wider variety of applications than originally intended or if new information about their properties becomes available. </PARA>
<PARA> Several important provisions exist for the estimated 30,000 existing chemicals, which are listed on the Inventory. These provisions allow the Federal Government to tackle, on a priority basis, those chemicals for which there are particular Australian concerns. In some cases, classes of chemicals which are related either by chemical structure or by their use or function may be declared as priority existing chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> In selecting existing chemicals for review, maximum use will be made of international collaborative efforts such as the O.E.C.D. Chemicals Program and the United Nations International Program on Chemical Safety. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be no prescribed information requirements for the assessment of existing chemicals. Instead an initial request for information will be made to assist in defining the extent of the problem. Information requirements will generally be directed to the specific concerns which prompted the review. Where only one aspect of a chemical is of concern, for example, environmental damage, information requirements and assessment may be limited to that aspect.</PARA>
<PARA> One important outcome of this scheme is the information on chemicals that will become available to the public. A summary of each assessment report will be published in a special issue of the Commonwealth Gazette and the full public assessment report will be available on request. </PARA>
<PARA> Confidentiality of information will be maintained when this is necessary to safeguard commercial interests. However, there will be a prescribed set of basic information, including summaries of health and environmental effects, which cannot be confidential. </PARA>
<PARA> The appeal provisions in the Bill are drawn widely. Industry and third parties will be able to appeal decisions made under the legislation to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. For example, appeals may be made against the content and recommendations of an assessment report on the selection of priority existing chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> The openness of the scheme, as evidenced by availability of information and by the wide appeal provisions, is unique, and is to be commended. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill includes a number of offences. It also sets out the levels of fines to apply to a natural person and to a corporation. Consistent with standard practice, the maximum fine for a corporation is five times that for a natural person. </PARA>
<PARA> The detailed implementation of controls and their enforcement will be the subject of memoranda of understanding to be developed between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories. Proposals for regulating hazardous substances at the State and Territory level are being developed to be consistent with this legislation. For this reason there are provisions in the Bill to declare equivalent State and Territory schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA> The costs of implementing this legislation are estimated to be $1.25 million after 50% cost recovery. Cost recovery is consistent with the practice established in August 1987 for the review of agricultural chemicals and veterinary drugs. Fees will be specified by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation has been developed to achieve its objectives at the minimum possible cost and includes significant provisions to allow flexibility in application to minimise impact on industry. Information required for both new and existing chemicals is limited to that necessary to perform an adequate hazard assessment of the chemical. The inclusion of statutory time-frames for assessment will ensure that hazards will be promptly reviewed and delays and uncertainties for industry minimised. </PARA>
<PARA> Harmonisation of the scheme with those in operation in most O.E.C.D. countries, and adoption of agreements on such matters as chemical test methods, good laboratory practice and mutual acceptance of data, allows a system of notification of new chemicals which does not duplicate equivalent testing and assessment processes carried out by other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of the Bill specifically make maximum use of overseas assessments resulting in reduction of costs. Where the chemical has been notified and assessed under a recognised equivalent scheme of another country, that notification and assessment will suffice providing it is accessible and relevant to Australia. On the other hand, there may be occasions where additional tests are required because of unique Australian circumstances. The Bill allows for such occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not suggested that the proposed legislation will, in itself, solve all the problems associated with hazardous chemicals and the considerable costs that flow from these. However, even small percentage reductions in the damage caused by chemicals represent very substantial benefits to Australia. The Bill, operating in conjunction with other mechanisms such as requirements for material safety data sheets will maximise these benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the Government's intention that the commitment of industry and trade unions to the scheme be maintained and their involvement continued. To this end, an advisory committee will be established within the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, a co-ordinating committee will be established external to the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission to deal with issues of common concern to interested departments, and to provide advice to the Government on the development and operation of the scheme after its inception.</PARA>
<PARA> Major effects of the scheme will be evident in the areas of, occupational health and safety and protection of the environment. Overall, we believe that real benefits will follow because the legislation will:</PARA>
<PARA> encourage uniformity of regulation by the States and Territories;</PARA>
<PARA> require those introducing chemicals to `know their products', to be aware of the chemical's identity and properties; and</PARA>
<PARA> increase rational debate in the community on chemicals issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable Senators, this Bill provides another strong indication, of the Government's desire to ensure that significant occupational health and environmental issues confronting society are managed effectively and safely. Chemicals are an essential part of our society and require responsible management by manufacturers and importers, workers and consumers as well as by Government. The provisions of this Bill show that the Government is addressing this important area. I believe this Bill represents an important step in the management of an extremely complex issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to implement increases in remuneration for members of the Federal judiciary and certain statutory office holders. </PARA>
<PARA> The Remuneration Tribunal in its 1988 review recommended increases in judges' salaries of up to 80 per cent. Whilst these proposals discharged the Tribunal's statutory obligations, the Government was unable to accept that level of increase at a time when continued community-wide restraint in wage fixation was necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government considered that a balance should be found between the need for restraint and the interests of the administration of justice through the maintenance of a proper standard of judicial appointments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industrial Relations therefore asked the members of the Remuneration Tribunal to provide further advice on appropriate remuneration for the Federal judiciary in the current wage fixing context. </PARA>
<PARA> The members of the Tribunal presented their special report to the Minister on 30 June. In that report, the Tribunal members found that within the terms of the national wage principles at that time, there was an inequity between Federal and State court judges. </PARA>
<PARA> They concluded that the duties and responsibilities of the Federal Court warranted remuneration no less than that of the members of the Supreme Court of Queensland, who at the time of their report were the highest paid of the State Supreme Courts receiving a level of remuneration 16 per cent greater than that of their Federal Court colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also proposed that expenses of office allowance be absorbed into salaries and that judicial remuneration be adjusted in accordance with the August 1988 national wage case decision which granted increases of 3 per cent and $10 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill implements these recommendations by amending the Judicial and Statutory Officers' (Remuneration and Allowances) Act 1984. The Government has also decided to legislate to equate the remuneration of members of the Family Court with that of the judiciary of the Federal Court. There is no longer any justification for members of the Family Court to be paid less than their Federal Court colleagues, especially as the Federal Court is now able to refer certain matters to the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with the report's recommendations, these changes in remuneration will operate from 1 March 1989. Travelling allowances are also to be adjusted from 1 March 1989 in accordance with the rates recommended in the Tribunal's 1988 review. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industrial Relations has foreshadowed that a further examination of judicial remuneration will be undertaken in the light of the recent decision from the national wage case bench. </PARA>
<PARA> The appropriateness of the relativities of remuneration between Federal Court judges and a number of statutory officer-holders will also be assessed. The linkage of two of these offices is to be removed pending the review of the relativities. These are the offices of Master of the Supreme Court and Judicial Registrar of the Family Court. However, the current levels of remuneration will be adjusted in accordance with the increases arising from the August 1988 National Wage decision. </PARA>
<PARA> The removal of these direct linkages at this time, should not be seen to prejudice in any way, the future re-establishment of linkages for these offices, should it be considered appropriate to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also empowers the Tribunal in the future to make determinations, rather than recommendations, in respect of the office of judge and offices of judicial status. The Tribunal currently has this power in relation to virtually all other offices within its jurisdiction. As is the case for these other offices, determinations will be subject to disallowance by either House of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of implementing the Bill will be of the order of $3.7m in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> Further information on the Bill is contained in the explanatory memorandum, which I now present and which has been circulated to honourable senators. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill would amend social security and veterans' affairs legislation to implement some of the measures announced in the Budget this year and several other program refinements of a mainly administrative nature. It also contains measures to enhance the effectiveness of the child support scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last six years the Government has rebuilt the integrity of Australia's social security system. We have substantially amended legislation to support an overhaul of administrative systems. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill would amend the Social Security Act to continue this reform. Compensation recovery mechanisms will be made much more effective, family allowance and family allowance supplement procedures will be refined, assessment of domestic circumstances of sole parent pensioners will be overhauled, deferment periods for education leavers applying for benefits will be adjusted and unemployment and sickness benefits will not be payable to people who refuse to provide or apply for a tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA> Three amendments in the area of compensation recovery promote the administrative integrity of the social security system and help to ensure that the funds made available by the Australian public for social security go to those who most need them. </PARA>
<PARA> Under present arrangements which apply where compensation payments and social security benefits overlap, the Department of Social Security tries to recover any money from the employer or the insurer. However, some employers and insurers pay out compensation before recovery is made even though they may have been alerted by the Department. This Bill makes it possible for the Department to take recovery action against employers or insurers to redress this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill tightens the Department's recovery powers to ensure that State compensation bodies participate in proper recovery arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also provides that any outstanding money still owed to the Department once a client has been paid compensation may be recovered from his or her continuing social security entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA> Sole parent pensions are payable to people caring for children who are not married nor living in a de facto relationship and to people caring for children whose spouse is in prison. </PARA>
<PARA> It is paid because of the very special hardships and disadvantages caused by bringing up children alone. </PARA>
<PARA> The administration of sole parent pension requires assessment of the domestic circumstances of some claimants and pensioners-to determine whether they are unmarried and not living in a de facto relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> That aspect of administration has been most unsatisfactory-for clients and staff of the Department. Without any clear legislative provisions, staff have been left to administer a program without clear rules and with no clear procedures. The results have necessarily been intensive investigations and arbitrary decision making. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill would specify clearly the process for decision making in these cases. It would enable the Department to require sole parent pensioners and claimants for pension who are living in a de facto or marriage relationship to fully disclose their domestic circumstances to the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> It would provide that, where this is done, the Department must weigh the evidence with a clear list of relevant indicia set out in the legislation and make a decision whether the person is, or is not, entitled to pension. The legislation would provide that, in the rare case when a decision maker is unable to come to a clear conclusion one way or the other, pension should cease-subject to continuation of pension pending resolution of any appeal to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation would also provide that, when a pensioner or claimant has fully and honestly disclosed his or her domestic circumstances to the Department and it has been decided that he or she is entitled to pension, there should be no further investigation of the domestic circumstances of that person for 12 weeks-unless there is a significant change of circumstances. In this way, the Bill would guarantee a decision making process which recognises the complexity of many cases in this area: and protects clients and staff from the indignity and arbitrariness of current arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation would also specify-for the first time-matters which decision makers must take into account in determining marital status issues for all purposes under the Social Security Act. This would lead to more structured, more consistent interviewing and decision making on these issues across all pensions, benefits and allowances. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill refines provisions relating to family allowance supplement (FAS) when family income has fallen. These amendments flow from practical experience with the FAS program. Under current arrangements, families may qualify for FAS if their taxable income for the financial year ending in the previous calendar year is below certain levels. If the family's previous taxable income was higher than these levels, but their income has dropped so that taxable income in the current financial year will be at least 25 per cent less, the family can qualify for FAS on the basis of their current financial year's income. </PARA>
<PARA> From December 1989, FAS will be payable even if the drop in income is less than 25 per cent as long as total income is expected to be below the FAS income threshold. </PARA>
<PARA> To preserve the effect of this amendment into the next entitlement year, families will retain their new, higher entitlement if this would make them better off than under a normal assessment based on their income for the previous financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill would provide for reassessments of FAS following amended assessments by the Australian Taxation Office of taxable income for the year which is the basis of a FAS entitlement. Under the provisions in the Bill, a downwards reassessment of taxable income would trigger FAS arrears for the client. With an upwards reassessment, an overpayment and reduction in FAS rate would occur only if the reassessment was more than 25 per cent higher. </PARA>
<PARA> Another amendment ensures that low income parents who are full-time students receiving Austudy or a similar payment will not be excluded from entitlement to FAS through the operation of the income test. FAS will now be payable to these people at the maximum rate subject to the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA> From January 1990, the family allowance provisions will be changed to require recipients to inform the Department of certain notifiable events which occur during the calendar year. Events such as the allowee starting a new job or getting married are likely to generate an increase in income and, therefore, might affect the family allowance rate payable. Prescribing notifiable events in this way puts the family allowance system on a similar footing to FAS. </PARA>
<PARA> A refinement is also being made to the FAS notifiable events arrangements. Currently, FAS can be reassessed where a family's income increases following a notifiable event but only if the event occurred after FAS had been granted. It will now be possible to take into account a notifiable event occurring before grant to arrive at a fair and accurate entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill includes a number of refinements to the unemployment benefit system to strengthen its principles of providing support to people when they need it, providing opportunities and incentives to unemployed people to get back to work and, in return for the community's support, requiring recipients to utilise the opportunities available to them. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to encourage school leavers who become unemployed to commence job search immediately, the four-week period of grace for education leavers to register with the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) after leaving study will be abolished from October 1989. This means that the standard 13 week deferment period which applies to all education leavers would run from the date of CES registration as long as a claim for benefit was lodged within two weeks of that date. The Bill stresses the importance of job search by providing that, when a young person registers with the CES before finishing school, that registration would date from the last day of school for benefit purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The requirements for payment of unemployment benefit and job search allowance include the need for the client to be actively seeking suitable work. It is often difficult to assess this when that person moves to an area where there are low employment prospects. At present, once a person has moved to such an area, it is usually sufficient for benefit purposes if he or she can demonstrate satisfactory attempts to find work in that area. The Bill turns this situation around in cases where there are no good reasons for making such a move. </PARA>
<PARA> In future, a recipient of unemployment benefit or job search allowance who moves address and reduces his or her employment prospects as a result will have his or her benefit cancelled and, on reapplication, will have to serve a waiting period of 12 weeks. This rule will not apply when the move is to live with or near a family member of the beneficiary. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill would provide for unemployment and sickness benefit to not be payable when the beneficiary does not provide, and will not apply for, a tax file number. At present, unemployment and sickness beneficiaries who fail to supply their tax file number are taxed at the top marginal rate of 50.25 per cent including the Medicare levy. As from November 1989, benefit will not be payable if claimants do not either supply a tax file number or agree to request one from the Australian Taxation Office. Any current beneficiaries who have not supplied a number by the date of effect or who are not prepared to request a tax file number will forfeit their benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, this Bill incorporates minor amendments to strengthen the child support scheme. The special maintenance income concession for pensioners and beneficiaries who are eligible to apply for administratively assessed child support under stage 2 would only be available if an application is made to maximise recurrent cash entitlements under child support assessment legislation. The Child Support (Assessment) Act would ensure that child support agreements, instruments and orders are exempt from State and Territory stamp duties. </PARA>
<PARA> The Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act would be amended to ensure automatic withholding from salary or wages can be effectively and speedily applied in every case when a non-custodial parent defaults-regardless of the date of the order giving rise to the liability. It would also be made clear that automatic withholding can be used by the Child Support Agency to collect arrears of maintenance owing to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pursuant to my contingent notice of motion, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Powell moving a motion to refer certain clauses of the Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report on or before the first sitting day in April 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>It is necessary for this suspension of Standing Orders to be made at this time to ensure that the provisions of the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) which relate to new procedures for the determination of de facto relationships are referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I am seeking this suspension so that this vital issue can be referred to a standing committee of the Senate. It is clearly an essential move. The clauses that are referred to in my motion seek to establish a system of assessment of personal and domestic circumstances and relationships. These clauses and these changes are causing a great deal of concern in the community, which concern has expressed itself by many calls for such action to take place. For instance, those calls come from the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) and, indeed, the councils of social service around Australia which comprise that national body. </PARA>
<PARA> On several occasions ACOSS has specifically asked for a committee reference of this whole question. It first did so when the proposal was mooted some months ago; again when the proposal was introduced by way of legislation when it was debated in the House of Representatives; and again, as recently as last week, on 26 October, when ACOSS was addressing the general question of child poverty and put several significant issues on the record while acknowledging the steps which this Government has taken so far, as well as pointing to the fact that the proposal which is contained in this Bill is:</PARA>
<PARA>likely to scare sole parents out of shared accommodation (the only way of coping for many in today's housing market). </PARA>
<PARA>ACOSS went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It will catch up thousands of innocent people in intrusive bureaucratic procedures, and only add to their confusion and insecurity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! Senator Powell, you are getting on to the subject matter of the debate that you wish to bring on. At the moment you are moving the suspension of Standing Orders. I know it is a very difficult line to draw. I want you to say why this should be brought on now rather than debate the merits of the proposal that you wish to have discussed.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O14">Senator POWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly, Mr Deputy President, I accept your ruling. As I said, the reason for my wanting to bring this on now is that, indeed, the calls for such an inquiry have been longstanding ever since the beginning of the Government's canvassing of this proposal. I simply wanted to demonstrate-and I will do so very briefly-the breadth of that. I simply felt that such a recent call, which was in fact subsequent to the debate in the House of Representatives, from a national body which I think has a fine record of considering social security legislation and helping social security recipients was particularly pertinent. As I said, it does come subsequent to the House of Representatives debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In fact, in my own State of Victoria, a coalition comprising a wide range of groups has made a similar and definite call for a committee reference. All of these organisations have also suggested that, should the Government not accept their call, they certainly would want a very great deal of amendment to the legislation. Again, welfare rights groups around Australia-the Women's Electoral Lobby, the Council for Single Mothers and their Children Inc, the Rural Low Income Network-Victoria, the Social Security Advice Service in Geelong, the Good Shepherd Youth Family Service and the Australian Financial Counselling and Credit Reform Association-have reflected their concerns about this particular proposal, which appears to be ignoring the needs of sole parents in seeking out shared accommodation and the ways in which the needs of sole parents in our community have not been taken into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Similar concerns have been expressed by the Federation of Community Legal Centres, Parents without Partners, the National Union of Sole Parents and, as I said, councils of social service around Australia, and also the Women's Refuge Movement, which is concerned that many women's choices may be limited by this proposal as it stands and even as amended in the House of Representatives and that, for financial reasons and for personal support reasons, women may in fact be less able to move out of potentially violent domestic circumstances. Even the Melbourne Age of Saturday, 14 October, supported a call for this whole very delicate question to be seriously looked at by a committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills has expressed some concerns. Although that Committee often expresses concerns about legislation, and those concerns are addressed by Ministers and accepted or not accepted by the Senate, I would like to point to what those concerns are because, if we are going to believe that it is significantly important to suspend Standing Orders in order to make this reference, I think we should have some idea of the concerns outside the community sector and in our own Scrutiny of Bills Committee. In Alert Digest No. 14 of 1989, which was published last week, the powers of the secretary are queried in that the legislation allows the representatives of the secretary, that is, the Department of Social Security officials in departmental offices around the country, `wide-ranging enquiries into the private lives of pensioners or beneficiaries who reside under the same roof but claim to be living separately'. The Committee notes provisions under certain paragraphs of the legislation, which we believe should be sent to a standing committee for perusal, that place a requirement on the relevant secretary-that is, a representative of the secretary in the Department office. It is stated:</PARA>
<PARA>when forming an opinion that two people are living together in a marriage-like relationship, or for the purpose of defining `de factor spouse' or `married person' to have regard to all the circumstances of the relationship including any sexual relationship between them. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee goes on to say that it is concerned that the provisions may excessively intrude into personal privacy, and that the Minister's opinion has been sought on this point as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Subclause 28 (6) of the legislation is causing a great deal of concern, not least to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. It is a subclause that I do commend to all members of the Senate and, indeed, to any member of the general public who can get hold of it as perhaps the most difficult piece of gobbledegook that I have seen in a long time, from a government which, in the past, has committed itself to framing legislation in a way which makes it accessible to people in the community. I remind the Senate that this is social security legislation. Therefore, surely our goal should be to make it accessible and understandable to social security recipients, among them some of the most disadvantaged people in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> Subclause 28 (6) has three negatives. I hesitate to read it to the Senate but, if nothing else, it will move this chamber to believe that this is an urgent matter: it really should be persuaded by this subclause. It is not worth the time of the Senate to be debating the substance of something which is so difficult to understand. A number of legally trained people, with whom I have been in communication in the last few weeks, are still having trouble. I find no instruction in reading the explanatory memorandum, the second reading speech of the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) or indeed the Hansard record of the House of Representatives debate, which did not mention this at all. Subclause 28 (6) of the Bill reads:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(6) The Secretary must not form the opinion that the pensioner or claimant is not living with the other person in a marriage-like relationship unless, having regard to all of the matters specified in the paragraphs of section 3a, the weight of evidence supports the formation of an opinion that the pensioner or claimant is not living in a marriage-like relationship with the other person. </PARA>
<PARA>The Scrutiny of Bills Committee has expressed concern about this clause. It has said that in its opinion it is difficult to comprehend and the Minister has been asked to comment on that. Finally on this clause, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has expressed concern that it appears that there is some question about the rights of review for claimants because within these provisions it is possible for a claimant to be deemed not to have made a claim. Clarification has been sought on that. As I said, I know that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee often expresses concern, often writes to Ministers asking questions, and then waits for the answers, as does the Senate, but these are among the very concerns expressed out in the community and now being felt by at least one committee of the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! Senator Powell, I know your problem of trying to illustrate why Standing Orders should be suspended so that you can discuss these matters but, rather than making a brief reference to what would have to be discussed, you are now developing a fairly long argument, which will be relevant to your motion if the one before us is passed, rather than to the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy President. All that remains for me to say, as I have done publicly in the past, is that, when there is a range of genuine concerns, the Senate needs to move for investigation, discussion and consultation before passage of the legislation rather than afterwards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I happen to be a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. At the moment we have before us a reference on the debt recovery and information gathering powers of the Department of Social Security. The reason that we have that reference now and that the Committee is spending time on it, after legislation has been passed and after pain has been caused in the community, is that we legislated before we investigated. Sections 162 and 164 of this legislation were amended to give powers which raised concern in the community in 1987 and in 1988, and in May this year the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee was asked to investigate those provisions. It seems that the credibility of the Government-and indeed of the Parliament-is at risk if it continues down this track of ignoring the people in the community who are working at the coalface; passing legislation regardless of those expressions of concern; and refusing to have that legislation properly investigated, to have a vital and sensitive issue, which this one is, properly discussed. It seems to me a bit like the case of Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother: `Everything will be all right but maybe down the track, if enough pain is caused, we will send it off to a Senate committee'. As I say, that committee already has a reference which probably it would never have had if we had seriously addressed earlier the issues of debt recovery and information gathering. The Australian Democrats are putting to the Senate that we should not go ahead with that part of the legislation dealing with the sensitive matter of determination of de facto relationships before there has been adequate consultation-and there has not been in this instance-and before the very difficult areas are investigated. The list that is being inserted in this legislation is not exhaustive, nor should it be because it is a very sensitive, very personal and very individual area. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not see how the Government is advancing what is a difficult area which is not being terribly well handled at the moment. We subscribe to the view that there are other ways of tackling this-that better administrative guidelines, better resourcing and better training of people who have to make the decision in spite of this legislation would be a better way to go about it. We submit that this Senate should at this point in the debate remove certain parts of the legislation so that we can then open up for consultation the serious issue that is before us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon we are confronted with a motion to suspend Standing Orders on the basis of the urgency to clarify and defer a matter for further and wider consultation. The Government needs to make three points in response to this. Those points are based very much on questioning the urgency of the need for deferral. I acknowledge that Senator Powell's concern may be honestly based, but we must respond to that concern by ensuring that the urgency and the reasons put forward for it are clarified in the minds of many people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first point is that the Government's intention in this area was announced some 6 1/2 months ago. At that particular time the Australian Democrats made their position very clear. Senator Powell indicated that she would oppose the legislation. In a press release of 7 August, Senator Powell said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats will oppose Government legislation on de facto relationships when it comes before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats have a clear position. There is no reason why that position could not have been expressed in the normal course of events when the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1989 came before the Parliament. But we have an expression of urgency this afternoon which, I must say, is not all that well founded. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the urgency of the consultation, Senator Powell, in the same statement of 7 August, indicated that she had written to all women Federal parliamentarians urging them to oppose the move in their party meetings and in the Parliament. It should be placed on record that consultation does not start and end with the Australian Democrats. The Australia Labor Party Caucus, as well as a number of Caucus committees, has considered the issues very closely. The status of women committee is one group that Senator Powell has targeted. The community service and welfare committee and the sole parents working group have considered the matter over some length of time. I am pleased to say that they have consulted, and are consulting, outside organisations and that they do not express the same degree of concern that Senator Powell expressed this afternoon. They are satisfied with the Government's intention. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell has had plenty of time to make up her mind. She had made up her mind some months ago. To defer this matter to a committee at this stage is just to stagnate the process of decision making. The case for urgency is based on a number of premises about how people's lives would be affected once this Parliament passes the legislation. In order to resolve that uncertainty, that case for urgency, it is important to go to some of the points raised by Senator Powell about which she was quite agitated. The legislation, in part, under clause 25, inserts a list of indicators to be considered and taken into account by the Department of Social Security in each case when deciding whether a marriage-like relationship exists. This list is contained in proposed section 3a. The list essentially codifies the law as it is laid down by the Federal Court in Tang's case, which has been in operation for some time. The law laid down by the courts implements a policy that people who live as if they are married should not be advantaged as against people who are married. It therefore requires decision makers to consider all the practical elements of a relationship to decide whether a person is single or not. </PARA>
<PARA> Some concern has been expressed-and, as a result, some urgency-that the legislation is rigid in its application of the principles of Tang. As I said, the legislation essentially codifies existing law, because the Government does see a need for the legislation to provide a clearer decision-making process than the current law. Essentially, that is because some of the interpretations of the current law really need to be taken account of at this stage by the Senate. For example, proposed subsection 3a (a) (ii) refers to:</PARA>
<PARA>any significant pooling of financial resources especially in relation to major financial commitments;</PARA>
<PARA>That compares with the case law, which would look to any pooling of financial resources; not limited to `significant' pooling nor to emphasis on `major' financial commitments. So if Senator Powell is concerned about the urgency of the legislation, her concern may be coming from the wrong direction. The legislation, at proposed subsection 3a (a) (iv), looks at the basis of sharing day-to-day expenses, not merely whether there is any sharing of expenses, as the existing case law dictates. </PARA>
<PARA> Some concern has also been expressed that some of the paragraphs of proposed section 3a are of no assistance in the decision making. Taken on their own, that may well be right as regards any particular case coming before a decision maker. Proposed section 3a provides for objective, thorough decision making, taking all relevant facts into account. So in some cases some of those criteria will be relevant and in other cases they may not. The proposed legislation will improve the primary decision making by the Department. The urgency that Senator Powell expresses about what it does is not well-founded. </PARA>
<PARA> I go on to other parts of the provisions about which there is said to be urgency. Currently, the legislation requires an officer merely to determine whether a de facto relationship exists, with nothing more. Decision making is often arbitrary and can be inconsistent. On the other hand, if officers are expressly required to make their decision by looking at the indicators listed in the proposed Act, then by turning their minds to each indicator we will get more consistency and less arbitrariness in decision making. That covers the first part of Senator Powell's urgency motion. </PARA>
<PARA> As regards the second part of the motion, clause 28 seeks to insert a new section 43a into the Act. That section will deal with three matters. First, it deals with the obligation of pensioners and claimants to provide information. Secondly, it specifies a clear decision-making process. Third, it repeals the arbitrary disqualification of some pensioners. It also limits investigations into domestic circumstances. All this concern and agitation about more intrusiveness by the legislation is really not well-founded. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions relating to obligations to provide information change the existing law, contained in section 163 of the Social Security Act, in three respects. First, the existing law overrides common law privileges. One of those privileges is the privilege against self-incrimination. It would have been urgent and subject to grave consideration by the Parliament if that sort of situation were allowed to continue. But the Bill we are talking about, which is said to be so urgent, does not allow that situation to continue. In recognition of the sensitivity of this area, proposed section 43a does not override privilege. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the existing law provides no procedural protections. It limits the imposing of obligations to notify `any matter that might affect the payment of a pension'. In contrast, one of the concerns that Senator Powell has with proposed section 43a is that it is limited to operating when specific objective facts exist and that there is not such a broad provision under it. In fact, individuals will be protected under proposed section 43a more than they are under the existing law. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, section 163 (2) of the existing law provides for pensioners to be obliged to notify matters by a written form. We are saying that that is a bit too rigid: a pensioner can comply with the requirement in the future through an interview rather than by filling out a form. That is the first part of this area of urgency and concern. I am sure that Senator Powell would agree that that is not as real as she might have thought it to be. </PARA>
<PARA> The second feature of proposed section 43a is the prescription of a decision-making process, which is vital and important. As to whether it provides certainty to people out there who, Senator Powell claims, might be concerned about further intrusiveness, a prescribed decision-making process can only assist against intrusiveness. That is what the second part of this particular section does. By imparting these more rigid and visible decision-making processes, we can be sure that decisions that are made on the evidence and in accordance with the criteria will be able to stand up to scrutiny. Let us acknowledge that intrusiveness is not going to be a real problem there. Basically, the legislation lays the groundwork for much more objective, less arbitrary and less intrusive decision making. When this new legislation becomes law, interviews in the home about the details of domestic circumstances will not occur. Instead, decisions can be based upon office based interviews and reviews. Further, we can be sure that decision making will be much more careful and consistent with regard to the detailed facts of each case and to set-down criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by going to the third feature of the legislation which is said to be urgent. Clause 24 (g) relates to the repeal or arbitrary disqualification from sole parent pension of people separated under the one roof after six or 12 months. The Government is providing a tight but fair decision-making process, which enables the repeal of this particular rule. Once again, far from urgent intrusiveness, we are striking a very good balance between fairness, equity and responsibility of government to ensure that government resources are spent appropriately. We also recognise by the legislation that domestic circumstances of sole parent pensioners can change over time. Proposed subsections 43a (13) and (14) would limit further investigations in certain circumstances and would ensure that reviews can take place after 12 weeks rather than at any particular time, unless there has been a substantial change of circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> I can go on. Other protections in the Bill will protect against intrusiveness and give more certainty to people. In summary, we have not had presented to us any case for this matter to be considered as urgent. The issues canvassed this afternoon can be canvassed when the Bill comes up in Parliament at the appropriate time. I am sure that that will not be more than a few weeks away. In the meantime, it probably would be appropriate for people who get representations to spell out some of the provisions as they would operate and not to approach this legislation as if we were approaching something new, something in a vacuum, but to acknowledge, firstly, that there is currently operating case law that dictates how departments work and how governments operate and interpret the legislation and, secondly, that this legislation gives certainty, clarity and a fair degree of definition to the criteria on which decisions have to be based, as well as to the decision-making processes. There is no case for urgency. I am sure we will have this debate again when the Bill is considered by the Senate, perhaps next week. In closing, I say that I can quite understand that Senator Powell's concerns in this area may be honestly based, but it probably behoves a lot of people in the community to approach this legislation with a calm mind rather than becoming hysterical about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on the question of urgency of the matter, and opposing the suspension of Standing Orders, the Opposition is of the view that this area of law is one which has been perpetually complex and confused. The legislation which is proposed to be introduced amounts to a statutory code which will make the definition question of de facto relationship-now referred to as a marriage-like relationship-more certain. The question of urgency concerns the fact that if a committee had been established, it would have held up the operation of the legislation, which is due to come into effect on 1 January 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Quite clearly the relevant sections of the Bill are clauses 24, 25 and 28. Clause 24 of the Bill provides a new definition of a de facto relationship. Clause 25 embodies new sections of the principal Act which will require certain aspects to be taken into consideration; namely, financial aspects of the relationship; the nature of the household task and arrangements; social aspects; sexual relationship and the nature of the commitment to each other. Clause 28, which proposes a further amendment to the Act, sets out quite clearly three absolute criteria which must be established on the facts, plus one of several others, which would mean that four criteria had to be established before the Secretary was required to ask for information. </PARA>
<PARA> The questions that have been raised in deputations that have resulted from the proposed legislation do have some real basis in what one might describe as a worst case scenario. It is for exactly that reason that the shadow Minister has sought from, and been given by, the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) an assurance that the review procedures would be applied fairly and that the person seeking review of a previous decision would be entitled to receive benefits until the outcome of the review. Further, the shadow Minister in the other place has said that we give a commitment that, if necessary, we will review the legislation upon coming to government and ensure that it is applied with fairness. Accordingly, if the motion moved by Senator Powell were to be agreed to, it would simply delay the introduction of the legislation and really serve no good purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell drew particular attention to the requirement that the Secretary is obliged to make a determination that a relationship is not in fact a de facto relationship only if the information supplied sustains that decision. It is further provided in the proposed legislation that it is prohibited to provide fraudulent or misleading information upon which the Secretary would make that decision. </PARA>
<PARA> There is general concern in the community that the existing system has been subject to abuse. Indeed, there has been growth in the number of people who are in receipt of the benefit. I think the projected figure is for an increase of 4.9 per cent for the current financial year. There is a good deal of concern that there is a need to tighten up the criteria upon which the benefit is paid. It is important to point out that it is a benefit conferred; it is not a right which is sought to be exercised. I think that that decision is important, particularly in light of some comments which are being made that somehow the onus of proof is being reversed, when in fact the onus of proof is something which belongs in criminal law. When we are dealing with civil law we are concerned with the balance of probabilities. I think it is important to remember that it is a benefit conferred to those who are in genuine need and not a right which people seek to exercise. Accordingly, I do not feel that Senator Powell has been able to establish urgency. It would in no way serve to benefit people who need to have access to the benefit, because the legislation makes the law more certain. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has decided to debate together Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1989-90, Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1989-90 and Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1989-90 which make up the Government's Budget for this financial year. No-one can enter this debate without feeling concern for the situation in which we are considering the Budget: a nation deeply in debt and going further into debt each month under a Labor Government that promises so much and then which does not deliver ever, at all; a nation burdened with record bankruptcies, where people cannot start or succeed with businesses; a nation facing interest rates above 20 per cent-interest rates which mean that the dream of owning a home recedes for many, including many Australians already in a home which they would like to own. We have the spectacle of people losing their homes and of a generation of young Australians despairing of ever owning one. We have the unsavoury spectacle of a government either unable or unwilling to fix the damage it has caused and created.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We hear a lot about the technicalities of the economic malaise and disaster that surround us today. Most of us do not really follow the jargon, the language, the arcane reasoning of economists. Too often it is just so much complicated nonsense. We understand simpler things. We know that we are not doing well as a nation. We know that more of our pay is now going into enormous mortgages. We know that our rents get higher and that our taxes increase. Every time we look around there is another Labor Government grab or another Labor Government withdrawal of benefit. Our children are having more trouble with enormous interest rates payable on their car loans. Their Bankcards cost them the earth to service. They are being laid off from their jobs as a result of a disastrous and unresolved pilots strike. </PARA>
<PARA> Yes, we know what it is like in real life even if we do not understand the jargon of the economists. Through it all this Labor Government seems either not to know what to do or to do things which just do not work. Then it tells us crazy things and it expects us to believe them. It expects that we should not be worried that two reputable rating agencies say that Australia under Labor is less creditworthy than it was. Why should we not worry? The Government tells us that high interest rates, which are part of its economic program, which are driving us to the wall, are good for us. Why should we believe that? The Government tells us that record international debt obligations do not matter. Why should we believe that? We know that the Government is wrong. A friend of mine who is a leading toy retailer in Australia-I would say the leading toy retailer-tells me that sales at this moment are down 30 per cent on last year. They are down because people have less money, people are less prosperous and they just do not believe that they are well enough off to be buying luxuries like toys for their children. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget, which forms the basis for this debate, sets out how the Government thinks it will approach things this financial year, and a threadbare and sorry effort it is, too. It is already clear that it is not working. Here it is October and we are almost four months into the financial year. Tomorrow is the end of the month, and that will be one-third of the financial year gone. We already know that the Budget program will not work. We already know that our debt is becoming greater and greater-not less. </PARA>
<PARA> We already know that inflation is worse. The figures given last week show that it is back above 8 per cent. We already know that we have lower creditworthiness. We already know that we have higher interest rates, and God knows where they are going to end. We already know that there is more misery around the country, that there is less certainty and more failure. Through it all, the Government says that it is a wonderful Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a pleasure to support the amendment moved by my colleague Senator Stone, which makes these matters explicit, in elegant economists' language. It is a pleasure to go further and remind Australians that we have an alternative government, that we have an alternative program and that there is another way to go. We have an Opposition which is now invigorated and renewed-and whole, particularly after the weekend-which stands ready to redress wrongs, to offer hope and succour, which stands ready to reward enterprise, to reward opportunity, to increase opportunity and to promise those who wish to strive that they will be allowed to succeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has now released its blueprint, a document which the Government has not dented or damaged. It is a document of hope which points the way to a better future. We know that the Labor Government in its desperation might steal some of the elements of our package. Well, the Government is welcome. Should it do so, people will see that as one more piece of evidence of the intellectual sterility and administrative incompetence of this Labor Administration. It has the smell of death about it, it is on the way out, and we cannot get an election quickly enough. </PARA>
<PARA> I use the opportunity that this debate presents to turn to some more detailed and specialised matters. I do not intend to use my time in this second reading debate to reconsider all the matters dealt with in the Estimates committees. I might mention one or two of them later in committee. For example, I might well wish to discuss further the case of Mr Young, the homosexual man who was so badly, inappropriately and callously treated in the Royal Canberra Hospital. However, that will be a matter for the committee debate. I trust that some of my colleagues will want to take up his case with me. </PARA>
<PARA> I now want to develop some matters related to my specialist interests and background in medical service delivery. I will discuss first some of the ways in which we conceptualise hospital services and why there is such disarray today. We all know that Labor's Medicare has produced quite perverse results. Public hospital beds are less available for the less advantaged now than they were before we had Medicare. That is one of the perverse results that Medicare has produced. Generally, public hospital beds are not readily available for those people seeking to redeem Labor's promise, made when Medicare first appeared, that we could all have access to public hospital beds if we wished. We cannot have access-that is the truth of the matter. This is one more promise by Labor that has been and is being dishonoured every day in every part of Australia. There are not enough beds for admissions of people with non-urgent illness, especially once the hospitals have been filled up with trauma victims, the victims of accidents that come in each weekend. </PARA>
<PARA> It has never been easy to find a bed in a public hospital in Australia. Once, many years ago, I was for a period the admitting officer of a large teaching hospital. Actually, I was the non-admitting officer-my job was to keep people out of the hospital. My job was to fit admissions to the number of beds that we had empty, not to fit admissions to the needs of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor's promise was that things would improve with Medicare, that all that would change, that people by paying their levy could look to the availability of a public hospital bed if they needed it. People have tried to redeem that promise, but they cannot. Things have actually become worse. They have become worse for a number of reasons. The Labor governments previously in power in New South Wales and Labor governments here in Canberra forced a quite unnecessary confrontation with members of the medical profession and drove nurses by the thousands out of the hospital system. Yes, things are much worse now. My old hospital, once the pride of that part of Sydney where it is located, now has beds closed and empty, in true Sir Humphrey style, and has queues at the door. Sir Humphrey Appleby would like it because, after all, empty beds require less maintenance and less administrative support and do not require nurses or resident medical officers. Empty beds mean that fewer meals are required, that big drug bills are not required and that investigations are not required. As Sir Humphrey Appleby said, `Keep the hospital empty and you will keep the costs down'. However, that is not very good for the community. Things are worse and we have all been cheated by the undelivered promises of Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA> This leads me to the question of what can be done. We know this is the situation, but what can we do? This is not just a theoretical matter to be solved by armchair experts. It becomes a crisis if I am ill or if one of my loved ones is ill, if we cannot then find a bed when one is needed. One obvious answer might be to look for a bed in a private hospital, and that is what used to happen. But even there the scene is one of chaos. It is a scene of betrayed hopes and broken dreams. The Labor Government has moved relentlessly on several fronts to make it less and less possible for private hospitals in Australia to survive, much less to prosper. </PARA>
<PARA> It has done this in a number of ways. It has taken away the $40 per day bed subsidy to private hospitals, it has reduced the reinsurance fund, which helps share costs for certain chronically ill people, from $125m five years ago to $1m last year, and it has reduced the rebate on Medicare that can be claimed for services in hospitals from 85 per cent of the schedule fee to 75 per cent of the schedule fee. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is it that it is only the helping professions that are being asked by the Labor Government to take cuts in their income at the present time-only doctors and pharmacists? What has the Government got against doctors and pharmacists? Can it not understand why they are so angry about these moves? Labor's promise might have been acceptable. It might have been acceptable action had we understood that we have a socialist government and a Minister who identifies himself as a socialist health Minister. It might have been acceptable had there been a surfeit of public hospital beds, because in that case the promise could have been redeemed. It might have been acceptable had there been unused public bed capacity-and I mean in the large cities, as that is what I know best. It might have been acceptable had there been a sufficiency of public hospital beds, or had there been the possibility of meeting the urgent and legitimate needs of citizens as those arose. </PARA>
<PARA> However, such is not the case. There is not a sufficiency of beds. It is not possible to meet the needs of citizens as they arise. The public hospital systems do not deliver accommodation for all who need it. Private hospitals are therefore, of necessity, one of the main locations of alternative care. Yet, as I say, this Government has moved in several ways to make it less and less possible for private hospitals to survive at all. Altered tax and levy arrangements have meant that fewer and fewer Australians carry insurance cover for the cost of private hospital accommodation. In the last few years the percentage of Australians carrying that extra insurance cover has dropped from something above 70 per cent to something under 50 per cent. So 20 per cent of the Australian population have opted out of private health insurance. Twenty per cent more people now rely on that smaller number of public hospital beds. The 20 per cent who dropped out were the young and healthy. I will mention them again in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Altered co-payment systems have further reduced the viability of some public hospitals. The submissions that have been presented to the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance, on which I serve, have not been made public and, therefore, they have not been released. However, one of the submissions consists of a paper which was presented in September at a conference of Australian health economists and is, therefore, a public document. The submission was written by Dr R. B. Scotton from Monash University who is well known as one of the architects of Labor's health policies in the 1970s. In respect of the present system, Dr Scotton says:</PARA>
<PARA>The major problem of Medicare is the difficulty faced by many patients in gaining access to free public hospital care, as evidenced by long waiting lists for certain types of treatment in most capital cities. There is some evidence that waiting lists are again tending to grow, despite attempts by state and federal governments to contain them. It is an ironic feature of the Medicare program-and a potential source of long-term weakness-that its capacity to deliver its most important promised benefit depends on a substantial proportion of the population opting not to avail itself of it. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Scotton is saying that for Medicare to succeed we need substantial numbers of Australians able and willing to use the private hospital sector. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Excess demand for public treatment is associated with a decline in private insurance coverage, which is down from 49.1% of the population in December 1985 to 46.2% in December 1988. The slide does not appear to be slowing, which indicates that the system is not in stable equilibrium. </PARA>
<PARA>The word `not' is underlined by Dr Scotton. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The trend away from private insurance has been exacerbated by several factors which have combined to an increase in the price of private health insurance premiums which has far outstripped general price rises. </PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on to talk in economic terms. The situation has been exacerbated further by some new arrangements for day care arrangements which are sensible in concept but still imperfect in detail and which have added further problems for the private hospital sector. The viability of our private hospitals-which is essential, as Dr Scotton said, if the whole system is to work-depends on and is related to questions of payment, of cash and subsidy. This seems to be where much, but not all, of the problem lies. If the cash is not going to be available, another set of questions arise. Those questions are: can we do more and can we do better with the same funds? First, we have dealt and continue to deal too much with inputs, with the result that we end up with incremental budgeting on an historical basis. This is no way to reform a system. It is no way to get better outcomes. It is no way to do better with the same money. </PARA>
<PARA> Without developing this complex subject in too much detail, let me suggest that it is now time for us to move to hospital funding based on outputs or outcomes, to provide more money for better or more complex provision of care and to provide less money for simpler, less complicated provision of care. There are some mechanisms by which this approach is being developed, but it needs more development. If carried through, there could be an alteration in activity undertaken, in funding for private hospitals and in the possibilities for new vigour and new development. Let me suggest further that while the levels of insurance cover and cash payments are important, they are not the most critical factors in the viability and future of private hospitals. They are important but they are not the only factors. The most critically important factor is the quality of the care and the facilities which are available. </PARA>
<PARA> We have in Sydney at least three outstandingly good private hospitals. Other capital cities have a corresponding number of good facilities, too. But in Sydney, if one is ill and one wants private care, one thinks immediately of St Vincent's Private Hospital, the Sydney Adventist Hospital and Baulkham Hills Private Hospital. Each of them is different from the other two in some or several major ways. But each shares a reputation for quality of facilities and quality of services. I put it to honourable senators that at a time of need this is what will influence people. I will go where quality care is available. If I were suffering a common or garden problem, I would certainly look for high quality care in a high quality institution, whether it be public or private. If I had a rare or complicated condition, at present I would seek care in a teaching hospital. But that does not mean that for the usual run of conditions I would be unhappy in seeking care from a private hospital. I would not be unhappy. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise this matter because the debate in Australia is not about quality, it is not about outcomes but, like so much of the medical services debate, it is mostly about inputs of money. I think we can do better. I want a better debate and, consistent with my long-time advocacy of program budgeting, I believe that the quality and relevance of that debate is linked closely with an increasing concentration on outcomes. That in turn means that I look closely at the range and quality of services and that I am concerned about the range and quality of data on which decision making must be based. </PARA>
<PARA> That leads me for a few moments to think a little about health insurance. I am, with five other senators, a member of the select committee which is presently looking at this matter. I have to say that I have some difficulties with some of the basic concepts underlying voluntary health insurance in Australia. These difficulties are added to the question of double payment. Most people say, `We have to pay our levy; why should we then, in addition, pay voluntary health insurance?'. People get the idea that they are paying double. Such health insurance as we have is based on the concept of community rating. This, of course, is a form of taxation of the young and healthy to pay for the medical costs of the elderly and the ill. </PARA>
<PARA> I said a few moments ago that it was the young and healthy who have dropped out of health insurance. They are the very people who are needed to make the system viable. The trade-off, of course, is that the young will become elderly in time and will then, in theory, benefit in their turn from community rating. But there are several flaws on community rating. It requires a very high rate of coverage across the community. Further, it requires what is euphemistically called `insurance'-one might wonder whether health insurance is insurance-to be taken out by many people whose need for services is predictable and inevitable. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give an example. My secretary and personal assistant of 20 years now receives the invalid pension because she is looking after and caring for her husband who has severe, crippling and destructive rheumatoid arthritis. He is not, and has not been for years, an insurance proposition in the sense that we use that term. He has been a dead cert high cost drawer on the health insurance pool. We all know that. Yet, under the community rating rules and assuming that he has been insured, it is required that he and many like him with equivalent disabling illnesses have access to community rating at the same rates and with almost the same rights of access and portability as young healthy people. This is one of the reasons young people I know-people who are already required to pay their levy-will not pay what they consider to be excessive premiums for extra private health insurance cover. You know and I know, Mr Acting Deputy President, that they may well need it because the public hospital system cannot deliver them the beds on which they depend. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course the matter is not simple. Any course one takes in trying to set down rules for private health insurance will have costs and benefits. For example, some people-not me-might propose a simple move from community rating to risk rating. I am not one of those people. The price of moving to risk rating is too high-that is, the cost in fairness and equity would be too high, so we cannot go down the road of risk rating. If it were applied with cold purity, it would mean that the insurance costs for the elderly increased severalfold. This is too much and market forces would then see the elderly abandoning health insurance in droves and see them left with no cover and getting no access to care as the public hospitals would be even less able to give them the access they needed. </PARA>
<PARA> Until our Committee hears detailed argument from witnesses, I favour some variance of the old `special account' rule which operated when I was in medical practice. That rule allowed the Commonwealth to pick up and subsidise the costs of certain high cost patients who were not insurance propositions, particularly some of the elderly with chronic illnesses. Under that system we identified people who were chronically ill and who were not then candidates for community rating and removed them from the pool. We bore their expenses as a community. That then seemed to me to be a fair, efficient and reasonable way to go and it still seems a fair way to go. It was certainly a better system then than we now have. The present system passes the costs of these people back to the general body of insurees, with little public assistance. For that reason it is in favour with and has the approval of the Department of Finance and the Department of the Treasury. They are delighted to see costs pass back to the public and to minimise the amount of public underwriting that has to be done by the Commonwealth. It may also be in favour with those who would like to see the costs of health insurance kept beyond the reach of many but it is not in keeping with those who are concerned about equity and fairness. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing I would like to see is more lateral thinking around the possibilities offered by the concept of capitation as a form of payment-as one choice. I do not favour some of the capitation schemes I know or in which I have worked, but I am impressed by some others. I am thinking of the health maintenance organisations that I have seen in North America. The advantages of these could include fewer visits, more emphasis on health promotion, lower drug bills, and less use of hospital services-all desirable things if the quality and the level of care remains. In addition, it would sit well in a mixed system alongside fee-for-service medicine, so offering even greater choice for consumers like me and my family. </PARA>
<PARA> We will have to take some policy decisions about those aged 65 or more who decide at that age that they wish to take out private health insurance. Medibank Private already has exclusion clauses related to new enrollees aged 65 or more, but we will have to go about it in a very logical way. These people can claim rights under Medicare if they have not contributed to the insurance pool up to the age of 65, but then a real question arises as to whether they should be able to enrol for all the benefits only at the age when they are likely to represent a call upon the funds and we know that most of the calls are from the elderly. We need to decide whether to subsidise their access and by how much. </PARA>
<PARA> Questions about pre-existing illness also need careful attention. Perhaps there should be exclusions for pre-existing illness, perhaps for several years, on those who come in with pre-existing conditions. These things will be necessary if we really wish to make health insurance viable, attractive and successful. We then have to devise better strategies for encouraging the young to join and for convincing the middle-aged to join and contribute before they are old. Getting the insurance formula wrong has high costs. It discourages further doctors already under seige and dispirited with low morale and feeling the assault of a Labor Government in Canberra and a former Labor Government in New South Wales. Getting it wrong would lead to even more inadequate hospitals, with wards closed, a distorted range of illness represented, no places left for those who depend on the Medicare levy alone and a staff with a low and dropping morale. It would lead to unfairness, not just the perception of unfairness, but its reality. It would lead to a poorer range of offerings and to lower quality services and facilities in private hospitals. If we get it wrong it will lead to fewer private hospitals for a community in which elective illness is too often just not treated properly. As a principle, surely we would all agree that delay in treating the routine things-cataracts, enlarged prostates, hernias, heart failure, delays in offering palliative care-is immoral. Such delays are a denial of what the Labor Party has been pleased to refer to as rights to care. That is what is happening today. There is that denial of care for those conditions. It is a shame and it is not good enough. We can do better. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party's economic statement has shown as a first instalment how we would go about it. Our health insurance policy is yet to appear, but it will carry the promise of relief, the message of hope, one stage further. We in the Liberal Party stand ready to resume the tasks and responsibilities of national government. We cannot have it happen soon enough and Australia will be a better country if we do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate on the Appropriation Bills gives one a chance to talk about general economic issues and the opportunity to raise issues of concern with regard to specific appropriations. Therefore, I will refer to some matters of macro-economic policy. Within that context, I will also comment on the issue of the adequacy and timeliness of the statistics which serve as the basis for official economic decision-making. I will also make some comments about the overseas aid budget-its quantity, quality, and the priorities within it-and proposals to cut further the already meagre budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to questions of macro-economic policy, there is a significant contrast between the policies of the Government and the Opposition. The contrast is not as it has been publicly presented and I would like to comment on some of those contrasts. With regard to fiscal policy, the prevailing analysis is essentially correct. There will be no significant tightening of fiscal policy under the declared policies of the Opposition. The macro-economic implications of the increases in the deficit are nil. It is possible to argue that there is a hidden agenda, that Messrs Hewson and Stone in a second Budget would be given their head to cut much more savagely. Certain indicators of their underlying attitude would indicate that that may be so. However, if we take their comments at face value, as also the policies they espouse, we can see that the fiscal policy differences are minor. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to wages policy, the difference is much more significant. The Government has an established, working wages policy which has delivered wage restraint for seven years while delivering increased household disposable income because that wage restraint has been the basis on which more jobs have been able to be created. This is where one of the areas of dramatic contrast arises. Under the proposed Liberal-National Party policy the preconditions for a wage blow-out for some workers-those in strong bargaining positions-would be enhanced, but workers in the less advantageous market position might get no increases at all or possibly even cuts in their wages. If the policy was to deliver an increase in wages, it would lead to increasing unemployment and consequent falling household disposable income. This would also create graver inequities and divide Australia in a way that a similar policy has divided Britain. </PARA>
<PARA> As a matter of interest, once unemployment went up, taxation revenue would start to fall, government outlays would start to rise and the Budget surplus so painstakingly built up would continue to be eroded. Of course, the policy might have some magical method of achieving its declared aim of making wage increases occur only at the same rate as productivity. The process by which this is to be delivered is not apparent and it has not been discovered anywhere in the world. Even if there is such a magic wand, one thing is certain: There is no element of the magic wand which could make rapid increases in productivity per employee. Mr Howard on the weekend confirmed that quite correctly. The only exception to that rule is unemployment. Unemployment could increase the productivity of those workers still in employment as capital labour ratios change. But unless unemployment increases, wage increases would be substantially less than inflation if the exclusively productivity-based wage increases espoused by the Opposition were to be achieved. By whatever method, household disposable income would fall. I believe that the real outcome would be a wage blow-out for the strong and a wage cut for the weak, increasing unemployment, falling household disposable income, social division and inequity, and a consequential slackening of fiscal policy, which is quite the opposite of what is predicted at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> In commenting on the so-called third arm of economic reform, namely, micro-economic reform, I should like to quote from a book entitled Making Economic Policy in Australia 1983-88 by Michael Keating and Geoff Dixon. At page IX of that book the authors say:</PARA>
<PARA>This book examines the Labor Government's response to the economic challenges in the period 1983-1988. The centrepiece of that response has been, in effect, a package of measures involving reductions in real wages, although not household disposable incomes, a Commonwealth budget surplus for the first time in 35 years for which comparable records have been kept and the floating of the exchange rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Taken individually each of these developments was of historic significance. As a package they represented a quite major redirection of economic policy, even by international standards. The package was moreover accompanied by a number of other significant changes in microeconomic policy: reductions in tariff and quota protection; major tax reforms; moves to put government enterprises on a more commercial basis, together with encouragement of improved work practices, pay systems and training, which is potentially of great long term significance. </PARA>
<PARA>Together with the proposed deregulation of the airline industry, the reviews of the primary industries, and the reports and recommendations on coastal shipping and waterfront reform, this constitutes the most comprehensive package of micro-economic reform ever achieved in Australia. This is not to say that the process is over; it is simply to say that the process described by Keating and Dixon as `bargained consensus', that is, negotiated agreement between affected interest groups to achieve agreed processes of change, provides the only real basis for lasting micro-economic reform. If time permits, I hope to return later to other micro-economic reform issues. </PARA>
<PARA> The other arm of domestic macro-economic policy is monetary policy, which I have deliberately left until last. A lot of attention has been focused on this subject. In fact, the allegation has been made by the Opposition that this is the only weapon which the Government is using to restrain demand. Quite clearly, the evidence of a tight fiscal policy and wage restraint points to the contrary. However, it is true that monetary policy has been what I would describe as the swing variable-the mechanism which is capable of being adjusted once fiscal and wages policies are as tight as can reasonably be achieved. The Opposition implicitly endorses this by a fiscal policy no tighter than that of the Government and a wages policy that will probably in effect be much slacker. </PARA>
<PARA> In these circumstances monetary policy does not have the capacity to be varied independently of the parameters of fiscal and wages policy. Certainly in the short term no micro-economic reform changes will have any impact on the level of monetary policy. There is no micro-economic reform initiative which could affect monetary policy in any way within any reasonable timetable that would, for example, affect the legitimate concerns of Australians who are aspiring to buy or maintain payments on their homes. For this reason the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has said correctly that the so-called economic statement of the Liberal and National parties is a recipe for higher interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> A second and disturbing element exists within the area of monetary policy. The language of the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), bears an awful similarity to that of the pre-1979 Thatcher Conservative Party. The shadow Treasurer's reference to medium term monetary targets is the language of Thatcherism and monetarism-a policy which has failed around the world and which will fail in Australia. The only problem with it is that the price of its failure tends to be paid not by its advocates but by the weakest in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> My outlining the manner in which I believe the Government's economic strategy is superior to that of the Opposition is not sufficient to establish the view-and I do not wish to pretend otherwise-that there is no more to be done. A large number of issues need to be addressed. For example, obviously any country with significant problems of debt and balance of payments and with an inflation rate that is higher than that of its trading partners must continue to focus primarily on economic management, which I believe will be the key policy issue in the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to one key variable to which attention needs to be given and which for the first time is beginning to be addressed, namely, savings. There is some evidence that the savings ratio in Australia has been rising. The Budget Papers appear to support that view. Nevertheless, it is obvious from the need for capital inflow to finance Australian investment that Australian savings are too low. We do not want to achieve a balance between savings and investment by a dramatic reduction in the level of investment. Therefore, we must concentrate on increasing the level of savings within the country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget appears to indicate that the principal source of increase in the national savings effort has come from public sector savings, that is, from the Government's outstanding performance in restraining expenditure and turning a large deficit into a record surplus. This makes the Opposition's policy on capital gains tax very hard to understand. For no apparent economic reason other than a pathological opposition to requiring its major contributors to pay tax, the Opposition is proposing to abolish capital gains tax and to hand back $450m a year of money that is legitimately paid by those people who earn their income as capital gains. In effect, that covers the top one per cent of income earners in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> What is more, the Opposition is advocating or pretending that this policy is being adopted to provide an incentive to people to change their savings and investment habits. I believe that the policy would be ineffective in that regard. If that is the real and underlying reason for the decision, it is very hard to understand why the Opposition is introducing this policy with retrospective effect, on all capital purchases dating from 1985. It is impossible to believe that even the Liberal Party would expect its rorted tax changes to have a retrospective effect on people's attitudes, that is, to affect purchasing and investment decisions made by people in 1985. It is no more than a handout to the wealthy at the expense of ordinary Australians who pay their taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> A key element of a proper savings strategy must be continued emphasis on superannuation. The Government has given proper and continuing emphasis to this both as a necessary element of its retirement incomes policy and as a process of generating savings by Australians. The example of what has occurred in Singapore and in other countries demonstrates the tremendous potential of widespread superannuation to generate substantial savings. Of course, not all money flowing into superannuation will be a net gain to savings. Some of the money flowing into superannuation would have been saved elsewhere by the individuals concerned, and another portion would have been driven by taxation incentives, which reduce public sector savings. Nevertheless, it appears that superannuation has the potential to generate an enormous increase in domestic savings in Australia and, therefore, to provide a substantially enhanced savings pool to fund Australian investment. </PARA>
<PARA> The increase and extension of the coverage of superannuation has substantial equity and social justice implications. I do not have time to consider those here, but they are outlined comprehensively in the retirement incomes policy statement of the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe), which was released at the same time as the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to superannuation, other countries have taken radical steps to increase savings. A wide range of measures have been adopted in a number of countries. For example, the Swedish Government has for many years pursued a voluntary savings scheme in association with its taxation collections. A Bill that was introduced into the Swedish Parliament in May 1989 contained a proposal to extend that voluntary savings scheme to a compulsory or obligatory savings scheme that required individuals and companies to deposit the equivalent of 4 per cent of income tax payable for the period September 1989 to 31 December 1990 into an interest bearing account for repayment in 1992 and 1993. If that legislation was passed, it was expected that obligatory savings would total about $2.7 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very controversial proposal and far beyond anything that I would suggest needs to be undertaken in Australia. However, it is an indication that a wider array of measures than those that are used in Australia to date is available and that we should examine the activities of other Western countries to determine possible measures to enhance savings and the likely impact of those measures if introduced into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to consumption tax. It is asserted continually that a consumption tax is a key measure to increase savings. The theoretical economic argument for that proposition is easy to comprehend. Nevertheless, the evidence is not yet available. </PARA>
<PARA> In Japan, where the controversial debate about the introduction of consumption tax has caused great damage to the LDP Government, notwithstanding the absence of this tax, Japan has a savings ratio that almost all countries which have some sort of value added tax or other consumption tax would love to achieve. What is needed is a comprehensive analysis of the correlation between consumption taxes and savings ratios, both across countries and through time. Do countries with a consumption tax tend to have a higher savings ratio than those without and, in countries which have recently introduced new or substantially increased consumption taxes, have savings ratios responded, as economic theory would predict, to those changes? Anecdotal evidence would tend to indicate that they have not, but it is a necessary part of our information base on which future decisions should be based. </PARA>
<PARA> Now I would like to turn to that question of the adequacy of our information base and our statistical base. The inadequacy of the statistical base on which contemporary economic decisions are made is highlighted by the savings issue. In contemporary measurement of economic statistics, savings is essentially a residual measurement, that is, it is essentially what is left over after everything else has been measured; and that clearly seems to me to be a methodological problem. But the problem in the measurement of savings is merely a microcosm of a broader problem. We need statistics that are better and that are more quickly provided. I do not pretend this is easy, and I certainly do not intend to reflect on the diligent and competent activities of the Australian Bureau of Statistics which discharges, in an exemplary manner, the brief it has been given by legislative charter and by various governments over the years. I am referring to the general issue. Economic decision-making is essentially a very difficult task. On the basis of statistical evidence, one is required to apply a theoretical analysis to lead to a prediction of what might or is most likely to happen in the future, and on that basis required to determine the measures that are appropriate to achieve desired social and economic outcomes. However, the information on which decisions are being based can never be up to date or supplied instantaneously. If that is the case the level of estimation or perhaps guesswork becomes much greater. If at the end of October we are dealing with figures in some areas from, say, May, June or July, then a great deal of very important consumer or investment behaviour and a great deal of evidence are unavailable. That has been particularly evident in previous circumstances when governments were making decisions about the appropriate time at which to ease monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA> What is frustrating about the level of this information is that in many areas industry has the contemporaneous information which government desires. The nature of modern computer-based information systems means that in such areas as housing, motor vehicles and retail sales information is immediately available in great detail to the people in the relevant industries. We need to look at ways in which this information can be made more readily and immediately available to government. It seems to me also possible to provide that sort of up to date information in the savings area as well. My purpose today in raising this matter is, I reiterate, not to criticise the Australian Bureau of Statistics or to reflect on the adequacy of current decisions. In the main, I support the view that they have been the best decisions available in the circumstances with which we have been confronted. However, I want to put on notice my concern that in future years governments, of whichever persuasion, will have to pay attention to the adequacy of the statistical base. </PARA>
<PARA> In the remaining time available to me I would like to turn my attention to one particular appropriation, that is, the aid budget. This has always been an area of special interest to me and I suppose I should declare that special interest before proceeding to participate in the debate. I think it is a matter which should be of special interest to all Australians and certainly to all involved in the process of government because, properly conducted, the provision of overseas development assistance by Australia to other countries is a question of the transfer of resources to the poorest of the poor and there can be no worthier cause than the alleviation of the cruel poverty in which many people in the world find themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to say at the outset that we are getting better at managing our aid. In this post-Jackson report period there seems to be a widespread view, with which I concur, that the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau is a more efficient, better managed organisation, conducting the aid program more efficiently. In addition, the Government, through the decisions made by Mr Hayden, towards the end of his period as Foreign Minister, and substantially endorsed and in fact reinforced by the current Foreign Minister (Senator Gareth Evans), has moved towards a sharp poverty focus in our own aid program; and I support that strongly. There is also, as a consequence of their decisions following the Jackson report, a greater regional focus on our aid. On the face of it, this may seem to be a contradiction as the poorest countries in the world are not be found in our region; they are to be found in Africa. But we must not ignore the enormous numbers of people in poverty in our region. There are more poor people in Asia than in Africa, although the plight of some of the countries in question is not as desperate as those of the poorest people in the poorest countries, such as the central African countries like Mali, or the besieged southern African states like Mozambique. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding the fact that the quality and focus of our aid is improving, I want to put on record, without equivocation, my regret at the extent of the cuts to the aid program made by this Government. In the economic circumstances with which the Government has been confronted, some cuts were inevitable: not desirable, they would never have been my first choice, but I recognise that all areas of government expenditure had to face restraint and in the absence of widespread community support for aid, and in a context in which aid expenditure, because so much of it contributes to the outflow of money from Australia, was particularly vulnerable for cuts. It was a soft option and all of us concerned with the aid issue-and I include myself-must share the blame for leaving it so vulnerable. </PARA>
<PARA> My concern is that aid has taken more than its fair share of the cuts. If the aid budget had been cut proportionately to the reduction in government expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), the aid budget would be substantially greater than it is today. As I said in a speech to a seminar at Deakin University recently, that aid budget would be approximately $150m more than it is today, or about 0.39 per cent of GDP, if those objectives had been met that is, if the cut had been only the equivalent of the reduction in government expenditure overall. It is possible, in fact, to argue that the correct figure is closer to $180m but, for the sake of not appearing too rash, I will use the more conservative figure of $150m. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge that in these periods all governments will have to make hard choices, as ours has had to do, but I must say at this stage that I deplore, in the strongest terms, the proposals put forward by the coalition to cut a further $100m from the already meagre aid budget. As Senator Evans said in answer to a question today, it would cut the already meagre aid budget to 0.29 per cent of GDP. What is more, this callous and ignorant decision was probably designed, as were some of the other cuts, such as those to Aboriginal Affairs, to provoke a community response from unpopular groups in an attempt to reinforce the cynical proposition being put to middle-class Australians that somehow or other money was being taken away from those areas in which it might have been wasted and paid to those whose votes the Liberals were hoping to win. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the decision is also ignorant. It ignores the fact that it is highly likely-and it was confirmed by the Minister in his answer to my question today-that the Australian Government will have to meet $100m of extra multilateral commitments to the international finance institutions next year and that therefore any proposal to cut aid spending by $100m will have double its normal impact on the programs because of the need to fund multilateral commitments. In a $1 billion budget, effectively some parts of it will have to be cut by 20 per cent to absorb this specific $100m cut while increased funding to the international finance institutions goes ahead. When the area of fixed costs in the aid budget is looked at, it will be seen that the impact of these cuts in the other areas of aid to the poorest countries, the effective programs that are being developed to assist the poorest of the poor, is particularly sad and an inappropriate response by any party aspiring to govern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> While I have been critical of this Government's cuts, I must say that there have recently been some substantial pluses in the aid program. I refer, particularly, to the decision to restore funding to the International Fund for Agricultural Development, IFAD. I believe that this is consistent with the poverty focus of the Government's strategy and an appropriate decision for which Minister Evans should take substantial credit. There is also the equity and merit scholarship scheme, devised under Mr Hayden and implemented under Senator Evans. Again, this is assistance in an area in which Australia has a particular capacity to contribute to the development of our region, in a way which is consistent with our objectives of equity and redistribution. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to refer to the increased environmental focus in our aid. It is often too easy to choose the soft option and ignore the fact that sometimes priority objectives may be in conflict. But in many areas of the Third World the problem of poverty is reinforcing the problem of environmental degradation. As the vicious circle continues, the problem of environmental degradation is reinforcing the problem of poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the well targeted and so far currently successful WATCH program; that is, the women and their children's health program. The health of women and children is a proper priority for a poverty focused program. It is one which I wish the Australian media would give more attention to. It is successful and it would give a dramatic focus to the positive achievements of Australia's aid program. The final plus in recent changes to the aid program to which I wish to refer is the question of increased assistance to non-government organisations (NGOs). The NGOs make an outstanding contribution to the Australian aid effort overseas and to the education of Australians about overseas development and poverty issues. This Budget reflects a substantial increase of 10 per cent in real terms in the level of assistance to NGOs. I believe that this is appropriate and I hope it can be sustained. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I turn to some suggestions for the next three years in this area. I hope, and I will be arguing, for a commitment by the Government which would see the lost $150m restored. Some people would regard this as too modest an objective. It is not as ambitious as the very worthwhile recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which sought 0.5 per cent by 1992. However, a real increase of $150m, or a target of 0.39 per cent or hopefully 0.4 per cent, which the Minister has set as his target over the next three years, would be a very ambitious and appropriate target. Within those financial parameters, I would support a maintenance of the poverty focus, the regional focus and the development of the new initiatives which I have recently outlined. This should be possible, as a greater proportion of aid will be available for such programs as the percentage of our aid going in Budget support to Papua New Guinea declines, as both the Australian and the PNG governments agree that it should. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no quick fix in this area. Australia is a small player in a game in which the international community is struggling to come to grips with an enormous problem. But we must act primarily for humanitarian reasons. I acknowledge that there are trade and foreign affairs benefits in a successful aid program. These should be recognised, but they must remain secondary to the primary humanitarian motivation. If we act in this way, we can further enhance Australia's proud place in the international community and make a contribution which is more appropriate to a country such as ours and which is within the realistic limits set by our current economic capacity. With those remarks, I support the Appropriation Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon we are discussing the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1989-90, Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1989-90 and Appropriation Bill (No. 2)  1989-90. This package substantially gives effect to the Government's economic policies. One cannot help but note that in recent days a significant criticism of the Government's present economic policy has come from both the traditional left and traditional right of politics. For instance, I note that Mr Chris White, the Assistant Secretary of the United Trades and Labour Council in South Australia, has just recently called for a change in government policy. He says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need to develop an alternative economic strategy to that of financial deregulation is pressing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is ironic that the Labor Party, which once rejected financial deregulation as undemocratic and irrational, began a program of financial deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> A further rise in mortgage interest rates would be a disaster for low and middle income earners. </PARA>
<PARA> Private and public housing sectors and local manufacturing would be forced into serious decline by the high cost of borrowing money. </PARA>
<PARA> Foreign debt will be fuelled by high interest rates, by restricting the capacity for growth of Australian manufacturing exports. </PARA>
<PARA> The failure of financial deregulation is increasingly evident with foreign debt increasing by over 300 per cent since public controls were lifted on investment flows in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> The private sector now counts for over 70 per cent of this debt-evidence of the need for introducing new forms of financial regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> A clear change of economic direction is required. </PARA>
<PARA>At the same time, Australia's major employer groups have attacked the Federal Government for making policy on the run and destroying investor confidence. Nine industry organisations warned that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . business could not confidently invest in the existing environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent Government decisions on resource development have sent clear messages to Australian business. </PARA>
<PARA> That message is: Resource development and business investment are subject to short-term political expediency. </PARA>
<PARA> The joint statement-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, by the nine industry groups-</PARA>
<PARA>follows a Cabinet decision earlier this month which effectively defers a decision on mining of Coronation Hill in the Kakadu conservation zone in the Northern Territory until after the next Federal election. </PARA>
<PARA> This, on top of an earlier decision to block moves for the Wesley Vale Pulp Mill in Tasmania, brought to a head simmering industry unrest over the Government's approach to projects with environmental sensitivity. </PARA>
<PARA> The joint statement said the greatest threat to investment was uncertainty . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats agree with both the industry leaders and Chris White from the United Trades and Labour Council: there is indeed considerable uncertainty in government direction. But the same is absolutely true of the Opposition's economic policies. Both the Government and the Opposition have failed to recognise that we live in an age of rapid and necessary transition. This transition is brought about by the need to adopt a different attitude to the environment. Both Government and Opposition live in the past. Both act as though the economic patterns of the 1950s and 1960s can be reinstated with a bit of environmental tidying up. Neither the Government nor the Opposition has understood that a new and totally different economic model with a number of exciting technologies is required and that Australia could lead the world in the application and development of those technologies and social adaptations. Until this is understood and a new direction is firmly announced and embarked upon by Government, as a society we will remain uncertain. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats is the only party proposing an alternative economic strategy. Neither major political grouping has grasped the need, and indeed the inevitability, of the eventual replacement of the present growth oriented polices of the major parties with a sustainable steady state economy. Contrary to the views of most economists and, dare I say, most politicians, economics cannot remain based on the arbitrary assumptions about people, society and nature. A new economics must be built on the real world and on the laws of nature. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we know of humanity's place in nature? For 99.9 per cent of our existence we have lived in intimate association with the natural world. This natural world is rapidly disappearing and may have passed from the experience of most people in less than another two generations. Yet this is the world to which evolution has adapted us. We have demonstrated our ability to survive in such a world. It is conjectural whether, as a species, we can survive in a world increasingly dominated by industrialisation and directed towards forever increasing the consumption and destruction of that natural world. Enough has been said on numerous occasions about population growth, resource depletion, species lost, greenhouse gas accumulation, ozone depletion, et cetera. I do not want to recite the list in more detail here but merely accept that the evidence is overwhelming that the industrial economic processes of the last few centuries cannot continue. </PARA>
<PARA> For over 20 years attempts to find other technically advanced life forms in our corner of the universe have been fairly vigorously pursued, so far without success. Bearing in mind the size and age of the universe, it seems almost certain that conditions suitable for life must exist in many places, and in some there should be life forms as technically advanced or more advanced than our own. The absence of any signal so far, together with limitations on space travel imposed by Einstein's relativity, suggest that planet earth is not only our origin but also our destiny. </PARA>
<PARA> What is our destiny? Cosmologists forecast that the conditions suitable for our type of life are likely to persist for at least another 500 million years. By evolutionary standards we are still a very young animal. Indeed, most of our life still lies before us. We have co-evolved with millions of other species over vast periods and now share this exceptional planet, with its unusual life sustaining properties rare in this cosmic precinct, with about 30 million other species. This animal Homo sapiens is at the very threshold of its life on the planet but already has exhibited some technical sophistication. But at the same time-and very recently-we have shown a strong tendency to apply this sophistication in ways damaging to the life support system on which we and all other living creatures depend. We could, if we chose, render the earth lifeless. The acquisition of this power places upon us the awful responsibility of so managing our own affairs-and that refers specifically to our economic affairs-that the slow and ponderous processes of evolution can continue to work themselves out without increasingly disruptive and intrusive human impact. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the context in which we must try to build our economic and other systems. These are the factors it is necessary for us to observe if we are to be free to properly fulfil our destiny. The biosphere reveals a system based on closed cycles and a tendency towards stability. In the last two centuries Homo sapiens has attempted to run increasingly open-ended systems which have moved the biosphere toward instability. We have adopted an open-ended economic model and an open-ended pattern of resource exploitation. Our longer view of history points us to the urgent need to re-establish closed, stable systems close to equilibrium. We must again become part of a dynamic steady state. We must recognise an economic model consistent with nature if we want freedom for ourselves and our children. </PARA>
<PARA> Where-and in some detail-are the flaws in the present growth oriented economic model? There are at least five quite fundamental flaws in a model which takes growth in gross national product (GNP) or gross domestic product (GDP) as its principal objective and as a surrogate measure of the welfare of a nation. GDP is the dollar value of all goods and services made in a country in a year. It roughly parallels consumption. Making GDP grow means making the dollar value of all goods and services consumed each year more than the dollar value consumed in the previous year after allowing for inflation. As growth is measured as a percentage year on year, the growth being attempted is exponential. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, there is no a priori reason, nor any basis for one in nature-and that should be our guide-why growth of GDP should be accepted as a guiding principle. This notion of growth hangs in an intellectual vacuum unconnected with anything but its own corollaries. Arguments about growth conducted within the paradigm of growth economics are tautological. Secondly, as an article of unproven and unprovable faith, the growth paradigm assumes infinite wants and infinite technological innovation to produce more and more goods and people world without end. It assumes that this is not only possible but desirable. Both assumptions can be shown to be false. Many scientifically illiterate economists pin their faith on the infinite capacity of science and technology forever to roll back the impediments to continued growth. Before getting carried away with the idea that the human mind is an ultimate resource that can generate endless growth, let us remember that, while certainly not reducible to physical or mechanical terms, the mind is not independent of the physical body. Frederick Soddy said:</PARA>
<PARA>No phosphorus, no thought. </PARA>
<PARA>Loren Eisley reminds us:</PARA>
<PARA>The human mind, so frail, so perishable, so full of inexhaustible dreams and hungers, burns by the power of a leaf. </PARA>
<PARA>Minds capable of such insight ought to be capable of showing more restraint towards leaves and phosphorus than is usually exhibited by our growth-bound economists. The restriction point in the entry of knowledge into the physical economy is through the availability of low-entropy resources. If there are no low-entropy resources there is no capital, regardless of knowledge, unless the second law of thermodynamics is abolished. Moreover, if endless consumption is so desirable, why do we spend over $10 billion each year on promotional advertising?</PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the peculiar accounting system used to calculate GDP counts costs as benefits. Recently it was said that some $32m would be spent on sand replenishment on the Gold Coast because New South Wales had interfered with longshore drift. That $32m to be spent in that way enters the national accounts as an addition to gross domestic product. The American economist Herman Daly puts it in a perceptive essay on this subject:</PARA>
<PARA>We take the real costs of increasing GDP as measured by the defensive expenditures incurred to protect ourselves from the unwanted side effects of production and add these expenditures to GDP rather than subtract them. We count the real costs as benefits-this is hypergrowthmania. Since the net benefit of growth can never be negative in this Alice-in-Wonderland accounting system, the rule becomes `grow forever', or at least until it kills you-and then count your funeral expenses as further growth. This is terminal hypergrowthmania. Is the water table falling? Dig deeper wells, build bigger pumps and up goes GDP! Mines depleted? Build more expensive refineries to process lower grade ores, and up goes GDP!</PARA>
<PARA>Beaches eroded? Cart sand to replenish them and up goes GDP. As we press against the carrying capacity of our physical environment, these extra effort and defensive expenditures-which are really costs masquerading as benefits-loom larger and larger. This creates the illusion of becoming better off when in actuality we are becoming worse off. We may already have passed the point at which the marginal cost of growth exceeds the marginal benefit. In that we might find an answer to the perception of most people in Australia today, who believe that they are worse off even though the economy continues to grow. This is not merely a matter of increasing inequity in the distribution of goods that are created; we may have a real reduction in those things ordinary people count toward the quality of their lives. Costs masquerading as benefits suggest one change that needs to be made to the growth model. Take the costs out and the adjusted accounts themselves should guide us into making more rational decisions. Such a course will produce productive shocks along the way. </PARA>
<PARA> Since coming to the Senate I have asked the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, a number of questions around this theme. For example, I asked where the $6 billion annual cost of motor vehicle accidents appeared in the national accounts. Senator Walsh told the Senate that these costs are indeed added to GDP. He went on to elaborate on the removal of some of these costs and said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to exclude medical costs borne by households would require more fundamental changes to the accounts-indeed, to the extent where it could touch off a spiral in which all of the gross domestic product gradually disappeared.</PARA>
<PARA>He could not have made more clear the point I am making here. It is true that it is difficult to decide precisely what is a benefit and what is a cost. An element of arbitrariness is impossible to avoid. However, note that the present system is extremely arbitrary, implicitly claiming that everything on which money is spent is a benefit. Wider public understanding of this arbitrariness would itself go a long way to dismantling the obsession with growth. Eighty per cent of population growth in Australia accrues to the capital cities. The increased costs of water, sewerage, electricity, telephones, roads, schools, police, air and noise pollution, loss of civil freedom, et cetera, made necessary by this growth-all these things that ordinary people correctly count as costs-are added to the gross domestic product. The public might view these things very differently if it understood that these same costs are used by treasurers and others as an index of improved quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, the growth model measures throughput rather than stock. This contrasts markedly with how we order our personal lives. There we do not measure our well-being by how quickly we can spend our assets; nor do we equate it with the size of the effort required to maintain our physical lifestyle. Indeed, we quite sensibly seek to minimise the rate at which assets are consumed and effort expended. Why should we adopt the exact opposite view when we contemplate the welfare of a nation? Consider for a moment a stock of physical goods-houses, cars, refrigerators, et cetera-being maintained in a steady state; that is, a constant number by a maintenance throughput. Herman Daly said:</PARA>
<PARA>That this maintenance throughput as a cost is clearly seen by looking at each end of the pipeline. Inputs necessitate depletion, outputs necessitate pollution. Furthermore, the maintenance of the stock requires human labour, the sacrifice of leisure to production. To increase throughput for its own sake makes no sense . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Seen in this light, GDP becomes a largely irrelevant number, something to be minimised for a given stock not maximised. </PARA>
<PARA>Every company keeps a capital account as well as a cash flow account. GDP equates with a cash flow account. This nation-indeed, most nations-keeps no national capital account to keep track of the state of our natural resources. It follows that, as no value is put on iron ore in the ground or forest trees, we can believe or be made to believe that we become richer when these things are exploited. What really happens when iron ore or woodchips are exported unprocessed is that wealth is shifted from the capital account to the cash flow account, but because we keep no capital account wealth appears, as if by magic, in the cash flow account and we can believe that we have become richer. Amory Lovins said: `Whoever heard of developing a bank account by drawing money from it?'. Yet this is precisely what a lot of development entails. </PARA>
<PARA> A related corollary concerns those services which nature provides free-clean air and water and space. They are not, of course, counted in GDP. However, once these services are destroyed or removed and we must pay dollars for their replenishment, these dollars are counted as an addition to GDP. As I have indicated, recently $32m was set aside for the replenishment of sand on the Gold Coast. This had become necessary because New South Wales had interfered with the south-north longshore drift. The national accounts only became aware of this longshore sand drift service provided by nature after it had been destroyed. Money had to be spent to artificially restore it. The money went into the national accounts as a benefit. Certainly it may be difficult to put appropriate values on natural assets, but it is even more ludicrous to put no value on them at all and assume that nature will continue to provide them at no cost. I am not here suggesting that the best way to assess value is always in dollar terms. I merely point out that that is the way it is now done, but done very poorly so that the result is very misleading. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of ways it could be done better. For example, Mr Hawke, in his 28 July statement, which has been described as the greatest environment statement in the world, said that he would plant trees at a cost of $1 per tree. The Opposition countered this statement saying that it would cost between $12 and $17 to plant and nurture a tree up to the stage its continued growth is reasonably assured. We could start by putting this value on trees and showing in our capital account each year how much poorer we were by reason of the number of trees that we had lost. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly, a number of factors are allied with the growth model which serve to further buttress it. Both the Government and Opposition daily extol the terms: market forces, market determinism, the economy as an entity which must be served for its own sake, increasing competitiveness as a goal and deregulation. These, together with growth, form the foundation on which the Government and Opposition both build their economic model. Each of these notions is based on assumptions which are rarely, if ever, questioned. Government and Opposition believe with fundamentalist religious fervour in the sanctity of the market. This belief contains an a priori assumption that the operation of competitive greed will somehow serve the common good. Of course, that takes us right back to Adam Smith. Mathematics tells us that it is impossible to maximise two independent variables simultaneously. It follows that unless the variables, competitive greed and common good, are dependent, then the invisible hand supposed by generations of economists to guide greed toward good must be a figment of the same economists' imaginations. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, the market assumed by economists is one near equilibrium and one in which there are a large number of more or less equal players: one in which supply and demand by these players causes the market to see-saw about this hypothetical equilibrium. I use `hypothetical' in a pejorative sense, because a moment's reflection will cause everyone to realise that in that state the market is at its most unstable. Positive feedback determines that as one player gets a slight advantage, that advantage will be magnified and the market will hunt toward monopoly. Some years ago, John Blatt, professor of applied mathematics at the University of New South Wales, wrote a book called Dynamic Economic Systems in which he mathematically modelled the economists' market and showed that this instability was indeed a real fact of that market system. Needless to say, his work was not accepted by most economists. But apart from intuition and mathematical modelling, we have the observation of what happens in practice; markets do hunt towards monopolies or cooperative oligopolies with big players expending enormous efforts to close markets against competition. </PARA>
<PARA> The market model extolled by Government and Opposition is unreal; it does not exist. The attempt to apply its dictates produces social inequity and environmental despoliation. This is the model that Government and Opposition are coercing citizens, scientists, educational institutions and industry to serve. The most sinister and most destructive aspect of the market system is that it necessarily assumes that the value of something is the value which the market puts upon it. As we have already seen, this market system evaluation has a countercurrent relationship with the real world. The market places no initial value on clean water, clean air and space to live, which nature provides free. As these natural services are destroyed, they obtain value in the market system. The more rare and less accessible they become, the greater the value which the market places on them. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent advertisement in the Australian Financial Review made the point with sickening clarity. It explained the likely impact of greenhouse on world agriculture and encouraged investors to take advantage of greenhouse induced food shortages on the futures market. I believe this could be described as making a killing. The market system allows the rich to maintain access as the price escalates. This is the market system that Government and Opposition coerce the people and institutions of this country to serve. </PARA>
<PARA> Two further points need to be made about the market driven, growth oriented economic model. It is frequently asserted that we need a growing economy so that we can afford to look after the environment. A growing economy is one that is getting richer and can therefore afford to spend more to look after the environment. The flaw is that a growing economy is not necessarily a richer economy or one that can afford to spend more. For example, if a wife and mother stays at home and looks after her husband and children, her work is not counted towards GDP because it is unpaid. If she pays someone to carry out precisely the same duties, then that enters the national accounts as an addition to gross domestic product. But, quite clearly, that does not make society richer and more able to spend on environmental clean-up. If instead of eating at home we all ate in restaurants, GDP would rise by the difference in the cost. But that again does not make us any richer. The flaw is that, because GDP does not distinguish costs from benefits, there is no clear connection between growth of GDP and more money for discretionary spending-for instance, looking after the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The point can perhaps be made most clearly by observing that what is spent on environmental clean-up is an addition to GDP. Therefore, it should follow that the more we spend on the environment, the more we can spend on the environment-that is, we could spend the same amount over and over again and obtain infinite environmental benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The pressure for economic growth is inconsistent with environmental sustainability. The press for continuing economic growth necessarily leads to environmental despoliation and increasing global and local inequity. Traditional economics considers the inputs to production as land, capital and labour. Land today must be generalised to material resource. Capital, as we have seen, is stored low entropy and is composed of material resources and labour. Of course, labour refers to human labour. Thus there are really only two inputs to GDP-material resources and labour. Growth in GDP therefore means a growth in the consumption of one or both of these inputs. There are clearly limits to growth in consumption of both of these inputs and therefore there are limits to growth in GDP. </PARA>
<PARA> Exponential growth in material consumption has clear limits. Energy consumption is a direct cause of greenhouse gas emissions and escalating changes in the composition of the global atmosphere. Energy use is closely linked with the extraction and use of all other material resources. Continued growth in the consumption of material resources is incompatible with ecological sustainability. I refer to my opening remarks regarding the mixed messages which this Government is giving to industry. On the one hand, it is talking about continuing economic growth, continuing resource exploitation, and, on the other hand, it is talking about further protection of the environment and cutbacks in the emission of greenhouse gases of between 20 and 40 per cent by the turn of the century-clearly, incompatible goals. </PARA>
<PARA> Because we live in a society which is so heavily predicated on economic considerations, I believe the tools we must use to change direction must be, at least in the first instance, economic. The first task is to explode the myths of the present market growth system. Once fully apprised of the flaws, the stupidity and the inappropriateness of the present growth directed market system, sensible people will look for saner, less damaging and more sustainable alternatives. I believe that we need to establish a national capital account in which is recorded the value of minerals in the ground, forests and those services which nature now provides at no cost. As these resources are turned to cash flow, we would then see that we have not become richer except to the extent that we have added value to them from human input. We would see that the export of raw timber or woodchips adds very little, if anything, to the nation's wealth. We need also to redefine wealth as capital and not merely as cash flow. We need to disaggregate the costs and the benefits which currently are lumped together in GDP. We need to recognise that the market system is not an appropriate mechanism by which to make many decisions, that we need to make other decisions, put value on some resources, in ways which are not purely monetary. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the sustainable steady state economy which must replace the present growth model will seek to maintain some agreed stock of goods-that is, capital-with a throughput of resources which is minimised and sustainable indefinitely into the future. The steady state is not a static state. As technology advances, resources can be used more conservatively. Choice would determine whether to use a little more resource or to decrease further human impact on the planetary environment. (Extension of time granted) I find this a far more exciting prospect than living in a world hell bent on forever frenetically increasing material consumption and equating that increase with progress. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that Senator Boswell's answer is correct. I am sure that everybody on this side of the chamber is working very hard to ensure that that is so. This Government's policies are putting Australia deeper and deeper into debt and that is something which affects every man, woman and child in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since last year's Budget there has been a dramatic change in Australia's fortunes-not that it was not expected, but many commentators Australia-wide failed to note what the average Australian could have told them. It is getting increasingly hard to make ends meet in middle Australia and there is no let-up in sight. We have an inflation rate of 8 per cent and eternal price rises. As I do my shopping in the supermarket every weekend-and I feel sure that Senator Reynolds who is present has to do likewise, unless she gets her husband to do her shopping for her-I find that the prices of groceries are going up and up. To me, it is like a dog chasing its tail. As the prices go up, inflation also increases and we never seem to be able to get to the end of it. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has indeed deserted middle Australia. It has deserted the men and women it relies on to produce the goods, and who keep paying tax so that this Government can continue with its many high spending policies and useless programs. Millions of average Australians have known for the last two or three years that this Government has been a failure as a manager of the economic affairs of this country. I say to honourable senators that millions of Australian families know more about the realities of economic life in Australia than do members of the Government and the Government's advisers. Indeed, they have proof of that. </PARA>
<PARA> In its six years in office the Hawke Labor Government has failed totally to live up to its commitment to the Australian family. In fact, I believe it has done quite the reverse. I refer to its high taxing policies, its continued support for high inflation-which, as I mentioned earlier, is now at 8 per cent-and high interest rates. I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that an inflation rate of 8 per cent is twice as high as that of our major competitors, and that is very damaging to industry as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has also attacked traditional values. Through that attack the Government has actively jeopardised the continuous viability and stability of many families. A prime responsibility of any national government must be to ensure that the family and the institution of marriage remain the cornerstone of Australian society. The Hawke Labor Government is seriously undermining that priority. Income distribution is now less equitable than it was when Labor took office in March 1983. The top 10 per cent of income earners now receive 28.4 per cent of all income in Australia, while low and middle income earners have gone backwards. Real disposable income fell by 1.2 per cent in 1986-87, the first time in 30 years that this figure has gone backwards. </PARA>
<PARA> After six years of Labor government, 2.6 million people, one in every eight households, live in poverty. Seven hundred thousand Australians have fallen below the poverty line, and 440,000 children are living below the poverty line. What did the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) promise regarding children living in poverty? He said that no Australian child would be living in poverty by 1990, yet there are up to 70,000 young Australians living on the streets. </PARA>
<PARA> Family values and living standards have been destroyed. The Government's record can only make a tragic myth of the many Hawke promises and commitments to Australian families. Just listen to this:</PARA>
<PARA>What concerns the ordinary Australian family is:</PARA>
<PARA> -that there should be jobs available now for parents and in the future for their children</PARA>
<PARA> -that they can purchase their own home at a reasonable cost and not have to face crippling rates</PARA>
<PARA> -that their children can receive an education which equips them in the best possible way for their lives ahead</PARA>
<PARA> -and above all that every Australian family has the opportunity to maintain and improve this standard of living-</PARA>
<PARA>high ideals certainly-</PARA>
<PARA>and that's where our efforts have been directed and continue to be directed. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will never believe it: these are the words of the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, during his election policy speech in November 1984. They were words and nothing more. Indeed, the rhetoric does not match the action. Mr Hawke said:</PARA>
<PARA>This Government sets the welfare of the Australian family as its top priority.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said earlier, he also went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>By 1990 no Australian child will be living in poverty. </PARA>
<PARA>We should note that Mr Hawke altered that statement recently to say that by 1990 no Australian child ought to be living in poverty. There is some difference between those statements. The members of the Australian public could be forgiven for being reduced to total cynicism about the promises of the Prime Minister and this Government because every Australian knows these commitments are not being met. No real attempt is being made to meet them. In fact the other day in the Courier-Mail I read an article which stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The poverty rate among Australian children was more than one in seven, a seminar was told yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> The 15 per cent child poverty level was despite a promise by the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, that by 1990 no child would be in such a situation. NSW Council of Social Service officer Graham Jackson was speaking at the launch of a campaign to make Australians aware of the nature and extent of poverty and encourage them to take community and government action to eliminate it. </PARA>
<PARA>Families have living proof that the Government's commitments are not being met. They know that the $9.1 billion surplus announced in the Budget will once again be achieved mainly through a massive tax impost on working Australians. Let us remember that the total taxation on individuals has more than doubled under Labor from $23 billion in 1982-83 to $51 billion in 1989-90. Here, just let me say that when I was home over this weekend I had to do the wages for the men who work for us. One of our workmen gave me a bill for 171 hours-I think it was-worked over four weeks. When I worked out his wages I found that, although he had worked ever so many more hours during that four-week period than he had during the previous four weeks, he hardly got any more money because of the higher rate of tax that applied. That is exactly what is happening all the time. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1983 a person on the average wage paid a marginal tax rate of 30c in every extra dollar that he earned. Today this is 40 1/4c in the dollar, including the Medicare levy. I know too of a similar situation applying to some of the Commonwealth car drivers who often work over weekends. They say that they earn double time pay if they drive on a Sunday but they sometimes find that it is hardly worthwhile because they have to pay so much of the additional earnings in taxes. If the tax rate is 40 1/4c in the dollar that is understandable. A single income family on average earnings in March 1983 paid $84.65 tax each week. That is nearly 23 per cent of its income. In July 1990 that same family will be paying $156.74 tax each week- almost 26 per cent of its income. By July 1990 this family will be $56 a week worse off compared to the situation in March 1983. If we include higher home mortgage repayments that family will be $100 a week worse off. Let us face it: most families these days are paying very much higher home mortgage repayments. People are very fortunate if they have managed to be on the 13 1/2 per cent home interest repayment as a fixed level because I am afraid that every time the interest rates go up so too do the payments for homes. </PARA>
<PARA> Those statistics that I have just mentioned are not only an economic disgrace, they are a social disgrace. Families know about the Government's housing policies, policies which mean that the Government will be able to tell the Australian people that it so loves the Australian dream of home ownership that it has put it beyond the reach of ordinary Australians-a very sad state of affairs. Families know that under current Government policies the prices of virtually all groceries have risen dramatically in the past few years. I mentioned that a little earlier. Families know that there has been a 90 per cent increase in the taxation bite for single income families on average earnings. They know that our foreign debt has quadrupled over the last five years, that home ownership is now getting steadily beyond the reach of all but the relatively affluent people who are entering the home market for the first time. The Government then turns around and asks the Australian people to save. I ask: How can they save to get ahead? Labor's tax system discourages and penalises hard work, penalises savings and penalises investment. </PARA>
<PARA> For the sixth consecutive year this Government has retained its title as Australia's highest taxing government. Adam Smith said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no art which one government sooner learns of another than that of draining money from the pockets of the people. They are themselves-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, governments-</PARA>
<PARA>already and without any exception the greatest spendthrifts in society. Let them look well after their own expenses and they may safely trust private people with theirs. If their own extravagance does not ruin the State that of their subjects never will. </PARA>
<PARA>This present Labor Government is working hard to make sure that these words Adam Smith said in 1776 are true today. The family is the building block of society. It is a nursery, a school, a hospital, a leisure centre, a place of refuge and a place of rest. It encompasses the whole of society. It fashions our belief. It is the preparation for the rest of our life. It is for these reasons that governments should ensure that their policies should serve to nurture the family and its structure and not to undermine it. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, today we see that many women are unable to care for their children because of the tremendous financial pressure placed upon single income families. In a society that is becoming ever more sensitive to women's rights, what is to be said of the rights of women who want to be full time wives and mothers? Is it fair that they fall victim to a taxation system that discriminates against women who choose not to leave home in order to earn a separate income? Without wishing to impinge on the freedom of women seeking fulfilment in employment and activities outside the home, adequate measures should be taken to recognise and financially assist the role of mothers who choose to stay at home. I believe that such measures should be taken now. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, apart from the economic hardship that has been imposed on families, this Government has directly undermined traditional family values, further threatening the stability of marriage and family life. It has provided for equal status for de facto partners, compared to married partners, for government benefits and allowances. It has supported programs that encourage homosexuality. It has introduced a homeless allowance for 16- and 17-year-olds. This can directly encourage the splitting up of families for economic reasons, particularly in the case of low income families. The Government has discriminated against single income families in the tax system, forcing both parents of an increasing number of families into the work force, and therefore jeopardising the home environment, particularly affecting young people. It has supported the pornographic video industry, by refusing to support legislation banning the sale of pornographic videos from the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget, of course, reflects the way that this nation has changed, both socially and economically. Government members place great store on the small and delayed increases in welfare payments to our needy, the aged, the handicapped and the homeless. Increased welfare payments simply point to the failure of government. Increased welfare is a sad reflection of a sick economy and the need to support increasing numbers of desperate people. Under current government policies, traditional services are struggling to survive. Public and private hospitals are under pressure. Aged persons' facilities, many of them established through the voluntary effort of communities and the generosity of individuals, are under threat of closure. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I refer briefly to a matter of great concern to me. I have mentioned this in the Senate on a number of occasions. Our road system is in a deplorable state. I remind honourable senators that families, whether living in the city or in the country, use the road system regularly for work and for leisure. The road system is being used heavily at the moment as Australia suffers the crippling effects of the current pilots strike. All senators would know as well as I do that a tremendous number of fatalities have occurred just recently on roads that are not of a good standard. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that one cannot attribute all these accidents to the state of the roads, but certainly many problems are caused by roads that are too narrow, for example. When large transports and buses are travelling towards one another some horrific accidents can result, such as those that we have read about recently in the papers. We have seen reports of these on television, and one's heart is nearly turned over. This is especially so when one sees someone like the gentleman on television-Colin Ormesher, I think his name was-who had lost nearly all his family. His relatives had come out from England. It just about made me cry while I was watching him on television, it was so sad. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor has cut road funding by over 30 per cent in real terms since it came to office. The increase in this year's Budget represents only 9.5 per cent over the miserly 1988-89 allocation. I suppose this is one of the reasons why the roads are deteriorating. The most recently indexed increases in fuel excise alone netted the Government an estimated additional $200m, none of which, I regret to say, has been earmarked for road funding. In 1989-90, total revenue from fuel excise will increase by 9.3 per cent, to $5,645m. So the apparent increase of 9 per cent in road expenditure is not a just return on the increased amount that the motorist will be paying at the petrol pump. In fact, I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that this Government will still be taking extra as the motorist fills his tank. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to an advertisement that appeared in Queensland papers. At the beginning of the advertisement, the first words `This is how Federal road funding has been going for six years' are printed back to front-and at first I wondered what it was all about. The next part of the advertisement states, `Two cents would turn it around'. The advertisement was placed by the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland, and it is very sad that it has to keep on advertising to tell people of the need that exists for more money for roads. The advertisement states:</PARA>
<PARA> If you're a motorist you'd be well aware that Federal road funding is going in the wrong direction. </PARA>
<PARA> But don't worry. We're not asking you-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the people of Queensland-</PARA>
<PARA>for any more money. </PARA>
<PARA> You're already paying about 30 cents to the Federal Government in petrol tax for every litre you're pouring into your car. And that's enough. </PARA>

<PARA> What you should be worried about though is that the Federal Government is trickling only about five and a half cents of this back into road improvements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Minister for Land Transport will tell you that his Government has increased the level of road funding this year to keep up with inflation. That's true. </PARA>
<PARA> What he's not telling you is that, because of inflation and previous funding cuts, we're still $500 million short of the amount spent on roads in 1983/84. That was the last time that there was any worthwhile increase in Federal funding for roads. </PARA>
<PARA> In real terms this means we are now about 30 per cent worse off. </PARA>
<PARA>All they are asking for is 2c out of the 30c that motorists are already paying in order to improve our roads. The Labor Government will be taking extra as the motorist fills his tank, and we must realise that that is the case. I must certainly emphasise here that it is the Federal Government that we are concerned about when it comes to the matter of bad roads. As far as I am concerned, the Queensland Government is doing a very good job indeed. The worst thing that the people in Queensland could do would be to vote in a Labor government in Queensland, because people would find that the same things would happen in Queensland as are happening federally now. </PARA>
<PARA> As Labor's willingness to tax the motorist has increased, its willingness to spend on roads has decreased. The Government's failure to produce a proper return of the fuel excise collections to road funding is particularly culpable, since 70 per cent of domestic trade is carried by road. It is expected that by the turn of the century that figure will have doubled and that the number of vehicles will have increased by 60 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> An increase of 9.5 per cent is simply not enough to provide the essential road infrastructure to sustain the growth in our road traffic safely and efficiently. For primary industry, the one sector which has the capacity to improve our trade balance and which, of course, offers the greatest potential for diversity, value adding and general productivity increases, these cuts only increase the burden in its attempt to make ends meet. In fact, the burden is becoming too hard for all Australian families. In short, six years of the Federal Labor Government have been a total disaster for the nation, especially for the security and future of Australian families. The record and the facts are indisputable. The tragedy is that there is no sign that the Government has any intention of making serious and urgently needed changes in policy to help ordinary Australians and their families. </PARA>

To get back to the debate before the Senate, the 1989-90 Budget is the continuation of seven years of sound economic policy under the Hawke Government. Those seven years have not been easy. In fact, they have been very difficult years in which the Government has fought to reduce the levels of inflation and unemployment. We have succeeded magnificently in both spheres. We have done it because of the social justice policy of the Australian Labor Party, the Cabinet and the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the last seven years Australia has experienced the highest level economic growth among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member nations. It has also achieved record Budget surpluses into the bargain. We have also seen a major restructuring of Australian industry in the last seven years, preparing Australia to stand on her own feet in the face of international trade competition. I will refer to a few remarkable facts a little later in my speech in order to give a backdrop to the long awaited coalition's taxation and spending policies which were outlined some three weeks ago. I will focus on those policies tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> On the one hand, we have seen remarkable achievements under Labor. They are even more remarkable, given the appalling legacy left to the people of Australia by the Fraser Government. On the other hand, we have the terrifying prospect of a Peacock-Hewson government actually implementing the coalition's Economic Action Plan-a plan which no doubt strikes fear into the hearts of all fair-minded Australians and even, no doubt, the more self-interested Australian, for ultimately it means economic ruin for the nation. To be poor, black or chronically ill, or to contemplate life should the coalition win the next election, can only mean despair-a real horror story. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my intention tonight to look at the implications and ramifications of such policies for ordinary Australians should they ever be implemented. The best way to do this is to look at what happened the last time the conservatives were given the opportunity to govern and to compare that with the sound economic alternative and salvation offered and delivered under Labor for the last seven years. The Budget, which we are speaking about tonight, is the culmination of that. Australians will then be in a good position to assess the coalition's Economic Action Plan for what it really is-inequitable, illogical, politically naive, vote grabbing, greedy and self-indulgent. </PARA>

<PARA> In order to get a real picture of the contribution that Labor has made to Australia and to the economics of Australia, we have to go back some time. We have to go back to the last time the Opposition was in government. We do not have to go back too far-only to 1983. For the purposes of this debate, I will outline some of the statistics relating to that time. I know that Senator Boswell and Opposition senators will not want to be reminded that in 1983 unemployment was 11 per cent and on the increase-on the up and up. Factory doors were closing, particularly in the manufacturing sector. Investment was negligible. There was only a little Japanese investment and that was in the coal industry. In the last year of the Fraser Government, 80,000 young people's jobs disappeared. The future of Australia was tossed on to the scrap heap. In the entire life of the conservative Fraser- National Party Government, payments to families for children were increased on only one occasion. That is disgraceful, considering that it was in government for seven years. The government deficit was more than $9 billion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Only one child in three finished high school; 270,000 children were dependent on adults who were receiving the unemployment benefit; 147,500 people aged between 20 and 24 were unemployed; two million Australians did not have access to adequate medical cover; and the inflation rate was 11.5 per cent and showing no signs of easing. At that time, all the economic signals-the inflation rate, levels of growth and investment, the number of apprenticeships and the number of new housing starts-indicated that Australia was in a rotten shape.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will move to the present. In the last seven years there has been a dramatic transformation in Australia. This has come about because of the good sense of the Australian people. That good sense was shown in 1983 when they elected Labor into office. Since then we have built a solid basis for society by providing opportunity, fairness, equality and security for all people regardless of their origins or circumstances. To realise this vision of a just society, especially given the massive numbers of people who had been marginalised by the policies of the Fraser Government, Labor had to provide solid, sustainable economic growth. Labor has encouraged productive investment and has dramatically reduced the massive unemployment inherited from the previous conservative Government. Unlike the conservatives the Labor Government would not tolerate massive levels of unemployment. The previous conservative government used recessionary tactics in a vain attempt to keep the inflation rate low. The Peacock-Hewson duo-now joined by Mr Howard-will repeat the exercise, given half a chance. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic rationale for the Hawke Labor Government's policy and the Budget as a continuation of that economic policy has been the driving force behind the reform of the taxation system, the introduction of the family allowance supplement, the child support scheme, award restructuring and Medicare. These are but a few of the initiatives implemented by the Federal Labor Government since 1983. All the initiatives have been based on the premise that only through a growing economy can effective assistance be provided to the needy in a community. That is not to say that the Opposition is not aware of social justice. Indeed, it paid lip service to it in the document released last year by the then Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, known as `Futile Diversions', or something of that ilk. There is no mention of social justice in the current Economic Action Plan. Perhaps we should applaud and recognise that honesty. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite all the dead lead in the saddle bags, even the Opposition realises that a policy which aims to open divisions in Australian society, a policy which attacks the poorest, the most marginalised in the community, that calls them bludgers, that condemns the poor and disadvantaged merely for being poor and disadvantaged, is an insult to the idea of social justice. The notions of a fair distribution of economic resources, equal access to essential services such as housing, health care and education, equal rights in civil, legal and industrial affairs and the opportunity for all to participate in personal development, community life and decision-making are alien to those who sit opposite. Under a coalition Government those who are most disadvantaged in our midst-the unemployed, families, invalids, the disabled, Aborigines-will be made to pay for the government privileges delivered to high income earners. That is the conservatives' understanding of the principle of social justice: take from the needy and give to the greedy. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the record of Labor over the last seven years. In the area of employment, education and training we have created 1.6 million jobs, a 24.7 per cent increase since 1983. Ninety per cent of those jobs have been created in the private sector; 55 per cent have been created for women. Unemployment has fallen by 30.2 per cent over the same period. Teenage unemployment has been halved. The median duration of unemployment has been almost halved: 26.1 weeks in 1984 and 15 weeks in July 1989. It is still too high. We will not rest on our laurels and the Budget will ensure that we do not. The number of people receiving unemployment benefit has fallen from its peak of 670,000 in 1984 to 463,000 in October this year. The number of apprenticeships has risen by over 50 per cent to 54,000 annually. Thirty-two thousand young Australians have now taken advantage of the Australian traineeship system. Award restructuring offers unprecedented numbers of workers for the first time in their working lives the opportunity to participate in new and more rewarding employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned at the start of this speech, school retention rates have risen from a disgraceful aggregate of one in three young people finishing secondary school in 1983 to two-thirds of young people finishing secondary school in 1989. Since 1983, Labor has created an additional 43,000 places in higher education. By the end of the 1989-1991 triennium, an additional 110,000 places in tertiary institutions will have been created-a massive 43 per cent increase over the 1983 levels. They are but a few of the achievements and they relate to only one portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Social Security portfolio we really see what a commitment to social justice principles can mean for the more disadvantaged members of our community. I believe that Brian Howe will be remembered for many years to come for his leadership and the achievements of his Department in this area. The policies that have been introduced have been singularly successful because, as I said earlier, Labor knows that social security payments alone will not solve the problems faced by many low income families. Since 1983 we have seen the introduction of the family allowance supplement and the establishment, for the first time, of standards of adequacy for child payments, benchmarks, to 15 per cent of the combined married rate of pension for children aged less than 13 years and 20 per cent of the combined married rate of pension for children aged 13 to 15 years of age. In recognition of the importance of ensuring that these increases are not eroded over time, the Government-also for the first time-will index annually both the family allowance and the family allowance supplement. This will ensure that the child poverty benchmarks are met permanently so that low income families with children need not slip back into poverty. The coalition has been unable to give a commitment that the indexation arrangements would continue under a conservative government. </PARA>
<PARA> Another initiative of the Hawke Government is the introduction of the child support scheme, a scheme that ensures that non-custodial parents meet their responsibilities to support their children. We have eased social security income tests to address poverty traps. Social security recipients have been encouraged to supplement their payments through part-time work. The Hawke Government also introduced new programs-jobs, education and training (JET) and Newstart-to increase the access to training programs by sole parents and long term unemployed, enabling them to overcome barriers to employment and develop a springboard for more active, satisfying lives. Another Hawke Government initiative is the extension of occupational superannuation across the work force so that it is not just the prerogative of a privileged few. Labor has also met its longstanding commitment to raise the age pension to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> Under Labor the taxation system has also undergone unheard of reform, despite the noisy, self-interested objections of a previously privileged majority. The reforms mean that the taxation system now provides greater equity and efficiency by broadening the tax base; taxing capital gains; effectively pursuing tax avoidance and evasion which, incidentally, previously was the only growth area under the former conservative Government; and by reducing marginal tax rates. Labor's tax reform package has restored incentive and neutrality to the tax system, establishing an improved economic future for the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> I give a few more examples, if more are needed, of Labor's achievements since it took office in 1983. We have introduced the home and community care program for the aged and the disabled, providing these people with real alternatives to institutionalised care. We have introduced Medicare and facilitated the building of a million new homes. We have increased funding for Aboriginal programs by 47 per cent in real terms. We have increased the number of child-care places from a measly 46,000 in 1983 to 114,000 this year, with another 30,000 places to be available by 1992-a 200 per cent increase since 1983. Commonwealth assistance for public housing has more than doubled, as has funding for disability services. The expenditure on the children's services program has increased from $62m in 1982-83 to $232m this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> These initiatives are remarkable in themselves, but they are even more remarkable, given that they have been introduced at a time when we have seen a huge decline in Government spending as a proportion of the gross domestic product. While Government spending as a proportion of gross domestic product has dropped to its lowest point in 16 years, the percentage of the Budget devoted to social justice programs has actually increased. An inherited $9 billion deficit in 1983 has been turned into a $9 billion surplus in 1989, the third consecutive year in which a surplus has been realised. I could continue to list many equally noteworthy achievements by the Government in a variety of portfolios from Transport and Communications to Veterans' Affairs, from the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories to Consumer Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the alternatives in the Opposition's Economic Action Plan, which aims to mangle and make mincemeat of the achievements to which I have just referred. The most needy in the community no longer will be targeted for efficient assistance. The cycle of poverty and welfare dependency will spin again as positive policies are ejected. The Opposition is hell-bent in a blatant and undisguised manner on winning votes by making the underprivileged the target of its wrath and callous proposals. In order to pay for their promises to the Elliotts, the Hewsons and their New Right mates, the conservatives intend to crush those who are already the most vulnerable. To those people who are allowing themselves a hope for the future as a consequence of programs such as jobs, education and training and Newstart, which are designed specifically for sole parents and the long term unemployed, the conservatives are saying, `You are good for nothing; you are only bludgers'. They are saying also, `Only those who can afford it have the right to be chronically ill.' The conservatives believe mistakenly that they can win government by playing on the bigotry of a small number of swinging voters. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, bigotry exists in our society. To prove that, one has only to ask a former Country-Liberal Party candidate for the Northern Territory about the rednecks and the white supremacists. Everybody hopes that the conservatives will not win the next election. They cannot win because, even if the conservatives do not understand concepts such as equity, justice and a fair go for all, the Australian electorate does. It will not take a giant leap back into the economic dark ages of unemployment, inflation and tax avoidance and evasion of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Australian electorate cannot be fooled into believing that politics is an acceptable substitute for policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's Economic Action Plan will be exposed for what it is: bigoted, shortsighted, inequitable and racist. What does it offer? The alternative government offers: the abolition of Jobstart; the abolition of the industry training support schemes; the abolition of Skillshare; and the abolition of a number of other employment, education and training programs that are designed specifically to meet the needs of rural areas, including the innovative rural education and training program; the rural education access program; the rural community-based education program; and the marketing skills program. If they were implemented, those proposals would be devastating for people in country areas, where unemployment is generally felt harder and where training opportunities are less numerous. It is further evidence of how out of touch the tories are with the needs and expectations of rural Australia. Those proposals, combined with the plan to privatise the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) operations, would have no other consequence for the rural unemployed than total disaster. Very few of the services that are presently provided by the CES in rural areas could be provided by private enterprise. Ultimately, rural communities would be left without any appropriate employment and training services. </PARA>
<PARA> The conservatives propose also to move all of those who have been unemployed for nine months or more off unemployment benefits and onto special benefits. However, no definition of the eligibility criteria has been provided for those people who would achieve and receive those special benefits. The tests that exist at the moment under the Labor Government are very rigorous. Under a conservative government, one could anticipate that those people who are unfortunate enough to be rendered unemployed and who are unable to gain employment within nine months may have to dispose of a number of assets before they can obtain those special benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The conservatives intend to abolish the Occupational Health and Safety Commission. They want to massively reduce the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio, particularly in relation to employment, education and training, which are the only hopes that most Aboriginal people have of ever lifting themselves out of a desperate cycle of poverty. Despite the fact that, in 1989, 11 per cent of Aborigines who are aged 15 years or more have never attended school, the coalition plans to massively slash assistance in that area. Although some achievements have been made under the Labor Government, there have not been enough. Under the Hawke Administration the retention rate for Aboriginal and Islander students in secondary schools has doubled and the number of tertiary graduates has trebled. However, more needs to be done because the figures are fairly appalling. I fear that the gains that have been achieved would be short-lived if the coalition were to win office at the next election, especially when they are combined with the severe reductions that are planned for sewerage, water and housing programs for Aboriginal people. Those programs aim to guarantee basic quality of life standards for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's Economic Action Plan contains good news for the wealthy. It proposes to abolish the capital gains tax, with a windfall going pretty well straight into the pockets of those people who have largely escaped from the wage restraint that has been experienced by the average Australian. It would go also into the pockets of those who have benefited greatly from the recent property and share boom or those who have already received the biggest cuts in their marginal tax rates. For example, John Elliott would be $17m richer under the proposal, whereas the effect on at least 95 per cent of the Australian population inevitably would be far less money being made available for the education of their children, the maintenance of roads and the care of their elderly. However, they would still be responsible for funding Elliott's child-care rebate. No mention has been made in the Economic Action Plan of the sums that would be allocated to road funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The plan also proposes to replace the higher education contribution system with a yearly $1,200 upfront charge for tertiary study, which would effectively mean that only the children of the wealthy could afford to undertake a degree. Under a conservative government, sole parents, Aborigines and people from disadvantaged working class and even middle-class backgrounds would be unable to afford to undertake tertiary study. The plan also proposes to scrap 30,000 new child-care places, thereby forcing thousands of families out of government funded child-care centres, out of jobs and onto welfare. Without affordable child-care, many in the community have no choice but to stay at home and to care for their children, despite their wish to enter or remain in the paid work force. </PARA>
<PARA> Another bright idea of the conservatives entails subjecting those who are on sickness benefits to monthly medical examinations. Any savings that may be made in that respect probably would be far outweighed by the cost of those examinations, assuming that enough medical practitioners were available to undertake them. Perhaps that is just a result of a reciprocal deal that has been worked out between doctors and those in opposition to provide some funding for the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's plan also proposes to deny migrants access to unemployment benefits, sickness benefits and invalid pensions for the first 12 months after arrival in Australia. That is proof of the Opposition's callous disregard for the different circumstances in which people may find themselves through no fault of their own. I suppose that we should be grateful that we have seen only one policy instead of two-one policy for Asian migrants and another for non-Asian migrants. Heaven forbid if, not long after arriving in Australia, a family of migrants were involved in a serious car accident or if the breadwinner were the victim of a terminal illness. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition proposes to reduce payments to the States by $300m, which would once again hit the disadvantaged the hardest because they are the most likely to be dependent upon the State government services that are financed from those payments. Although it is not specifically mentioned in the Economic Action Plan, funding to local government is linked to funding to the States. Local authorities are virtually guaranteed their share of cuts in allocations.</PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps one commendable aspect of the entire policy is the decision not to repeal the Hawke Government's decision to tax the profits in the goldmining industry, thereby making that industry subject to the same taxation arrangements as apply to all other Australian industries. We are told that the big emphasis is on families, but no definition of a family has been supplied. Two weeks ago, on 16 October, during the Australian Broadcasting Commission's AM radio program, Brian Howe said:</PARA>
<PARA> It's very much a question of which families, isn't it? There's nothing there for families with people unemployed. There's nothing there for black families. Migrant families are very much the subject of attack, as are poor and low income families. I don't see that as a families' package. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening we are considering the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill and related Bills. In any consideration of the Budget proposals of the Hawke Labor Government, I cannot think of anything more typical of the situation in which the nation finds itself at the moment than Darwin Airport. We have in the Darwin Airport a totally inadequate facility that for years and years has been the subject of procrastination by a Federal Government about the dedication and the commitment that it will give in any funding to the north of Australia. We are well aware that the Hawke Labor Government has made major announcements about the Darwin Airport: that its construction timetable is to be kick-started in the near future and that it is to be given an injection of capital works that will enable it to be the provider of a major facility for the future of northern Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But just where is that future at the moment? The current airline pilots dispute would have us all in an absolute quandary about whether there is a future use to which a terminal such as Darwin Airport could properly be put. Later in my remarks I will make particular reference to the important tourist industry of northern Australia. It is the very impotency, or the symbolism, of Darwin Airport at the moment that makes me turn my attention to the Budget and ask: What is its purpose? What is its direction? Where is it going? What will it provide? What facilities will be carried forward into the future? I am afraid that, when it comes to this project, all of the hype, the promises and the commitments of the Hawke Labor Government fall on very shallow fields. As I said, I believe that the impotency of the Government becomes paramount when we consider the 1989 Federal Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> There are so many areas that we would like to take the time to address and on which to consider where we are going. Many people in the electorate are making competing demands not only on government but also on many of the facilities of State governments and local governments. They are looking to the Federal Administration for some degree of leadership, some degree of commitment, some degree of hope, and all of that is totally failing. </PARA>
<PARA> Darwin Airport is merely one example. Let me move several hundred kilometres south-east from the Darwin Airport and take honourable senators to the Kakadu National Park. Again we need to look very carefully at the policies and proposals of the Hawke Labor Government. In the Budget proposals we see estimates of income that will be received by a rise in the fees received by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS) for tourist visitation to Kakadu. But that cannot and will not be achieved because, as I have said, the commitment to solving the current pilots dispute, which rests squarely on the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), will result in disastrous consequences for the Kakadu area. The Budget figures that we saw with regard to fees for the Kakadu National Park just cannot be anticipated. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the Government's commitments to so many other areas in that great park? Many years ago, a cattle station called Munmarlary was amalgamated into the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service administration. That property has been allowed to fall into extensive disrepair by the ANPWS, so much so that, where it could be providing major facilities for the Aboriginal traditional owners of the area and providing business opportunities for the Aborigines and for the Territory generally across the tourism industry, we have seen the Government completely walk away from any responsibility in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at service agencies of government such as those in the Department of Administrative Services (DAA), in particular the Australian Construction Services, we see that there is a commitment to commercialise or normalise many of the operations of that Department. For example, I refer to the commitment to architectural and engineering facilities that are to be provided in the various regions of DAA throughout Australia. What is happening with the changes in this area? Recently, in the Senate Estimates hearings I was able to ascertain that the Department has been told, `Get out there into the field and compete with private industry'. But compete on what basis? For example, where the Government is making commitments to major civil works projects throughout Australia and is inviting commercial and competitive tenders, it is then saying to the various wings of the Australian Construction Services, `Yes, your various branches can also be involved in those tenders in cooperation with the large building contractors or construction firms'. So what do we see? We see projects in which two or three State divisions enter into partnerships with competing tenderers. What is the end result of that? It is that Government funds are being squandered; Government funds are being wasted by branches of the same Department putting up similar facilities in different consortiums around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Take the firefighting protection services for Commonwealth assets such as those at airports or Army facilities. Again I use the example of Darwin, where the Department of Administrative Services has decided that it would rather move its staff resources into firefighting protection of Commonwealth assets than use the traditional form of contractors and consultants that it has been able to engage at very competitive rates. The Department says that it is trying to rationalise, save money and enter into facilities of that nature, but instead what does it do? It rips the contracts away from those contractors and brings in a bureaucracy to run that type of venture. </PARA>
<PARA> Several days ago, the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) made an announcement about the satisfactory negotiations between the Australian Government and the Indonesian Government on the Timor Gap treaty, which will open up oil and gas exploration fields to the north of Darwin. Yes, the facilities to be put in place are well worth the type of announcement that was made. I am pleased to welcome that sort of announcement. But at the same time, if we look at the policies of the Hawke Labor Government in its commitment to mining in northern Australia, we have to ask: Why, then, the deferment of uranium mining in the north of Australia? Why a dedication and commitment to a three-mine policy that will in effect thwart the economic development of northern Australia, which development can be carried out in all consciousness of the environmental and safety factors that have to be taken into account? There are jobs to be had by the development of the uranium industry, but the Hawke Government says no, it cannot face up to these important onshore facilities. Because of the international treaties and arrangements, the Government can enter into negotiations and treaties that are very worthwhile offshore. But try to break the three-mine uranium policy of the Australian Labor Party: No way. This has to be deferred until after the next Labor conference. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent weeks in this chamber and in the House of Representatives we have seen the debates with regard to the development of Coronation Hill. Under a very obvious threat from the Australian Conservation Foundation and a number of other groups with very particular and vested interests, the Government has walked away from the proper, managed, proven, economically and environmentally sound projects that would provide jobs, that would provide an economic stability for northern Australia and, in fact, for all people throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to weigh up the differences in the economic approaches of the Hawke Labor Government and the Opposition. In recent weeks we have had announcements of new economic and tax policies that would be implemented by a Federal Liberal- National Party. These policies give a commitment and a promise that an extra $2,000m will be put into the pockets of families each year. Gains for families would include child rebate of at least $200 per child, a new rebate for child-care worth between $10 and $20 a week, and an opportunity for a spouse to earn more and still get the dependent spouse rebate. Under such a policy, gains for taxpayers would include a commitment to give back extra tax paid by those pushed up the tax scale because of inflation and a commitment to reduce tax scales in our first term of office. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties would give a far greater degree of commitment to the important area of small business-an area sadly neglected by the Hawke Labor Government-by scrapping Labor's capital gains tax and replacing it with a fairer speculative gains tax which would phase out after five years. As a commitment to the elderly, probably one of the areas that we are all very mindful of as we all get older year by year--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not just speaking for myself; I am speaking for many people in the community in saying that there is a need for a much fairer application of the assets test and a deferred pension plan for those who wish to continue working beyond retirement age and ultimately receive a higher pension. The Liberal and National parties' policies, by comparison with those of the Hawke Labor Government, aim to ease the pressure on families, to protect the elderly, to give small businesses a fair go and to stop people rorting the system. Indeed, no-one in genuine need would suffer. The announced Liberal and National parties' policies are not, as described by my political colleague in the Northern Territory, Labor member Warren Snowdon, a cynical political stunt. I can assure Mr Snowdon that my colleagues and I make no apologies for promising to help millions of hardworking people who are bearing the brunt of six years of a Labor government. We certainly have a commitment to those people of middle Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many comments have been made on the Budget but we have to ask: Are these measures aimed at reducing government inefficiency across the board by cutting out unnecessary spending, wastage and red tape? It seems to be endemic that after six years of Labor we have forgotten that the important principle is to look after people in the suburbs. Community reaction was probably best summed up in an editorial in the Centralian Advocate newspaper about a week ago. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is high time to give middle Australia a fair go. This forgotten class has been milked for all it is worth by pressure groups and minority lobbies. This so-called silent majority are not prepared to remain silent for much longer. </PARA>
<PARA>That is where a very strong and deliberate comparison can be easily drawn between the Hawke Labor Government's budgetary commitments and those that the Liberal and National parties would implement in government. </PARA>
<PARA> We also need to ask: What areas of portfolio adjustment would have to be made? Andrew Peacock, the Leader of the Opposition, and so many shadow ministry members have gone into considerable detail to isolate and work out how the Liberal and National parties' commitment to a new tax package could be achieved-so successfully, as I am sure all honourable senators would be aware, that in the last week or so the polls have shown very dramatic turns away from the stalemate and the position that the Labor Government has got us into towards the promise and commitment of the Liberal and National parties and the faith that the community can have in the policies of a Liberal-National government. </PARA>
<PARA> An area of personal interest to me, which I have pursued in this Senate for the past two years because of the pressures and commitments in my electorate, the Northern Territory, is the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs. The Liberal and National parties quite openly admitted that they could see the opportunity to save about $100m or, I remind the Senate, 10 per cent of a total Budget worth nearly $1,000m of current commitment to Aboriginal affairs. Some commentators and some politicians have come out crying on that issue. The Senate should bear in mind that this saving of $100m is actually less than the increase announced in the last Labor Budget for this portfolio. Our plan is to save money by reducing government inefficiency, cutting unnecessary spending, wastage and red tape, and coordinating State and Commonwealth programs. </PARA>

<PARA> The Senate Estimates hearings of several weeks ago gave very important consideration to this portfolio. I invite honourable senators to pay particular regard to the report that will be handed down in the near future as a result of the deliberations of the October 1989 Estimates. I make no apology for putting some 600 questions on notice concerning the portfolio this year. The range of answers that were given need very careful academic but, more importantly, political study by Ministers of the Crown because they highlight time and again the areas where policy direction has been misguided and where there has been very considerable waste and duplication of expenditure. As I said earlier, the Hawke Labor Government has demonstrated a very deliberate different emphasis across this portfolio from the commitment that the Liberal and National parties would make. There are many particular and individual instances that would be very easy to highlight across that portfolio. I draw honourable senators' attention in particular to the Hansard record of Estimates Committee E of 10 October 1989, when we spent an entire day, from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m., thoroughly scrutinising and deliberating on the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs. That was in addition to the information so widely available through all the questions put on notice. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal Development Commission can take credit for having improved their game in the past 12 months. But frankly it is still not good enough. The performance indicators applied to such important and necessary areas of service delivery show that they have failed time and again in being of real benefit to Aboriginal people throughout Australia. Whether they live in urban communities on the eastern seaboard, whether they live in traditional and ceremonial types of Aboriginal communities-the areas I am familiar with in the Northern Territory-or whether they live among the pressures of different groups throughout Australia, there are so many examples of where the Government has got it wrong. The Government and its agency, the Aboriginal Development Commission, have failed the Aboriginal constituencies, that they so piously claim they are serving, with this expenditure of over $900m per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> There are 230,000 Aborigines in Australia. This Parliament has for many years been giving a commitment of funds of that order. The test of the expenditure in that area should be whether we end up with programs that are helping people in terms of health, education, welfare, business improvement and community relations. Instead, well in excess of $100m that the Liberal and National parties have identified as matters of waste and duplication need to be particularly addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> There are so many matters in the Aboriginal area that need to be pursued and I am sure we will do so in the committee stage. I am sure that the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), who has taken a very close interest in this area-he has been forced to do so for the last 18 months-will be mindful of the changes that are so necessary in the portfolio, particularly as the Government has steamrolled ahead with its determination to set up an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) early next year. I believe that the Government has not been honest with Australian people or with Aborigines throughout Australia, in terms of the political agenda that has driven the formation of ATSIC as opposed to the appropriate spending of taxpayers' money. Mr Acting Deputy President, as you would be so well aware from the personal interest that you took in the debate and the deliberations on the ATSIC legislation, there is no proper way that ATSIC should be kick-started on 1 February, as the Government seems hell-bent on doing, to force the agenda that will quickly aggravate the many problems that have been created. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to spend the remainder of the time available to me addressing the differences in approach and commitment to the tourist industry between the Hawke Labor Government and an alternative Liberal- National Party Government. I would also like to say something about the opportunities that would be given under a coalition government. We have all become familiar with the problems of the pilots dispute. We are months into it and there is no hope of resolution because the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is not prepared to make any commitment whatsoever to getting one. We need to be reminded time and again of how long it is going to take for the consequences of this unresolved dispute to actually have an effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Some constituents of mine in the Northern Territory who have obviously been giving this a lot of consideration are operators in the tourist industry. I would like to draw on some comments that were made today by some of these operators. One operator, Mr Kevin McDonald, the manager of Darwin's Atrium Hotel, has said:</PARA>
<PARA>It may take seven or eight years to overcome something like this. It may be that the hotel industry will never recover. </PARA>
<PARA>John Parsche, who manages another of Darwin's biggest hotels, the Beaufort, said that Australians will be left with nothing to sell overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Penny Tastula, the President of the Darwin Tourist Promotion Association, speaks for many of her members when she says that officials estimate that the Northern Territory tourist industry has lost about $45m through the dispute and that, with only a couple of exceptions, hotels say their occupancy figures have remained at least 50 per cent down on last year. She says that Darwin's Beaufort and Diamond Beach hotels have each cancelled more than 20 conferences and conventions while most Northern Territory hotels report cancellations of room bookings well into next year. She says that almost all of the Top End's 40 tour operators are in debt as a result of the pilots dispute and that at least three of the major operators may not be able to re-open business next year. My office has run a very open and public hot line canvassing the problems and the issues that have affected this industry. There have been hundreds of phone calls, contacts and letters from industry representatives and individual people who have been vitally affected. </PARA>
<PARA> I had a phone call today from an Alice Springs constituent, a Mr David Baldwin, who has invested some $200,000-odd in a specialised red carpet service to a particular upmarket clientele in the tourist industry. Of course, the rug has now been pulled totally from under him. What resort does he have? He has certainly got large debts and large commitments. He has not had a single booking since the end of August. What does this do to such a personal business? Here is a territorian of some 40 years standing who has pioneered taxi services and radio controlled freight delivery services and who has made a commitment to the tourist industry. He has had the rug totally pulled from under him. Because he has some assets he cannot get any assistance from Social Security. Nothing is available to him there. If he walked into the Department of Social Security he would be told, `Sell your assets; sell your business'. That is the sort of commitment that Hawke wants to give. </PARA>
<PARA> I am well aware that the Northern Territory Government has done everything possible to help the small tour operators and the families that have been affected but there is no easy solution. Certainly, the Northern Territory has lost the advantage of the peak tourist season. The Northern Territory Government has been able to stimulate a united effort in the small business and family business area. But the price hikes in air fares that will be the inevitable consequence of this pilots dispute will cause even further major heartache. I am very surprised that my Senate colleague from the Northern Territory, Senator Collins, has had a preoccupation with attacking the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. I have no truck with the pilots or the Pilots Federation and their stance in this dispute. They should have been at the negotiating table far sooner and they should have had an invitation by the Prime Minister to be there. He should have locked the door behind them and held them in the room until there was a resolution. Bob Hawke has walked away--</PARA>

We are going down the gurgler fast because the issue is back squarely with the Prime Minister. I could cite many examples from throughout the Northern Territory of the hurt that is being felt because of the efforts of this Government. Everyone is well aware of the major tourist promotion of the last few years with regard to Australia and, in particular, the Northern Territory. Every Australian can now identify with places such as Kakadu, Mataranka, Daly River, Litchfield Park and Uluru. But where will we go?

The Prime Minister and his Ministers do not appear to believe that an economic crisis exists. They are all running away when the nation is bleeding to death. Certainly, the Northern Territory's second largest industry is a major casualty. Whether one is talking about the family or industry, it appears that the Government must bear the responsibility for what it has done in trying to coordinate the economic climate in Australia. We are in the worst economic situation since the Great Depression. It is totally the responsibility of the Hawke Labor Government, which is absolutely and crucially defenceless--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating this evening cognately the Government's Appropriation Bills. It is in fact the Government's Budget. My belief is that what this centralist socialist Hawke Government has done to this great country of ours over a relatively short period of time can be described as nothing more nor less than a damn shame and a disgrace. We are a large country with a relatively small population, blessed with a very broad range of rich mineral resources, a great primary industry and great plains-for example, the brigalow country in my own State where we produce wheat, beef, wool and so on. Of course, we have the additional benefit of having places of great beauty that people wish to come and see; hence, the recent growth of our tourist industry. In addition, our terms of trade, the money we get for our exports, are at their highest for 10 years. Over the past year they have been at that level. So as a country we have everything going for us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Notwithstanding all these factors, after just over six years of this Hawke Labor Government, our economic position, by whatever measure one takes, is frighteningly precarious. I get no pleasure in making those remarks; I get great displeasure. Julie McIntosh, the 20-year-old president of the apolitical Association of Students in Economics and Commerce, said recently:</PARA>
<PARA>We are getting left behind and if we don't do something about it soon we will end up as a nobody country at the bottom of the world whose economy will work around trying to service its overseas debts. </PARA>
<PARA>What great perception from a 20-year-old. It comes not from a scaremonger with political motive but from a young lady who was reflecting the views of not only the young but every rational thinker who is genuinely concerned about the future of our country. Instead of being the envy of the world, a downturn in our commodity prices would plunge us into recession. Instead of reaping the rewards of record terms of trade, we are besieged by welfare groups pointing to the level of poverty in Australia, the plight of single income families and so on. The National Media Liaison Service even quotes at great length the Minister for Social Security, Mr Howe, in the publication it has put out with the headline `Welfare Record', saying that 1.2 million children in families benefit under welfare. It also says at great length that the Government's policy is directed forwards those families who are poor or near poverty. This Government is saying that, because of its economic policies, 1.2 million children in this country are in or near poverty. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Hill" NAMEID="BH4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He should be ashamed of it, not bragging about the headline `Welfare Record'. But neither he nor the Government seems to recognise that the higher the level of people receiving welfare payments, the greater the indictment of its failed economic policies. They are directly proportional. I am not referring to those people with physical or mental disabilities; I am talking about people described by this Government itself as being in or near poverty. That comes about only because of economic policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Instead of reaping the rewards of what should be good times, firstly, we have a net foreign debt which, in the term of the Hawke socialist Labor Government, has risen from $23 billion to $108 billion; and, secondly, for the second time since this Government has come to power, two recent significant downgradings have occurred of our international credit rating by the two international credit rating agencies, Moody's Investors Service and Standard and Poor's Inc. I cannot help observing that the name of one of the agencies is Standard and Poor's. Regrettably, it is not a bad description of the state to which Labor has brought Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the inflation rate is now 8.3 per cent and rising. For almost the whole period of the Hawke Government, our inflation rate has consistently been about twice the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development average. Senator McKiernan, who usually speaks fairly wisely about these things, said during his speech in this debate that the Hawke Government had to be proud of what it had done about the inflation rate. Senator McKiernan said that when the Hawke Government came into power the inflation rate was 6.9 per cent and that a year later, in 1984-85, it was 4.3 per cent. The reason that it came down to 4.3 per cent was as a direct result of the Fraser Government's wages freeze. Year in and year out it has gone up steadily. Currently, it is running at about 8.3 per cent, notwithstanding that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in his last Budget Speech said that he expected the inflation rate to fall below 7.5 per cent. Pigs might fly! Fourthly, home mortgage rates are not only at a record high but also by far the highest in the industrialised world. I do not have to go into that; numerous articles have been written on that subject and the affordability of homes in Australia as a result of those high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> We are in drastic times. The blame can only be laid squarely at the feet of this Government, which lacks foresight and which has persisted with antiquated centralised solutions instead of stimulating the initiative of individual Australians. That is what the coalition parties are on about. Yesterday's solutions are clearly not solving today's problems. Monetary policy, with resultant high interest rates, is the only lever being pulled by the Government. That may have worked 20 years ago, but not today. The reasons are really quite simple: a deregulated financial system means that financial institutions are able to offer domestic borrowers far greater flexibility, which was not available 20 years ago. There is not much difference to home buyers between cheaper houses with higher interest rates and dearer houses with lower interest rates. What high interest rates do, however, is depress new housing starts. </PARA>
<PARA> The other major problem is that our inflation rate and high level of marginal taxation rates are an inbuilt disincentive to save. While attempting to dampen domestic consumption with high interest rates, what is totally ignored, or seemingly not even recognised, is that high interest rates are a major cause of our continuing current account deficit and increasing debt. It should be noted that the net incomes component of the current account deficit-that is, the difference between interest and dividends paid overseas and interest and dividends received from Australia-is locked in at around $1,100m a month. That has been going on for the last 12 to 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of our high interest rates, manufacturers cannot compete with imports from countries where bank lending rates are as much as one-third of Australian rates. Current overdraft rates in Australia are around 21 per cent compared with 6 per cent in, say, Japan. This not only precludes our manufacturers from holding their own domestic markets, but our inflexible centralised wage fixing system and grossly inefficient waterfront practices preclude any consideration of exporting those manufactured goods if they do make them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is possible to borrow from overseas banks at interest rates of about 9 per cent, compared to the 21 per cent charged by Australian banks, particularly if one is exporting commodities in United States dollars. This applies to all areas, whether it be the resources, primary industry or tourism area. An exporter would be a fool not to take advantage of those lower rates. By exporting in United States dollars there is really no exchange risk. That is why it is happening. I believe the Australian Democrats should take this point on board when they call for the abolition of foreign borrowings by the private sector. Having regard to a 50 : 50 debt ratio, there are export projects which will go ahead if the money is borrowed at 9 per cent interest rate which would not go ahead at a 21 per cent interest rate. </PARA>
<PARA> What one would hope would eventually sink in is the fact that our domestic interest rates are contributing to the level of private sector foreign debt. It is no good blaming the person in the business sector; he is making a proper entrepreneurial decision to borrow so that his project will be viable. I note that Senator Sanders is looking at me. I say to him that if one is in the export trade, selling in United States dollars, there is no exchange risk; hence the reason for borrowing at those rates. No business person who gains satisfaction from building an enterprise wants to hand it over to someone else. People starting a small business must borrow if they wish to continue to control their own enterprise. Of course, this country started in that way. People set up a business with few resources and try to hang on to it. I suppose it could be argued that they have an opportunity to sell out to one of the big guys, but they may not want to do that, they may want to hang on. The only option they have is to borrow, and they have to borrow at a rate which makes the project viable. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding our inherent wealth, with 80 per cent of our exports in the mining and primary industries, we cannot make the goods that Australians want or need to buy. This is the critical problem in this country today. Our mining and primary products are cost efficient, mainly because nature has blessed us with special resources. We should not forget that. We are not as efficient as we could be, even in those great cost effective industries, but we are fortunate. I believe we must look at adding value to those commodities. There is some value added in capital and power intensive industries such as the aluminium industry, but in the main our minerals are treated, refined and exported to be made into finished products overseas. I add that the loonies who put paid to the Wesley Vale pulp mill in Tasmania were from the same Luddite tribe which attempted to stop the construction of the Portland aluminium smelter. I wonder how many people in this chamber remember the chant, `Stop the construction of the smelter, it will export canned electricity'. Yet it was producing a value added product. It was one of the few areas in which we had taken advantage of turning our raw materials into value added products, instead of just exporting the raw materials itself. The difference, of course, was that the coalition Government at the time had the interests of Australia at heart, which enabled construction of that smelter to go ahead. Under this Government I have no doubt that it would have been stopped or at least delayed. When such projects are delayed people lose confidence and in many cases walk away from them. </PARA>
<PARA> If it was attractive to process our minerals further, it would be done. I will come to why I believe it is not being done. Everyone must recognise that non-renewable resources are just that, and eventually, because of depth, lower grades or the introduction of substitutes, operations will close. The reasons that we are not doing further processing must be identified and addressed, otherwise generations to come can expect a dismal future. They will look back with contempt at the stupidity of this generation. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the vast majority of Australians have no sense of urgency because this Government in particular has made sure that they are not aware of the depth of our problems. The attitude is, `Things have been great, we live in a marvellous country and the position will improve next year'. If we look at every Budget Speech made by the Treasurer over the past six years we find that he said, `Don't worry, by the end of next year things will be right, we will have turned the corner'. The real position is that because of our almost total dependence on commodities, a collapse in world commodity prices would be as devastating to Australia as a war. Unless there is a profound change in the economic history of the world, there will be a cyclical downturn in demand for our commodities by other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Investment is not made in the manufacturing sector because people perceive that there are more predictable and better ways of protecting one's savings. We have a real estate mentality in Australia, which is no different from the gold mentality of some South East Asian countries where people move into gold investment when there is political or economic turmoil because their savings are protected and it can be easily traded. In Australia people move into real estate to protect their savings. This investment contributes absolutely nothing to the wealth creation of the economy. They invest in real estate because it is more secure and does not have the hassles or uncertainty associated with investing in business enterprises. The collapse of major organisations such as Ariadne, Rothwells or Bond provides a major disincentive to the ordinary person to invest in wealth creation. Added to this is the complexity of the Government's regulations and charges. </PARA>
<PARA> Foreign investment in Australia is geared towards resources and tourism. The question is often asked, `Why don't foreign investors invest in manufacturing?'. The answer is that we would all like to see them do that but one cannot persuade them by force. One must look at why they are not doing it. The answer is that there are other parts of the world whose manufacturing sectors are more attractive for investment. Australia has raw materials, natural wealth, the necessary expertise and our people are educated, yet Australia is not the place in which they wish to invest. If it were attractive, the investments would be made. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many reasons for this lack of foreign investment. The major reasons are that we have an inflexible, centralised wage fixing system, terrible work practices, an unenviable record on disputations and hold-ups, and a shocking reputation for unreliability. We are also a long way from major markets and we have a relatively small domestic market. In the June 1989 edition of the Far East Business publication, an article appears on the reforms needed on our waterfront. Being an island continent relying so much on exports, our waterfront is vital to the prosperity of this country. The Far East Business is read by people in the Far East who either wish to invest in this country or wish to purchase goods from this country. It is worth quoting some points from this article. In fact, I was ashamed to read it. As a person who is very proud of my country, I found the facts appalling. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's reputation as an unreliable, expensive and inefficient port operator has been a major barrier to international trade. </PARA>
<PARA>The article states that a study by the Business Council of Australia found that-and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Australian ports are half as productive as European ports and only 40 per cent as productive as many Asian ports. </PARA>
<PARA> Peter Dexter, president of the Australian Chamber of Shipping, which represents foreign and domestic shipping companies, agrees. ``There is just no comparison with Europe, South America or Asia,'' he says, adding that Australia even lags behind `banana republic' ports of Chile in its efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe I have heard that sort of comment before from our own Treasurer. The article made these other points:</PARA>
<PARA> The lost opportunities in exports through this are frightening. </PARA>
<PARA>In respect of meat, this comment is made:</PARA>
<PARA>The Japanese demand precise delivery dates and the greater reliability of U.S. suppliers tends to swing buyers in its favour. Australian meat producers also fear they will miss out on much of a new 70,000 ton market opening up in Korea . . . </PARA>
<PARA>because of these problems. Since that time we have seen the $200 a container surcharge being put on containers in the Port of Sydney. All these problems should be surmountable for people who have the benefits of this country at heart. I do not care what their position is, be they in the trade union movement, the business sector or whatever. For instance, our entrenched problems in respect of work practices and unreliability could be swept away if only there was a little bit of understanding that the work practices destroy productivity, destroy industries, destroy enterprises and destroy jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Where, however, there is a monopoly-whether it be a monopoly organisation or a monopoly union-controlling essential areas such as our ports, the removal of restrictive work practices will open up export vistas which are beyond the reach of much of Australian industry today. I was disappointed with the in-principle agreement on the waterfront. I would have expected the first aim of this in-principle agreement to be the achievement of a standard of efficiency that is better than that in any other port in the world. It is no good for a country as far removed from its markets as we are to have ports equal to ports in other countries. We should aim to be the best in the world. I would have thought that this is the sort of pursuit of excellence that we, as a country, should be looking to today. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation is ludicrous, I believe, in that we have a country that stretches from nearly the Equator in the north almost to the Antarctic in the south, from the Pacific Ocean to the Indian Ocean, yet we have a group of people in Melbourne in the Industrial Relations Commission who determine wage rates for the whole country. It does not make any sense. It is like the sort of regulation that I often hear my colleague Senator Sanders talk about in the Civil Aviation Authority. It is a myth. If someone lives in Launceston, Hobart or Bundaberg and is asked to move to Sydney that person will not move without a sufficient increase in wages or salary to pay for those costs. It is a myth. It is ludicrous that under the so-called accord national productivity increases are applied across the board with the productive subsidising the unproductive. This guarantees that the unproductive will survive. </PARA>
<PARA> We must look to countries that have been successful: our near neighbours Japan, Taiwan and Korea. Last year in Korea a bipartisan parliamentary delegation of which I was a member met with South Korean trade union representatives. It turned out that just before we arrived one of the major companies had agreed to a 23 per cent wage increase. When asked whether this increase had flowed on to other companies or other industries, the union leaders were taken aback. They pointed out in no uncertain terms that they were interested in nurturing business not destroying it. They said that their aim was for all business to grow so that they could afford the same sorts of increases. In fact, those representatives made the comment that they were not about to destroy business at birth. What a difference in attitude to Australia! If we are to improve our position we must come around to that way of thinking. Until we move to genuine enterprise employment, agreements with wage rates determined at the work place and based on productivity increases at the enterprise level, we will continue to decline to what Julie McIntosh, as I mentioned earlier in my speech, described as a nobody country at the bottom of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> In seven years this centralist socialist Government has reduced Australia to a country with a precarious economic position. The coalition has produced a blueprint-an economic plan which provides the recipe for recovery of this great country. It is a great country. It is a country with natural inherent wealth, as I keep saying over and over again. One of the few areas of progress is my own State of Queensland. There are some exciting developments on the horizon in that State: the Cape York Space Agency, a stainless steel plant in Townsville, a steel mill in Gladstone. </PARA>

There are companies from both Japan and Taiwan that would like to put a steel mill in Queensland. The only thing that will prevent them from doing so is the uncertainty of our industrial relations-in particular whether they could bring ships, for instance, from the Pilbara to Gladstone without having to use the coastal shipping system as we have it today. Ideally, ships would come from Japan, pick up iron ore in the Pilbara, take it to Gladstone, dump the iron ore off and pick up coal, and take it back to Japan. So there would be a triangular course. Will Senator McKiernan's militant colleagues in the Seamen's Union of Australia, through the Australian Council of Trade Unions, allow that to happen? I mentioned that the Opposition has a recipe for recovery. Basically the summary of it is: tax rates will be cut; interest rates will be lowered; government will be smaller; inflation will be reduced; productivity and real wages will be higher and the growth in foreign debt will be brought under control.</PARA></TALK.START>

When looking at the destruction of the value added Wesley Vale project in Tasmania and the delay of the Coronation Hill project, which might be its demise, people involved are taking a particular view at the moment. They are talking to me and presumably they are talking to Senator McKiernan. They are saying, `Look, is it worth the hassle? There are other places where we can make investments. To hell with them'. The people of Queensland will see that under a Labor State government the development era in Queensland will be over. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1989-90 and cognate Bills. One of the biggest wastes of money in the Budget is the ongoing study into the Royal Australian Navy move to Jervis Bay. At the moment environmental impact statements (EIS) and a number of other studies are being conducted which are a great waste of money because the Navy should not be moving to Jervis Bay in the first place. In 1987 the Federal Labor Government announced that it proposed to relocate naval facilities from Sydney to Jervis Bay at a cost exceeding $1.2 billion. Engineering consultants, Sinclair, Knight and Partners Pty Ltd (SKP), were commissioned to produce an environmental impact statement for the proposed move. The EIS has been described by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, as probably one of the most complex to be dealt with under Federal environmental law. The EIS contract was initially for $1.5m but in less than three years it has grown to $3.1m. A further $5.3m has so far been spent on planning studies by the Department of Administrative Services and the Department of Defence is spending another $5.5m on the most comprehensive studies of Jervis Bay's marine ecosystem ever done. Yet, most of the results have come too late to be incorporated in the EIS.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Even before any formal Cabinet decision is made on the future of Jervis Bay about $14m has been committed to the relocation plan. In mid-1989 the preliminary draft EIS for Jervis Bay was deemed inadequate by the Federal Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, causing the public release of the draft EIS to be delayed from April 1989 to early 1990. In particular the justification for and alternatives to the relocation have not been adequately investigated. In September 1989, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who had previously been a strong advocate of the Jervis Bay plan, directed the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) to re-evaluate thoroughly alternative schemes. Regardless of this directive, work on the EIS is continuing with the intention of completing it with a minimum of further delay. The study of alternatives will be separate from the draft EIS. </PARA>
<PARA> I will document evidence, uncovered in a survey of the work of Sinclair Knight and Partners, which suggests that SKP lacks the competence and independence to produce an adequate EIS for the Jervis Bay plan. The evidence also reveals that three firms, which have performed key studies for or related to the EIS, have engaged in seriously questionable practices in the course of other work. They are Hill and Knowlton Australia Pty Ltd, which is monitoring public awareness of and reaction to the EIS; Anutech Pty Ltd, which evaluated the impact of defence activities on Jervis Bay's Aboriginal sites; and Kinhill Engineers Pty Ltd, which was commissioned by the Department of Defence to investigate Twofold Bay, New South Wales, as a possible alternative naval port to Jervis Bay. </PARA>
<PARA> This evidence renders the Jervis Bay EIS an unreliable document, which cannot be significantly improved by the last minute window-dressing which is now on the way. The EIS should be abandoned. The significance of this goes beyond the Jervis Bay project. It calls into question the entire system of assessing the environmental impact of major projects and underscores the need for substantial reforms in Federal environmental law. First, I shall talk about Sinclair Knight and Partners and its organisational philosophy. A Sinclair Knight and Partners publicity brochure of March 1987 says:</PARA>
<PARA>Environmental services: . . . Our specialists know the relevant authorities and can assist in meeting complex requirements so that timely approvals can be acquired. </PARA>
<PARA>This statement, which was published in the same month that SKP won the Jervis Bay contract, is an unambiguous admission that it performs environmental studies in order to win approval for construction projects. SKP's approach is hardly surprising. Its publicity brochure lists as key areas of expertise the planning of bridges, buildings, coastal engineering projects, dams, highways, factories, mines, ports, marinas, urban developments and railways. </PARA>
<PARA> Revenue from its environmental services accounted for only 8 per cent of all income in the 1987-88 financial year. In short, SKP is an engineering firm whose corporate priority is to ensure that construction projects proceed. Furthermore, environmental impact statements are paid for and supervised by the company or bureaucracy which proposes the project-the Defence Department in the case of Jervis Bay. An EIS consultant which earns a reputation for opposing projects it studies is, of course, unlikely to win further contracts.</PARA>
<PARA> I shall now mention some recent SKP environmental studies. In recent times SKP has completed several environmental studies which have drawn damning criticisms from official and independent expert assessors. One of the studies involved an EIS for the controversial Wesley Vale pulp mill. Two were assessments of contamination caused by a toxic waste dump on which homes had been built in the Brisbane suburb of Kingston, and two were EISs for a proposed marina and hotel project at Woolloomooloo in Sydney. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard some of the quotes from the Hansard record and extracts from letters. </PARA>

<PARA> STUDIES OF THE IMPACT OF A BURIED TOXIC WASTE DUMP IN KINGSTON</PARA>
<PARA>(Carried out by SKP for the Queensland Government and Logan City Council, 1987 &amp; 1989)</PARA>
<PARA>Institute of Applied Environmental Research (Griffith University) report to the Logan City Council, June 1989:</PARA>
<PARA> The . . . dumping of hazardous wastes in the Kingston area has been the subject of two reports by Sinclair Knight and Partners [in 1987 and 1989] which were commissioned by the [Logan City] Council and the [Queensland] Government. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . [This review is] an independent assessment of [SKP's] two reports . . .</PARA>
<PARA> . . . [It] is the review team's opinion that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The field investigations were poorly conceived and implemented and hence the resulting database is of suspect quality. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Sufficient care was not taken to ensure samples were representative of the materials under investigation, whether it be the hazardous substances, soils or waters, and hence the conclusions drawn from the interpretation of the analytical results are unreliable. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. The unexplained approach to sampling and analysis limits the usefulness of the investigations. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. The nature of the source of contamination has not been adequately characterised. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. The extent of contamination of groundwaters has not been established at either of the waste disposal sites. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. The study has generally concentrated on hazards for public safety and appears to have ignored possible hazards to the environment, i.e. wildlife and aquatic life in the local water courses. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. There appears to have been no quality control programme in existence to detect and correct the inadequacies of the investigation and sampling programs. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. It is possible that the waste materials at the site do not represent a significant hazard to public health (other than direct contact), but the investigations undertaken are inadequate to establish this. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. In view of the findings of this review, little weight should be placed on the results of [SKP's] investigations to define the nature and extent of contamination. Further, more reliable investigations are required. </PARA>
<PARA>THE WOOLLOOMOOLOO MARINA EIS's</PARA>
<PARA>(Carried out by SKP and Masterplan for Pivot Group, Wardley Australia and Woolloomooloo Marina, 1987; and by SKP for Pivot Group, 1989)</PARA>
<PARA>Sydney City Council, Evaluation of the 1987 EIS, 27 October 1987:</PARA>
<PARA> [T]he claim that the marina moorings and the land facilities are visually non-intrusive cannot be sustained . . . </PARA>
<PARA> [T]he perspectives illustrating the marina concept grossly underestimate the visual impact . . . </PARA>
<PARA> [C]laims made in the EIS . . . that development of [a] smaller lease area is financially unacceptable cannot be sustained . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The EIS has not considered the environmental and visual benefits of the demolition of the wharf and the restoration of public access to the bay foreshores . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Sydney Morning Herald, 28 November 1987:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Dick Smyth, the director of the [NSW] Department of Planning and Environment, said the system of assessing the environmental impact of major projects was fast approaching a crisis of credibility. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . [E]nvironmental impact statements . . . were often inadequate, failed to address relevant issues, were misleading and used contradictory and biased information. </PARA>
<PARA> They were often lacking substance, or contained superficial analysis. He called part of the [1987] EIS for the Woolloomooloo marina that said `the removal of the Finger Wharf will reinstate the original landscape of the bay', a classic of more recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> They also failed to adequately justify projects . . . and sometimes tended to be a justification for a prior decision. </PARA>
<PARA> `I can think of the [1987] (Woolloomooloo) marina EIS and Maldon Dumbarton railway as being two classics in that category', he said. </PARA>
<PARA>Sydney Morning Herald, 12 May 1989:</PARA>
<PARA> [After the Woolloomooloo project was abandoned by the Unsworth Government, then revived in modified form under the Greiner Government-incorporating a 400-room hotel, commercial areas, marina, retail shops, restaurants and car parks-with SKP producing the second EIS, in 1989.]</PARA>
<PARA> The $280 million Woolloomooloo Finger Wharf development was dealt a potentially fatal blow last night after the Central Sydney Planning Committee refused approval for a multi-storey hotel on the site . . . </PARA>
<PARA> It also considered the [1989] Environmental Impact Statement `inadequate'. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1J4">Senator SANDERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The studies cited above were all completed while SKP was working on the Jervis Bay EIS. Two of the projects studied-and approved-by SKP were later rejected by the Federal Government, namely, the Woolloomooloo project, for which the Federal Treasurer (Mr Keating) blocked foreign investment on the grounds that it was `contrary to the national interest', and the Wesley Vale pulp mill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Commonwealth approval has not been an issue in the Kingston toxic waste scandal, because the Federal Government has left the matter entirely to the Queensland Government. Residents groups in Kingston strongly believe that SKP's reports understated the hazard, thus assisting the Queensland Government's attempts to minimise political damage and clean-up costs. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be stressed that the Jervis Bay EIS will be inadequate if it contains just one of the flaws found in these SKP reports, namely, justification of a prior decision; inadequate consideration of alternatives; poor scientific methods; a lack of substance; superficial analysis; ignorance of the marine environment and of toxic substances; lack of consideration of impacts on archeological and anthropological, that is, Aboriginal, sites, fishing and tourism; and underestimation of the visual impact of maritime structures. </PARA>
<PARA> How about the independence of this firm? The successful conduct of environment impact assessments requires more than scientific and analytical competence. The study consultant must also be demonstrably independent of the proponent. Despite official assurances, there is clear evidence that the Jervis Bay EIS does not meet this requirement. Commodore Viv Littlewood, of the Royal Australian Navy, in an article in the Winter 1989 issue of the Naval Ensign, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Jervis Bay EIS process is not a whitewash, as the consultant [Sinclair Knight and Partners] is completely independent of Defence and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the following statement was made in the Australian Financial Review of 23 January 1989:</PARA>
<PARA> An Australian-Dutch consortium expects to be awarded a . . . contract this month to [plan] a new [$2 billion] Indian naval base . . . </PARA>
<PARA> However, this contract . . . hangs on the imminent trip through [Asia] of the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Bruce Sinclair, director of the consultancy firm Sinclair Knight and Partners, which heads the Australian-Dutch consortium, said: `We are still hanging by our thumbs. Bob Hawke's visit will be very critical in timing'. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> . . . [The consortium] is . . . facing a last minute challenge from a rival French group . . . [who are] about to play their trump card . . . with the forthcoming visit to India of President Mitterand. </PARA>
<PARA> [He] is expected to lobby the Indian Prime Minister, Mr Gandhi, strongly on behalf of the French group. In status-conscious Asia the endorsement by a head of state of a corporate venture can be decisive. This is why Mr Hawke's visit is crucial. </PARA>
<PARA>The following statement appeared in the Pacific Defence Reporter of May 1989:</PARA>
<PARA>An important breakthrough into the Indian defence scene marked the recent award to an Australian/Dutch engineering partnership of a key consultancy contract for planning and designing a huge new naval base . . . on India's west coast . . . known as Project Seabird. </PARA>
<PARA> The . . . consultancy . . . will be worth about $US5 million. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> ``A special factor in our success was the support of the Australian Government'', [consultancy team leader Bruce Sinclair] said. </PARA>
<PARA> ``Defence Minister Beazley met the Indian Navy delegation when it visited Australia and volunteered his support for our partnership. In preparing the bid, we had the support of Australian Construction Services [ACS], the Trade Commissioner Service and other Government agencies.'' . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Sinclair also touched on the work of . . . Sinclair Knight and Partners as consultants to the [RAN] and [ACS] on modernizing Garden Island dockyard and on the planning and Environmental Impact Study of the proposed RAN facilities at Jervis Bay. </PARA>
<PARA> ``. . . [T]he RAN and [ACS] have developed `state of the art' naval support facilities . . .'', he said. ``This was apparent to the Indian Navy assessment group.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact that the patronage of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence was crucial to the success of the bid by SKP's consortium raises grave doubts about SKP's independence in its conduct of the Jervis Bay EIS. Mr Hawke until very recently and Mr Beazley have been the strongest advocates of the relocation plan. In fact, Mr Hawke has said in media interviews said that he `initiated the move'. </PARA>
<PARA> SKP's independence is further compromised by its role, as acknowledged by Mr Sinclair, in helping to plan the Jervis Bay facilities in addition to conducting the EIS. According to Mr Beazley, SKP's planning role was to `survey possible sites in the Jervis Bay region for naval facilities'. SKP's wealth of knowledge of the Jervis Bay proposal and of the relevant planning issues in particular puts it in a unique position to win contracts for the further planning and design of proposed facilities. It appears to be in SKP's interests that the project be approved. SKP had a similar conflict of interest in the Wesley Vale pulp mill case. In its 1987-88 annual report, SKP revealed that it had joined forces with Canadian engineering consultants Sandwell Swan Wooster to transfer `specialised pulp and paper technology' to Australia. It listed amongst its clients `North Broken Hill Ltd at Wesley Vale in Tasmania'. With the prospect of further work arising from the proposed new mill, it was perhaps predictable that SKP would produce a favourable EIS. </PARA>
<PARA> It could be argued that SKP has already demonstrated its independence of the Federal Government by producing EISs at variance with Government preferences in the Woolloomooloo marina and Wesley Vale cases. However, this is a false conclusion. Neither project was opposed by the Federal Government until after the EISs were completed. In fact, the Prime Minister had initially given strong support to the Wesley Vale project, which he toned down only in response to environment movement pressure following the release of the draft EIS. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings us to the firm of Hill and Knowlton. As I have mentioned before in this Parliament, it has been involved in spying on community groups. In 1988, a report of the 4 September 1987 business meeting of the Jervis Bay Protection Committee-a key local environmental organisation opposed to the naval relocation-was leaked from Defence Department files. The activities and some statements of the Committee's leading activists were recorded. Some of this information was clearly directed at identifying ways to discredit those activists. The wording of this report indicates that it was written by someone who had attended the meeting to spy on behalf of the proponents of the relocation of naval facilities to Jervis Bay. The Federal Government denied any knowledge of spying and dismissed the matter as `mickey mouse stuff'. That reference can be found in the Senate Hansard of 7 December 1988. The world's largest public relations firm, the United States based Hill and Knowlton, admitted monitoring the Committee as part of its EIS work but claimed that its role was legitimate. The Canberra Times of 8 December 1988 said:</PARA>
<PARA>A spokesman for Hill and Knowlton, a subcontractor for Sinclair Knight and Partners which is carrying out the [Jervis Bay] EIS for the Department of Defence, said that as part of his company's program of monitoring public awareness of and reaction to the EIS, `stringers' or casual employees regularly attended public meetings, including meetings of the [Jervis Bay] Protection Committee. Information was then passed on to Sinclair Knight and Partners. </PARA>
<PARA>While it is true that public meetings have been monitored, so too have the Protection Committee's business meetings, such as the 4 September 1987 meeting of which a record was leaked. These business meetings are open only to limited attendance by prospective new members. At no time have the planted observers identified themselves as such, which indicates that their motives were far from honourable. </PARA>
<PARA> While watertight proof of Hill and Knowlton's covert monitoring of Protection Committee business committee meetings cannot be obtained, it has a case to answer. It is worth noting that Hill and Knowlton's Australian arm has a history of involvement with espionage. The Age of 24 July 1989 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Australian spies worked in South-East Asia under cover provided by the `king' of Australian public relations, Eric White. </PARA>
<PARA> The agents were recruited and trained by the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, whereupon they were assigned to Mr White, who sent them to Asian cities as representatives of his firm, Eric White Associates. </PARA>
<PARA> This arrangement operated well into the time of the Whitlam Government (1972-1975) . . . In the mid-70s, [Eric White Associates] became part of Hill and Knowlton, the giant American public-relations and publishing group. </PARA>
<PARA>Brian Toohey and William Pinwill in Oyster: the story of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, 1989, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>By providing cover for ASIS spies-who routinely engage in deception, misrepresentation, bribery and law-breaking-the Australian PR firm-[a reference to Eric White Associates, which Toohey &amp; Pinwill were forbidden from identifying] breached at least seven of the seventeen articles of th[e] code of ethics [of the Public Relations Institute of Australia]. </PARA>
<PARA>These revelations were of sufficient concern to the Indonesian Government for it to recently sever its links with Hill and Knowlton's Australian operations. On 31 August 1989 the Australian Financial Review stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Jakarta's concern hinges on the fact that . . . Hill and Knowlton, which has owned Eric White [Associates] since the mid-1970s, for more than a decade has been employed by the Indonesian Government as close adviser on the international dissemination of economic promotional material. </PARA>
<PARA> As such, Hill and Knowlton PR staffers, many of them in the past drawn from Eric White Associates in Australia, have enjoyed a long-standing position of privileged access to Indonesian ministers and other leaders in an often-secretive government. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Hill and Knowlton is still operating for the Indonesian Government in Jakarta. Eric White, now treated as a separate entity . . . by the Indonesian Government, is not. </PARA>
<PARA>As to campaigning against the environment, Hill and Knowlton's Australian operation has shown a willingness to promote projects which could pose serious dangers to the environment. In Western Australia, for example, it is handling public relations for the French-based multinational chemical company Rhone-Poulenc, which is proposing to establish a rare earths separation plant at Pinjarra. The plant would produce large quantities of radioactive waste and other hazardous by-products. In 1988 Western Australia's Environmental Protection Authority rejected the proposal because of doubts that the wastes could be safely disposed of. Rhone-Poulenc has now proposed a controversial new scheme, which includes the disposal of radioactive ammonium nitrate by pumping it underground. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian alliance between Rhone-Poulenc and Hill and Knowlton had its origins in France, where the two firms combined to wage a successful anti-environmental campaign. Their victory is proudly described in an extraordinary memo from Hill and Knowlton to its international branches. It is graphic evidence of a disturbing corporate philosophy. The heading of the memo reads `Getting Results Through Strategy and Action'. The memo states:</PARA>
<PARA> Did you know that Hill and Knowlton helped the largest French chemical manufacturer deter the government from imposing a nationwide ban on the use of phosphates in detergents?</PARA>
<PARA>The memo goes on in that vein to brag about how this organisation stopped the environmentalists in France from instituting environmental controls. I seek leave of the Senate to incorporate the memo in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA>46...March 15, 1988</PARA>
<PARA> Did you know that Hill and Knowlton helped the largest French chemical manufacturer deter the government form imposing a nationwide ban on the use of phosphates in detergents?</PARA>
<PARA> The French chemical company Rhone-Poulenc is a major producer of phosphates, which are non-toxic organic compounds commonly used in the manufacture of laundry detergents, among other products. Phosphates in effluents discharged into lakes, streams, and rivers contribute to the oxygen depletion in the affected bodies of water, resulting in algae growth and other ecological disturbances. </PARA>
<PARA> In a response to the rising public concern about the deleterious effects of phosphates on the environment, the governments of Italy, Switzerland, and West Germany recently passed sweeping legislation that bans the use or drastically reduces the allowable levels of phosphates in detergents. In France, meanwhile, environmental groups and others were clamouring for the swift enactment of similar legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Rhone-Poulenc feared that such a harsh measure would force the company to close a number of its plants and, consequently, lay off hundreds of workers. The company challenged Hill and Knowlton/Paris to developed and implement a comprehensive campaign that would help thwart the passage of stringent government regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Paris office suggested that Rhone-Poulenc could counter the arguments for controlling phosphates in detergents by presenting solid evidence that the regulation would have widespread undesired economic effects on the company's plant communities. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the phosphate issue was a hot media topic, Hill and Knowlton organized a task force comprising six Rhone-Poulenc researchers, detergent experts, and marketing and environmental specialists who met regularly with H&amp;K representatives to review the campaign strategy and determine further actions to handle troublesome issues as they emerged. </PARA>
<PARA> H&amp;K/Paris then began monitoring European media coverage and conducting in-depth research of the phosphate problem. A ``who's who'' list of 1,500 government officials, community leaders, media representatives and environmental experts who could influence the outcome of any decision to regulate phosphate was prepared. Backgrounders, educational booklets, authoritative brochures, and an economic impact study also were developed for the various target audiences. A corporate advertising and mailing campaign designed to point out the distinct product benefits of phosphate detergents was launched as well, with the 7,000 distributors of detergents in France the primary target. In addition, the task force members participated in media training sessions to prepare for potential crisis communications responsibilities and for a major news conference held at Rhone-Poulenc's research centre in Lyons. </PARA>
<PARA> To relate the client's viewpoint to government leaders, H&amp;K assisted Rhone-Poulenc in lobbying key decision-makers in the relevant ministries. Another significant component of the government relations program was the presentation of a 15-minute video highlighting the devastating effects of phosphate controls on the economies of U.S. and Swedish plant communities. Two 10-minute videos also were produced for tentative television broadcast. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, H&amp;K arranged for Rhone-Poulenc's active participation in industry symposia and roundtable discussions on pollution-related issues-most notably the World Conference on Detergents, where a company executive delivered a keynote speech-to position the company as taking the initiative to tackle a difficult problem. </PARA>
<PARA> H&amp;K's campaign proved invaluable to Rhone-Poulenc: The French government dropped pending legislation against the use of phosphates in detergents. The campaign also deterred consumer interest in a newly introduced non-phosphate detergent. Rhone-Poulenc was so pleased with the program's outcome that it retained H&amp;K to extend the campaign to other countries, including Spain and Belgium. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will move on to a local firm called ANUTECH Pty Ltd, the Australian National University's consulting agency which has been subcontracted to perform one of the most sensitive studies for the Jervis Bay EIS-as assessment of the impact of Jervis Bay defence activities on Aboriginal sites. Jervis Bay's Aboriginal communities-the Jerringa community from Bundoola's Place on the Beecroft Peninsula on the north side and the Wreck Bay people on the south side-are strongly opposed to the relocation plan, reinforcing the need for the utmost integrity to be shown by ANUTECH. ANUTECH's report from the Jervis Bay EIS is not available, but assessments have been obtained of studies done by it of the impact of two other proposed projects on Aboriginal values-a sand mine at Gerroa in New South Wales and a mining exploration program at El Sherana near Coronation Hill in Kakadu; in the sickness country of the Jawoyn people. In both cases, ANUTECH acted against Aboriginal interests in profoundly unscientific ways. On 16 July 1989 the Sun-Herald stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> An archaeologist, who recommended sand mining should not proceed on a site on the NSW South Coast because it contained important Aboriginal artefacts, has discovered her report was later changed without her knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Sarah Colley, an archaeologist from the Australian National University in Canberra, was contacted last October by the ANU's consulting agency, ANUTECH, to survey a proposed sand mining site near Seven Mile Beach at Gerroa. </PARA>
<PARA> She found `rich, archaeological deposits', including 5,000-year-old shell middens and stone tools, indicating a once-thriving Aboriginal population in an area now owned by a local concrete company, Cleary Bros. </PARA>
<PARA> But in December, a report was published in her name recommending that sand quarrying should be permitted in some areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Allan Lance, ANUTECH's executive archaeologist, admitted to the Sun-Herald last week that he changed the report without Dr Colley's permission after doing a further survey of the site . . . </PARA>
<PARA> This report was attached to the Environment Impact Statement performed by two consulting engineering firms, Hardcastle &amp; Richards and Dames &amp; Moore, on behalf of Cleary Bros. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Last week, Dr Colley said she was disgusted at the alteration of her report. </PARA>
<PARA> `I'm not doing any more work for them', she said. </PARA>
<PARA>I now refer to the misrepresentation of the Jawoyn people. The El Sherana mineral exploration program is a project of BHP Gold Mines Ltd and the Coronation Hill joint venture. In 1988, BHP Gold commissioned ANUTECH to conduct an archaeological survey of the El Sherana site. The study was conducted for ANUTECH by a Canadian PhD student, Paul Tacon. In his report, Tacon not only dealt with archaeological matters but also offered his assessment of the attitude of the Jawoyn elders to mining, and gave advice on the tactics BHP Gold should employ to expedite exploration approval. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a section of a report by Paul Tacon of ANUTECH to BHP Gold and the Coronation Hill joint venture in October 1988 entitled An archaeological survey of the BHP Gold lease at El Sherana. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The report read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Survey methods: . . . [Jawoyn traditional elders] Peter Jatbula, Sandy Barraway and Nipper Brown were consulted . . . [but] declined to visit the area and said there was ``nothing there''. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Conclusions and recommendations [No. 3.4]: The more senior [Jawoyn] men did not express much concern about exploration in the El Sh[e]rana lease . . . At a recent meeting of all concerned [Jawoyn], BHP Gold, the Northern Land Council, the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Protection Authority and others at Barunga, it was decided by the [Jawoyn] community that some limited exploration may soon be able to commence . . . Politics and personalities have made cooperation with the Sacred Sites Authority difficult and it is suggested that the best approach is to develop stronger ties with the Northern Land Council and [Jawoyn] elders. It is not advisable to employ an anthropologist to establish the nature of individual [Jawoyn] ties to the Upper South Alligator Valley as this is already being done by the Northern Land Council for the [Jawoyn] land claim. If a rival research study was commissioned at this point there could be much conflict, bad feelings and, eventually, drawn-out court battles. . . . With the air of reconciliation that arose out of the recent Barunga meeting among the Jawoyn it now seems probably [sic] that they wish to make a viable compromise and it is therefore within BHP Gold's interests not to impede this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service archaeologist whose job it was to review Tacon's report generally agreed with his archaeological conclusions. But the comments he gave drew sharp criticism. A minute from I. P. Haskovec of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (Kakadu) to the Assistant Director N/O, of 3 November 1988, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . I believe that Paul's [Tacon's] interpretation of Jawoyn refusal to accompany him into the lease as a lack of concern is wrong [. A]s I understand it, the senior traditional owners do not want to validate the exploration lease by their cooperation, since they are opposed to . . . mining anywhere within the Upper South Alligator. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . Paul's advice to BHP in 3.4 is outside his expertise and as such should not be accepted. Paul is not an anthropologist, and his brief contact with Jawoyn people does not provide sufficient experience for his evaluation of the community's attitude. </PARA>
<PARA>Tacon's misinterpretation of the Jawoyn elders' attitude to mineral exploration and his recommendation that BHP Gold should attempt to by-pass the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Protection Authority are extraordinary and disturbing. The elders' opposition to exploration is well established. And the Sacred Sites Authority-now the Areas Protection Authority-is, under Northern Territory law, primarily responsible for documenting and protecting Aboriginal sacred sites under the direction of a committee of Northern Territory Aboriginal people. Tacon's report was a clear attempt to further BHP Gold's interests. It gives little cause for confidence in ANUTECH's sensitivity to Aboriginal concerns or its objectivity in assessing them. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to Kinhill Engineers' report. The ANUTECH study of El Sherana was carried out as part of a public environment report, a PER, on the proposed exploration program. PERs are conducted for projects which the Commonwealth believes warrant an environmental impact assessment, but not a full EIS. BHP Gold and the Coronation Hill joint venture, CHJV, were directed to produce the PER by the Federal Government; it in turn commissioned Kinhill Engineers to carry it out. In the PER, Kinhill repeated the ANUTECH claim that the Jawoyn did not oppose mineral exploration and also claimed that the size of the Jawoyn's people's sickness country had been greatly exaggerated by non-Aboriginal anthropologists and did not in fact encompass El Sherana. Kinhill concluded that the sickness country was not an impediment to mining; under traditional law human activity is greatly restricted in the sickness country. Kinhill's views drew a barrage of criticism. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the comments of the Northern Land Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The comments read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Not only does the [PER] contain incorrect statements of Jawoyn attitude, but it attempts to discredit the important spiritual association of the area. There is [a] suggestion that the . . . `sickness country' has been deliberately expanded. This suggestion is regarded by the Jawoyn Association to be totally untrue. The PER . . . ignores the traditional principle behind the Jawoyn Association objection to activities in the sickness country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Jawoyn Working Party recently visited Canberra to advise the Prime Minister of the Jawoyn's total rejection of any exploration or mining in the sickness country. This position is fully endorsed by the Jawoyn Association . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Statements contained in this PER suggesting Jawoyn support for exploration and mining in the sickness country and, in particular, in the El Sherana area are patently without foundation and are considered by the Northern Land Council to be a deliberate distortion of the truth . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Within th[e] section [of the PER on `Aboriginal interests'] there are a number of inaccuracies which show a lack of research during the preparation of this PER. However, of greater concern is that they indicate the biases of the consultant company Kinhill and presumably the direction of the client, CHJV. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> It would appear that Kinhill has . . . adopted the tactic of discrediting researcher's findings that are contrary to the CHJV ideology. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATIONS</PARA>
<PARA> 1. In view of the poorly researched and inaccurate contents of the PER, that the Government reject the findings of the this report. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. The blatant bias of the report, in particular those sections dealing with Aboriginal interests, justifies a total condemnation of the authors . . . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In December 1987, Kinhill Engineers produced an environmental effects statement, EES, for a proposed copper, zinc and silver mine near Benambra, in the north-eastern highlands of Victoria. Environmental effects statements are the equivalent of EISs under Victorian law. The EES was carried out for the proponent, Macquarie Resources Ltd. In the EES, Kinhill claimed that no sites of significant flora or fauna would be affected by the proposed mine. The Conservation Council of Victoria pointed out that two plant species of national significance and a rare frog were potentially affected. Macquarie Resources admitted that this was so, and modified the project in an attempt to rectify the danger. One of the major changes was the selection of a new 45-hectare site for the tailings dam.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In April 1988, Kinhill produced a second EES for Macquarie Resources' modified project. It offered reassurances about the botanical impact of the project in general and the tailings dam in particular. The Kinhill Engineers' report, Macquarie Resources Ltd: The Benambra Project-Modified Project Description and Environmental Information, of April 1988 states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . [T]he modified project does not directly affect any of the areas identified in the original EES as having conservation significance. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Preliminary [botanical] survey results indicated that the . . . dam sites are covered by mature forest, and relatively undisturbed understorey . . . However, the area directly disturbed is small relative to the total area of forest in the region and the communities represented (montane forest and sclerophyll woodland) are not of limited distribution. </PARA>
<PARA>The botanical survey Kinhill was referring to had been carried out by sub-consultants Ecological Horticulture Pty Ltd from 23 to 25 March 1988. This was three weeks before the release of the second EES. In the EES, Kinhill states that final results from the survey would be ready in mid-April 1988 and would be provided on request to interested parties. This would have been well in advance of the closing date for public submissions in response to the EES, 13 May, and the public hearing at which these submissions could be discussed, 13 June, allowing ample time for the survey results to be analysed by conservation groups, local landowners and other interest parties. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the final results were received only between 6 and 9 June and then only after repeated requests by several bodies. This was well after the closing date for submissions and only two to five working days before the public hearing. Some organisations did not receive the results at all. Amongst them was the Conservation Council of Victoria, the peak body of Victorian conservation groups, which should have received them automatically. The unacceptable delay indicated that the survey results were embarrassing. This turned out to be the case. A report to Kinhill Engineers in May 1988 from Ecological Horticulture entitled The Benambra Project-Vegetation Data and Assessment of Botanical Significance states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . A total of 10 plant species are significant in a regional or state context; nine (9) were found in the Montane Swamp Complex vegetation . . . </PARA>
<PARA> . . . The Montane Swamp Complex vegetation community has high regional and possibly state conservation significance. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . The . . . proposed [tailings dam] would eliminate the Montane Swamp Complex . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the tailings dam was to be built on a rare swamp, not a forest as suggested in the second EES. Clearly, the EES should not have been released until the final results of the botanical survey had been incorporated. Kinhill's failure to do so indicates either incompetence or dishonesty on its part. To believe it was incompetence is to accept that the preliminary results of the botanical survey were insufficient to tell a swamp from a forest. At the public hearing, Kinhill was forced to acknowledge that the swamp was unquestionably of State conservation significance. In January 1989, it was provisionally listed as a community under Victoria's Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I now come to the conclusions that can be drawn. Senator Graham Richardson, the Federal Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, was recently reported as saying that it was unlikely that an EIS could be produced for the Jervis Bay relocation which would satisfy the Federal Government. The track record of the consultant and key sub-consultants, as described in this speech, supports this view. It is only fair to note that there are other sub-consultants to the Jervis Bay EIS whose work has not been scrutinised here. However, it cannot be assumed that their work is therefore beyond reproach. For example, consultants Dames and Moore produced two of the environmental studies referred to in the preliminary draft EIS for Jervis Bay. In the Gerroa sandmining matter, ANUTECH claimed that it was directed by Dames and Moore to alter Dr Sarah Colley's report. Dames and Moore also performed two environmental studies for the Rhone-Poulenc rare earths plant previously described, the first of which was rejected by Western Australia's Environmental Protection Authority. Dames and Moore also produced the draft EIS for the controversial Coronation Hill mine which failed to provide a complete or objective analysis of the project's impacts on Aboriginal, that is Jawoyn, interests, according to the then Sacred Sites Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> The Jervis Bay EIS is beyond redemption and should be abandoned. In order to prevent a similar misappropriation of public resources in future, it is important to ask why it happened this time. The answer lies in the mindset of the Federal Government and developers that EISs are an afterthought, a cosmetic attempt to address environmental concerns without putting the project in doubt. It has become a recurring theme for the Prime Minister and Cabinet colleagues enthusiastically to embrace major construction plans well before environmental studies have commenced. The Wesley Vale pulp mill, Coronation Hill gold mine, Cape York space port, the very fast train project, the multifunction polis, and the Jervis Bay relocation, are only some of the projects in this category. </PARA>
<PARA> The EIS process is heavily weighted in favour of project components. They choose and pay the consultants for the EIS and oversee its conduct. The Federal Environment Department has only a secondary supervisory role, while the general public is allowed detailed input only after the draft EIS has been completed. Much has been said about EISs. They do not perform their functions as an environmental watchdog and they should be scrutinised as a process, overhauled and made to work for the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise a number of points in debate on the Appropriation Bills tonight. In particular, I want to highlight the fact, in response to criticism of the Government, that this set of appropriations, the Budget, does not stand by itself-though it could do that-but it very importantly and very differently is examined if we take it as one of the ongoing Budgets produced by this Labor Government. The Budget is yet another step in the processes instituted by the Labor Government since it came into office to address a multitude of problems left to us by seven years of an uncaring Fraser Government; `uncaring' is the word-uncaring for people who are thrown on to the unemployment heap, people who could not afford to pay, universities and schools that had been wound down without any capital works, the people who could no longer get places in those institutions and the people who could not pay for their health care. The Budget is part of an ongoing series of programs and policies developed by the Government. It is not a random or arbitrary thing that has happened in the Budget; it is part of that program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That program has first to take account of all the successful creation of 1.6 million jobs since the Government came to office, a quite extraordinary record unmatched at any time-certainly unmatched by the Opposition which has made our figures that much better because of the enormously low base we had to build on when we came into office. Sixty-five per cent of those jobs are full time and 55 per cent have been taken up by women. Youth unemployment has been nearly halved from its record level of about 28 per cent in early 1983 and women are now in the work force with the highest labour force participation rate in our history. Jobs have been created as part of the Government's policy and they continue to be created because the Government understands that the best way out of poverty is by going into employment, by people being able to have the income security that a job gives them. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, this Government is committed to supporting people who are looking for work not only by the creation of jobs but also by the creation of educational opportunities. In the 6 1/2 years of Labor Government there has been an extraordinary turnaround in the retention rate in our schools from something like 36 or 37 per cent to over 57 per cent. In fact, in my own State of South Australia that rate is well over 60 per cent. I believe that South Australia is some decimal points behind Queensland in having the highest retention rate of children finishing year 12. It is important to note that, amongst those figures, girls are more highly represented than boys. This Government knows that one does not get on in this world, one does not get a reasonable paying job or even the same opportunities for employment unless one has an adequate education. As a result, this Government's commitment to education is very real and the runs are on the board. </PARA>
<PARA> For many people, education to the end of secondary school leads to the opportunity of some sort of tertiary training and, very importantly, university training. While Susan Ryan was the Minister for Education, some 50,000 tertiary places were created. With the introduction of the higher education contribution scheme, another 50,000 places will be created in our universities, colleges and tertiary institutions around this country. Despite the massive increase in tertiary education places, some people still cannot obtain those places. There is still unmet need, much of which cannot be sheeted home to the Government. However, it can be sheeted home to the appalling run-down of commitment to both capital and recurrent expenditure on secondary and tertiary education that occurred in the seven years of the Fraser Government. Despite that, the growth in educational opportunities is matching the growth in jobs. Both of those factors are critical for the development, recovery and ongoing productivity of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Against all of that one needs to remember Medicare, which has often been overlooked in recent years. Medicare provided an insurance policy-a health insurance coverage-for the two million people who were not covered for medical expenses until 1983 when Medicare was introduced. This Government provides for the health of families, the educational opportunities of families and the job opportunities for families. The necessary infrastructure for people to take up those opportunities is very important. I refer now to child-care. This Government is massively committed in its policy and in its funding to the establishment of a huge increase in child-care places. At present there are an extra 30,000 child-care places under construction in this country. That number will be increased to 140,000 public child-care places. Certainly that is not sufficient to meet current demands or needs, and that is why a government that has a commitment to increasing those places and is continuing to fund and establish them must be acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA> The other important point that should be noted is that those child-care places are varied to meet the variety of needs of parents who have the responsibility for their children. Full day-care centres exist for those parents who have a need for full day-care services, particularly if those parents are in full time employment. Occasional care places exist for those many people who need only brief child-care assistance either because they are undertaking voluntary work, making hospital visits or dental visits, or because they are undertaking part time study or part time work. Occasional care meets the needs of those families that have less than a full time requirement for child-care. </PARA>
<PARA> Having established child-care facilities for preschool children, the Government recognises that those women who are encouraged to accept employment opportunities do not want to lose those opportunities once their children go to school. As a result, there has been a significant increase in the number of places that are available for after school hours care. The Government recognises that the need for child-care does not stop once children go to school, particularly the children of people who are in full time employment. Often people in part time employment are required to work hours that create a need for child-care either prior to or after school hours. The Government is very concerned that those after school hours care places are established in order to overcome that terrible description of latchkey children. </PARA>
<PARA> As well, family day care services provide a variety of flexible options for parents whose children are looked after in smaller groups in private homes. The Government provides assistance, subsidy, fee relief and so on for the users of family day care services. That child-care program is very comprehensive. Not only are child-care places created in various areas of the community, particularly those in greatest need, but also the needs of people in rural or isolated communities are taken into account. Child-care places are not only a metropolitan establishment; they exist across the country and provide a variety of needs to meet the varying needs of working parents, particularly those who have the principal care of children, namely, women. As well, the Government ensures that the provision of child-care and its related costs do not disadvantage people on low incomes. The Government's very comprehensive fee relief subsidies for those in the public child-care sector assist the creation of child-care places and enable people to use them. </PARA>
<PARA> The child-care program together with the jobs, the education and the Medicare programs are part of an ongoing commitment that is further reinforced and developed in this Budget. As well, other infrastructure exists for those people who have been out of the work force and who need assistance to get back into it. In particular, that assistance deals with people who are long term unemployed or who are sole parents, particularly women, who may have had a very short time in the work force prior to establishing their families. With its Newstart and jobs, education and training programs, the Government is very concerned to ensure that people do receive assistance to move off pension benefits and into the work force. For many people that task is not easy. The Government is concerned to assist people to take that step rather than to abandon them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is particularly shocking that the Opposition's proposal-if one can understand its policy at all-is to dump unemployed people once they have been unemployed for nine months. In a policy that is committed to families there is little understanding from the Opposition of just who are the unemployed people, particularly the older unemployed people, many of whom are family people who have the care of children. Enormous inconsistency exists in the Opposition's policy in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1983 when I first became a member of this place, the Government faced an appalling deficit that was left to it by the Fraser Government. The deficit at that time was $6.5 billion. However, earlier that year it had been estimated to be even higher. This year, the Budget proposes a $9 billion surplus after the actual $6 billion surplus of last year. Nowhere do I hear any cheers or celebrations for that good news. Certainly we cannot overlook the challenges that confront this country, but I find it surprising that, in times past, the bad news was always in terms of the size of the deficit. Somehow the good news of completely reversing that and creating a huge surplus has been lost, particularly amongst members of the Opposition who would not like to confront it at all. That surplus has been another measure of this Budget and past Budgets contributing to an ongoing recovery for this Government. Nothing can be done just in one Budget. No-one would accept that a government's recovery, particularly after what was left to this Government, could be turned around in one Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> More than that, the Government was not concerned solely about getting back to some kind of level of neutrality but was concerned to establish policies and programs that would be developed year by year, each time building on the past programs. As a priority, this Government was concerned to help people on the lowest incomes. As I have said before in this place, I well remember a speech by Senator Chaney on appropriations which I believe was delivered last year and during which he criticised the Government for actually assisting families on the lowest income. At that time he said that the Government should have been condemned for that. However, the Labor Government stands up without shame to Senator Chaney and says, `But that was our priority. Do you not know what being a Labor government is about? It is about helping as a priority people on the lowest income'. In fact, if Senator Chaney recognises that the Government has done that, all to the good. Indeed, it has and it should be acknowledged for it. I find it quite surprising that Senator Chaney would want to condemn the Government for it. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time and since, the Government has continued to build on assistance for families-first of all, those at the lowest end of incomes. Then in the April statement and the Budget of this year it moved to increase the range of commitment and assistance to families. This Government has now targeted those families above the lowest income bracket and is tackling the position of the more-middle income earners. The third lot of tax cuts that have just been introduced by this Government take account of that. They are particularly targeted to those on average weekly incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> To hear the Opposition speak, one would think that this Government had actually only increased taxes. Somehow the Opposition overlooks the fact that this is the third lot of tax cuts that have been introduced by this Government since it came to office, and not just willy-nilly tax cuts. Those first introduced benefited people at the lowest end of the income scale and are now moving towards those at the middle level of income. At the same time, the Government has been able to reduce the top marginal rate of income tax for a number of reasons, one involving equity considerations and another to encourage people to actually work. In other words, we seek to do away with higher tax levels that may act as a disincentive. Company tax has also been reduced so as to assist producers and companies to get on with the business of producing wealth for this country to address the difficulties of our balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes for families in terms of family allowance and family allowance supplement cannot be let pass without a particular acknowledgment being given. For the first time ever, those payments are now indexed. More importantly than that, benchmarks have been set for what is considered a reasonable amount of money for children. For children under 13, it is 15 per cent of the married rate of pension, and for children between 13 and 16, it is 20 per cent of the married rate of pension. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has made quite extraordinary contributions on behalf of families and children. First of all, the family allowance has been indexed and increased dramatically. For the first three children, that payment is now $9 a week, and for further children it is $12 a week. That payment is now indexed. Although we in the Government could say that never again will those payments fall below that level, we would have grave concern about what the Opposition means when we have had evidence in this place. Senator Chaney says they are indexed but Mr Peacock says that that is perhaps the case and, anyhow, only for a year. </PARA>
<PARA> Having finally got to the stage of being able to afford to index those payments-and what a commitment by government that is-and to afford to index the other payments such as the pensions, the benefits and the family allowance supplement, the Government has a doubt that if the Opposition became the government it would continue that indexation and a fair suspicion that it may well in fact remove it. So the huge amount of work done for six years by this Government to tackle inequity, to tackle poverty, may well be undone by the Opposition, which prefers to target people at a different level of income and to target those people at the expense of those people who are poorest in the community and least able to argue for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like also to pick up on the curious criticism by the Opposition, in particular that of Senator Newman. She was in the chamber a minute ago, but she has just left. Senator Newman, both in an article in Portfolio and in speaking in this place, actually criticised the Government and its commitment to women which she says is nominal. I certainly utterly disagree with Senator Newman. Of late, her arguments have moved away from criticising the Government for creating child-care and urging women into the work force. That argument has gone and it had better stay gone, particularly in the light of the proposed policy by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Her argument now is that economic matters are more important than, for example, allocations to women in sport. I wonder what she would say if she were able to speak to any sporting women's group about the recognition that government is finally giving to women in sport. It is no arbitrary or random, `Why not do that?'. It is part of a coherent program of increasing the contribution to sport and the recognition of the importance of sport in our society, not just for gold medals, although all of us celebrate when the gold medals come home, but in particular to increase the broad-base participation of people in sport and recreation in this country. That increase is dramatic. The Government needs to be congratulated on that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has a national health policy for women, but that policy is not something that stands alone and has no regard for other things that people do in our society that contribute to their health. The health of women is not an isolated matter and it does not refer only to their genital tract, although sometimes people might want to confine it that way. Certainly, if I am speaking to a woman I want to speak to the whole woman about all the sorts of things and areas of interest that she has. One of the areas of interest for women in this country is their sporting involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> For too many years, the achievements of women in sport in this country have gone unrecognised, unacknowledged and certainly massively underfunded. I find it surprising that Senator Newman and the Opposition would criticise the Government for actually committing dollars to improve women's sport and in particular to increase the participation of women across the spectrum of talents not only at the elite level but also, as I said earlier, at the recreational participation level. Those are matters of great celebration. They certainly build on the work that this Government has been doing for a number of years. </PARA>
<PARA> I could say that in some ways I had the opportunity to focus on matters of women in sport when I chaired for government an inquiry into women in sport in 1984-85. That was not something that I thought up; that was one of the comprehensive policies for women that were part of the Labor Party's policy statement on women before it came into government in 1983. I am certainly not abandoning it at this stage. I would have thought that Senator Newman should find out what happens when she speaks to the netball players or the hockey players or any other women involved in sport in this country to suggest that they are not really worth dollars. If Senator Newman really understood economic issues she might know that on some recent surveys undertaken by the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories it is estimated that 25 per cent of household income-presumably some households-goes on sport and recreation, for people either to buy the equipment to participate in sport and recreation or to attend sporting and recreational facilities or even games. That is a very large pool of money and it certainly seems to me that even with those figures we should be beginning to regard sport and women's involvement in sport as something that is more of a kind of fillip to women. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not. It recognises what opportunities are about. In addition to providing opportunities for our girls and boys, this Government is about providing opportunities for women and men in all fields of endeavour. The Government is not confined, and it will not confine people to a few opportunity areas. Where women want to extend their talents or to try out, to test themselves, to develop fitness and health, this Government acknowledges those efforts and says it will support them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also recognises that there is a significant economic contribution to be made from the whole field of sport and recreation, and I think that is beginning to be understood more and more, particularly by those people who are beginning to sponsor women's sport with ever increasing numbers of dollars. At a women's cricket meeting at Christmas, one of those sponsors made a comment to me that people have to understand that sponsorship of women's sport is not a soft piece of altruism; it is a hard, economic rational decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Women are purchasers. Those women I mentioned earlier who have jobs, who have education, who have increased opportunities under this Government, also have opportunities to participate in sport and recreation like they have not had before. That also means that they can contribute to the economy in a different way from before. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as that, of course, women are doing things about their own health. Senator Newman also wanted to argue that dollars allocated for women in sport seemed to be taking dollars away from women's health. I think Senator Richardson has answered questions on this matter on a number of occasions in this place, but I would certainly say that the Government's women in sport program is no irrelevancy. Indeed, it is a comprehensive part of programs that look at women's health, and it fits very well with the national women's health policy established by this Government last year and now to be implemented over however many years it takes. But in particular, it is a $43m package over the next four years to promote the health of Australian women. </PARA>
<PARA> That takes account of not only the breast-screening program and the cervical cancer program but also a $33.7m national health program for women that is cost shared with the States and Territories, and it will address a comprehensive list of health issues for women as highlighted in that national health document. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area of great interest and concern to people in this community, especially women, has been income security. The creation of jobs is a very important way in which that has been established for women. So too are the changes to superannuation in this Budget. Superannuation membership, particularly for women, will be further encouraged. Indeed, it must be encouraged because it is very low-far too low for those of us concerned about income security for women of all ages. Superannuation membership will be encouraged by permitting contributions to private superannuation schemes for those out of the paid work force for up to two years and by extending the tax deductability of private superannuation contributions for those working as little as 10 hours per week. Both of those changes are particularly advantageous to women. </PARA>
<PARA> It is mainly women who drop out of the paid work force to have families. To be able to continue with their contributions to superannuation funds will be a distinct advantage and encouragement to them. They should feel that superannuation is real. It will encourage them to take seriously the prospects of providing for themselves in retirement through superannuation-something that until recently women had not seriously thought was real for them. If they had any access to superannuation it tended to be from their spouses. As women increase their numbers in the work force and have a different attitude about themselves in terms of their income security and their contribution to the productivity of this country, it is important that they look at their superannuation and retirement income differently and take up the options encouraged so much by these changes to superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as that, there is a further inducement for many women in part time work, sometimes working as little as 10 hours a week, to contribute to superannuation and see its benefits. People are more likely to see the benefits of superannuation if they have a realistic opportunity to participate. It is very important that we appreciate those changes to superannuation under this Budget. It is very important that women are reminded of those improvements available to them. </PARA>
<PARA> As well, there are changes in the pension rebate. This is beneficial for all pensioners, particularly as many of those pensioners are women who can look forward to an increase in their retirement income through changes to pensions. In the next few years they will be able to earn the full amount allowed under the pension without losing any pension and without having to pay any tax. Again, both of these changes are part of the Government's ongoing comprehensive package of policies in this Budget, which builds on policies that we have put into place in the years before. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly there are challenges ahead for this country; certainly there are matters of serious consideration before us-but this Government has acknowledged that all along. Senator Parer, in his contribution, said that this Government rushes around saying that everything is rosy. I do not know where he was when the Treasurer (Mr Keating) reminded us that we were heading towards a banana republic-a fairly sober message, and certainly not a salutary message about everything being okay. Indeed, it has been this Government that over the years has held out to the Australian people the importance of recognising the real facts about the state of our economy. It has been this Government that has insisted that we face those issues head on and be realistic about them. It is this Government that has put in place the programs that have led to a massive turnaround of a huge deficit to the $9 billion surplus that we will face at the end of this year. That, along with its other policies and programs that deal with needs of individuals in this community, particularly in matters of social justice, of fairness and equity for all, indicates clearly that this Government is not only doing well under this Budget but also is continuing the program that justifies its existence. This Government appreciates the stern concerns that face the country, but it also has the policies and programs in place to continue to address those concerns. It does that because its Budget, year by year, has built on policies. First, it addressed the needs of the poorest in this country and now it is looking to extend its consideration to those people who have over time borne the brunt-those people on middle income levels. This Budget is well worth our serious consideration and celebration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I start my speech I thank my colleague Senator Reid for rising to my defence. It is very much appreciated. I have now participated in a number of appropriation debates. It has begun to strike me as somewhat of a futile exercise. However, one thing that can be said of this Labor Government is that it is consistent, particularly in its management of the economy! It has consistently mismanaged the economy and it has consistently told us that things will get better. In fact, I cannot remember one occasion during the last five years when I have been able to suggest that the year in prospect looks any better than the year in review. This year is certainly no exception. Just as inflation pushes prices ever upward, so too it seems that each year other figures move naturally upwards with nary a hint of apology or explanation from anyone on the Government benches. It seems that we just have to live with higher interest rates, higher inflation, higher current account deficits, higher foreign debt and higher taxes, and with reduced savings, reduced standards of living and reduced international credit ratings-all of this in a nation once termed the lucky country. Where has the lucky country gone? If people such as Sir Arvi Parbo are to be believed it has gone all one way: downwards. In a recent seminar address, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . paradise is under attack . . . Australia has become uncompetitive and lazy. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Financial Review, in its editorial of last Thursday, 26 October, said that it will get worse before it gets better:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the balance of payments and inflation reinforces the true nature of Australia's economic woes . . . The road ahead is nothing short of a long, hard haul. </PARA>
<PARA> As the saying goes, it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better on the balance of payments and foreign debt fronts. </PARA>
<PARA> While the commentators seem to realise the seriousness of the situation, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is doggedly sticking to his ill-conceived, inappropriate policies, caring little what effect they are having on the broader economic stage and certainly not giving one minute's thought to how they are affecting the average Australian family. Let us look at the Daily Telegraph of last Friday, 27 October. The headline is `Food, home prices soar'. The article says:</PARA>
<PARA>A sharp rise in food prices, housing costs and the July 1 rise in third party car insurance sent Sydney's cost of living rocketing by 2.8 per cent in the September quarter. </PARA>
<PARA>These are all areas where the ordinary household is being inflicted with rising costs, and all because this Government has not addressed itself to the proper issues that it will have to address if this country is to get back on the road. </PARA>
<PARA> The so-called special meeting convened a month ago by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer to consider the impact of 18 per cent home loan interest rates on Australian families resulted in absolutely nothing being done to improve the lot of an estimated one million families who have taken out home loans since home loan rates were deregulated. Interestingly, the banks argue that if the 800,000 families on the fixed 13.5 per cent loans were also to be deregulated, the banks could lower rates across the board. The conundrum for the Government here is obviously to determine whether there are more Labor voters in the 800,000 families paying 13.5 per cent home loan interest rates or in the one million families with higher interest rates. That is the decision that the Labor Party will have to make at its Caucus meetings in the next little while. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Government does not really care a fig for the difficulties of either group. To be honest, it is simply trying to weigh up the political consequences of any change. The political dilemma for the Government was evident when the Treasurer gloatingly announced the other day that a pensioners meeting had pleaded with him to keep interest rates up. Think about that. Treasurer Keating took that as an indication that the Hawke Government's high interest rate policies are popular. I doubt it. I can only suggest that he test that theory at the next Federal election and see how popular he is then. </PARA>
<PARA> It is staggering that the Labor Government could have got itself so far removed from the ordinary Australian family and so distant from its traditional support base that it supports economic policies that ensure that the poor in this country remain poor while the rich get richer. They are the simple facts. This nation has turned from being savers to being borrowers. People can no longer afford the luxury of putting a little money aside for a rainy day. The one million families who have suffered 2, 3 and 4 per cent hikes in their home loan repayments have no rainy day accounts left. Those rainy day accounts are long gone. For many others the dream of their own home has long gone. As early as April this year the Australian newspaper was predicting that by the turn of the century-that is, in 11 years time-more than 500,000 Australian families would be sharing their homes with at least two other families. That means 9 per cent of the population will be living in shared accommodation. In commenting on the survey BIS-Shrapnel Pty Ltd director Neil Hayne blamed the staggering survey results on the Federal Government's emphasis on monetary policy. He said that to provide adequate housing for all families now living in shared accommodation the level of residential construction would need to double from the present 120,000 dwellings to 240,000 dwellings a year. What an indictment of a government housing and financial policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McGauran is quite right; they are not fit to govern this country any longer. This Government is turning Australia into the ghetto of the Pacific. Imagine 1.5 million Australians sharing their homes with at least two other families. Gone is the Australian dream and any chance of family life and privacy. Ghetto style living is all that is in prospect for 1.5 million Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> They will be far luckier than the tens of thousands who are presently homeless and who will remain homeless. In the debate on the Appropriation Bill last year I talked about the more than 700,000 Australians living below the poverty line. I spoke of the more than 60,000 people who live on the verge of homelessness and of the 40,000 who sleep in refuges at night and are forced to roam the streets by day. Sadly, the situation has got a lot worse. Many of those who last year were on the verge of homelessness are now out in the streets. Soaring interest rates forcing up rents in capital cities have given them no other option. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not forget the children living in poverty. According to the Prime Minister, we would not have any by next year. Of course, he has now said he might have to apologise for that remark because he was a little bit wrong. But it is anyone's guess where, before the start of next year, he intends to put the estimated 15 per cent of children currently, in late 1989, still living in poverty. We do not have a hope of addressing any of these concerns while this country remains with the same tired, unworkable economic policies this Treasurer has pursued with little success for the past seven years. Take the Labor Government's roads policy, for example. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the past seven years all we have got is increased fuel taxes and decreased road funding. Senator Sheil makes the point that if he could only get some of these Labor Party Ministers to have a look at the roads all around the country areas of Australia they would see, as Senator Sheil would see travelling around his vast State of Queensland, the problems caused by this Government. This Government has failed to understand that 70 per cent of our domestic trade is carried by roads, with road cargo haulage increasing by 25 per cent between 1982 and 1985 and expected to double in the next 10 years. It is expected that the number of cars will increase by over 60 per cent by the turn of the century. Yet the Federal Government has cut funding in real terms by 30 per cent. Only just tonight we have seen on television the carnage on the roads that has been created by some of the semitrailers that are now being forced onto roads that are not adequate for them to travel on at night with all the other traffic. It is not just the National and Liberal parties that are complaining about our roads. The National Roads and Motorists Association says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Roads are in an appalling condition and getting worse. Everyone can see that except, for some strange reason, members of the Federal Government; they refuse even to acknowledge there is a problem. </PARA>
<PARA>While fuel excise has risen from 6.155c in 1982-83 to an estimated 23.152c per litre in 1989-90, allocations to roads have not similarly increased. We all know at what cost those savings on roads are made. One has only to read the newspapers. I have already alluded to my seeing on television tonight that 20-odd people have been killed in one small area just near this city of Canberra. That is not a record that any government could be proud of. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet while the Government is penny-pinching on such vital issues as roads it is offering bribes and handouts to the waterfront. Is that not an area that needs cleaning up? Mr Deputy President, I am quite sure that you would agree that that is an area that really does need a lot of cleaning up. The Government's proposed $290m waterfront reform package is nothing short of a sellout to union pressure. How can the Government possibly justify such a pay-out when it is slashing other essential areas, such as roads, so savagely. Where are this Government's priorities? Are they with card-carrying members of the Labor Party and the various unions of this country? Does this Government only recognise people who live in marginal electorates and belong to blue-collar unions? Certainly the pilots would believe that. While the Prime Minister is giving multi-million dollar handshakes to wharfies he is refusing to talk to the pilots about wage rises-or talk to them at all-to get us out of this horrendous strike that is bringing Australia to its knees. </PARA>
<PARA> Hundreds of businesses are going to the wall around the country because the Prime Minister will not put his mind to settling the airlines dispute. Even in affluent Canberra, as Senator Reid would attest from a survey that her office conducted this week, literally hundreds of people have been financially disadvantaged or even destroyed by the strike. If businesses are so savagely hit in Canberra, a city to which most tourists come by bus or car, what hope is there for tourist operators in Tasmania, northern Queensland or the Northern Territory? I heard Senator Tambling earlier tonight, and I know that he is very concerned about the way the strike is affecting people in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Prime Minister is looking after his mates to the tune of millions of dollars in compensation, what about the little shopkeepers, the one person operators, whose losses may not be as great numerically but are totally devastating? The Prime Minister forgets about them. Even in my home city of Tamworth, people associated with the airline industry or who have connections with the industry are suffering horrendously at the hands of this Government, which will not sit down and talk to try to fix the dispute. Perhaps the commentator Des Keegan best summed up the present situation facing Australia when he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>Labor ran out of direction years ago and the momentum of events is going badly against it; like the Marie Celeste, there's nobody on the bridge. </PARA>
<PARA>Fortunately for Australia, there is a choice, unlike the directionless, muddied, failed economic flounderings of the Australian Labor Party, the coalition has put down a set of guidelines more detailed and comprehensive than anything ever produced by any party in Opposition. The policies are clear-cut with direction and detail. More importantly, they will pull Australia out of the economic abyss in which it presently exists under the Hawke Labor Government. We have set out quite clearly our goals and guidelines. Unlike this Government, which cannot say whether inflation will come down by next year and cannot predict where the current account deficit will finish up-and heaven help us in looking at the predictions last year-we have pledged by the end of our first term in government a cut in tax rates, lower interest rates, smaller government, reduced inflation, greater productivity, higher real wages and a foreign debt under control. We do not accept this Government's absurd reliance on high interest rates to cure Australia's economic ills. We reject a high interest rate policy as damaging the very fabric of Australian life. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me allude to how that policy affects country people. We are told that the increase in the consumer price index is running at 7.8 per cent, maybe 8 per cent, a year. The input cost increases to people who are running businesses in country areas are between 10 and 15 per cent-that is, increases in the running costs on the same commodities this year compared to last year, because all the people associated with giving services are suffering from high interest rates, the stocks on the shelves have to increase in price for those people even to keep afloat. So it gets passed on down the chain. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties believe that it is time for hard working Australians and their families to get a fair go. It is time that those who pay taxes saw some benefits for their efforts and did not have them squandered on handouts for wharfies and protection for wealthy businessmen. When we have a Treasurer who one year describes the balance of payments as Australia's No. 1 economic problem and inflation as the country's No. 1 economic disease and the following year claims that they are the key to securing sustainable lower interest rates, we begin to understand how directionless this country really is under the Hawke Labor Government. The Marie Celeste has nothing on this country. (Quorum formed)</PARA>

<PARA> Australia started under a period of colonial government. At the turn of the century it had a government of cooperative federalism. The Whitlam Government was a government of coercive federalism. Today things are worse. The Australian Labor Party, despite all the rhetoric and talk about being enlightened and progressive, is still lumbered with the socialist objective. It wants to socialise labour, production and the means of exchange. The Government is going ahead willy-nilly and is well on that track. One of the means that it is using is the creation of economic chaos. It is a well known ploy of socialist governments around the world-which have all failed-that the first thing to do to gain control of the country is to destroy its economy. That is what is happening in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Look at how the country is situated with regard to production. We get our income mainly from the rural and mining industries, with a small but significant contribution from the manufacturing sector. We have to pin our hopes on the mining and agricultural industries. All the incentives for our agricultural industries have been removed by the Labor Government. In fact, life on the land is now a lot more difficult than it was years ago. Similarly, in the mining industry, we have locked up millions and millions of hectares of Australia without even knowing what minerals lie beneath the land-and for no good purpose. I refer, for example, to the decision on Coronation Hill. It is conservatively estimated that the Hill contains minerals which would provide about $500m worth of export earnings for Australia, yet they have just been locked up. In order to pay off our international debt, we would have to discover the equivalent of a Coronation Hill every fortnight for the next year or so and bring them into production so that the country could get itself out of its present mess. That gives us some idea of the extent of the problem caused to this country by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> One would have to say that the mining men are the front row men of the development of any country. They have to find the minerals. The rural industries then usually supply the mines and the miners must move on and explore other areas. This is not easy. We have to provide an enormous infrastructure for people in this industry. Education and hospital facilities are supplied to the mining areas. Nevertheless, it is a risky business which costs a lot of money. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is making it harder and harder for people to explore for minerals. In the pursuit of this socialist objective, if one wanted to have an ideological argument, one could take the word `environment' and substitute it for the word `socialist'. One would then find that the environment is being used as a tool by the Government to destroy the economy. Of course, our Aborigines are mixed up in this mess. They are being used as a tool to thwart the development of this country. This is creating disharmony as well as shattering our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is attacking professional people-the non-union segment of the labour force. I refer to the medical profession-not only ordinary doctors but radiologists and pathologists-the pharmacy industry, the tourist industry and the mining industry. They are all under attack by this Government. Of course, that is another normal socialist ploy. The Government hates independent people. It wants to gain control of them and these are the measures that it is using to gain control of these people. </PARA>

This one is just adding fuel to the fire.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I admit that in the last century the bosses used the power of government to make the lot of the working man hard. This led to the rise of the trade union movement. The trade union movement is now so powerful and has been able to achieve such good terms and conditions for its members that it has now priced itself out of the economic market. The prime example is the waterfront in Australia. Featherbedding, double manning and whatever other practices it is engaging in have led us to achieve a deficit of $2 billion a year on the waterfront. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Government say that they have unshackled the financial sector. They have certainly done so, but they cannot do only half of the job. They should unshackle the union sector as well. Of course, they did not do that. By deregulating the financial sector and leaving the union sector to run wild they have added to this country's problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what happens when one socialises the means of distribution. For example, the Australian National Railways Commission is recording losses. With regard to the airlines, the pilots are on strike. There is no end in sight to the disruption of our air transport industry. </PARA>

The state of the roads not only poses a threat to life and limb but also causes damage to vehicles and increases costs. It is all a sorry plight.

It is a misdirected policy to use these rates as the sole means of trying to get us out of our economic plight, yet the Government is persisting with it. It is crippling business and preventing new businesses from starting up. It is crippling the housing industry. Housing contributes a great deal to the maintenance of our economy in all fields-from gardening and landscaping to providing work for plumbers and electricians and those in the transport area. The whole basis of our business economy is exemplified by the housing industry. Even taking into account all of those factors, one could not afford to buy a house today because of the crippling cost. People cannot afford to service the present level of interest rates. In most countries, throughout history once interest rates have reached 22 per cent the countries then degenerate into economic chaos. We are getting very close to that situation now. It does not augur well for the future of young people who want to marry, start a family, buy a house and a car and subject themselves to the enormous stress of raising a family and educating children, in the face of the interest rates with which they are now confronted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today Senator Button, as Leader of the Government in the Senate, made an announcement about the death of Gordon Reid, the former Governor of Western Australia. It was not a condolence debate and so I did not participate in it then because I did not want to hold up the business of the Senate, although many people confused it with a condolence debate. However I do want to identify with those who mourn the loss of a person whom I regard as a great Australian. I rise now in this adjournment debate to do that. I regard myself as a personal friend of Gordon Reid. I do not pretend that there is anything exclusive about this personal friendship. It is a mark of the man that everyone he touched felt a personal bond of friendship similar to the one that I felt. I think his wife, Ruth, shares this quality: a remarkable capacity to establish rapport with people of all types from all walks of life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I had a special interest in Gordon Reid, particularly in his achievement as a Governor. In the early days of the Burke Government when it was looking for someone to take on the difficult task-Labor governments always have greater difficulty in appointing governors after the experience of 1975-I suggested Gordon Reid as a good choice. I do not pretend that I was singly responsible for his appointment but I hope I was one of those who influenced his appointment. I had a great deal of faith in his capacity. I do know that. I also know that this faith was confirmed by consequent events. </PARA>
<PARA> Gordon Reid was, indeed, a great Australian, that rare balance between scholar and statesman, dignitary and common man. He brought to the governorship that special capacity to convey the power and importance of his position in a dignified and competent way. Yet he was also-I think this is a rarer achievement-able to identify with and enjoy contact with everyday Australians who would not normally have moved in such circles. As I said, Gordon Reid managed to be everyone's friend, not in any supercilious way but in a genuine way out of an apparently innate interest in people. He was a gentleman in the truest sense of that often loosely used term. Gordon Reid will be greatly missed. He will not easily be replaced as Governor. It will not be easy to emulate the style that he was able to bring to that role. More importantly, he will be missed by the many people from all walks of life who, like I do, count him among their special friends. I convey my sympathy to his wife, Ruth, who has so capably partnered him through his many roles, and to his family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to join with Senator Beahan. He has explained the reasons why I am using the adjournment debate rather than having spoken at the time when other senators did to note the passing of my friend, Gordon Reid. I first met him, not in any role as Governor or other subsequent roles which he played, but when he was appointed as Professor of Politics at the University of Western Australia in 1966. I was a student of his in that year. There were some very distinguished students of politics in that year of whom, I suspect, he thought I was not one. Had he had to choose who was likely to be in the Parliament from that group to speak on this sad occasion, I am sure he would not have picked me as that candidate-and he might have been right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He was a very calm and thoughtful man who made a contribution as a teacher because he was interested in ideas. He would never have claimed to have been a great orator or speaker. Students remember some people at university because they were exciting lecturers; they made the subjects sparkle. Gordon was not an exciting speaker. He just loved to talk about the ideas and to advance the discussion of ideas. His background here in the Parliament had given him a great love of democracy, a great commitment to the institution and he wrote and talked and educated people about parliaments and their role and the struggle between the Parliament and the Executive. He will be remembered for that. Other people spoke about it earlier today and I share their views. </PARA>
<PARA> But I want to add a different perspective, one that has not been mentioned. I saw Gordon Reid once speaking on a more partisan political occasion. I do not mean party political. It was not a Labor Party occasion; it was a rally about issues. He was usually very concerned not to involve himself in that area. I am not in any way implying what his personal political views might have been. But it was significant that he was talking about his experience in World War II as a pilot. It was a very emotional occasion when he spoke. It clearly affected him substantially and changed the course of his life. It showed me a different side of Gordon Reid, a side which I had not seen before. I guess in a sense that it was Gordon with his guard down and I admired him all the more for that. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to tell just one other anecdote about Gordon Reid before concluding. Before he was Governor he was appointed Deputy Vice-Chancellor of the University of Western Australia. I was very surprised, not that he should be chosen because I knew that he would be a good candidate, but that he would accept because I knew that he loved being Professor of Politics. I was still in Western Australia at the time and I saw him and asked him why he had done it. He said, `I have had a great deal from universities. I thought it was time that I gave something back'. I think that explains why he took that position and why he went on to be an excellent Governor. He had a sense of responsibility, of contributing. He was an outstanding Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as his wife, Ruth, I knew one of his sons and one of his daughters. They were people who had obviously benefited from Gordon's influence. I regarded them at the time-a long time ago now-as friends and colleagues. I enjoyed working with them. I admired his wife, Ruth. I particularly want to join with those honourable senators today who have spoken about Gordon Reid, to regret that we will not have the benefit of his wise counsel and to hope that others will carry on the excellent work which he did as a teacher, as an administrator at the University, as the Governor and as a great Australian. </PARA>

The tributes on that occasion came from the former Governor's staff at Government House in Perth, people who actually worked with Gordon in carrying out his duties on behalf of the State. As Senator Beahan said earlier, both Gordon and his wife, Ruth-it was a combination of both of them-were real people and they associated with real people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Community Services and Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The ALP health policy was released by the Hon W. G. Hayden and the Hon N. Blewett in Sydney on 4 February 1982. It was a major element of the Prime Minister's policy speech on 16 February 1983.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, upon notice, on 27 September 1989:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Does the Government agree that the development of the bionic ear is one of the success stories of cooperative research between the universities and industry, having considerable commercial potential.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Is the report in the ``Australian'' of 19 September 1989 correct in saying that the Australian Bionic Ear and Hearing Institute (ABEHI) is having problems with paying its rent because it can only keep 25 per cent of the royalty received from the sale of the device whilst it would need 75 per cent for this and for further development work.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Did Professor Clark approach the Government seeking a much larger share of royalties and what were the reasons for denying the request.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) What is the Government's assessment of the future need for, and importance of, ongoing research on the bionic ear.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2576" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The report in the ``Australian'' of 19 September is partially correct. I am aware that Professor Clark is having difficulty in meeting the rental cost for the premises occupied by the Australian Bionic Ear and Hearing Institute (ABEHI). However, the fact that the ABEHI is having difficulties in meeting its rental payments is not directly related to the level of royalties received from the bionic ear. It is one possible source of additional funding which would go some way to alleviating the Institute's current financial difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA>Cochlear Pty Ltd, an Australian company, has been granted an exclusive licence to commercialise the bionic ear by the Commonwealth and the University of Melbourne. The royalties received from the sale of the device are shared equally between the Commonwealth and the University of Melbourne. I understand that it is the policy of the University of Melbourne to pay some portion of royalties received to the inventors and to the Department of the University involved in the invention. The portion of the bionic ear royalties paid to Professor Clark or the Department of Otolaryngology is 25% of total royalty payment for the bionic ear, that is, the University of Melbourne also retains 25%.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes. Professor Clark has on a number of occasions approached the Government seeking a re-direction of the Commonwealth's share of bionic ear royalties to his Department. I have recently received agreement from my colleague, the Hon. Peter Walsh, the Minister for Finance, to the Commonwealth foregoing future royalties up to the amount it has received from Cochlear to date and thereafter sharing its royalties on a 50:50 basis with the University of Melbourne. The royalty payments foregone by the Commonwealth will be paid to ABEHI.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The importance that the Government places on ongoing research on the bionic ear is reflected in the Commonwealth's decision to forgo a proportion of its future royalty entitlements in favour of the ABEHI.</PARA>
