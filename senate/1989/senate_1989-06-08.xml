<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament. The petition of the undersigned shows:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Leonid Yakovich Lubman, electronics engineer, was born on 5 March 1936 in the Soviet Union.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. He is believed to have been arrested on or about 29 August 1977 and to have been charged under Article 64 (a) of the RSFSR Criminal Code with Treason and Slander of the USSR and to have been sentenced to 13 years strict regime.</PARA>

<TITLE>Health Care for the Elderly</TITLE>
<PARA>Honourable the President and members of the Senate Assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's population is ageing and most people require more health services as they grow older.</PARA>
<PARA> If open not-for-profit Health Funds are to be able to meet the costs of providing benefits to their older members at affordable rates, those costs need to be shared equitably.</PARA>
<PARA> Some Health Insurance organisations are being allowed to avoid meeting the health costs of sick and elderly people.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled, urge the Government to take the necessary action to reverse rising cost trends and provide positive incentives to encourage all Health Funds to share the cost of health care for sick and elderly Australians.</PARA>

<TITLE>Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled, the petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully sheweth that:</PARA>
<PARA> This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the Senate to the continued Government interference in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme which has severely affected the viability of our community pharmacies and their ability to provide the quality and quantity of services to which we Australians have as a right.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore request the Senate to guarantee the provision of our adequately funded Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme which ensures the availability of Pharmaceutical Benefits through local community Pharmacies.</PARA>

<TITLE>Home Ownership</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Hawke-Keating government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many Australians out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Re-establish control over interest rates-and in particular those affecting housing, farming, and small business.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Take action which enables the repatriation of our resources and heritage in the long-term.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Ban the export of profits deriving from Australian-owned businesses and companies.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Develop programmes to limit the vulnerability of the Australian economy to overseas influences.</PARA>

<PARA> (6) In the spirit of the above, generally guide our Nation towards a sustainable, humanitarian future-by evolving the regulatory means to deal with encroaching environmental problems, and social break-down. For example: the greenhouse effect, homelessness and drug-dependency.</PARA>

<PARA> That the mountainous terrain and geography of Tasmania makes VHF television transmissions the most suitable for the State;</PARA>
<PARA> The more than 30,000 Tasmanians will have to purchase new television receivers and new antennae if commercial television in the State is forced to change from the VHF to the UHF band;</PARA>

<PARA> Following telephone calls to your office may we, the undersigned, as a group of mature and older people, express to you our deep concern that legislation has been passed through the Federal Parliament for the dismantling of the Tamworth projects namely Sheltham Enterprises, Wirraway Enterprises and Simpson Lodge. The whole community has supported these shelters for disabled and handicapped people and we are alarmed at what the outcome of this new legislation will be. There has been practically no coverage in the press and media in these areas so we do ask that you heed our concern</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) condemns the massive and indiscriminate slaughter of thousands of unarmed Chinese pro-democracy demonstrators and bystanders by units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Beijing since Saturday, 3 June 1989;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) calls on the Chinese Government to cease this brutality and commence a process of open and democratic consultation with the Chinese people in order to avoid further bloodshed and violations of fundamental human rights;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) notes that the recent processes of economic liberalisation in the People's Republic of China, and the attendant benefit to the peoples of China and the region of those processes, cannot succeed in the face of the systematic repression of legitimate democratic aspirations; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) recognises the work of diplomats and their staff who at times of trauma and difficulty are prepared to risk their personal safety to ensure that the lives of Australian citizens are not endangered. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not intend to speak to the motion at any great length because I think that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, has made the position of the Australian Government completely clear on the events that have occurred in China. I have very little doubt that at the end of this debate the chamber will carry the motion unanimously and, as such, indicate to the Chinese Government the attitude of all Australians to the events that have occurred in China. Over the last eight or 10 years we have all been very encouraged by the extent to which reform was occurring and the degree of openness that was occurring in China. I think we all anticipated that long term, the events would lead, inevitably, to the establishment of a democratic regime-an open society, a society with respect for the law. </PARA>
<PARA> The events of the last few days are a massive setback to the direction of the last eight to 10 years. It is an absolute tragedy when a government feels it necessary to use its armed forces to shoot innocent, unarmed demonstrators in the way that has occurred. The Australian Government has made very clear to the Ambassador of China, and by its statements, its absolute abhorrence of the events that have occurred in China and calls on the Chinese Government to abstain from these activities. We hope that, long term, not only will stability be restored but also the march towards democracy and freedom in China will continue, and that China will take its place very proudly among the rest of the nations of the world. The events of the last few days certainly give it a lot to be ashamed about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports the motion. In fact, we had said that we would be prepared to have it called `formal' and simply vote upon it because, needless to say, we have been appalled by the bloodshed and the indiscriminate slaughter that have occurred in China in the last week or so. Recognising the economic reforms that have occurred in China over a period, we have been concerned as to whether they would stand the test of time without corresponding social and political reforms. That is a debate that perhaps we could have another day-a debate about whether Western powers, including Australia, have correctly read the evolving changes in China or perhaps have overestimated the extent of change and in some ways attributed a Western assessment, invalidly and prematurely, to those changes and formed a view that they were more significant, in our terms of moral behaviour-to use a rather emotive expression-than what was in fact occurring. As I said, that is certainly a debate for another day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The extent to which the Government has been correctly advised in its assessment of these events in China is also a debate for another day. There is the question of whether the West generally, including Australia, has adopted the right policies to encourage sufficiently the evolvement of the forms of democracy which we believe are so important. We believe those forms of democracy and basic freedoms are important. We now find that the people of China also believe them to be important, but they have not had the opportunity to exercise them under the communist regime. These are important debates for another day. </PARA>
<PARA> We indicate our support, as part of the Parliament of this country, for this motion to condemn the massive and indiscriminate slaughter that has occurred and which calls upon the Chinese Government to cease this brutality and to enter into negotiations. As we said in our motion the other day, those negotiations should be with students, those who have been fighting and the representatives of those who have been prepared to give their lives for the sorts of values that we regard as so important for basic freedoms, such as freedom of speech. This motion notes that the processes of economic liberalisation that have occurred are important, but that they are only half the recipe. As we have noted, they will not stand without changes of a much more substantial nature in attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA> We support the motion. In doing so, we recognise the work that our diplomats do, not only in China, as in this instance, but in so many places throughout the world, in risking their lives to protect the interests and the lives of Australians. At times like this it is important that we note that because at other times they are taken for granted. For the reasons we have indicated, we support the motion, leaving to another day what is a much more complex debate as to the role Australia has played, could have played and could play in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make no apology for calling the motion not formal. It delayed the introduction of the motion by exactly 45 seconds. It is too important a matter to be dealt with simply by formal notice of motion-a motion is called formal when there is no debate-particularly as the motion was drawn up certainly not in consultation with me. I have seen the motion and, as motions go, it is a reasonable one, although one could quibble about whether the slaughter was indiscriminate. I would have thought that premeditated and very discriminate slaughter was undertaken by the 27th Army of the People's Liberation Army. It was quite deliberate, quite discriminate, and ordered by the power brokers in Beijing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the main reasons that I asked for the motion to be declared formal was so that I could express some of the concerns I have that the lessons of this action may not even be heard by the Government, the Parliament or the democracies of the world. That is so, given their attitudes over the last 10 years since the fall of the democracy wall, given their attitudes to the Chinese leadership and given their failure to draw attention, time after time, to the violation of human rights in China. The euphoria that has swept the Western world over the so-called democratisation of trade in China has stifled the attempts of people to raise civil rights issues and the violation of human rights in China. I have felt the odd one out in this regard for the last 10 years. I have pointed out, on a number of occasions, the violations of civil rights and the undermining of respect for human life in China. That respect is the basis for a true recognition of all human rights and, of course, all civil and political rights, no matter which country we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> We should reflect upon the fact that this most recent manifestation of imperial leadership in China in respect of its citizens comes about 10 years after the democracy wall incident. The democracy wall incident occurred in 1979, and had a long lead period. I speak as one who has an interest in China and personal contacts who presumably are able to give me far more detailed information than the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) is able to get. The democracy wall incident in 1979 was, apparently, used by Deng Xiaoping as a means of consolidating his position vis-a-vis Hua. It involved, as we all know, criticism of the Gang of Four. We know that Deng Xiaoping had spent a period of time in the wilderness prior to that. As the campaign progressed it appeared to Deng that the demands of those protesting were broadening to include criticism of the state and of the communist rule of the state, including the violation of human, civil and political rights. It was at that stage that Deng ordered a crackdown and the movement was crushed. The crackdown was accompanied by widespread purges and imprisonment. Indeed, a report in 1983-I think it was-by Amnesty International adverted to a number of violations of human rights in China. </PARA>
<PARA> One has to ask what has happened in those 10 years. How many people have been executed in China during those last 10 years? Has that issue ever been raised in an effective manner with the Chinese authorities-raised on every possible occasion? These are the questions we have to ask ourselves. When the blood has been cleaned up in Tiananmen Square the problem will still be with us. It is up to the governments of free democratic countries to continually raise the violations of human rights in China, instead of constantly considering how much money they can get from this enormous source of trade. It is a very strange circumstance when many people are carried away by that sort of euphoria. </PARA>
<PARA> About two months ago there was an advertisement from Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) in the House Magazine. I understand that it was also in the daily press. It was headed:</PARA>
<PARA> When we were capitalist running dogs and the world was better dead than red, we saw future partnerships, not rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA>I am convinced that Arvi Parbo, who is now Chairman of BHP, would not have seen that advertisement before it went in. He would have been rather more understanding of what that meant. The message that comes through is: do not raise human rights issues; let us get in and make a quid no matter what happens to the Chinese people; it is an internal affair of the Chinese. That attitude has even been stated here when I have raised matters such as the use of RU-486, the drug which was mainly developed for the Chinese Family Planning Commission. There was no international ethical evaluation of that. The Australian Government pays money to the program. I asked whether there was any international ethical evaluation of the program. The answer was no, because it was responding to the needs of the particular government-the Chinese Government in this particular regard. The Government funds the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) and financially supports the program in China. USAID said in its official declaration:</PARA>
<PARA> UNFPA participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion and involuntary sterilisation in the People's Republic of China. </PARA>
<PARA>We are paying money to the UNFPA. We have to consider these essential human rights issues before we willy-nilly accept the slogan that these are internal Chinese affairs. We have a large number of lessons to learn from this. I believe that unless we learn those lessons, democracy will not be inevitable in China. Violations of human rights in China will not stop. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel very strongly about this question, as I believe all honourable senators do. It has come to us very strongly in recent days but I believe that on every possible occasion we should raise these matters with dictatorship governments. Even though trade is flowing and there is a free-flow of people and a greater understanding of problems, we should never forget our responsibility as free democratic nations to raise not only issues of civil and political rights but also issues of fundamental human rights. Those rights will never ultimately be established unless there is a recognition of and respect for human life. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had not intended entering this debate. On behalf of my Party I express our wholehearted support for the motion moved by Senator Robert Ray for Senator Gareth Evans. I was moved to enter the debate by some of the remarks of Senator Harradine which I find quite extraordinary. The suggestion is wrong that he is the only one who has in fact raised human rights issues. I can see in the chamber, for example, Senator Puplick who I know on many occasions has raised these issues personally and has worked tirelessly in this matter. I know also of people on the Government benches who have done likewise. In fact, four weeks ago I was in China and on behalf of Amnesty International I raised issues about people who are imprisoned in China. Members of all political parties of every delegation that I have been with to China have raised those issues each time. I find it a most distressing thing that in a debate recognising the slaughter that is taking place we should have descended to a petty political exercise amongst ourselves in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> There is no other group of people from whatever party with whom I would prefer to be on this particular issue. I have seen no divisions whatsoever at any time in the strong support shown by everybody in every political party in this nation for human rights and at outrage at the violations that have occurred in China to date. These matters have been raised with the hosts on every occasion that I have been there. I hope that we will have unanimous support for this motion to express our concern, our profound distaste for and our condemnation of what has been the most extraordinarily massive and indiscriminate slaughter of those people fighting for one thing only and that is the right to have their country run by their own people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will support the motion. But I make the point that since the motion was moved yesterday things have moved on at speed. The Army has been mobilised and has split, and the slaughter is going on. Senator Harradine raised some important points. He is not the only one to have raised them over some years. I have had the good fortune to visit China twice, once in 1974 on a private trip with the Australian Institute of International Affairs and once with a delegation led, Mr President, by your predecessor, Senator Douglas McClelland. There were vast changes in China between the visits. It has gone from having the world's poorest and most struggling people to a society that has a chance of getting on in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> China had its original revolution in 1949 when Mao Zedong took over. In 10 years the country was on its beam end. It had the Great Leap Forward. In another 10 years the Great Leap Forward had not got off the ground, so China had the Cultural Revolution; but that did not cause any prosperity for it. So it had a campaign of persecution against Lin Biao and Confucius. That did not help and so China had a campaign of persecution against the Gang of Four. And so it has gone on. </PARA>
<PARA> The significant thing about all these putsches to reinstate the fervour of the socialist revolution is that the time between them has become less and less. It was quite obvious that at some time the people were going to revolt against the oppression. This motion calls for the Government of Red China to stop what it is doing. The Government in China is fighting for its life. The fact that the Army is split in the way in which it is shows the desperation of the struggle. The people, of course, are struggling for their freedom. It will not stop. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware from history that nearly every country that has fought for democracy has had to go through a monumental revolution. Even Britain had to do that. Brother fought brother, father fought son and the king wound up getting beheaded. The United States had a civil war where the same thing happened; the French had a revolution; and China looks as if it is destined for that. Certainly we can support the sentiments of the motion. I think the split in China goes a lot deeper than we realise at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has agreed to debate a package of six Bills-in reality there are eight Bills-as a block in a cognate debate. The Opposition did not vote against that. First of all, we do not have the numbers to turn the Senate around and, secondly, we recognise the mess that the Government has got the legislative program into and the need to finish in time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to put on record that the motion really abuses the whole concept of a cognate debate because we agree to a cognate debate where Bills are similar. We have before us eight Bills which have no similarity at all. They range from a diesel fuel rebate Bill to a customs tariff amendment Bill dealing with shipping containers and top crude oils, another customs tariff Bill on beer and liquefied petroleum gas, a coal export levy Bill, a sugar Bill, a uranium concentrate Bill, a subsidy Bill for farm equipment and a bounty Bill on ships. There is nothing linking any of those Bills together. It is an abuse of the cognate system, an abuse of the Senate and an abuse of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Four of those Bills are of significant political importance to the Australian community. The diesel fuel rebate Bill, the coal export levy Bill, the uranium concentrate Bill and the sugar Bill, which is the sequence to the abolition of the embargo, all have great political significance not only for the Liberal and National parties but also for the Australian Labor Party. The Parliament is entitled to have some time to debate them. Instead, we have an hour, which works out roughly to a little over three minutes to cope with each of these Bills. Being the shadow Minister for Customs, the person responsible for the Liberal and National parties' approach to the Bills, I want to put on record the total inadequacy of the system we are faced with. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us deal with the Bills in series. The first is the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1989. The Opposition will not be opposing this Bill. The Bill proposes amendments to the Customs Act 1901, the Excise Act 1901 and the Customs Administration Act 1985. The principal amendments in the Bill relate to the diesel fuel rebate scheme which was announced on 3 March 1989. The proposal to alter the diesel fuel rebate scheme contained in this Bill includes amendments to improve its administration and to correct anomalies in the coverage of activities eligible for rebate. The diesel fuel rebate provides rebate on either customs or excise duty at varying rates for diesel fuel purchased for specified categories of off-road use-namely, in mining and primary production, residential premises and medical institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill reverts to the situation which existed prior to 2 October 1987. A whole host of rebate claims were made prior to October 1987. These will now be able to be claimed after the announcement on 3 March 1989. But in between there is a veritable no-man's-land where no claims can be made. The Opposition would very much like to know in the committee stage how the Government can justify the discriminatory action of inflicting different requirements on the industry at different points in time. I am advised that some of the mining companies miss out to the extent of up to $800,000 in some cases because of this illogicality, this gap in the payment of rebates. I look forward to the explanation from the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) in due course in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Bill before the Senate is the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989. Again, the Opposition supports this Bill. The principal amendments in this Bill relate to the treatment of transport containers and topped crude oil. The Bill also contains some minor amendments which relate to the introduction of harmonised tariff classification and makes a complementary amendment in line with changes to the Excise Tariff Act, which is part of this debate also, concerning the beer provisions in the next Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The tariff amendments in this Bill are a consequence of a number of factors, including Budget decisions, consideration of various Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) reports and Government policy. In the case of top crude oil the amendments reflect the Government's desire not to let an estimated $14m slip from the revenue pool. This $14m is the amount which the Government has estimated it could lose if steps are not taken to tighten the position of revenue gained from the tariff on crude. Presently, all crude oil is not subject to tariff. A tariff is payable on the refined products. The potential revenue effect arising from crude oil not being sent to local refiners but instead being used for other purposes, such as fuel oil, means that it would be possible for the Treasury to miss out on excise payments which the Government estimates could reach up to $14m a year. </PARA>
<PARA> The other major amendment in this Bill relates to the tariff on shipping containers. At present containers attract a tariff loading of 30 per cent. Following the IAC report on transport containers which was released in February 1988, the Government has accepted that the 30 per cent tariff be removed. The IAC concluded that the current rate of duty was distorting the allocation of resources and was resulting in Australian customers for containers paying a higher price than necessary. This situation is further complicated by the containers convention, which places restrictions on the use of international containers in domestic trade. The Australian National shipping line is one of the major sources of containers and it has estimated that the amendment to the Act will save it about $1m a year. There are other industry estimates which suggest that the removal of this tariff will provide, collectively, benefits up to a value of about $9m a year. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendments to this Bill are basically in line with the harmonisation of tariffs, and they range from the removal of a high rate of duty on embroidery sewing kits-a reduction to 15 per cent-and the introduction of a new tariff barrier of up to 15 per cent on the production of Australian manufactured large hand-held sprays. There are a few minor areas which deal with carpets and hand-held machinery. </PARA>
<PARA> The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1989 deals with amendments to enable customs duty on certain imported goods to be collected at the time of importation, to alter the excise duty on naturally occurring liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and to impose excise duty on top petroleum crudes as a consequence of the preceding Bill. Again, the Opposition will not be opposing this Bill. Three proposals of note are the excise changes in relation to low-alcohol beer, liquefied petroleum gas, and top crude. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition supports very much the reduction of excise duty on low-alcohol beer. One of the distortions that have taken place in Australian drinking habits has been a preference for spirits because beer, quite simply, has been inflated out of its normal price range. If people are going to drink, particularly people who are starting to drink such as adolescents in the 16- to 20-year-old bracket, I argue very strongly, as I have in the past in this chamber, that the Government should provide an incentive in the form of reduced excise loading on beer to people to drink beer rather than spirits. I am very alarmed about the way we have, in the last 15 to 20 years, seen very sophisticated television inciting and inviting young and immature drinkers, because of the high glamour depicted on television, to drink things such as Bacardi and Tia Maria, which contain very high levels of alcohol. They are drinks which, by their very nature, are mixed with tonic water, soda water, orange juice, and so on, which disguise their true flavour. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned at the way the importers of these spirits are leading young people to believe that it is smart and desirable to drink these very high alcohol content drinks. My objection is that inexperienced drinkers simply do not know the alcohol content of what they are drinking, and that beer is to be preferred because it is the drink of moderation. Most people, particularly with the introduction of the new low-alcohol beers, reach satisfaction before they reach inebriation. Given the enormous cost and devastation that alcohol in excess does to this society, the Government has a public duty to provide an incentive in the form of a lower duty rate on beer. I say again that, whatever people might think of beer, beer is the drink of moderation in the alcoholic regime. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will provide for a lower rate of duty on the low-alcohol beers, which are now making big inroads into the beer-drinking market. But I am not sure that in the competition from wines and spirits, the beer-drinking market is recovering the place that it enjoyed 20 or 30 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> In passing, I note that the cost of alcohol abuse in Australia is about $1.5 billion a year. About 40 per cent of road deaths are associated with alcohol consumption. In 1987 alone, Australians spent $7,098m on alcohol-almost as much as we spend on our defence budget. It is comparable with our education budget at the Federal level. It is a huge amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA> The next amendment in this Bill deals with changes in excise in relation to LPG. That is basically a technical matter. The Opposition welcomes the change but we believe that complete deregulation of the liquefied petroleum gas market would be a greater industry incentive to increase availability of supply, to prolong the availability of the gas beyond the next decade and to ensure its efficient allocation. We would move for more deregulation in that field. </PARA>
<PARA> The next Bill, the Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Amendment Bill 1989, deals with the blending of low grade coals with higher grade coals to satisfy market requirements. In 1984 the Government provided an exemption from export duty for high quality coking coal, which was blended with underground and open-cut coal, providing that on average there was at least 15 per cent of the underground coal in the blended coal and all of the resulting blend was produced from the same mine. The exemption also applied to high quality coking coal produced at the same mine where at least 15 per cent of the total production of exported coal on average had been produced from underground mines. The effect of these provisions was that in the Bowen Basin in Queensland, at Moura and South Blackwater high quality coking coal blends were exempt from export duty if exported as a single blend. They lost that exemption if further blended with coals from other mines before export. This Bill will extend the existing exemption from export duty where high quality coking coal is blended with coal from other mines before export. </PARA>
<PARA> The origins of the Coal Export Bill go back to 1975 and the infamous Rex Connor when the Australian coal market was expanding very rapidly. There were some very big profits to be made, particularly from the Queensland fields with their efficient, low cost production. Those days are long past. The coal market is now intensely competitive and the imposition of excessive freight rates as a taxing vehicle, as occurs in some of the States, particularly in Queensland, and the imposition of a customs tariff coal export duty severely operate against the national interests of our export sales. On this side of the Parliament we would like to see these coal export levies abolished in the interests of the coal industry and in the interests of Australia's export trade. We certainly support this Bill, which is extending the entitlement to exemption for coal export duties to those mines. </PARA>
<PARA> The next Bill is the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Amendment Bill 1989. On behalf of the Opposition, I have an amendment in relation to the motion for the second reading, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate is of the opinion that the Government should be condemned for:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) imposing a discriminatory levy upon one operation alone at a time when Australia's uranium exporters are struggling to remain competitive in the international market and are already overburdened by excessive taxes and charges; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) its ideological approach to the development of Australia's uranium industry which has resulted in an economically absurd `three mine policy' ''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Uranium Concentrate Export Duty Bill imposes an increased duty on exported uranium mined in the Alligator Rivers region from $1.02 per kilogram to $1.15 per kilogram. I noted that on page 311 of Budget Paper No. 1 a further increase is proposed. It covers the increase we are discussing here and then talks about an increase to $1.30 per kilogram from 1 July 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> A duty was imposed on the exported uranium concentrate mined in the Alligator Rivers area by the Customs (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Act 1980. Funds raised through the duty are used to finance the operation of the Office of the Supervising Scientist, which is responsible for monitoring, controlling and conducting research into the environmental effects of uranium mining in the area. As a sideline, it is interesting that at the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd operation at Coronation Hill, which is also covered by the Supervising Scientist, BHP makes no contribution at all. The sole producer in the region, Ranger, has to pay for the environmental supervision of the Coronation Hill gold prospect in its exploratory stages under this legislation. The duty is quite significant; it is about 5 per cent of the operating costs for Energy Resources of Australia Ltd which is the operator of Ranger. This is not an inconsiderable impost on an industry which is struggling against the great fratricidal warfare going on in the Australian Labor Party which is having a most detrimental effect on Australia's uranium export industry. </PARA>
<PARA> We live in a very polluted world. One of the huge pollutants of this world is the burning of fossil fuels. No matter how many scrubbers we put on the exhaust chimneys of thermal power stations burning coal, we still end up with carbon dioxide; we end up with a considerable amount of nitrous oxides; and, to some degree, depending on the nature of the product and the efficiency of the scrubbers, we end up with sulphur dioxide. Millions of tonnes of pollutants go into the atmosphere from the combustion of coal. Inevitably, the world will have to move to a cleaner and safer form of production. That form of production, given present technology, must be atomic power stations. There is no alternative. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note in the technical literature at present the development of a second generation of atomic power stations. We have been through the first phase during the last 30 to 40 years, where we have dealt with very big units at very high costs. In the Western democracies, they have had a predictable and safe performance. This has not been so in the Soviet economies, but it has certainly been the case in the West. We have been free from great accidents such as that which occurred at Chernobyl. Now technology has advanced into the phase two stage and we are looking at power units which can be at least a third, and possibly a tenth, of the size of the huge mega-stations which were once required to be built for the nuclear generation of electricity. Not only has there been a great shrinkage in the size of stations, but also there has been a commensurate reduction in capital costs. There have been great increases in safety because passive safety measures have been developed in the light of the engineering experiences of the last 30 to 40 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The world is on the brink of a huge expansion into the nuclear generation of power which will be safe and cheaper than coal-fired stations. That, in itself, has implications for Australia with respect to its coal exports. But we have the greatest proven deposits of uranium in the world at the lowest cost of extraction. There is an enormous market for Australia if we get into that market now. We do not have a monopoly. Other countries can come in. Yet this Government is at war within itself-the Left versus the Right versus the Centre and the unity factions and all the other factions the Labor Party has manufactured. We have a very bad reputation internationally. When one makes an investment in nuclear power houses, with the amount of money that is involved, one has to be able to look not only 10 years ahead, but also 20, 30, 40 years ahead. One has to know that supplies are going to be delivered on time and on price. This Government's behaviour over the last six years-with members fighting amongst themselves and with the Party not being able to resolve a simple, fundamental, management issue, namely the production of a fuel that the world needs-is working very much against Australia's national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The next Bill we are debating is the Subsidy Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, which is designed to terminate the Subsidy (Cultivation Machines and Equipment) Act 1986 and the Subsidy (Grain Harvesters and Equipment) Act 1985. This Bill has its origins in the April economic statement. The termination of these assistance schemes will result in a saving to the Government of $19m during 1989 and $10.4m during 1990-91. Whilst the Bill is obviously favourable for the Government, it does not do much for the industry operating in an environment of total unpredictability. The industry was told some time ago that this bounty would stay on grain harvesters and farm equipment. In the April statement the ground was cut from under its feet. The Bill contains an amendment to provide a transitional period. Again, the Opposition does not oppose the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA> (b) its disregard of the need for certainty and predictability in industry policy; and</PARA>
<PARA> calls on the Government to introduce as quickly as possible the proposed new policy initiatives promised in the April statement''. </PARA>
<PARA>The next Bill we are considering is the Bounty (Ships) Bill 1989. The Government has notified the industry that the bounty will be phased out and it has given it a forward termination date. The Opposition will support this Bill but we will move an amendment in the committee stage which is aimed at changing clause 17, which deals with the registration criteria. This Bill is very much a compromise. The Bounty (Ships) Bill is not a new Bill, but it is effectively a successor to the Bounty (Ships) Act 1980, which is soon to expire. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to provide bounty assistance to the shipbuilding industry for the period 1 July 1989 to 30 June 1995, with the bounty being phased down in that time. It reflects the Government's policy announced in November 1988 following the consideration of the IAC report entitled Ships, Boats and Other Vessels. Under the provisions of this Bill it is proposed that shipbuilders who meet the registration criteria and who construct or modify bountiable vessels in Australia will be eligible to claim bounty for their eligible costs, with rate of bounty paid at that cost dependent on which cost was incurred by the shipbuilder. That sounds very complicated, but it happens to be what the legislation provides. </PARA>
<PARA> A bounty has been paid to the ship building industry for almost 40 years. The current scheme has applied since 1980. In 1988 the IAC undertook a review of the industry, and this Bill is based on its recommendations. It recommended that the removal of import restrictions be undertaken; that the continuation of bounty assistance for ship construction and modification for domestic sale be phased down from 19 per cent to 15 per cent by 1992 for prescribed vessels, and continuing at 15 per cent for other than prescribed vessels, with certain provisions; the continuation of bounty until 1993; and payment of bounty only on completion of the vessel. The Government has not accepted all of those recommendations. In the face of the IAC recommendations, the Government proposed to phase out bounty on all eligible construction and modification for the export and domestic markets over a six-year period. However, it has agreed to remove import restrictions. </PARA>
<PARA> A major concern is the Government's proposals concerning registration, which have become more restrictive. I will continue my remarks on this topic in the committee stage. A major provision of the Bill is an interpretation section-clause 4. Clause 5 specifies which costs incurred by a shipbuilder in the construction or modification of a bountiable vessel are eligible to receive bounty. Clause 6 relates to the determination of costs of construction and modification. Part 2 of the Bill concerns the bounty itself, and prescribes the eligibility conditions, circumstances where bounty is not payable, and the rate of the bounty. The rate of the bounty is 15 per cent from July 1989 to June 1991, 10 per cent from July 1991 to June 1993 and 5 per cent from July 1993 to June 1995, when it will be terminated. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 3 of the Bill concerns the payment of bounty and part 4, which is entitled `Administration', concerns the registration of crown securities and so on. Currently, registration criteria are prescribed by regulation. However, the criteria have been included in the body of the Bounty (Ships) Bill. There are three newer, modified registration criteria which set out that at least 75 per cent of the applicants' activities will be devoted to the construction or modification of vessels which are bountiable; that applicants must employ at least 40 persons, in contrast to the current specified requirement of a minimum of 20 persons; and that applicants will have to submit a business plan. Part 5 of the Bill permits the making of regulations as required by the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The final Bill we are considering is a very important one-the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1989. In a way, it is the end of a saga of mismanagement by this Government. It is particularly important to all Queensland senators. I would like to quote the statement of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin. On 12 May 1989-within the last four weeks-he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to announce that after a year of grandstanding and political opportunism, often by people who would not know sugar from salt, the new arrangements have been completed. </PARA>
<PARA>If there is one person who should not have made that statement it is the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. The sugar embargo-the prohibition on the importation of sugar into this country-which has been so important to such a large industry, was handled by Mr Kerin and this Government in an absolutely scandalous manner. The announcement came out of the blue. The industry has always recognised that the prohibition of sugar imports had to expire at some stage. But the Government, without warning and consultation, dropped this decision on a very big and important industry. There is no way that can be justified. At the time Mr Kerin said that he was too busy to talk with this industry-one of the biggest industries in Australia, but the Minister simply did not have time to talk with its members. If anyone has grandstanded or operated in an opportunistic way, it has been Mr Kerin, on behalf of the Labor Party. The price for that negligence, arrogance and incompetence will be exacted at the next Federal election in the sugar seats in Queensland currently held by the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The abolition of the sugar embargo was accompanied by a statement that certain tariff protection would be provided. That tariff protection operated in a way that gave no defence to the industry when it was most vulnerable. The Opposition, in this chamber, referred the matter of the form of protection the industry should have to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology for inquiry. The Committee made its recommendations. It advanced the case of the sugar industry considerably. But at the end of the day, the Senate Committee's recommendations were not practical because they compromised the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and could not be implemented. Building on the Senate Committee's recommendations, the Government and the Opposition have now come up with a specific rate of duty for sugar which is acceptable to the industry and which will be beneficial. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before us proposes to terminate the Sugar Agreement Act 1985 and to lift the sugar import embargo. It places a fixed tariff on most sugar products of 11.5c a kilogram, phasing to 7c a kilogram protection by 1 July 1992. The Bill provides for a 5 per cent tariff discount for developing countries: Papua New Guinea and the Forum island countries. The sugar trade between Australia and New Zealand will be free of any tariff. The Bill would expose the Australian refined sugar industry to competition from this source because sugar could be imported by New Zealand duty free-there is no tariff on it there-could be refined and then sold on the Australian market. The protection for the Australian market is the incompetence of this Government in handling the Waterside Workers Federation and the Seamen's Union of Australia. The freight costs across the Tasman are so high they form a natural protective barrier for the Australian industry. However, because of the very high costs of transport in Australia we will be in the ridiculous position that it will be cheaper for Western Australians to import sugar from Mauritius or Thailand than to buy it from Queensland, where it is produced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The package of Bills we are dealing with is quite extensive. I intend to address only three of those Bills-the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Amendment Bill 1989, the Bounty (Ships) Bill 1989 and the Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Amendment Bill 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon drew out several important features in his remarks which underlie consideration of two of these matters; namely, the use and export of coal and the use and export of uranium. He argued in a somewhat illogical way that we should not increase the tariff on uranium because the industry was in dire straits. Yet, at the same time, he seemed to be arguing that we should be expanding that industry because somewhere down the track it will become extremely profitable for Australia. The Australian Democrats do not accept that view. We point to, and we underscore, the lack of profitability of the uranium industry at the present time. I understand there is an announcement in today's press that, following a public referendum in California, a further nuclear power station has been closed down because of the very high costs of that form of energy. </PARA>
<PARA> I will pick up that point for a moment. Senator MacGibbon and others in the Opposition repeatedly seem to emphasise that nuclear energy will be the fuel which will address the important environmental problems which we face, such as the greenhouse effect. They do not seem to have read the very extensive literature which gives very good reasons why that is simply not the case. Those arguments bear on both coal exports from Australia-which is the subject of one of the Bills we are dealing with-and the uranium concentrate customs tariff. When the increase in the price of oil occurred throughout the world in the early 1970s, one would have expected that if nuclear energy was a suitable substitute for fossil fuels, the demand for nuclear electricity would have increased. But what did we observe? Not only was there a downturn in the consumption of fossil fuels, as we learnt to use them more efficiently, but also there was a very considerable downturn in the building and ordering of nuclear power stations. Since that time there have been no new orders for nuclear power stations in the United States of America. The stations which have been coming on-line were ordered and have been under construction since the mid-1970s. </PARA>
<PARA> In an economy which is directed towards perpetual growth, there is a positive and not a negative link between the consumption of fossil fuels and the perceived need to build nuclear power stations. In other words, the consumption of fossil fuels increases as we move towards building more nuclear power stations, and there are very good reasons for that. If there is a demand in the economy for more electricity and that is met by nuclear sources, those industries which use the electricity and those industries which serve both the electricity industry and the other industries which will use the electricity, are largely dependent upon fossil fuels. For instance, the mining of the uranium ore itself is normally carried out with devices which use fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are used to transport the ore. The industries in the major centres which use the electricity which is generated will use fossil fuels to transport their raw materials to factories. While they may use nuclear generated electricity within the factory, the transport of those goods away from the factory also involves the use of fossil fuels. </PARA>
<PARA> This subject was very closely explored as long ago as the mid-1970s by the so-called Flowers Commission, which published the sixth report on the environment in the United Kingdom and which dealt specifically with nuclear power. It posed the question in a somewhat different form and asked: what is the likelihood of the advent of nuclear power and the use of nuclear power in advanced industrialised countries releasing fossil fuel for less developed countries? It came to the clear conclusion that that was extremely unlikely, that the need for very large up-front capital expenses for the building of nuclear power stations would place such a demand on the economies in these countries that their consumption of fossil fuel would in fact increase. It pointed to the need for a political will to reverse both the demand for fossil fuel and the demand for energy generally if less developed countries were going to get greater access to fossil fuel at a lower cost. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether Senator MacGibbon is aware of a quite extensive paper produced by two American researchers, Keepin and Katz, who have looked at the relative costs of developing technologies which would use the available energy far more efficiently. They compared those costs with the costs of going down the nuclear road as a way of addressing problems like the greenhouse effect. The figures come out something like this: the efficiency road is about seven times more cost effective, dollar for dollar, than going down the nuclear road. According to their estimate, for every $100 spent on building nuclear power stations rather than on increasing the efficiency with which conventional fuels are used, approximately one tonne extra of carbon dioxide goes into the atmosphere. So building nuclear power stations directly contributes to the addition of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere and increases the greenhouse effect for a variety of reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> What we derive from these analyses is that we need to be moving very firmly towards greater efficiency in the use of energy, and there are considerable technologies available to do that. But what do we find in these Bills, particularly the coal Bill? We find the Government looking backwards and attempting to keep the levy on coal low in a desperate attempt to export more coal. The Government clearly has no ability to look to the future and allow the longer term considerations to be fed into determining policy with respect to fossil fuels or to modify policy to develop those technologies which in the future will be of economic benefit to Australia. For instance, if the world recognises that there is a severe problem with greenhouse warming, with the addition of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, and moves towards greater fuel efficiency, then clearly the demand for coal, including Australian coal, will fall still further. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we do then with those industries which we have artificially supported for longer than they needed to be supported? It leaves our coal industry and Australia in an even worse plight. Rather than further subsidise an industry which clearly is not able to compete while it pays the full levy, I suggest that the Government and Australia, as a nation, would be far better advised to put that money into developing more efficient ways of utilising energy. They are the technologies which will be demanded within the next one or two decades. Not only would we get advantages in terms of increased fuel efficiency, lower costs, decreased emissions of greenhouse gases, which benefit everybody, but also we would put ourselves in the forefront of new technological developments which the world will be needing and demanding. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, this Government is looking backwards. In looking at the coal legislation, it is interesting to note that the Government seems to recognise that in a competitive market situation the price of our coal needs to be kept lower so that we can maintain our exports. Coal is also being exported by a number of less developed countries, so by doing that we are directly competing with those countries and putting them in a less viable situation at a time when we should be providing more help in an attempt to increase equity in this world. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats are very concerned about the Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Amendment Bill, which seeks to extend further the alleviation of the coal levy with respect to certain coals-in effect, to subsidise coal, although the Government would deny the use of that term. I am reminded that just the other day the Opposition asked a question about the gold tax and the Government was careful to point out that it was putting a similar tax on gold producers to that applying in other industries; it was simply bringing the gold production industry into line with other industries. In this case the Government clearly is moving in the other direction and, I believe, for the wrong reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Amendment Bill, I note that the Government has accepted the logic of the argument which I used last year when the levy was increased and has now further increased the levy, making it much closer to covering the total cost of the Supervising Scientist in the Northern Territory. This is completely justified, strongly supported and long overdue. The levy should have been made to cover the environmental consequences of uranium mining in that environmentally sensitive area. The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) referred in his second reading speech to the environmentally sensitive nature of Kakadu National Park. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon asserted that nuclear energy is safer than fossil fuel. He is apparently unaware of the work of Pohl, an American health physicist, who calculated the long term health consequences of uranium mining, arising from the release of radon gas from tailings. His calculations show that the number of deaths from cancer arising from that radon gas is essentially the same as the number which would arise from mining coal to provide an equivalent amount of energy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This was an open-cut mine: it was from the open tailings on the surface. The difference is that the effect of radon releases extends for hundreds of thousands of years into the future and the resultant deaths are spread out over a long time, whereas those who are killed in coal mines belong to the generation which enjoys the benefit of the electricity. Some people would argue that we can discount future deaths. That is not a position taken by the Democrats. We would argue that it does not matter whether a death occurs in this generation or 10 or 100 years hence; it is still a death which is attributable to an activity in this generation, and we have a moral responsibility to take the integrated death toll into account. Of course, the levy relates to immediate environmental consequences and in no sense takes that into account. We say that we do not have a right to shift onto later generations the penalties from activities which produce a benefit in this generation. We believe it is a significant reason why we should not proceed with uranium mining.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bounty (Ships) Bill provides for a continuation of the bounty on ships of between 150 and 10,000 tonnes built in Australia up to 1995 and under certain conditions. The conditions have been mentioned by Senator MacGibbon and the bounty applies to yards which employ at least 40 people on such an activity and yards which are 75 per cent involved in shipbuilding. The bounty scales down over time. It will be 15 per cent of eligible costs up to 1991 and will go down to 10 per cent between 1991 and 30 June 1993. It will then be reduced to 5 per cent and will run out completely in June 1995. The Minister has made a convincing case that this restructured bounty has already had a significant effect on the building of ships in Australia, and particularly on exports. He points in his second reading speech to current export orders amounting to $300m and goes on to outline some of the details of those successes. It seems that the Government's action has been successful in establishing a viable shipbuilding industry and helping it to get and maintain export orders. </PARA>
<PARA> Strong representations have been made to the Democrats by one shipbuilder in particular, who maintains that his operation may at times fall below the 75 per cent requirements in the legislation. The Democrats accept that, whatever criteria are set to determine whether an operation is in or outside the registrable category, those criteria will be arbitrary to some extent. In this case we accept the Government's criteria and, therefore do not support the Opposition's amendment. We believe that, should the criteria be modified, as has been suggested, some company or companies will be sitting right on the borderline and there will be further claims to extend the bounty criteria and make them much wider. It is for that reason that we believe that the criteria set by the Government, while arbitrary, are appropriate. They seem to be working, and therefore we support the legislation in the form in which the Government has presented it. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I make the point again that two of the Bills before us deal very much with the development of a long term energy policy by Australia but do not properly reflect the development of such a policy. Indeed, the Energy 2000 statement by the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) earlier this year did not deal with questions such as the greenhouse effect and improved energy efficiency. We are, therefore, disappointed with the way in which this lack of policy development comes through in things such as the coal Bill. We enjoin the Government to look again at the development of a longer term energy policy and how that policy would mesh in with the development and establishment of desirable forward-looking industries in Australia directed towards improved energy efficiency. Those sorts of industries would be of benefit in terms of their environmental impact and they would also be cost effective. In being forward-looking they would put Australia in a very advantaged position in terms of our industries being able to compete on future markets. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak to just one of the Bills before the Senate, the Bounty (Ships) Bill. This Bill extends bounty assistance for some Australian shipbuilding from 1 July this year to 30 June 1995. The reason for the Bill is that the current Bounty (Ships) Act provides for a cash limited bounty to shipbuilders who commenced construction of vessels prior to 30 June 1989, that is, the end of this month. This new Bill will continue bounty assistance after this month at rates which will be gradually phased down until June 1995 when the bounty assistance will cease. There is no doubt that in recent times the bounty assistance for shipbuilding has increased our export orders. At the moment our export orders for ships amount to $300m. Recent orders include two high-speed catamaran car and passenger ferries, 10 fishing trawlers and two luxury motor yachts, all for export. Over half the vessels completed in 1989 so far have been for export, compared to only one ship exported from Australia in the whole of 1984-85.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the shipbuilding industry is becoming more vibrant, why do we need to retain the bounty? The Government argues-and I agree-that we need it because the cost from entry to the international market resulted in trading losses for a number of firms in their early years. I agree with the Government that the most appropriate form of assistance is a bounty, which is very much preferable to a tariff because a tariff is likely to distort consumption costs and reduce the local demand for ships. I also strongly agree with the proposal in this Bill to phase down the rates of assistance gradually and for the bounty to cease altogether on the designated date, June 1995. The trouble with protection in Australia in the past has been that we have never known when to end it. We have protected so-called infant industries and have kept protecting them long past infancy until they have become senile and inefficient, and very costly to Australia. The car industry is one example of this, and we are still trying to clean up that mess. If we are to protect our newly emerging shipbuilding industry, we must ensure that protection ceases at a predictable and reasonable date. I believe that this Bill does just that. </PARA>
<PARA> Why do we want a shipbuilding industry at all? In 1979 a combined Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) and Tariff Board inquiry looked into the shipbuilding industry and concluded that it was essential for defence reasons and for maintaining and developing shipbuilding skills in Australia. At the beginning of the 1980s the prospects for the shipbuilding industry were certainly not very bright. The introduction of the 38-hour week increased costs and wages in shipbuilding. The imposition of a sales tax on pleasure craft had a detrimental effect on shipbuilding. As a result there were no new sales. In addition, the high costs of protected materials in Australia added to the other high costs for shipbuilders. </PARA>
<PARA> The result was that in the early 1980s few new ships were built here and second-hand ships were imported instead. Even the Government was not a particularly good customer for our shipbuilding industry. Two mine hunters were built for the Navy, but the first four FFGs were built in America, rather than being built here. The two follow-on FFGs were built at Williamstown, which is an improvement. The only reason that program has had any degree of success is that the Government has sold off Williamstown. It is now privatised and is working apparently quite efficiently, although one still has to see a detailed run-down of the costs of building these ships at Williamstown. What was done there-I wish it had also been done elsewhere-was to reduce the number of unions involved in shipbuilding. The number of unions at Williamstown is now down to three. We will not really succeed until it is down to one. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish more action had been taken in regard to the other major shipbuilding projects in Australia: the submarines in South Australia, and the proposed 12 frigates to be built in eastern Australia-the exact position where they will be built is still not decided. We must use the shipbuilding programs for the Navy to revolutionise and clean up our shipbuilding industry. It is absolutely essential that we have only one union in each work place if we are to have efficiency. The workers in each shipyard must have some interest, some involvement, in the success of their enterprise, rather than regarding it as an enormous cow which they can milk interminably with unreasonable wage and condition demands. Until we achieve that, we will not be competitive on an international scale. </PARA>
<PARA> We can build very good ships, but at the moment they are extremely expensive and their delivery dates are extremely unreliable. That is for the Navy. I mention that only in passing because this bounty Bill does not deal with ships built for the Navy. So, coming back to the types of ships with which the Bill is concerned, I repeat the remarks I was making about naval shipbuilding. The importance of proper industrial relations, the involvement of the work force and the productivity of the enterprise are essential if we are to have a long-term success in building other ships. </PARA>
<PARA> Coming back to the Bill, though, since the introduction of bounties to assist the shipbuilding industry there has been some improvement and the beginnings of an export market. However, there are still a number of problems. The Government boasts that 45 new companies have registered since the extension of the bounty scheme in 1984. However, of these 45 new companies, only 13 have maintained continual registration during the last five years. Our shipbuilding industry now is very small by world standards, following the closing of the shipyards in Whyalla and Newcastle. As a result of their closure, we no longer have the capability to produce large international trading vessels. We are still able to build steel-hulled vessels up to 10,000 tonnes-fishing vessels, support vessels for off-shore installations, tugs, dredgers, small naval vessels, barges and passenger ferries. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the problems facing existing and potential shipbuilders in Australia? The fundamental problem is that we are between 10 per cent and 20 per cent dearer than an overseas competing firm. We should not be, but we are. The reasons are essentially the appalling system of industrial relations and restrictive work practices. If we want to be competitive in this and all other areas, we must tackle those problems. In addition, finance for shipbuilding is very difficult to obtain in Australia. Even the bounty is not easy to come by under the present Act. To receive the bounty a shipbuilder has to be registered by the Minister, who acts on the advice of the Shipbuilding Consultative Group. This group advises the Minister whether a shipbuilder meets the registration criteria and whether the builder will `contribute to the orderly development of the industry'. The result is the bounties are restricted to a select group of shipbuilders, determined by bureaucrats rather than the market. However, imperfect as the system might be, for the moment contribution of the bounty seems to offer the best hope for the shipbuilding industry in Australia. Otherwise I fear that the resources will just move out of the industry as the current orders are completed within the next year or so. </PARA>
<PARA> This bounty Bill, I make quite clear, applies to ship construction or modification. The ship repair industry, though related, is a different industry. One has only to look at that industry to see the problems. Just over two years ago the Government provided bounty assistance for the ship repair industry, but it is still very uncompetitive. Last month I was at a meeting of the Institute of Marine Engineers, at which the leading shipowner told us that he still preferred to have his ships repaired overseas. His reasons were cost and time taken. Time out of service is a cost for the shipowner. This particular shipowner said-I agree with him from my experience-that Australia does high quality work very well, but that routine ship repairs are just too expensive because of the high wages and poor performance in terms of output per person of the employees in the Ship Painters and Dockers Union and other relevant unions. The result is that shipowners would prefer to have their ships repaired overseas rather than in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> On the shipbuilding side there is some hope for us with the world shipbuilding outlook. The latest Drewry Shipping survey indicates that the shipbuilding industry worldwide is now entering a period of relative stability, with replacement being the prime requirement. We have only to recall that the average age of the Australian National Line fleet is now over nine years to realise that the replacement requirement is also very strong here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The shipbuilding industry in 1989 is an entirely different industry from 10 years ago. In 1979-I am talking about the world-wide situation-most of the top shipbuilders were located in western Europe. Ten years later the shipbuilding industry has gravitated to the Far East with the South Koreans challenging the Japanese for world supremacy in shipbuilding. All shipbuilders have incurred losses in recent years and government subsidies have declined. As a result, the prices of new ships are bound to rise and the shipyards will be unwilling and, of course, unable to offer loss making contracts. This expected rise in the prices of new ships has resulted in more owners upgrading or converting existing tonnage, and it is important that we, here in Australia, are in a position to take advantage of the increasing market for ship modifications. </PARA>
<PARA> What worries me, as I mentioned briefly before, is our lack of productivity and the high costs of our ship repair and shipbuilding industries, which may prevent us taking advantage of the chances offered. For instance, Australia takes three times as long as Holland to build a dead-weight 4,000-tonne ship. In Australia we take at least a year to build one of these vessels while Holland builds three ships in the same period. Put another way, Holland has a 300 per cent productivity rate over Australia. This is because Holland has a longer working week than we do, its people take fewer days off work and it has a lead over us in innovative design. Here, we do less work, we subsidise inefficient industries, and frankly, we just cannot afford to go on as we have been doing. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the great crimes of this Government is that during its six years in office industrial productivity has not risen at all. At a time when we desperately need a rise in productivity to overcome our very serious economic problems, our productivity has not risen. We can see why, from the debate we had yesterday on shipping and the waterfront. The Labor Government is an extension of the trade union movement, and is not prepared to take the necessary tough measures because the consequence would be a revolt from their trade union colleagues. I was going to say `masters'. I think they are masters rather than colleagues. The problem is, if the Government is not prepared to tackle industrial problems, we are doomed to sinking further and further down in international comparisons. Coming back to the ships, they are essential, of course, and we have an urgent need to replace the ageing fleet of Australian flag ships. If we are to do it here in Australia, and be economically competitive with our shipping afterwards, we must be able to build them economically. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill reflects some of the recommendations of the IAC report on Ships, Boats and Other Vessels, and is designed to preserve the small amount of shipbuilding this country still has. The IAC recommended the removal of import restrictions on ships, the gradual phasing-down of tariffs on boats, the continuation of bounty assistance for ship construction and modification for domestic sale, the phasing out of bounty assistance for export sale and the payment of bounty only on completion of vessels. The Government has implemented some, but not all, of these recommendations. For instance, this Bill will phase out the bounty for all eligible ship construction and modification for the domestic as well as the export market over a six-year period. This Bill does not put any upper limit on the total amount of bounty which is calculated as a percentage of the costs at the time the costs were incurred, plus 20 per cent of overheads. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, the registration criteria in the Bill have become more restrictive than the IAC recommended. In the committee stage Senator MacGibbon, I understand, will be moving an amendment relating to these registration criteria. It is these registration criteria which concern the Opposition. The Opposition is concerned that the Bill requires, firstly, that at least 75 per cent of the activities of the applicants must be devoted to the construction or modification of vessels which are bountiable. That excludes ship repair activities which are neither construction nor modifications. The second requirement is that the applicant must, at all times, employ at least 40 persons in ship modifications or construction, compared to the present requirement of 20 under the existing regulations. Thirdly, applicants will have to submit a business plan whereas, at present, this is not necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The IAC is strongly opposed to these registration criteria. The amendment to be moved by Senator MacGibbon would delete the 75 per cent requirement. The reason the Government included this requirement is to stop the proliferation of bounty hunters. I accept that that is a reason for doing it, but these sorts of decisions are very rarely black and white but various shades of grey. In this case the balance, I believe, looking at all the favours, suggests that the 75 per cent rule should be removed. The 75 per cent has to be engaged in ship construction or modification. There are very great advantages in the same shipyard being also involved in ship repair. We are building very few ships in Australia, but if ship constructors are exposed to repairing foreign built ships which have new technologies and new design features, it will keep our shipbuilders and, of course, the work force involved up to date in new techniques. Without that, our ship construction industry will, I believe, lag behind international technology. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, when a firm builds ships for export, there is an increasing trend that the firm is also required to service the ships it has built. If the firm is limited to how much ship repair it can do, it cannot offer the sort of contract that people looking for export orders would require. The other problem is that, inevitably, shipbuilding is very variable in demand. What a firm could do, is employ its work force sometimes on ship repairs and sometimes on ship building. If it has no shipbuilding orders it can go flat out to get more ship repair orders, but this Bill would prevent that sort of flexible management. Probably firms would get around this problem by setting up a subsidy company within the main one to do ship construction, but that would be very clumsy and, I suspect, uneconomical. I suppose they would have to do that, if faced with this variable pattern, but it is a very untidy way, and for that reason a very uncompetitive way, in which to run a business. </PARA>
<PARA> We understand, from the remarks made by the Australian Democrats-in so far as they were comprehensible-that they will not be supporting this amendment to be moved by the Opposition and, therefore, the Government will have its way. The Opposition will be looking very carefully at how these registration criteria will work. We do not want to see efficient producers discouraged. Some of the criteria are entirely acceptable to us and very sensible, such as that the builders must be financially sound, they must have access to waterfront premises and they must employ one apprentice for every eight tradesmen. These criteria, I think, are very reasonable. If the registration is rejected or withdrawn the applicants have a right to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which will look at the case on its merits. That also is very reasonable. The registration is to last for a period of one year. Those criteria are all reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> Our two objections are, first of all, to the 75 per cent requirement for shipbuilding and ship construction, which we think will make for an inefficient industry. It is an undesirable requirement, although we can see the reasons for the Government's proposing it. But even more importantly-and this is not directly a part of this bounty Bill-in the shipbuilding and ship repair industry and right across the rest of our secondary industry we have to tackle our deplorable industrial relations and productivity problems. Without that we are doomed to future mediocrity. The Opposition supports the general thrust of this Bill. I and, I think, all of us hope that the Australian shipbuilding industry will survive in the short term and expand and prosper in the long term. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The package of Bills before us today relates to an extensive series of changes to various customs tariffs. The ones that I would like to turn my attention to relate to the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Amendment Bill 1989. Madam Acting Deputy President, as you will appreciate, this has a major import and bearing on the productivity of uranium in the Northern Territory. The duty, which has been imposed since 1980, is in recognition of the special costs incurred by the Commonwealth for environmental monitoring and research activity related to uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers Region of the Northern Territory. The increase which is now proposed to the rate of duty reflects the Government's position that the costs associated with protecting the environment from the potentially adverse effects of uranium mining should be borne, as far as practical, by the industry carrying out that mining activity and not by the ordinary taxpayer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to address a number of issues relating to this matter, particularly as it affects the operation of the office of the Supervising Scientist (OSS). Whilst it is the Government's intention to raise more funds to offset the costs of the Office of the Supervising Scientist, we need at all times to be sure that the operations of that very office are being carried out in an efficient, accountable manner that does not require an undue extra subsidy by the Government. Today in the Senate my colleague the shadow Minister for customs, Senator MacGibbon, has moved an amendment in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . but the Senate is of the opinion that the Government should be condemned for:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) imposing a discriminatory levy upon one operation alone at a time when Australia's uranium exporters are struggling to remain competitive in the international market and are already overburdened by excessive taxes and charges; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) its ideological approach to the development of Australia's uranium industry which has resulted in an economically absurd `three mine policy'. </PARA>
<PARA>Both tenets of that amendment moved by Senator MacGibbon have great value. They need to be addressed particularly by this Senate and in the broader context of the debate that, naturally, at all times goes on with regard to the expansion of uranium mining in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Many issues arise from the international marketplace. It is our responsibility to ensure that we are a proper partner in providing an environmentally safe nuclear fuel cycle. This Government is imposing excessive taxes and charges on that industry because it sees it as one in which there is an opportunity to seize and to grab easy, large dollops of money. The Labor Government is also constrained by the Labor Conference, which has imposed upon it the absurd three-mine policy, which does not allow for the expansion of that industry in a manner that would be controlled by environmental guidelines and by the marketplace itself. </PARA>
<PARA> When this Bill was originally introduced in the House of Representatives in early March-and it is interesting to note that it has taken some two months to surface in this chamber-the shadow Minister for science and energy, Peter McGauran, drew attention to a lot of the issues regarding the current state of the international marketing of uranium. At that time Mr McGauran drew particular attention to the fact that 5 per cent of the operating costs of Energy Resources of Australia Ltd (ERA), the operators of Ranger uranium mine, were now being allocated for this duty and how it was to be imposed for environmental monitoring and research activities related to the Alligator Rivers Region. I commend to the Senate Mr McGauran's speech on 4 April. He goes into great detail with regard to the marketing of uranium and how this duty is disproportionate in that the levy is imposed on one company alone. Mr McGauran stressed that the policy of the Government at the moment makes no good economic sense-it is a policy which expresses the interests of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) ahead of and above those of the nation as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The previous coalition Government imposed this levy in 1980 as part of the principal Act, which is now being amended, but I remind the Senate that the duty that was initially put in place stood at 11c a kilogram. It is now proposed that that be increased to a whopping $1.15 a kilogram. That is a tenfold increase since its introduction some nine years ago. By and large, the levy falls on the shoulders of one company-Energy Resources of Australia, the operators of the Ranger uranium mine. </PARA>
<PARA> It is often argued that the funding of OSS at its present exorbitant levels is vital and necessary to what is going on in the area. But I think we need to turn to and address the annual report to this Parliament of the Supervising Scientist. Throughout the report there are glowing accounts of the practices at Ranger, which are environmentally sound. Of course, no mention is made of the fact that Ranger itself is expending some $10m in this whole area of monitoring and the environment. Looking in particular at the report there is reference to the fact that, to date, there is only minimal environmental detriment. Let me draw from page 6 of the report, where it states:</PARA>
<PARA>Over the seven or eight years that the Ranger and Nabarlek projects have been operating in the Region, the work of the OSS, in co-operation with other Commonwealth and Northern Territory agencies, has been essential not only in understanding and ensuring protection of the environment, but also in giving credibility to the claims made by the mining companies and the regulatory authorities that the mining operations have resulted in minimal environmental detriment to date. </PARA>
<PARA>We find on page 8 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA>Overall, a high standard of environment protection, commensurate with the unique natural and cultural values of the Region, has been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that this has been achieved largely as a result of the practices of the Ranger mine and the Northern Territory Government in their approach to the peculiar problems of Kakadu. We find on page 60 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA> Ranger has fulfilled its regulatory requirements, under the terms of its authorisation, in respect of environmental protection during 1987-88. Review and assessment by OSS of monitoring reports and other information indicate that requirements to minimise the environmental impact of the mining operations are being met. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have said, Ranger itself has engaged in extensive environmental operations at costs that far exceed those of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. We need to look very carefully at the costs that arise and at the reasons why the OSS is carrying out so much of the research that goes on in particular areas. </PARA>
<PARA> This issue was raised in the House of Representatives in early March. It was probably not coincidental that at that time there was also a reporting of incidents that had arisen with regard to releases from the tailings at restricted zones at Ranger. I remind the Senate that on 8 March I gave in this place a notice of a motion, which says:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) condemns the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) for misleading the Senate in his answer to a put-up Question without Notice by Senator Collins on 3 March 1989 and his failure to present a comprehensive and adequate account to the Senate regarding recent alleged breaches of environmental guidelines at the Ranger Uranium Mine and notes that he failed to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) acknowledge the view expressed by the Office of the Supervising Scientist that the dumping of waste rock did not constitute `any immediate or even demonstrable risk to the environment',</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) acknowledge that uranium levels in the pond receiving run-off from the waste rock dump have actually fallen during the current wet season,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) acknowledge the steps taken by the Northern Territory Government to act promptly to ensure adherence to approved environmental guidelines, and</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) accurately advise the Senate of the date of the granting of original approvals covering the most recent discharge of water from RP4; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) calls on Senator Richardson to make a comprehensive statement to the Senate which can be debated fully and to refrain from making statements which are inflammatory and misleading and designed for no other purpose than to attempt to restore his shattered political credibility with the ill-informed but noisy elements of the environmental movement. </PARA>
<PARA>To date that motion has not been brought on in the Senate. Senator Richardson has not responded to any of the calls made in that notice of motion and has certainly not given this Senate the opportunity to debate the incidents that arose at that particular time. There always seems to be a coincidence between the incidents that happen at Ranger and the times at which the Government is proposing to address policy matters within the Labor Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that the remarks I am making are directly relevant in that we are looking at the Budget allocations or the raising of levy funds that provide for the conduct of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. The very conduct of that office was very much the matter of the notice of motion that I gave here in March. So there is a direct parallel and there are direct issues that relate both to this Bill and to the motion that I gave in March. The issues arising with regard to the Office of the Supervising Scientist are such that they require urgent and, always, comprehensive attention by this Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting that Ranger itself has undertaken a comprehensive study of all these particular areas and has released a report that it made available to Senator Richardson on the very matter of the operations between Ranger and the Office of the Supervising Scientist. The Ranger report alleged that the Office of the Supervising Scientist had spent about $40m but had failed to produce any standards, practices and procedures of value to environment protection at Ranger; that it was insufficient and duplicated the functions of other organisations; that it did not effectively carry out the work that it was required to do; that the average cost per employee in the Office of the Supervising Scientist was approximately 50 per cent higher than in the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, 20 per cent higher than the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's Natural Resources Division and 28 per cent higher than the Alligator Rivers Region Unit, the Northern Territory's uranium unit. The report also stated that in the 10 years from 1978 to 1988 the research work of the Office of the Supervising Scientist had produced no standards, practices or procedures that Ranger could use to protect the environment; that on average roughly $4m a year was being spent on research but almost nothing of any real practical value for protection of the environment from uranium mining had resulted; and that in 10 years the Office of the Supervising Scientist had grown into an organisation far from the original concept proposed by Commissioner Fox in the second report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry. Of course, we must be mindful of the fact that about 75 per cent of the funds required by the Office of the Supervising Scientist comes from ERA, Ranger's operators in this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA> On a number of occasions Senator Richardson has sought to discredit Ranger in order to influence the ALP's committee which is currently looking at the uranium policy of the Government. Senator Richardson supports the three-mine policy that is currently under way. We need to be aware, of course, that Ranger's operations have at all times been clean and straightforward. Senator Richardson has ignored the Northern Territory's strong record in administering procedures and safeguards as well as the evidence from the Office of the Supervising Scientist which supports Ranger. That was patently obvious from the last annual report of the Office of the Supervising Scientist which I quoted earlier. Ranger is practising wetlands filtration, which is far more efficient and environmentally safer than any pipeline release. The issues relating to that March incident of the RP4 ponds bring this out. </PARA>
<PARA> I take a few moments to look at the review of the Government's uranium policy that is currently under way. We are all aware that the Labor Party has instituted a uranium policy review which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has now announced will not report until 1991. This will put off any decisions with regard to the expansion of uranium mining in Australia until well after the next Federal election and will seriously affect our economic production as a country. It is obvious that the Labor Party is unable to decide, whether through its review committee or by action of government, where it really stands on this very important matter. There seems to be a number of conflicting views within the Labor Party as to where the three-mine policy or the whole uranium debate ought to go. We are well aware that Senator Collins has taken, to his credit, a very positive stance with regard to the liberalisation of the three-mine policy and has been very active in that area. The honourable member for the Northern Territory, Mr Snowdon, has not come as clean as Senator Collins as to where he stands on this particular issue. For example, in a recent radio interview, when he was asked about this particular area, he commented, `I have got a view, I am not going to tell you what that view is'. Of course, he has equivocated in relation to the review that is under way with regard to the three-mine policy, so we do not know exactly where he stands. In 1988, Senator Richardson stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I have considerable sympathy with those people who have been seeking a change, but while the arguments are there the numbers are not. </PARA>
<PARA>As usual, Senator Richardson seems to understand numbers very well but he is not prepared to get out and muster them with regard to liberalising the policies that are so necessary in uranium mining. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition in the Northern Territory Parliament, Mr Terry Smith, has come down with a very different view. He obviously now understands, as a result of a recent world fact finding trip looking at the nuclear fuel industry, that there must be some very important changes. Mr Smith's conclusion now is that nuclear power will become an integral and growing factor in the world's future energy needs and that the environmental consequences of non-nuclear energy alternatives are beginning to dawn even upon the troglodytes of the greenie industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Where are the Democrats? The troglodytes are not here to participate in this debate. Having listened to Senator Coulter earlier, it is no wonder. The Northern Territory Leader of the Opposition, Mr Smith, now supports the development of new uranium mines on the basis that there is a significant uncommitted demand for uranium and a lack of low cost uranium reserves. His conclusion that Australia, with the world's largest low cost reserves, could capture a significant proportion of the uncommitted demand is in agreement with the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy report on the nuclear fuel cycle industry. I commend that report to the Senate. The fact that the report now has the endorsement of the Labor Leader of the Opposition in the Northern Territory is, I believe, most important and significant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have reached a point where the uranium industry is now well accepted as being environmentally safe and environmentally clean. If Australia is to develop and benefit from the economic advantages, it is important that this industry not be constrained. The provisions of the legislation before us today impose, in a very discriminatory manner, additional taxes on the principal operator of a uranium mine in the Northern Territory. It is important that we should note that. I think it is also important that this Senate should very carefully address the issues that were properly raised in Senator MacGibbon's amendment. We are imposing a discriminatory level upon one operation alone at a time when Australia's uranium exporters are struggling to remain competitive in the international marketplace and are already overburdened by excessive taxes and charges. We should be challenging the Labor Party at all times to review thoroughly, properly and promptly the absurd three-mine policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in this debate on the Subsidy Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 mainly because of the disruption that this sudden removal of bounty paid to Australian manufacturers of certain products has caused. To be more precise, the Bill amends the Subsidy (Cultivation Machines and Equipment) Act 1986 and the Subsidy (Grain Harvesters and Equipment) Act 1985. The situation concerning cultivation machines is probably more important, though I will briefly comment on grain harvesters as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In his second reading speech Senator Button said:</PARA>
<PARA>As outlined by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the April economic statement the Government is determined to ensure that fiscal policy is kept tight in order to maintain downward pressure on Australia's trade deficit. </PARA>
<PARA>After telling us that savings would be used to offset the cost of measures announced in the economic statement, which would assist families and pensioners, Senator Button went on to tell us:</PARA>
<PARA>In view of these strong budgetary pressures, the Government considers it would be inappropriate to exempt outlays associated with industry assistance and development. In the Government's view the most appropriate means of effecting the necessary savings in this area is to terminate the grain harvesting and cultivation equipment assistance schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>As I see it, the Government has once again seen fit to harvest an efficient rural industry to fulfil its ever-growing social welfare account, which is out of control. The Minister made a contradictory point when he said that the Government is determined to maintain downward pressure on Australia's trade deficit. I was under the impression that the best way to take off that pressure is to encourage Australians to buy Australian products and so lessen demand-in this case, demand for imported machines. </PARA>
<PARA> What better way is there to lessen that demand than to encourage Australian manufacturers of machinery which could be competitive in price, which is suited to Australian conditions and which is accepted already by Australian primary producers? I would like Senator Button to tell us exactly what he means and which way he wants to go. Does he want downward pressure on imports or does he want upward pressure by causing Australian products to rise in price? Surely, if the price of Australian machinery is kept down, we would be able to compete against overseas products. This would help the balance of payments and employment situations and the benefit would flow on to the factory workers and the suppliers of materials and components. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will result in savings to the Government of $19m in 1989-90 and $10.4m in 1990-91. In my opinion, the total savings do not justify the disruption to the supply of farm machinery and the employment losses in the manufacturing and distribution fields. In these days of micro-economic reform, I do not believe that bounties should continue forever. The cessation of these bounties was due by 30 June 1990. In view of the expected amount of savings and the disruption that this legislation will cause, I cannot see why the phase-out of bounties should not have been left to run its course. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there is a difference between a bounty for harvesters and a bounty for cultivation gear. These two products differ. The harvester bounty came into being because of a government bungle. There used to be no tariff on imported machines of a certain size-to be more exact, harvesting machines with a threshing drum greater than 48 inches. In the early 1980s Massey-Ferguson (Aust.) Ltd experimented with a power take-off harvester or header with a drum size greater than 48 inches-namely, about 60 inches. The company went to the Tariff Board and applied for a tariff. To my dismay and that of other Australian farmers, it was successful. Even though it had a machine that was suitable, Massey-Ferguson could not have hoped to supply all Australia's wheat farmers with harvesting machinery. The Government at the time should have looked at a bounty rather than a tariff. That tariff added up to $30,000 to the price of an imported good-sized rotary or conventional machine with a drum size of 60 inches. After lobbying took place between 1983 and 1985, that tariff was removed and a bounty was put on. This is what should have been done in the first place. When the tariff was removed, not all importers returned to the consumer the gain that was made. I welcome the end of the bounty on harvesting machines. But as I have said, the tariff should never have been imposed in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to the amendment to the Subsidy (Cultivation Machines and Equipment) Act. A vastly different set of circumstances apply in respect of this legislation. Let me refer to the question of John Shearer (Holdings) Ltd in Adelaide, a matter which has been in the news in the last few weeks. As I have always said, and I know from first hand experience, Australian harvesting machines are far behind those manufactured in other parts of the world. But, on the other side of the coin, I believe that Australian cultivating machines far exceed any other product in the world. This is especially true when working soils in the medium to low rainfall wheatbelts around Australia. We should take into consideration that a lot of those lands have been cleared for upwards of 150 years, yet are still new in comparison to many parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> We had the case of John Shearer Ltd, a manufacturer of what I consider to be the best tillage machinery in the world, and certainly the best available in Australia. It outshines any imported gear. The Government cut the bounty on cultivation gear right in midstream. The bounty was to continue to 31 December 1990. The Government then announced in its mini-statement that this bounty would finish on 12 April 1989. We then had the Shearer debacle over the last couple of months. I suppose in one respect there has been good come out of legislation by press release in that it allows one to have a good look at it before it ever comes to this place. Honourable senators should know that rural producers did not operate in a good climate from the year 1985 through to 1988. This climate was not caused by any lack of rainfall but rather the economic climate around the world. Farm commodities were at a low ebb. We then had a turnaround at the beginning of 1988 which was mainly caused by the great improvement in the price of wheat and wool. </PARA>
<PARA> In those years to which I have referred, farmers, mainly wheat farmers, did not reinvest in new machinery. Hence, second-hand machinery was sought after and this lifted its price. In 1989 with a good crop behind us, a good wool crop as well, expectations of better prices for wheat in 1990-hopefully at around $A225 or better-and the encouragement from this Government, of which you, Madam Acting Deputy President, are a part, to grow more wheat in the season to come there was an upturn in demand for new tillage gear to sow the crop that is now going in despite the excessive wet weather around Australia. These manufacturers-this includes Shearers-had through their dealers full order books with contracts at a fixed price from the manufacturer to the dealer and a fixed price under contract between the dealer and the farmer. In most cases the dealer had taken machines off the farmers as trade-ins and again in most cases the dealer had sold them to someone else. In the middle of this-we should bear in mind that 12 April is the time the Australian wheat crop is being planned and farmers, in order to start sowing the crop, are waiting for the rains-the Government dropped a bombshell by removing the bounty. As I have already said, farmers had held off buying new plant for the past three years and the Government came in and removed this bounty at what one would call, in secondary industry, the re-tooling stage. It was very convenient for the Government to bring in extra income to itself. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of Shearers and in the case of other manufacturers, they had to go back to the dealers and ask them for more money. The dealers in turn had to go back to the farmers and ask them for more money. I would say that the contracts were at a fixed price between the farmer and the dealer but not necessarily at a fixed price between the dealer and the manufacturer. Of course, a farmer, or a dealer for that matter, to add to the double confusion could have walked away from the whole contract. But with the wet season coming on the farmer, especially the farmer who had had his trade-in taken away and sold, would have to put up the money and shut up, to put it in plain terms. That changed after the Shearer fiasco. There was a case with enough problems already. The Amalgamated Metal Workers Union decided to have a strike-I am not exactly sure of the length of it-over nothing but compulsory unionism. The company then was returned to past practice; that is, compulsory unionism. Even the Adelaide Advertiser on 21 May 1989 made a mockery in its editorial of the plight of Shearer and its customers. I have a copy of that editorial and I will quote a section of it:</PARA>
<PARA> The Industrial Relations Commission yesterday ordered the company to resume past practices while the issue was negotiated-a basic move in any dispute. Whatever may be felt about closed shops, Mr White-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Chairman and Director, I believe, of Shearers-</PARA>
<PARA>should recognise that the unions behaved properly in resuming work. </PARA>
<PARA>What this editorial did not point out was that the unions misbehaved by being on strike for two weeks. The editorial continued:</PARA>
<PARA> As for the bounty, Shearer has known for four years that it would be removed.</PARA>
<PARA>This was because the Act came down in 1986 and contained a sunset clause. The company knew but it worked and budgeted for it to come off in June 1990 not 12 April 1989. Now, after negotiations, the bounty will remain until 10 June 1989. I believe that the Adelaide Advertiser gave a very cynical view of the whole show. As I mentioned briefly, a fall out occurred. It concerned Shearer. Things were brought to a head. Under this amended Bill the bounty, as I understand it, is to continue to 10 June 1989. Manufacturers will have to apply for their bounty by 10 July of the same year, that is this year. Three hundred jobs have been saved and Shearers is without compulsory unionism, at least for the present. </PARA>
<PARA> That means that the bounty on cultivation gear would have had only 12 months to go after 15 June. I consider that the Government, for what it will save, could have let it go to the dates set by the sunset clause. The Government could have let that subsidy continue until 30 June 1990 and would have recouped the cost many times over in the increased production which would have been gained by the new machinery which would have been available and which was so badly needed on the farms. Honourable senators should bear in mind what I have already told them: very little retooling and replacement of machinery by investment in new machinery was done in those three years. Once again the Government has regard to all except primary industry when it comes to cost cutting measures and it will probably never change. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I reiterate my disappointment at the decision of this Government to remove this bounty at such short notice when in fact the legislation was already due to run out on 30 June 1990. In such times of economic restraint I believe that the load should be shared around to all the sectors of the voting public and not only to the ones of our persuasion or to the ones with little voting strength, that is, the rural areas. This is the section of the population, as I have said many times in this chamber, that accounts for 85 per cent of Australia's export income. That figure will be rising with a downward pressure on manufacturing exports. This section of the population has only 10 per cent of Australia's voting strength. </PARA>
<PARA> Bearing in mind Australia's total export and import deficit, I thought that the Government would have kept any incentive for Australian manufacturers in place, for the time being anyhow. What are the alternatives? John Shearer is an Australian manufacturer making machinery that is suited to Australia, not a multinational manufacturing in Australia. We have had many multinationals manufacturing in Australia, such as New Holland, Massey Ferguson and a few others. Australia is only a minor cog in the whole system for them. When the multinationals withdrew from manufacturing in Australia and exported their farm machinery to this country from overseas, this was of no great concern to us, especially in relation to cultivation gear, because, as I have always maintained, their gear does not stand up to Australian conditions. John Shearer is probably the only real Australian manufacturer left, but the accent should be on keeping such companies manufacturing in Australia. I believe that there is a vast difference between how an Australian manufacturer should be treated and how a multinational manufacturer in Australia should be treated. The only alternative for Australian manufacturers-I have used John Shearer as an example-is to go overseas, manufacture under contract and export back into Australia. They would be away from compulsory trade unionism and disruptions. They would be taking detailed drawings and specialised jigs to manufacture in various parts of the world under contract and would then export back at a lower cost than they pay in Australia at present. No special personnel would be taken overseas, so the result would be a lessening of the demand for personnel of specialised machinery in Australia. Hence, their future is not so great. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not delay the Senate any longer. I will be supporting the amendments moved during the second reading debate by my colleague, Senator MacGibbon, and will support any amendments moved by the Opposition in the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon I wish to speak on the sixth Bill in the parcel of Bills that are being debated today, the Bounty (Ships) Bill 1989. As my colleague Senator Hamer said earlier, it is not the intention of the Opposition to oppose these Bills, but we do intend to move an amendment in the committee stage which will remove the requirement that 75 per cent of a shipbuilder's business be devoted to activities which are subject to a bounty. As Senator Hamer quite rightly said, this restrictive requirement tends to lessen the likelihood of shipbuilding companies keeping up to date with modern technology and using new techniques that are available overseas, because fewer shipyards will be devoted to repairing ships in our country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a matter of some disappointment that as an island continent Australia does not have a more vibrant shipbuilding industry. Indeed, given the restrictive work practices which have flourished in this country for so long under the present Government, it is a great credit to those in the shipbuilding industry that they have survived at all under the restrictions that abound in the climate in this country at the moment, with massive wage increases, interest rates and all such things that work against business. Under the existing Bounty (Ships) Act 1980, a bounty is payable on the construction and/or modification in Australia of vessels which exceed 150 gross construction tonnes and commercial vessels exceeding 150 gross construction tonnes or 21 metres in length. The bounty is based upon the cost of construction or modification of a vessel. For tugs, bulk carriers, rig servicing and fishing vessels which fit the pre-requisites commenced after 1 January 1988, the bounty is 20 per cent of the cost of construction. For other vessels the bounty is 15 per cent. To be eligible for a bounty in relation to modifications, the cost of these modifications must exceed $400,000. </PARA>
<PARA> In July 1986 a limit of $144m was placed on the total funds available under the Bounty (Ships) Act 1980 in respect of vessels completed before 1 July 1989. However, at the end of March 1988 all of that $144m had either been distributed or reserved. The new scheme will begin on 1 July 1989 and will phase out the bounty over six years so that by July 1995 the industry will operate without any bounty assistance at all. It is estimated that over the six-year period the scheme will cost $145m with an initial outlay of some $24m in 1989-90, rising to $33m in 1990-91. To be eligible for the bounty, shipbuilders must meet what are known as orderly development provisions, along with registration criteria. It emerges that 45 shipbuilders have received registration during the period from 1984 to April 1989 while, disappointingly, only 13 firms have managed to maintain their registration during that period. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to phase out the bounty over the next six years is something which the Opposition is prepared to live with, as Senator Hamer said earlier, but we certainly see it as an acceptable compromise between those people who wanted the bounty to remain at its present rate and those who wanted it scrapped altogether. However, it provides a clear path for the future for those in the community who wish to remain involved. As I said earlier, they are becoming fewer and fewer because of the restrictive provisions that have been forced upon them by this Federal Government with work practices, high interest rates and all the other things that make it so difficult for them to make their businesses profitable. </PARA>
<PARA> I spoke earlier of the success which has been achieved by a number of operators in the industry despite the difficult economic circumstances under which they must presently operate. I want to refer particularly to two highly successful operations in my own State of Tasmania. I believe that they deserve the commendation of the Senate. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is right. As honourable senators would realise, because of Tasmania's dependence on the sea, it has always made quite a significant contribution to Australia's shipbuilding industry. During the early whaling years Tasmania was noted for its wonderful wooden construction of vessels that plied around the world in pursuit of whales. In fact, I learnt when I was in Japan some five years ago that one of the first contacts the people there made with Europeans involved a whaling ship that was wrecked on the shores on Mabiro Beach in Japan in 1826. That ship was built and registered in Hobart, so our shipbuilding industry goes back many years. Former Senator Ken Wriedt, now a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly, tried to get dry dock facilities in Hobart for Russian vessels some 10 years ago. I know of efforts being made at present by Mr Gunther Shultz, of whom the Minister opposite would have heard. He was the Polar part of P &amp; O Polar. He is currently trying to get the Government to support Hobart becoming a stopping off point for Russian research vessels as a repair providoring port for vessels that are plying to Antarctica. I believe that the port of Hobart is certainly well able to cater, as a supply depot at least, for Antarctic vessels from all over the world. It seems unusual that the Government can support the Chinese working out of Hobart whilst the Russian ships do not seem to be receiving the support they should. My own State Premier has had varying views on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said earlier, we have skilled craftsmen and the facilities in Hobart to produce world class vessels. Tasmanians have made many famous yachts and fishing vessels. At present, on the banks of Prince of Wales Bay at Glenorchy, International Catamarans is a company which is flourishing. It is run by a friend of mine, Bob Clifford, who came about this enterprise after one of the most unfortunate incidents that ever happened to my State. That was when the Tasman Bridge collapsed when the Lake Illawarra collided with it on a foggy night and caused a lot of disruption to the eastern shore of Hobart. He, along with quite a few others, used the unfortunate circumstances as an opportunity to ply ferries between Rosny Park and Hobart. In the early days he was responsible for the construction of a couple of well known vessels-the James McCabe and the Matthew Brady. They are all named after bushrangers; I can assure honourable senators that Bob Clifford is no bushranger. He adapted the technique of using catamarans as ferries. The first catamaran he used to cross the river was the Lawrence Cavanagh. That was the beginning of his success. He could see that eventually the ferry services would melt away with the relocation of the Tasman Bridge. </PARA>
<PARA> This company has gone from strength to strength. At present it is undertaking the construction of three wave-piercing 71-metre catamarans, the first two of which have been sold to British Sea-Link for service in Europe. The first sea trials of those vessels are expected in March. The third vessel, which is being promoted by Tasmanian Ferry Services, will be used to ply between George Town in Tasmania and Port Welshpool in Victoria. It will enable a fast daylight service to transport 350 passengers and some 80 cars across Bass Strait. I believe that this particular service will certainly have a great effect on Tasmania. Unfortunately, even though the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the early days was averse to having this particular company exempted from the payment of diesel fuel excise, which would have saved the travelling public some $26 on the trip, that has not come to pass. Paying passengers going both ways will now have to pay an extra $26 because of this unwarranted diesel fuel excise. Given the fact that this new service will be paying all wharfage fees and other docking fees at both ends, I cannot see why it should be paying diesel fuel tax when it does not use any roads at all. It is very unlikely that any of the funds it pays in the form of this diesel fuel excise will find their way to our crumbling road network around Australia. The efforts of International Catamarans will generate 760 new jobs in Tasmania and inject an estimated $35m into the Tasmanian economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few brief remarks regarding the situation in China and, in particular, respond to some remarks made by Senator Harradine today during the debate on the motion moved by Senator Robert Ray, on behalf of Senator Gareth Evans. I did not have a chance to speak in that debate because of time constraints due to the amount of government business to be dealt with. Senator Harradine, although he made a personal explanation at the end of the debate, I think left an unfortunate impression that the Australian Government has been soft in its attitude to the Chinese Government in recent years over the issue of human rights because of our interest in trade matters. I completely refute that. I believe that if one studies the records of any international forum, one will find that over the last six years this Government has been a supporter of human rights wherever the issue has arisen, without fear or favour. I believe our record is one that is recognised by other democratic countries as being exemplary. I believe it is unfortunate that Senator Harradine left that impression. Certainly, in his personal explanation, he said he was not implying that individual members of parliament were not concerned about human rights in China, but he did leave the impression that the Government was soft on the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I mention to the Senate that in April 1987 I was invited to visit China as a guest of the international liaison section of the Chinese Communist Party. It has an extensive program under which people from Australia and other countries are invited to visit China. Senator Teague-I think 1988 was the most recent occasion-represented the Liberal Party under a similar program. So the program does not just invite people from particular parties. The Chinese Communist Party uses it to invite a whole range of people. During my two-week visit, I had discussions with senior members of the international liaison section of the Communist Party of China over six hours spread across two days. The major points that I raised, in accordance with Australian Labor Party policy-I was not then a senator but I was, and still am, a member of the international committee of the Labor Party-were the issue of human rights, the issue of democracy, and the extent to which China intended to develop its system to take account of the right of people to dissent, to form free trade unions-and, if they so choose, to strike, to withdraw their labour-and the right of people to have access to a free press. </PARA>
<PARA> I had meetings with senior editors of the People's Daily, the official newspaper, and again raised those issues. I do not believe that I did anything remarkable, compared to what many other Australians have done, but I think it is wrong to suggest that the Australian Labor Party Government has been soft on China. Certainly, members of the Chinese Communist Party at times felt uncomfortable, when I had discussions with them, about the issues we were raising. I think it is a pity that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) could not be here-at the moment he is overseas on Government business-to give a detailed response to what Senator Harradine said. I am sure that when he returns that detailed response will be given and it will prove conclusively that Australia's role in supporting human rights in China is one of which the Australian community can be proud. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by referring to activities in Australia at the moment. I gave notice of a motion yesterday in which I reminded the Senate that at 1 o'clock tomorrow in the Great Hall of Parliament House a memorial service will be held for the people killed in China in the last few days. I hope that as it will occur during the lunch break, as many senators as possible will attend that function. Protest rallies will be held in various places in Australia tomorrow. I am sure that many more will be held in coming weeks. I certainly look forward, in view of Senator Harradine's great interest in these issues, to seeing whether he attends those rallies. I believe that it is one way in which we can demonstrate our support to the Chinese people. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday I raised an issue about Radio Australia. I requested the Managing Director of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to permit Radio Australia to extend its Chinese language broadcasts to China so that there is more opportunity for Chinese people to hear on the short wave band what is actually happening in their own country, having regard to the fact that the official press is not reporting those events. Above all, it would show the Chinese people that there is strong support from people elsewhere in the world for their struggle for democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another way in which we can show our support. Last night on television an American commentator said that many Chinese students living in America at the moment are sending random fax and telex messages to China, explaining what is going on in the Western press, and giving expressions of support. I am making arrangements to obtain a copy of the fax and telex directory for the People's Republic of China and will arrange its distribution amongst protest groups in Australia-and among members of the Senate, if they wish to get a copy-and will encourage people to make their contribution to the support of democracy in China by also sending faxes and telexes to random numbers in China so that people in China are aware that they are not alone in their struggle. </PARA>
<PARA> Next week it will probably be necessary for us again to place on the agenda another notice of motion. I note the remarks of Senator Hill earlier today regarding the need for there to be a more extensive debate. I think that is necessary and I hope it can be arranged without affecting the Government's legislative program. I agree with Senator Hill; these are momentous events in China and they should be debated in the Parliament in a bipartisan way. I do not think it does our cause for the support of democracy any good to start criticising each other and what our role has been, or whether we have been strong enough in the past. I believe that the record of the Parliament and the Australian Government over the last few years on human rights in China has been good and does not need to be criticised. I think we need to put on the record continually our concern about what is happening. </PARA>

I do not think we can afford to be self-serving and try to pick and choose where we think human rights abuses are less abusive because they may occur under regimes of the Right or the Left.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think this Parliament and the Australian Government have been quite correct in taking up the question of human rights under various regimes, irrespective of where they occur. I, like many other senators, have a particular interest in some countries. I am interested in human rights violations in Burma. Four thousand students and civilians were killed last year in Burma by the army when they demonstrated for democracy. They did not get coverage in the West because of the lack of access by television and the news media to Burma. But those events were just as horrific as what has been occurring in China in the last week. I do not criticise other members of the Senate by saying they are soft on human rights in Burma because they have not been there or they have not seen the information. I was fortunate to visit Burma earlier this year for a week and met students who had been tortured or beaten up. I met people who had been arrested and detained for years without trial. I deplore that. I do not criticise other members of the Senate or the Australian Government for being supposedly less active in Burma, because there is a lack of information. Before people say we are selective or give more emphasis to one country than another, they should realise that on many occasions it is a matter of available information. We have quite rightly taken up the matter of South Africa, about which Senator MacGibbon interjected. South Africa is a country that hangs more people per year than practically any other country. Most of the people it hangs, if not all of them, are black. </PARA>

When I was in China in 1987 I raised with Chinese authorities the system during 1985-86, when it is estimated that maybe 20,000, 30,000 or 40,000 people had been, in my view, summarily executed for supposed criminal activities. That is something that I find quite abhorrent, just as I find it abhorrent that in the mid-1980s in Indonesia similar activities were carried out by the Government to get rid of so-called criminal elements. The point I am making is that one cannot be selective; one should not make a judgment that one country is worse than another on human rights abuses. We must be active in promoting human rights wherever abuses occur, without fear or favour. I believe that this Government and this Parliament have been as effective on these matters as any in the world in acting without fear or favour-at times to our cost and to the irritation of other countries, including China.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I have today lodged the attached Question on Notice seeking information about the living conditions of Aboriginal people at Brunette Downs. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Anthony Hoy, who produced several recent articles for The Australian, might have done well to check the facts before going into print. </PARA>
<PARA> If, as I suspect will be the case, the Minister's reply to my question reveals that the situation at Brunette Downs differs from that represented in your columns, one would have to ask why both Mr Hoy and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs omitted to mention several significant aspects of the story. </PARA>
<PARA> In the interests of balanced media presentation, I suggest you take some interest in securing the information which the Minister's reply to my question may be expected to provide. </PARA>
<PARA>Subsequently, on 23 May 1989, I tabled in the Senate a document which set out the negotiations between the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association and the Commonwealth Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs during the period 1984-89. There has been a further response to this matter by the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short statement entitled `Brunette Downs-The Facts'. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>BRUNETTE DOWNS-THE FACTS</PARA>
<PARA>What the Government claims</PARA>
<PARA> On 19 May 1989, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, wrote to The Australian to congratulate the paper on its front-page story about living conditions of Aboriginal people at the Northern Territory cattle station known as Brunette Downs. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> ``The story focused on the living conditions of the Brunette Downs' Aboriginal stockmen and their families. The shocking conditions they endured are directly related to the fact that they have no title to the area of land on which they live. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a problem which unfortunately is not confined to the Aboriginal people living on Brunette Downs. There are other Aboriginal communities who, because their traditional living areas happen to be part of pastoral leases, have no title or security to their land. </PARA>
<PARA> In most cases this means the Government cannot do anything about proper housing or infrastructure requirements.''</PARA>
<PARA>The facts</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> These assertions, and the matters represented in The Australian as the factual basis for Mr Hand's implied criticism of Brunette Downs, require closer examination. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts show that:</PARA>
<PARA> the Aboriginal people at Brunette Downs have had title to land there for several years;</PARA>
<PARA> the site of that land was chosen by the people and title transferred to them at no cost;</PARA>
<PARA> the people later decided they wanted a different site. The company has agreed in principle to a second excision. Title will pass as soon as Mr Hand honours the Government's promise to exclude stock routes/reserves from land claim. </PARA>
<PARA>What The Australian says</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> On 5 and 16 May 1989, The Australian gave prominent coverage to a ``photographic essay'' entitled Brunette Downs: a showpiece property for whites, a squalid camp for Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA> The article drew a sharp distinction between the living conditions for station owners and Aboriginal families nearby. It implies that the pastoral company is content with the present situation and has done nothing to improve matters. </PARA>
<PARA> It is stated that the Human Rights Commission has investigated the whole matter. Yet the Commission established that the complaint submitted on behalf of the community by the Northern Land Council did not warrant investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> The article conveniently neglects to mention, until just near the end, that, at the instigation of the company, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs has agreed to provide temporary housing improvements at the existing camp site. </PARA>
<PARA> There is not one word in the article explaining that, if the Federal Minister had delivered his Government's promises on stock routes/reserves, the company would by now have signed a new second lease with the community where they would be able to make any accommodation arrangements which suited them. </PARA>
<PARA>History of the negotiations</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>In 1980, Brunette Downs management and the Aboriginal Community agreed on an area of 4104ha south of the Tablelands Highway and north of Barkly Stock Route (the ``Corella Creek'' site) as suitable for excision from Brunette Downs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Aboriginal community leader, Mr Jack Cotton, signed an acceptance note on 5 October 1980. (Document A). </PARA>
<PARA> A sub-lease was drawn up and signed in September 1982. Again, Mr Cotton signed on behalf of the Jarnba-Gadarlangi Aboriginal Corporation. (Document C). </PARA>
<PARA> Between 1982 and 1987, it became clear that the community members had changed their minds. On 24 November 1987, the Northern Territory Department of Lands and Housing informed the leaseholders that ``the people do not wish to live at Corella Creek on the eastern side of the Tablelands Highway''. The letter also said ``that the Aboriginal community wishes to pursue an interest in an excision at the Two Mile Waterhole on Brunette Creek.'' (Document D). </PARA>
<PARA> The leaseholders replied on 27 May 1987 indicating that they would offer an alternative site. (Document E). The letter said the Company would ``seriously consider the excision of an area, for living site . . . adjacent to the Two Mile Waterhole of one square kilometre . . .'' There were a number of conditions attached to this offer. The most important was that the Federal Government should comply with its earlier undertaking to protect stock routes and reserves from claim as Aboriginal land. Such a requirement was quite reasonable, since the Government had publicly promised to pass this legislation. The former Minister had kept his word but the present Minister decided not to proclaim the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then, however, it would seem that the community have changed their minds again. Now it is said on their behalf that they wish to stay at the present site, which is within 500m of the Brunette Downs homestead. However, no official indication of this further change in preference has been given to the leaseholders. </PARA>
<PARA> Although this proposal has always been unacceptable to the leaseholders, they remain concerned to improve the living conditions of the Aboriginal community-now camping near the homestead. A meeting was held in Darwin on 16 November 1988 involving all parties. This meeting was called by the leaseholders themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> A later consequence of this meeting was that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs eventually accepted the company's proposal and agreed to fund certain improvements at the homestead site. The work included 8 new housing units, even though the community will have to move from there when permanent arrangements are agreed on. That work is now in progress and that fact would have been known to the Minister when he wrote to The Australian on 19 May 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>Alleged Human Rights Commission ``investigation''</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Australian article of 5 May stated that the Aboriginal settlement at Brunette Downs was ``the embarrassing subject of a Human Rights Commission investigation into living conditions''. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that, in October last year, the Northern Land Council Chairman said that the Human Rights Commission ``is to be asked to act on a dispute in which a Pastoral Company is asking the Northern Territory Aboriginal community to shift off their traditional home''. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not known whether the NLC or the community did make a complaint to the Commission. But, if a complaint was made, it was never taken to investigation or hearing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is by no means clear whether the NLC has any power or responsibility under the Act establishing it, to make any complaint or otherwise act for this community. </PARA>
<PARA> It is, however, quite clear that the Human Rights Commission took no investigative action in this case. There is no doubt that the Commission has power to investigate matters which may involve ``unlawful'' acts as defined in the statute. The fact that they did not act shows that there was not even a prima facie case of breach of human rights involved in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA>Breach of faith by Commonwealth Minister</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The situation at Brunette Downs would have long since been resolved if the Commonwealth Minister had honoured the understanding of his predecessor and amended the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act so that stock routes and reserves were excluded from claim. In return, the cattlemen had agreed to hasten negotiation of excisions for Aboriginal living areas from their leaseholdings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's failure to proclaim the legislation it promised meant that the pastoral leaseholders could not continue negotiations. The Commonwealth Government must accept full responsibility for this delay. It could advance matters immediately by proclaiming the legislation without further prevarication. </PARA>
<PARA>The Evidence</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Copies of the following documents are tabled showing the facts of this matter:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I return briefly to the theme of banking which, as I am sure honourable senators are aware, I have been exploring for weeks. Since I first raised the question of allegations of banking malpractice in November 1988, quite obviously the profile of the banking issue generally in the community has increased quite dramatically. The focus recently, of course, has been on questions of bank charges-specifically, bank interest charges. The question of charges generally has captured the interest of the public, as have the extraordinary profits-I think the banks referred to them as super profits-announced by all major banks in Australia in recent times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On previous occasions, I have tabled 39 affidavits relating to allegations of serious banking malpractice. Indeed, I proposed to the Senate that the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs address these serious allegations. I have undertaken on behalf of constituents to table, for the consideration of honourable senators, further examples of these allegations of malpractice. I seek leave to table two further affidavits today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I have circulated copies of those two affidavits to the Minister who was previously at the table and to the shadow Minister on duty. They refer to the cases-I will cite them now, but not in detail-of Michael Patek, who has a dispute with the Westpac Banking Corporation, and Kenneth Whitbread, who has a dispute with the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. I will not take up the time of the Senate by elaborating the details of these cases, but I have spent some considerable time examining them. They are of a nature that I believe warrant the attention of those senators who are pursuing with some interest this growing issue of banking and, specifically, allegations of malpractice and corruption.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to one further matter which touches on the issue of bank charges and the attitude of banks to those charges. I have received a letter from a Mr D. G. Quinton who is a public accountant and who, like many of us, has a bank mortgage-in his case with the Royal Bank-and who sought an explanation of some of the charges which were being made on his account. He was either unable to follow the explanation or not satisfied by it and he pursued the matter; in fact, he has been doing so over some considerable period. He is obviously a very diligent and fastidious person who keeps very close records, is persistent and does not give in. He was dissatisfied with the responses from the Royal Bank. He approached the Australian Bankers Association concerning this dissatisfaction. He took issue with a press release which it had put out on 3 July 1988. I quote from that press release of the Australian Bankers Association:</PARA>
<PARA>Banks will undertake to provide the above information in such a way as to enable any customer who so wishes to calculate independently charges made by the bank and to verify their accuracy. Details of methodology employed will be available on request. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Quinton took that assurance from the Australian Bankers Association on its merits. He sought an explanation for some of the charges. As I say, he was dissatisfied with, or unable completely to comprehend, the explanations that were given to him. However, more recently, in following up these matters, he has received a reply from the Royal Bank which, among other things says:</PARA>
<PARA>Please note that further correspondence, unless it is to do with refinancing, will be directed to our solicitors for reply. The costs of their attending to that work will be debited to your loan account without further notice to you. </PARA>
<PARA>So this bank has taken the attitude that if one is not satisfied with its answers, one cannot comprehend its answers, or one believes they are inadequate, once it has offered what it considers to be satisfactory explanations, any queries thereafter will be referred to its solicitors and one will be required to cover the costs thereof. Those costs, without further notice, will be debited automatically to one's bank account. That strikes me as a very potent way of truncating the process of open inquiry which had been assured by the Bankers Association in its press release of 3 July 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Quinton, being, as I say, persistent, took the matter up quite recently with the Australian Bankers Association. On 28 April this year he wrote seeking its intervention. He received the following reply. This is the entire text of the letter:</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to your letter of 28th April 1989 and advise that this Association is not a governing body for the member banks and it is not within our charter to become involved in individual bank-customer disputes. </PARA>
<PARA>That is probably a fairly reasonable position for the Australian Bankers Association to take, but it contradicts its press release of 3 July 1988 and it certainly does not resolve the sorts of difficulties in which Mr Quinton and others find themselves. There has been inadequate explanation of bank charges, and they face what could be substantial legal expenses incurred by banks to respond to requests for explanation. This attitude stands in marked contrast to that which has been espoused by the Australian Bankers Association in the recent suggestions that it will voluntarily set up an ombudsman process. The Australian Bankers Association, as you know, Madam Acting Deputy President, has undertaken to sponsor the process of a bank ombudsman. I think that is quite a positive first step, provided that we can assume the process encompasses a little more than banks looking at banks. We hope that the Australian public will get more satisfaction from this process than they received, for instance, from the process of police looking at police over the last decade or so. </PARA>
<PARA> I cite the Quinton case simply to illustrate what I have attempted to illustrate previously, and to demonstrate to the Senate that the ethos of banking and the attitude of banks stand in contradiction to their fundamental fiduciary relationship to the client which requires that they consider the interests of their client as being equal to their own interests. The Australian community has every reason to be dissatisfied with the posture of banks in the Australian community today. On future occasions I will continue to bring before the Senate serious matters in relation to banking. </PARA>
<PARA> This morning I had a protracted discussion in my office with a gentleman who is making most extraordinary allegations about the way in which he has been treated by banks in the last two weeks. I am investigating those matters further. Last Saturday I had several hours of discussion with a gentleman who, once again, has given me examples of very serious difficulties with banks which he believes have been inadequately investigated by the Australian Federal Police, the Victorian fraud squad and the Trade Practices Commission. I will pursue that issue further. If I believe it is responsible to do so, I will bring it to the attention of the Senate at a later time. However, on this occasion I seek leave to table Mr Quinton's letters and the correspondence he has had with the Royal Bank and the Australian Bankers Association. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the past two years I have been helping a constituent to investigate the use of epidural injections for the treatment of lower back pain and other pain resulting from injuries such as whiplash injuries sustained in motor vehicle accidents. This research has revealed what I regard as a totally scandalous situation in my home State of Western Australia and I suspect that a similar situation may also exist in other States. My basic concern is that doctors in Western Australia-mainly anaesthetists who specialise in pain relief-are routinely giving a dangerous and sometimes damaging form of treatment to a very large number of people. Many individuals are experiencing severe adverse reactions to this treatment. Honourable senators may be surprised to know that when a patient experiences a serious adverse reaction to a drug or a form of therapy, it is not mandatory for a doctor to make a report to the adverse drug reaction committee. Forms are available to doctors to make such a report, but they are not obliged to use them. I understand that in Britain and the United States the reporting of adverse reactions to drugs and therapies is mandatory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The particular form of treatment that I am concerned about is the epidural administration of the drug methylprednisolone acetate. It is a form of cortisone. The trade name under which it is commonly marketed in Australia is Depo-Medrol. This drug is intended for use in the treatment of inflamed and painful joints. A typical injury for which it is suitable is an injury to the knee joint. As far as I am aware, the drug is efficacious in this particular application. I have no reports of problems with it in that respect, although I understand that the drug has been banned from use with horses. Depo-Medrol is not intended for use in the joints of the spinal column. The notes supplied by the manufacturer specifically warn against its use in the joints of the spine. Under the heading `adverse reactions' there is reference to reports of developments of a condition known as arachnoiditis if the drug is administered in the spinal column. </PARA>
<PARA> Attempts were made, beginning in about 1960, to treat both disc diseases and multiple sclerosis by intrathecal injections of Depo-Medrol-that is, injections into the fluid of the membrane of the spine. There were some initial promising reports as a result of clinical trials, but these were rapidly followed by a mass of contradictory results and warnings of many serious complications, such as the development of sterile meningitis, arachnoiditis or pachymeningitis. By 1979 intrathecal use of the drug had almost ceased because of a number of studies which showed conclusively that horrendous and frequent complications ensued. At this time, in about 1979, there developed renewed interest in the epidural use of Depo-Medrol for the treatment of severe and persistent back pain. A number of reports announced its efficacy and safety. </PARA>
<PARA> An epidural injection is one in which a presumed therapeutic substance is injected close to, but external to, the membranes which protect the spinal column. The theory was that depomedrol administered outside the membranes would not be able to cross this barrier and contaminate the spinal fluid. Once again, however, within quite a short time other specialists began to question the efficacy of this form of treatment and to report adverse reactions. There were reports that the treatment was completely ineffective. There were other reports of serious complications and adverse reactions, including arachnoiditis and meningitis, which I mentioned previously. The epidural use of Depo-Medrol for the control of back pain and other spinal conditions has been highly controversial ever since. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three possible dangers connected with the use of Depo-Medrol for epidural injections. In the first case, a planned epidural injection may, by mechanical misadventure, become an intrathecal injection, that is, the anaesthetist making the injection inadvertently pierces the membranes and injects the drug directly into the spinal column, where it is conclusively proven to be capable of doing enormous damage. This happens, on average, with between 0.5 and 2.5 per cent of injections. The patients who receive these injections by misadventure are highly likely to experience very serious adverse reactions. </PARA>
<PARA> In the second case, the needle may enter the interspinous ligaments as a result of inaccurate placement. This has been proven to occur in up to 42.5 per cent of injections. In the third case, Depo-Medrol injected epidurally as intended may very well cross the blood brain barrier and contaminate the spinal fluid, again with potentially catastrophic results for the patients. My concern is that in my State of Western Australia this form of therapy continues to be widely practised by a number of anaesthetists. I seek leave to table 17 statutory declarations from constituents in Western Australia which detail the dreadful impact this treatment has had on their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IH4">Senator JENKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These people all had spinal problems, some as a result of work-related injuries, and others as a result of traffic accidents. In the great majority of cases their medical treatment was being paid for under workers compensation or by the Motor Vehicle Insurance Trust. In a number of cases they had experienced pain for a long period of time and had had other unsuccessful treatments for that pain, but they were still functioning effectively as human beings and they were still able to work as productive members of our society. Following the treatment, they have experienced a great range of serious adverse effects and a number of them have been rendered incapable of working and turned into pain-ridden invalid pensioners. They regard themselves as a burden on their families, a burden on society and, in fact, a burden to themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to stress this aspect of the problem because it is the most distressing aspect of it. This form of treatment is routinely being given by qualified specialists. It takes full functioning individuals, suffering from distressing and manageable pain, and converts them into physical wrecks. Some of the reactions reported in these statutory declarations include: vastly increased pain; severe headaches; intracranial pressure; confusion and poor memory; paralysis of the arms and legs; abdominal distension; blurred vision; involuntary spasms; sweating; rashes; muscle weakness; loss of muscle mass; skin discoloration; total loss of sexual function; quick temper and nervousness; bleeding from the rectum; dizziness; chronic dermatitis; peptic ulcer; kidney pain; limitation of movement; weight gain; photosensitivity; numbness; bowel problems; fluid retention, and chronic adhesive arachnoiditis. The list goes on and on. The Senate will begin to understand why I expressed concern at the commencement of my remarks about the non-reporting of adverse reaction to drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no means of knowing how many people have been affected, but I do know that a considerable number of people in Western Australia have been receiving this treatment. On the basis of limited publicity-a small advertisement placed by one of my constituents in a local suburban paper and a couple of follow-up radio interviews-my office is now in touch with almost 100 people who have experienced problems with this treatment. I suspect that the numbers may be many more. </PARA>
<PARA> Surprisingly, I have not been contacted by anybody who has defended the treatment and claimed that he or she has experienced beneficial effects as a result of it. We are dealing with a therapy which does not appear to help anyone and certainly causes great damage to a number of those on whom it is practised. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect greatly concerns me. I have pointed out that the manufacturer who supplies the drug in question specifically provides a warning in the accompanying notes about its unsuitability for injection into the joints of the spine. I have detailed a large number of the adverse reactions which have been reported to me by people and which are contained in their statutory declarations. It is therefore clear that the specialists who administer this treatment cannot but be very much aware both of the warning and of the adverse reactions. The principle of informed consent requires that a practitioner proposing to embark upon a course of treatment must advise the patient of the nature of the treatment, of any attendant risks and of any adverse reactions which may be experienced. The patient is then in a position to decide whether he or she is prepared to accept any risks which may be involved in return for any prospect of relief. </PARA>
<PARA> A constant refrain throughout these stat- utory declarations is that the patients were not told what drug was being used. They were not told that there was a warning from the manufacturer against its use in the spinal joints. They were not told anything about the procedure involved. They were not warned of the possibility of any debilitating reactions. I believe that steps must be taken to ensure that doctors genuinely respect the principle of informed consent. Indeed, I suggest that they should be liable to powerful sanctions if they engage in risky or controversial forms of treatment without adequately informing the patients concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> By raising this matter in the Senate I hope to achieve the following: I believe that it is imperative that the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) place an interim ban on the use of Depo-Medrol by the epidural route while a detailed investigation is conducted by the Department of Health and Community Services into the efficacy and safety of this form of treatment. This would be with a view to the imposition of a permanent ban on this form of treatment if the investigation reveals, as indeed it may well do, that this treatment offers benefits to few and disastrous consequences to many. It is imperative that the Government move to make the reporting of adverse drug reactions mandatory and to provide for the use of powerful sanctions against doctors who fail to make such reports. It is imperative that the Government further review the application in Australian medicine of the principle of informed consent and take steps to make doctors liable to serious professional and financial consequences if they neglect adequately to inform patients before engaging in forms of treatment. I believe that these steps will stop the damage which is currently being done to people's lives and may also bring an end to serious abuses which they may not even be aware of in the initial stages. </PARA>
<PARA> The human and financial costs of the situation which I have just described are absolutely horrendous. Some of the people affected have described their experiences as a `lingering, living death' which, in one case at least, has continued for more than 10 years. The treatment itself is expensive and involves a half-day in hospital for each injection, with minor theatre costs. These costs are in one way or another borne by the community. They contribute to the high level of workers compensation, insurance premiums and also motor vehicle insurance premiums. The loss from the work force of those permanently incapacitated is also enormously expensive to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators may ask why doctors persist with this form of treatment when they can see with their own eyes what damage it does to people's lives. I cannot answer that question. I have covered only the medical aspects of this problem. There are other aspects to it, such as the way workers compensation insurance works in Australia, the involvement of the legal profession and the unions and the role of the State Government. The overall picture is ugly. I hope to develop it further in another speech at a later time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it the Motor Vehicle Standards Bill 1989. The Opposition will be supporting the legislation. The Bill is comprehensive and proposes to give effect to a series of Inter-State Commission recommendations concerning a common, Australia-wide standard for the importation of motor vehicles and components into Australia. The Bill will establish and apply a national uniform standard for motor vehicle safety and environmental quality which will apply at the time of first sale in Australia, irrespective of where the vehicle has come from.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The standards will be declared by ministerial order. They will apply to vehicles offered for sale in Australia prior to their first registration. Once the vehicles are in Australia, the laws that exist within each State with respect to maintenance and operation will apply. So the responsibilities of the States are not diminished in that sense, except that now we will have an overriding national safety standard in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will require that identification is on the vehicles showing that they comply with the Australian Design Rules. The Bill comprehensively goes into the monitoring, manufacturing and testing processes for the production of vehicles and spare parts. It also provides appropriate sanctions for breaches of the Act. The Bill applies both to new vehicles imported into this country for sale and to the second-hand market. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last 20 years we have had in this country a certification system for motor vehicles. It has been developed between the various States, the Federal authorities and the vehicle industry. It has been managed out of the Federal Office of Road Safety. In the early 1970s, the Australian Design Standards were introduced to provide minimum standards. They covered a variety of features: safety requirements, vehicle exhaust emission, noise, and anti-theft requirements. The design standards, where possible, were harmonised with international standards. To date, Australia achieves about 60 per cent harmonisation with international safety standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst it is not covered in this Bill, I think it is important that we move towards an agreed international standard with respect to design rules for motor vehicles because it costs the consumer if we have our own rules. Whether the consumer is in Australia is not the chief point. Consumers all around the world are affected in some way or other by the cost of meeting these standards. The more varied they are, the more the cost of the vehicles necessarily must be. There is no reason why vehicles produced in Australia should have different safety standards and different emission requirements from standards required of vehicles produced in the centre of Germany or in North America. It is the same environment, essentially, in which they are operating. The provision of agreed standards would be of benefit to all of us.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia needs to be more conscious of international standards. I give as an example the certification standards relating to the importation of aircraft. Ludicrously, the Federal authority designated with the responsibility for the certification of aircraft, the Civil Aviation Authority, sets the assessment criteria and certifies passenger aircraft imported into this country that have been rigorously tested in their country of manufacture. The last aircraft we brought in was the 737/300 series. It cost Australian Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia $1m to reinvent the wheel, to prove that the aeroplane was safe. In all the years that the Australian authorities have examined imported passenger aircraft, costing Australian users millions of dollars, not one modification has arisen. In other words, the certifying processes in the United States, Britain and Europe, where our passenger aircraft come from, are more than adequate for our requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a real need for Australia to grow up and to recognise that standards can be set internationally and that we do not need to stand out in an uncompromising way. I would hope that particularly in the car market-a far more important market with respect to the volume of production than the aviation market-we move rapidly to an agreed international standard for all matters covered by the Design Rules. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the old legislation, because the responsibility was divided between the various States and the Federal Government, a vehicle manufacturer or a vehicle importer had to deal with at least eight different authorities. Whilst a base level was set by the Federal authorities for vehicle standards, various States had differences. Again, delays and cost, inevitably, were involved in this program. The other point is that the Commonwealth had no legal capacity to intervene to enforce the standards. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will overcome the different standards within the country. It is hard to put a numerical value on the benefit it will be to the industry, but it certainly will contain costs to some degree. It is particularly important in regard to one facet, that is, the importation of used vehicles. There has been a flourishing trade in imported cars as Australian cars have become more expensive-as a consequence of the failed Button car plan. It has been very attractive to pick up vehicles around Asia, particularly in Japan. The Japanese certification requirements are so tight that five years after the purchase of a car it does not become economic for the Japanese to keep that car on the road. The renewal of registration becomes so expensive that the Japanese sell them. One often wonders whether that does not have an influence on Japanese design practices; that the Japanese build vehicles that basically satisfy the five-year rule. It means that a large number of vehicles have been available at a very low price in Japan and they have been imported into Australia. Because of the variation in State standards it has been most attractive to import them through Western Australia. This legislation will prevent that happening by imposing a standard that imported vehicles have to meet. It is important that, if we do have standards, we do not have loopholes in them. </PARA>
<PARA> I was talking earlier this morning about the cost of alcohol to Australia and its social consequences. It is also true that road accidents are a big cost to the economy. It is estimated that the cost of road accidents is in excess of $5 billion a year. That is an enormous amount of money. It not only involves property damage; there are also some very severe human consequences. The mortality rate is devastating. About 3,000 people a year are routinely killed on Australian roads. If we were losing 3,000 people a year in aviation accidents, in Army training or in a sporting activity, the country would be in uproar. The fact is that a ritual process which kills 3,000 of our fellow citizens on average a year passes without comment in this country. I find that quite terrible. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from those who are killed, there is the morbidity side of it-the people who are injured in road accidents: the quadriplegics and paraplegics, and the human distress it causes their families and the society supporting these people. The whole purpose of the Design Rules with respect to safety standards is to ensure, firstly, that vehicles licensed for sale in Australia have safe handling qualities and, secondly, that when accidents occur, the passengers within the vehicles get the maximum amount of protection possible. </PARA>
<PARA> So the Opposition supports this proposal. We take particular interest in the denial of the loophole in regard to the importation of vehicles. It is important that those importers who acted in good faith and within the correct letter of the law as it stood, those who had made forward orders at the time this legislation was announced, have the right to import those vehicles into the country. Clearly, they were operating within the law as it stood at the time. I believe that the Bill will allow that to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is worth making some comment about the way the Government has mismanaged the manufacturing side of passenger vehicles in this country. The latest plan-the Button car manufacturing plan-has been in place for four or five years and we have nothing to show for it. Australians now have the privilege of paying, both for locally produced cars and for imported cars, at least twice what they would pay for the same vehicle in the United States. Under the Button plan, Australian manufacturers have increased the price of their products to a level which enables them, when imported cars are brought in and heavy duty is paid on them, just to undercut the price of imported cars and thereby maintain their market share. In short, the plan has not succeeded; it has been a failure. It does not matter how much Senator Button rabbits on about what great changes and rationalisations have taken place in the industry, the fact is that, after a fair trial, we are still paying twice what we should be paying for vehicles-vehicles which, by and large, do not meet quality control standards that are attained by the Japanese, the American or the European producers and which are often a year or two, or five or six years, behind with respect to component design refinements. In conclusion, the Opposition supports this legislation and wishes it a speedy passage through the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats applaud the Government for its action in bringing in the Motor Vehicle Standards Bill-action in which we have taken a particular interest throughout this year. While this legislation has a broad ambit-that is, to enable the Federal Government to establish and apply nationally uniform standards for motor vehicle safety, gaseous and noise emissions and anti-theft devices-the specific area of interest with which I, on behalf of the Democrats in my capacity as consumer affairs spokesperson, have been involved during this year has related to concerns which arose out of the enormous increase in imports of substandard second-hand vehicles, particularly from Japan, and especially-as Senator MacGibbon has mentioned-through Western Australia. This has occurred as a result of the lack of a national set of standards. Western Australia has been the most favoured State for this practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In February of this year I made a public statement by way of a press release expressing our concern about the road safety issue, and I put the position of Australian consumers on this matter. We were very concerned that a large and increasing number of cars without standard safety features, such as side intrusion bars, seat belt anchoring points, anti-burst door locks, and so on, were coming into the country, being registered and finding their way out of Western Australia as well as remaining in large numbers in Western Australia. We were also concerned about the safety of people purchasing these vehicles, their inability to have the vehicles serviced, to get spare parts, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> We pursued the issue. I asked a question on 8 March of the Minister for Consumer Affairs, Senator Bolkus, raising the issue of the danger of these cars on our roads and consumer issues. I referred to insurance companies not wanting to insure these cars, to the unavailability of spare parts and also to the position of consumers with regard to litigation which might follow any accident involving cars of this nature. On 15 March, the Minister sought the views of the Trade Practices Commission on the importation of commercial quantities of used passenger vehicles said not to conform with the Australian Design Rules, and which in some cases might pose safety hazards for consumers.</PARA>
<PARA> We received a report from the Trade Practices Commission in May. I note that at that time Senator McKiernan, in the West Australian, expressed his concern.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that because I happened to come across a press clipping. I am not claiming to be the only person around here who is concerned. That is really what I am saying. The officer of the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Brown) pursued the issue with us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are, as I say, extremely pleased to see that this legislation has come before us. It does, of course, go beyond the importation issue. The Government has taken the opportunity to address the important question of national standards. The Australian Democrats have urged the implementation of a range of national standards in a number of other areas, particularly from the consumer angle. As Senator MacGibbon has pointed out, there are enormous economic disadvantages to this country because of the disparities that we so often find in so many areas from State to State. </PARA>
<PARA> So in general terms we support the concept of national standards in this area, particularly in view of the fact that this legislation addresses the issue of the importation of large numbers of vehicles. They have been largely Japanese vehicles, because the system of motor car registration in Japan makes it virtually impossible for Japanese consumers to keep a car much beyond five years unless they are prepared to spend a great deal of money going through the incredible hoops they have to go through to continue to register cars of that age. So there is an enormous market of barely used second-hand vehicles in that country. I have been told stories of whole fields of vehicles just sitting in Japan waiting to be exported around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The implications for our indigenous industry are enormous. It is a fact of international economic life, I suppose, but it is a cunning market practice of the Japanese industry. An extraordinarily high proportion of Japanese motor vehicles are sold in New Zealand-more than 50 per cent, I believe. I suppose that while this is a free country, with a free market to a large extent, we simply have to accept that this is likely to happen. However, what the Democrats have said all along is that if motor vehicles are going to come into this country and be registered here they must meet the same standards as the motor vehicles which are produced in this country have to meet. Further, we have said that those standards should be the same throughout the country. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, we commend the Government for this legislation and, in particular, for the speed with which this legislation has appeared subsequent to the concern that was expressed publicly by us and others on the issue of the importation of substandard vehicles. I understand that the Government has been working towards this sort of legislation for some time. The industry felt a need for it and expressed that need. A conjunction of events has brought us this legislation today, which the Democrats endorse. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Bill is supported by the Opposition. A number of matters have been subject to negotiation, but those negotiations have been concluded and allow our support at this time without our having to propose amendments. I will mention those in a minute. There are four principal issues contained in the legislation. The first is in relation to the loss of superannuation benefits because of corruption. The Bill cancels the superannuation benefits of members of the Australian Federal Police (AFP) who are convicted of a corruption offence and sentenced to imprisonment for life or a term longer than 12 months. A corruption offence is defined as an offence involving an abuse of office, one which is committed for a corrupt purpose, or perverting or attempting to pervert the course of justice. Therefore, after conviction and sentence, the AFP member runs the risk of having his or her superannuation benefits cancelled. That order is made by the court which heard the original charge. If the court order is made, the member loses the Commonwealth contribution but is repaid the employee's contribution and accrued interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The provision applies to present and former members convicted after commencement of the Act. Equivalent provisions apply in relation to members convicted of declared disciplinary offences under the AFP discipline regulations and also apply separately to the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner. As I understand it, under the structure of the legislation a separate provision is needed in relation to such officers. There is, as you are well aware, Madam Acting Deputy President, widespread public concern that police officers who have been guilty of corruption might be able to leave the police force with large superannuation payouts. We support the Commonwealth in its efforts through this legislation to ensure that the public contribution to those payments is not made. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been concerned about a couple of aspects of this part of the Bill. The first was in relation to the disciplinary regulations. We were a bit worried that the disciplinary offences should not be of such a minor nature that it would seem to be unjust that such provisions would apply. We moved an amendment in the other place in order that the Parliament could have some input by making such provisions disallowable. I understand that there have been some negotiations between my colleague the shadow Attorney-General, Mr N. A. Brown, and the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, that enable me not to need to move that amendment in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect that has caused us concern is in relation to members of the AFP who have taken a superannuation payout and have disposed of that payout in some way. Our belief is that, according to the normal principles of justice, the public should be able to recover the public contribution to such a payout where such officers are subsequently found guilty of a serious offence relating to official corruption. We moved amendments to that effect in the other place. We do not move them here because we have accepted an undertaking from the Government that it intends to introduce similar legislation that will cover the Australian Public Service generally, other government employees, and statutory office holders-and I think it will cover parliamentarians as well. In such circumstances we have indicated that we would be satisfied if the amendments that we moved in the other place to widen the scope of the Bill were included within that intended piece of legislation. The Government has indicated by letter to us that it will move accordingly. On that basis we are not seeking to amend this Bill. I look forward to the Minister's confirmation of that agreement when he responds today. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area covered by the Bill has to do with redeployment and retirement. The Bill contains streamlined provisions on redeployment and retirement which provide that if the Commissioner is satisfied that a member's services cannot be reasonably used in a particular position in his present rank, the member may be appointed to a specified position in a lower rank, or retired. That is subject to appeal under the Merit Protection Act. We think that that greater flexibility is worth while, and therefore we support it. </PARA>
<PARA> The third area covered by the Bill is witness protection. The Bill provides that the Commissioner may make arrangements with State and Territory police forces, the National Crime Authority and other authorities for the provision of services needed for a witness protection program. We have indicated in this chamber our support for a witness protection program under the auspices of the AFP, which has had a good record in relation to witness protection so far, and we therefore support these provisions. I should say that they represent only a start in dealing with the problems of witness protection. There are still major issues, such as the cost of such programs at the moment, which are going to have to be streamlined, and also the fact that there has been very little done so far to enable the establishment of a witness-after his services are no longer required-in a new identity. As you might imagine, Madam Acting Deputy President, that requires not only Commonwealth but State legislation in order that everything from motor vehicle licences to social security numbers and the like can be adequately varied. We urge the Government to lift its pace in relation to those necessary reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth and last area covered by the Bill is in relation to fixed term appointments. The Bill enables fixed term appointments to be made to prescribed or senior executive ranks. We understand that the Australian Federal Police Association supports that provision. We support it. Again, we think that fixed term appointments will provide greater flexibility and therefore is a reform that is worth while. As was indicated in the other place, and as I have indicated today, we therefore support the fourth of those reforms. On that basis I indicate our support for the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand so. But that effort may be very much curtailed or inhibited by a breakdown in communication systems. That comes back to the first part of Senator Lewis's question about the current assessment. It is fair to say that there is increasingly less hard news coming out of China and that newspaper headlines speculating about divisions within the military and so on are probably exaggerated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In so far as conferring with other Western countries is concerned, intelligence assessments are made on behalf of the Australian Government and other Western countries. There is some liaison in comparing those intelligence assessments. However, I am not in a position to answer the question in further detail for obvious reasons.</PARA>
<PARA> The other point I should make-which is very much my own point-is that the machinery of government in China is currently totally preoccupied with its own problems and is not highly susceptible to what the outside world is saying or thinking about those issues. While countries might engage in a fair degree of competition to make statements about the issues, I am not sure that those signals from the outside world will be heeded or that they will be of a great deal of interest to the Chinese Government or whoever is in control at the present time. In answer to the question as to what Australia can do to limit the broadening of current problems in China, the realistic assessment is: not very much.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. I refer to a grant of $1m recently allocated by the Federal Government to assist Australian Aborigines and Islanders to teach and maintain their unique languages. Is it a fact that only 20 Aboriginal languages now survive, when in 1788 almost 250 distinct Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages were spoken across Australia, consisting of more than 700 dialects? Is it correct that, based on the current rate of attrition, all Aboriginal and Islander languages will be extinct within 20 years? Is the grant of $1m vital in preserving the cultural heritage of the Aboriginal people? Has the Minister's attention been drawn to criticism levelled by the Opposition Aboriginal Affairs spokesman, Mr Smith, that the $1m would have been better spent on Aboriginal housing, employment and health? Can the Minister provide details of the amount of funding currently allocated by the Federal Government to provide housing, education and health for Aboriginal and Islander people?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fact that only about 20 Aboriginal languages are still in existence. It is believed that a couple of hundred years ago there were about 250, with a larger number of dialects. It is also believed generally that without some government assistance the remaining 20 languages might well die out altogether. With that in mind Mr Dawkins has already announced that more than $1m will be allocated by the Commonwealth to assist Aborigines in teaching and maintaining their languages. This year 53 grants have been offered, most of them to community groups.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am aware of criticism levelled at the program by the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs, Mr Smith, who said that the money would be better spent somewhere else. However, I understand that Mr Smith made those comments not as the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs but as Chairman of the Opposition's Waste Watch Committee in some previous incarnation-I am not sure whether he is still the Chairman of that Committee. Therefore, there seems to be a bit of confusion about where the Opposition or its spokesman on this subject stands on this issue and whether Mr Smith cares at all about the survival of the remnants of Aboriginal languages and the associated culture. In view of that, it is incumbent on the Opposition leadership, and especially on Senator Chaney, who has often claimed to have a deep and genuine interest in these matters, to clarify the Opposition's position on the funding for Aboriginal languages and to clarify whether Mr Smith's comments are his own views. If so, it is incumbent upon Senator Chaney and the Opposition to dissociate themselves from Mr Smith's views. For the record, since Mr Smith also mentioned housing, education and health, the Government is currently spending some $295m on those programs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I indicated in broad terms what the cost to the general public would be if the legislation were rejected. I can now indicate in some specific examples what the cost would be. The examples I have selected are the electorates of Kingston and Fairfax, and the new electorate of Pearce. I observe that, as it so happens, these are the electorates for which the Leader of the Australian Democrats is running, the Leader of the National Party of Australia is running and the Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia is running. For the first time, all the leaders of the non-Labor parties are trying to get out of this chamber and are running for lower House seats. From Senator Button's point of view, that is a Garry Ablett-like performance. The three players that have been positioned on him are trying to move themselves off him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I table the detailed workings out of the costs to those electorates. For the record, I mention that the cost to the ordinary population of Kingston would be $900,000. The loss of income for GPs would be $2,250,000. The cost to the electorate of Fairfax would be $900,000. I do not have figures for GPs. We do not have a census figure for the actual population of the new electorate of Pearce, but based on electors it would be $470,000. I do not have the figures for GPs. This document shows how those sums have been worked out. An elector in any one of those three electorates would not call those three people running the `three amigos'; he or she would call them the `three stooges'.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am aware of the report in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald about Harris-Daishowa's intention to build two pulp mills, one at Grafton and one in Tasmania, and its statement that no chlorine bleaching would be conducted here in Australia. I also note its statement that, if that is the case, it would be none of Australia's business. I am not sure I can agree with that part of the statement made by its spokesperson this morning. There would obviously be two tests that any pulp mill proposal in Australia would have to pass. First and foremost, given that it is a Foreign Investment Review Board matter, economic tests apply, one matter being whether it is considered that this proposal and its value-added nature would be of sufficient benefit to Australia to warrant approval. That matter would be for the Treasurer, Mr Keating, and for the other economic Ministers to determine. The second test to pass would be the environmental test. The Government demonstrated the strength of its resolve when it came to the Wesley Vale mill earlier in the year. When one looks at that result one sees that the answer to question No. 2 of Senator McLean's question-are we placing some of the highest environmental standards on paper production in the world?-is yes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator McLean is aware, early in May, the Government announced that a delegation from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, my Department and the industry would be going to Finland, Sweden and Canada to look at what was the best possible technology. I think that delegation is due to report by the end of this month. The members returned a couple of weeks ago. In the briefing that I have had so far from one member of the delegation, it is quite clear that the technology suggested for Wesley Vale was nowhere near the best possible technology and that the Government's decision to announce its intention to apply higher environmental standards, had the consortium wished to go ahead, was certainly correct.</PARA>
<PARA> I am asked whether I have considered thermomechanical pulping as a means of producing paper. Senator McLean will recall that the Prime Minister did change the terms of reference for the group that was going to Europe and Canada. As a result of that change of the terms of reference, I am sure that there will be a report on that process in this report we are expecting to get in the next few weeks. I shall let Senator McLean know what those experts have to say about its possibility.</PARA>
<PARA> The last question asked whether I have considered outlawing the building of any new pulp mill in Australia which uses the old environmentally disastrous kraft method of pulping. I have not considered attempting to outlaw kraft mills. It is not a decision I would make; it would be a government decision. I anxiously await this report. I think it may well suggest that if the best possible technology is used, then kraft mills do not necessarily have to be environmentally disastrous. The effluent which will come out from them, at the end of the day, might be very much cleaner than that which we were talking about before. I remind honourable senators that we were talking about 13 tonnes of organochlorins being dumped into Bass Strait every day. I am hopeful that that report will give us at least the basis to answer question No. 4. Certainly, at the moment I have not considered outlawing the building of a pulp mill which includes the kraft process.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see the article in this morning's Canberra Times. It is not the first time these allegations have been made by either Mr Buschmann or his supporters, although, I note for the record, that when asked the question directly in a television interview over the weekend Mr Buschmann very quickly denied that allegation. But he has resurrected it again today-I can only assume for the purpose of playing on the emotions of those who are gullible and trying to raise emotions and false issues, as has occurred all the way through. My Department is dealing with this individual and his supporters. I reiterate that the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs is acting upon two matters related to his application form for a visa. Whenever these breaches are brought to our attention they are acted upon. He has been treated no differently from any other visitor to this country. As always in these cases, he was given the opportunity to leave voluntarily, as other visitors to this country are once a breach is brought to the attention of the Government. When one does not leave voluntarily our Department proceeds with the deportation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On Friday night of last week Mr Buschmann was offered passage from this country via a safe route-not a dangerous route-but he insisted on going to Adelaide to continue his political activities. Throughout this matter the Department has acted in a non-political way. But I do say this: Mr Buschmann describes himself as an `anti-fascist fighter'. I would have thought that the first step down the road to fascism was ignoring the law or treating people differently under the law. In future our Department will find it impossible to enforce deportations or visa conditions if we let a darling of one section of society get away with breaches of those laws yet prosecute everyone else. I have not made any of these decisions on the basis of politics.</PARA>
<PARA> I guess we have had a fair deal of criticism because Mr Buschmann is perceived as a magnificent freedom fighter. I might put the record straight on that once and for all; in my view Mr Buschmann is a left wing terrorist. That is not only my view. I can quote leader after leader of the opposition in Chile, people who have risked their lives to oppose the Pinochet regime, people who are still in Chile risking their lives, who have condemned Mr Buschmann. The ultimate statement by Mr Buschmann that disgusts me and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is that even if the democratic road were to succeed in Chile in 1990-91, and even if there were to be a democratically elected government, he would still pursue an armed overthrow of that government. There is no way that we, as a government, would support those activities and say, `All right, Chile has gone to democracy but you can still install a left wing terrorist regime to replace a right wing totalitarian regime'. None of these political issues has been used in the consideration of my Department in its treatment of Mr Buschmann. But if Mr Buschmann wants a public fire fight on his political views, I am willing to have it because to me they are not an Australian way of doing things. He is preying on the gullibility of his supporters in this country who, I accept, to a man and woman are anti-Pinochet. However, it does not necessarily follow that, if one is anti-Pinochet, one must support Mr Buschmann.</PARA>

Has it sold its products in 25 countries but not in Australia? Since it should be ideal for the project, having worked on Jindalee now for 10 years, given that it wishes to be part of the project and in view of the fact that at least two of the consortia have indicated no interest in this Australian manufacturer because of commitments made to potential overseas partners, I ask the Minister: Can he seek to ensure that, in the making of the contract with whichever prime contractor is successful, the Government will insist that manufacturers like Kel Aerospace not be excluded by the demands of overseas companies seeking to reserve to themselves elements of any successful contract for the Jindalee project?

Those corporations are Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, Telecom Australia and AWA Ltd, which are all Australian companies. These companies will take into account any Australian company that hopes to contribute to Jindalee. The Government is determined that Australia will have full technical control over this vital strategic asset. In relation to that vital control, obviously we hope Kel Aerospace will be an important part of the project. But its capabilities are on a small scale. It is not as if Kel Aerospace could have been asked to fulfil the whole contract. However, contrary to the information which the honourable senator has provided, I am advised that the company would be welcomed as a sub-contractor to the three companies that are bidding for the prime contract.

For example, under the new guidelines of the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), a Boeing 747 jumbo jet should undergo extensive modifications and repairs after 20,000 flights, or 20 years. I ask the Minister: Is Australia also considering adopting a policy of automatically repairing and replacing the structural components of ageing aircraft at a specified life, or flight limit, rather than just when cracks appear? Will these modifications and repairs, costing an estimated $US2.3m, be made as soon as possible to Qantas 747 aircraft, given that at least one Qantas plane had chalked up 19,300 flights as at April this year, according to an answer given in the Senate on 5 May?</PARA></TALK.START>

But, it is important to note that there is no proposal to scrap the regular inspections of aircraft which will continue for all aircraft. The mandatory modifications, should that decision be made, would be on top of the normal scheduled inspections.

I received last week, and tabled in the Senate this week, an interim reply from the Minister for Natural Resources, Mr Ian Causley, after it was reported that the New South Wales Premier, Mr Nick Greiner, had indicated in a press interview that he would direct the Minister for Natural Resources to resume discussions with the Commonwealth. I received that letter, which I take as being an interim reply from him to a quite detailed and complex submission from us to ensure protection of the industry in the south-east and to enable the Commonwealth Government to conduct over 12 months a biological survey of the environmental properties of the key areas of the south-east forests. A further dimension of our proposition was to try to encourage the industry and the New South Wales Government to develop plantations to meet future sawlog and woodchip resources from that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On Tuesday of this week I wrote to Mr Causley-the letter was faxed and he would have got it the same day-inviting him to come to Canberra, as the sittings of the Senate prevent my going to Sydney, to try to finalise what is now a long running stand-off between the Commonwealth and the State. I am surprised that Mr Causley has not responded by now. This matter is quite important and urgent. Three weeks ago I obtained the support of the employees of Harris-Daishowa (Australia) Pty Ltd to the proposition that I put. I have also obtained support for the proposition from shop stewards of the Timber Workers Union of Australia, who met in one central spot in the south-east to hear the proposition from me. After discussions with the Bega Shire Council, representatives of the Bombala Shire Council and representatives of the Eden Chamber of Commerce, I believe there is substantial support for my proposal.</PARA>

I understand also that last Thursday, after the demonstration outside Parliament House in support of employment by members of the timber industry, members sent a delegation to meet the Opposition and to solicit its support. As I am now advised, there may be an answer to the question that both Senator Richardson and I have been asking of Senator Puplick: Where does the Opposition stand in terms of the New South Wales Government's attitude on the south-east forests? I understand from the industry that it could not get a clear answer either way-whether the Opposition supports the New South Wales Government, the environmentalists, the industry or this Government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not like Senator Chapman's question to perpetuate the myth that the majority of people coming to Australia from Hong Kong are business migrants. He did not intend it that way, but I think there is a general view that everyone coming from Hong Kong is a business migrant. Business migrants would not make up more than 10 per cent of the total applications out of Hong Kong. The level of $650,000, as I indicated at the Estimates hearings, is under review. It is under review for a number of reasons. One was the level of the Australian dollar at that time, which was US88c. That has now come down to US75c, so it is not such a strong factor. We have been looking at whether we can lower that level. One of the things we are looking at is age. We think it is harder for a younger person to accumulate that amount of assets. We may have three categories. For instance-this is not definitive-for those under 40 years of age we may require only $300,000; for those from 40 to 58 years of age we may require $500,000; and for those over 58 years of age, because of the short business span, we may require $1m. We have been looking at all of those features. A report on these matters is due to me very shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has also been suggested that we might like to take a country's taxation regime into account because it is a lot easier to accumulate assets in one country than another. I suspect that in the end that criterion would not be enforceable because of the capital gains tax and a number of other matters. The honourable senator's suggestion is under serious consideration, not just for Hong Kong but for countries throughout the world. We are now in a position, with a return to a bipartisan policy and with the sorts of adjustments I have mentioned, to compete very strongly with our major competitors, New Zealand and Canada, in this regard. I suspect that no matter what, even if we do not alter the current requirement, we will see a very substantial increase over the next couple of financial years in the number of business migrants coming to Australia.</PARA>

I agree with Senator Lewis's criticism of Senator Bolkus in that we should always follow a question, because sometimes I have found that a question has changed halfway through. Leaving that aside, I argue that the question is not out of order, although I reinforce the point made by Senator Lewis about the length of questions and the fact that long questions waste a lot of Question Time.

I made sure that the Senior Private Secretary of Mr Howard, and of Senator Richardson before that, was made well aware of the procedures required-that is, to give us the fullest possible notice of trips to Queensland so that appropriate threat assessments could be undertaken and a close personal escort could be provided by the Federal Police, as it has been in the case of Senator Richardson to ensure his safety.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The financial year 1986-87 is the latest one for which detailed taxation statistics are available. They show that in that year just over half a million Australians declared on their personal income tax returns income from dividends on company shares. As a percentage of total taxpayers, that is just over 7 per cent. Some taxpayers would own shares through partnerships and some would own non-dividend paying shares. In addition, a very much larger number would have some very indirect share ownership via superannuation funds, so the 7.2 per cent is very much the base figure. Because the figures refer to 1986-87, pre-dating the effects of the imputation system, they might well have changed since then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The data does not allow for particularly reliable international comparisons, but it seems that the proportion of Australians who personally own shares-that excludes indirect ownership through superannuation funds-is not high by international standards, given that Australian per capita incomes are still about fourteenth or fifteenth in the world.</PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned the dividend imputation system as being a factor which ought to encourage the ownership of shares by Australians. Another factor which some surveys have picked up is that many Australians perceive our stock exchanges as casinos where rich wheeler-dealers shuffle paper. That, of course, is a negative for more widespread share ownership. It is a perception that is not helped when leading figures are seen to be deliberately flouting the rules of the game. That includes the current attempt by Mr Elliott to deprive small shareholders in Elders IXL Ltd of their right to a proper takeover bid from Harlin Pty Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA> The mechanism through which the take- over bid is being pursued by Harlin is that shareholders have been offered a block of Elders shares, around 18 per cent, on a pro rata basis to their present holdings. The price at which the shares are being offered is $3, which is well above the prevailing market price of around $2.70. The issue is underwritten by Harlin Pty Ltd, a company controlled by Mr Elliott. If the other shareholders decline to pay the price, which is well above market price, at which the shares have been offered to them, Harlin as the underwriter picks them up, bringing Harlin's total shareholding in Elders IXL to around 48 per cent. Any company which had a pre-existing level of shareholding of around 30 per cent, which Harlin had, would under the proper rules of the game have been required not to add more than 3 per cent in any six-month period to its shareholding or alternatively to make a proper takeover offer to all the shareholders. This particular behaviour was commented on in an article in the Australian on Monday of this week. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The equities manager at Perpetual Trustees, Mr Anton Tagliaferro, said he was `disappointed to see the paper shuffle continuing'.</PARA>
<PARA>. . . .</PARA>

<PARA>He is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Issuing bonus shares on shares paid to 1c (under the Elders IXL executive incentive scheme) was bad enough, but this creeping takeover is worse.</PARA>
<PARA>The final point I want to make is that when company executives manipulate share issues and takeovers to benefit themselves and therefore by definition diddle ordinary shareholders and are known to be doing so, that obviously discourages direct participation in share ownership by the great majority of Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 31 May Senator Calvert asked me a question concerning nursing home admissions in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health. An answer to that question was supplied to me by Dr Blewett. As it is a long answer, I wonder whether it would be more appropriate to incorporate it in Hansard. I seek leave to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> In general, nursing homes are neither staffed nor equipped to provide care for people with psychiatric disorders. Most people with psychiatric disorders would not be helped by being admitted to a facility which is intended to provide nursing and personal care mainly for people with physical disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA> For these reasons I do not intend altering this section of the guidelines in response to the issues raised in the question.</PARA>
<PARA> The Section of the ``Guidelines for Approval of Admission to a Nursing Home'' relating to residents of State psychiatric institutions was adopted in 1986 following a large number of nursing home admission applications from such residents where the reason for admission was given as ``closure of hospital beds''. This type of application is still being received.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth cannot be expected to bear the cost of savings realised by State Governments when State institutions are closed down and the State fails to make appropriate alternative arrangements for their accommodation and care. It remains the responsibility of State Governments to continue to provide care for long term residents of State psychiatric institutions particularly when those residents are discharged because of closures. Alternative arrangements are the responsibility of the States not the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA> For this reason, the Commonwealth guidelines do preclude persons who have been long term residents of State institutions from being approved for nursing home admission. However, the guidelines specifically state that exemptions may occur where the application fulfils the criteria for admission in the National Health Act section 40ab (3) and:</PARA>
<PARA> where the application is for admission to a special purpose home related to the person's disability; or</PARA>
<PARA> the applicant has been admitted to the State institution for an acute episode while still a nursing home patient, or where admission was for less than twelve months or three years in last five; and</PARA>
<PARA> the applicant suffers a long term physical illness, which overrides any psychiatric disorder or intellectual disability, and</PARA>
<PARA> the physical disability cannot be adequately managed in the State institution, and acute hospital care is not appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> These exemptions would cover the case of a nursing home resident being required to have treatment for a temporary illness in a State institution and then wishing to return to a nursing home. There would therefore be nothing to prevent such a person from returning to the nursing home providing his or her physical and mental condition continued to require nursing home care.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Tuesday Senator Boswell asked me, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, a question concerning frozen banana prawns being traded to Japan. I have given a copy of the answer provided by the Minister to Senator Boswell, but as it is a three-page answer I seek leave to incorporate it in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Exports of prawns from Australia to Japan in 1981-82 totalled 13,168 tonnes, while in 1986-87, there were 9,257 tonnes exported</PARA>
<PARA> some stocks of ocean-caught prawns are being held in cold-stores in Northern Australia. This is not unusual.</PARA>
<PARA> Quality of the product is not the major barrier to sales of Australian prawns to Japan.</PARA>
<PARA> There has been a large expansion of imports of white prawns from China, Indonesia and Thailand into Japan, associated particularly with the enormous growth of aquaculture in those countries.</PARA>
<PARA> At the end of March there were 92,000 tonnes of prawns still held in Japanese cold storage from last year</PARA>
<PARA> consumption fell away during the illness of the Emperor and the mourning period which followed his death.</PARA>
<PARA> Japanese companies are attempting to reduce excess holdings, especially of large size prawns.</PARA>
<PARA> The decline in trade to Japan therefore has much less to do with inappropriate export standards</PARA>
<PARA> Product assessed for export is rejected if the aggregate defects exceed a total of 15% (not 37% as stated by Senator Boswell)</PARA>
<PARA> existing export standards for fish were brought into effect in 1985 with the promulgation of the Fish Orders (amended in 1988 as the Export Control (Fish) Orders)</PARA>
<PARA> a review of the export standard for frozen prawns in 1988 resulted in the tightening of the size grade tolerance from 25% defective (ie outside the declared grade) to 15%</PARA>
<PARA> this change was made in accordance with broad industry views.</PARA>
<PARA> Government policy is to place greater responsibility for compliance with regulations onto industry, and to avoid interference in matters of a strictly commercial nature</PARA>
<PARA> the concerns raised by the honourable senator reflect difficulties experienced by the industry to meet commercial demands, and are not relevant to product wholesomeness or truth in labelling which are the objectives of export controls administered by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service.</PARA>
<PARA> If the fishing industry desires a review of the current export standards, I will be happy to arrange that</PARA>
<PARA> however, the comments received from industry in 1987 and 1988 would suggest that the export standard meets the needs of the export industry</PARA>
<PARA> a tighter grade standard would very likely result in higher costs for Australian exporters and therefore a widening of the cost differential between us and our competitors.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is actively encouraging the adoption of quality assurance and Total Quality Management principles by the food industry</PARA>
<PARA> the benefits include reduced inspection costs, greater product quality assurance and improved competitiveness</PARA>
<PARA> it is open to all fish exporters to pursue this approach, and AQIS officers can assist in explaining the systems and initiating Approved Quality Assurance arrangements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> The urgent need for Government action to strengthen Australia's Defence capability by enhancing the capacity of the reserve forces. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Defence Force (ADF) has outgrown its budget and, as a result, is now in crisis. The Army, in particular, cannot survive at its present regular size without more money and, because more money may not be available, the only way to preserve structures and to maintain capabilities at an acceptable level of peacetime readiness is to make more effective use of the Army Reserve. The Reserve is that body of part time servicemen which, in time of conflict, would be the core of the rapid expansion of our military forces. It is the Reserve which gave us some of our most famous leaders-people like Monash, Morshead, Herring and Dougherty-people who are famous for their deeds in defence of this country. And the Army Reserve, if allowed to do so, could do the same again. </PARA>
<PARA> Are senior service officers serious about the Army Reserve and about the reserves generally? Do they fear the reserves as a threat to the permanent forces? Do they fear that a fair go to the reserves might not suit their short term agendas for personal promotion? Sadly, it seems that that might be so. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the background, contained in a series of facts: firstly, the defence vote has been used to accommodate capital equipment expenditure running at about 30 per cent of the total vote. Secondly, the vote itself has not risen significantly in real terms and, if there is more money for capital expenditure, there has therefore to be less for other functions. Thirdly, costs, including Australian industry participation costs and capital cost increases, have placed even more stress on the Defence budget. That again means that there will be even less for people and for day-to-day operations. Further, ADF manpower has been left behind as far as wage justice is concerned. Senator Newman has drawn attention to this on many occasions. This is significant, and is of the order of 20 per cent of the wages bill. That is to say, Defence Force personnel are underpaid, which is one reason for the high resignation rate within the forces. Even so, the cost of ADF manpower within the regular forces is about $35m for every thousand personnel. When the long-overdue pay rise is put into effect, that cost will exceed $40m for every thousand Defence Force personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Services, in order to live within their budgets, have been forced to economise to the point of real hurt in the area of operating costs. These operating costs are the essential items of fuel, rations, travel allowances, and so on which permit personnel in the ADF to undergo adequate training. Flying time, steaming time, exercise time-all the training elements-have been drastically curtailed. Further, the restrictions have not been shared equally. Certain elite units-for example, the Army's Operational Deployment Force-have properly required, and received, high resource inputs to maintain high degrees of readiness. Of course, that means that other areas get even less. One of the consequences of these economic stringencies and of the restrictions on service life which they cause has been the huge wastage by resignation and non-re-engagement. Again, this has been referred to by my colleagues on many occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> The only alternatives for solutions to the present training, resignation and morale problems are, on the one hand, more money for operating costs-and we know this is not likely to be forthcoming-or, on the other hand, reduced commitments either to equipment or to manpower. If there is to be no more money, the solution has to be one of those two alternatives. In the absence of any real new commitment of resources, and in the presence of a continuing commitment to equipment acquisition, the only solution will inevitably mean the shedding of regular manpower and the loss of more of our regular forces. It should make any Australian frightened, because this loss is likely to be 5 or 10 per cent of the total manpower of the Australian Defence Force. And this is where the Reserve forces should come in. </PARA>
<PARA> The Army has, for very sensible reasons, incorporated Reserve manpower into its regular units and formations. One would have expected the ADF to have turned increasingly to its Reserve components. This would have enabled key capabilities to be maintained, numbers to be kept up, units to be preserved and a core force to be maintained-perhaps at a lesser degree of readiness but at least as part of the force in being. Certainly, at top levels-the Chief of Defence Force, for example-this imperative is clearly recognised, but in application the policy is sadly and dangerously deficient. That is why it is a matter of urgency to bring this issue to the attention of the Senate today. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy is deficient in several ways. Firstly, not only are we wasting regular soldiers, not only is there an enormous rate of resignations and non-re-engagements; but also there is no effective policy whereby resigning officers, with expensive expertise provided at public cost, are required or encouraged then to perform a return of service, part time, as reservists. There is no effective encouragement or requirement for Royal Australian Air Force aircrew, Army engineers, naval technical officers or any other hi-tech personnel fleeing the Services to do Reserve service after they have left. This is a tragedy. For example, to replace the pilots we know we have lost recently will take years and cost millions or dollars-even if no more resign. Of course, we would expect that the resignations will continue. There is no effective policy to use the training and experience of the rank and file who, by not re-engaging, leave the Army at the rate of about 3,000 a year. No Reserve service is required of these persons. </PARA>
<PARA> But the problem is worse than that. The Reserve component itself, and the Army Reserve in particular, has been subject, over recent years, to debilitating neglect and debilitating restrictions. At this stage I wish to quote from the minutes of an Army Reserve Association contact meeting held on 3 May 1989 at Kogarah depot at which a number of concerns were expressed to Major-General Keldie, who was at the meeting, and to other senior officers. Let me select the complaint about clothing. The minutes read:</PARA>
<PARA> Dissatisfaction with availability of clothing was wide-spread. It appears that pieces of World War II webbing are still being issued. Slouch hats are still not available. Poly shoulder boards have not been available in the Sydney system for two years. Sleeping bags for weekend activities are difficult to obtain. </PARA>
<PARA> Recruits, in particular, receive a very poor impression of the Reserve when their initial kit-out issue fails to supply the majority of items to which they are entitled. </PARA>
<PARA>The minutes go on. This is not some document from the Opposition; it is in fact a document from the Army Reserve Association. These are the kinds of concerns that are being expressed. It is not enough for the Chief of the Defence Force and for many high-ranking officers to say that they want to see the Reserve play a greater and a necessary role. It is not enough for them to say that they want the Army Reserve to be able to assist the Australian defence forces in a time of crisis if the desire in those statements is not reflected at unit and formation level. </PARA>
<PARA> The Army Reserve has been subject to hurtful training day restrictions which will save literally trivial amounts of money when we look at the quantum of what is involved in, say, equipment purchases. The Army Reserve has been forced to impose strength restrictions which, in turn, is now forcing some commanders to turn away hundreds of would-be volunteers. Units are being disbanded or combined. Restrictions on operating costs are preventing adequate training or exercising. Where Reserve elements serve with regular units, the needs of the reservists tend to be overlooked or ignored. Inevitably, as a result, there is a loss of soldiers, non-commissioned officers and officers and there is a need for continuing high levels of recruiting activity. That in itself is another expense; recruiting is expensive. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, reserve officer production is starved of real resources. The officer cadet training units have small intakes because few resources now go into attracting suitable candidates to undertake the training. Units are short of officers and equipment is scarce. But, even more, no real total Army or total force feeling has emerged. The reservist is frequently and unfairly criticised, as is his unit, because of deficiencies. There are low training standards. Also, there is no money to train-they cannot do much about that; high manpower wastage, which is inevitable; and low officer strength. These deficiencies have always been within the capacity of government to rectify if only it will make available the necessary resources to the forces and to the Army. </PARA>
<PARA> Lately we have had a new attack on the opportunity of reservists to have a career in the Reserve Army, leading to formation command or above. When I talk about `formation command', I am talking about the rank of brigadier and above. The argument, especially as espoused, I am sorry to say, by the General Officer Commanding Land Force, Major-General Neville Smethurst, goes something like this: there are too few places for brigade commanders; the reservist is not well enough qualified; we need command places for regular soldiers; readiness requirements have changed since World War II and reservists will not do. I have to say that Major-General Smethurst, applying that kind of argument and that kind of policy, has ceased to appoint Reserve officers to formation command and above and has started to replace them with regular soldiers. This is the final straw. As the Army Reserve is operating today under the promotional strategy of Major-General Smethurst, no senior commands are going to Reserve soldiers. Many qualified reservists have been passed over in favour of regular soldiers and, as a result, no Reserve officers serving today can realistically entertain hopes of holding high command. </PARA>
<PARA> What would have happened in the time of Monash had that policy applied? What would have happened if we had not been able to send away the Monashes and the Morsheads who became famous for the role they were able to play? Several Reserve formation commanders have been removed or not renewed by Major-General Smethurst and have been replaced by regular soldiers in recent times-I am talking about this year and last year. While this happens there can be no emergence of great citizen soldier leaders-the people who have genius and interest but who have an occupation apart from professional soldiering. Although there is supposed to be a policy against this, every indication is that this practice of not appointing Reserve soldiers will continue while ever the major-general continues to ignore the policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been informed by a former senior officer that, some time early in May, Major-General Smethurst gave a keynote address at General Fay's Army Reserve conference. In front of a large number of officers, he supported his anti-Reserve formation commander policy and he described it as his policy. So we now have a situation where this is the policy of the Land Force Commander. It is no good; it is not right. This will be another nail in a coffin already largely nailed down and it would not be to the advantage of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I might support my argument by reading into the Hansard a letter from General Sir Francis Hassett, AC, KBE, CB, DSO, MVO. Those honourable senators who know General Hassett will be aware that he was the former Chief of Defence Force and, before that, Chief of the General Staff. His letter to Major-General Cullen reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Paul,</PARA>
<PARA> I have read your Army papers with concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I strongly support the principle that when an Army Reserve officer is suitable for an Army Reserve appointment then he must be preferred. Suitable, to me, means that he has adequate military knowledge for the appointment and potential in other fields, such as leadership. The last, for Army Reserve officers, also takes account of his standing in the community. The more senior the appointment, the higher the expectation. </PARA>
<PARA> Adequacy in military knowledge does not mean that he must be as thoroughly informed as his regular counterpart. He will learn on the job-that is part of the exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Army Reserve is, inter alia, to train and give experience to Army Reserve officers at the various command and staff levels. This can only be done if appointments are kept open for them. We do not want to shut out potential Morsheads, Herrings, Allen and the like. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken to people in Canberra, including the acting CGS Fitzgerald-(O'Donnell is overseas). It seems to me that you have already achieved two important results. </PARA>
<PARA>He sets out two results which have been achieved recently. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Re-affirmation by the Minister, the CDF and others of the important principle that if a suitable Reserve officer is available then he must be preferred. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) An awareness at senior levels of current feelings and the need for extreme care in future appointments. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe there is a deliberate plot to undermine the ethos and standing of the CGS. If there has been such a move, then you have stopped it. The present policy is perfectly sound. Its implementation is the problem. Perhaps there is currently, undue concentration on producing an efficient organisation today as opposed to training Reserve officers for the future. There must be a proper balance and it is the responsibility of the Advisory Committee to get it right. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said all of the above, we both know from long experience, that there are situations, particularly in the smaller or more remote areas, where a suitable Reserve officer is just not available. The appointment of an unsuitable officer, particularly if senior, not only affects the Army internally but drags down its reputation with the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot comment on individuals you mention because I know little about them and none of the details. </PARA>
<PARA>He then said a couple of personal things. General Hassett has no doubt what the proper promotion strategy should be. If one reads General Hassett's letter, it is quite clear that he would not agree with the policy being followed today by Major-General Neville Smethurst. </PARA>
<PARA> My message today is that the future of Australian defence requires as an essential element the enhancement and reinvigoration of the reserve forces. These are the elements of Australian defence that gave us a number of very famous generals who came forward in a time of crisis to help defend this country-names such as Monash, Morshead, Dougherty, Herring and Allen. </PARA>
<PARA> If we fail to respond to the crisis now facing the Army, if we pretend that the crisis does not exist, if we fail to understand its critical elements, if we fail to take the difficult decisions which are demanded-and I have set out in this speech some of the things that need to be done; they seem to be decisions that the Labor Government has avoided for far too long-then we will betray this country: its traditions, its past, its present soldiers and its future. I believe that we can today send the following message to the bunker at Russell: What you are doing is unacceptable to the Parliament. It is not fair to the Army Reserve. It is not in the best interests of Australia. Ignore our protests if you will, but do so at your own peril. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin at the outset by trying to put this motion in some context. The first point that needs to be made is that we are not just talking about the Army Reserve. Senator Peter Baume attempted to paint a broader picture about Australia's defence capabilities and the policies of this Government relating to them. I will begin by responding in kind. I remind Senator Baume that the reserves are part of a total context, a total defence capability that Australia has put together and will need over the next decade or so. He knows very well, having been a member of this Senate for so many years, that when this Government came to office we were confronted with a backlog of defence decisions that had to be made. For example, there was no overall strategy. Procurement was haphazard and not part of an overall defence strategy. There was no overall view of defence requirements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators opposite have made a few noises about this being an inappropriate picture. Yet some of them were members of a government which tolerated the idiocy of having three separate departments looking after the defence of Australia, putting in their bids, and often counterbids, for procurement of equipment and the setting of strategy goals. In effect, they were fighting each other, in and out of the bureaucracy, to get what they wanted. We knew when we came to government that it was absolutely necessary not only to set new structures and new goals but also to get a debate going about what we wanted for the next decade or more. </PARA>
<PARA> That debate was started by Minister Beazley. Minister Beazley is not only one of the first Ministers to have had the courage to force those involved in setting policy goals for defence in Australia but also the first to ask for that debate to occur and request a response from the Opposition, the community at large and current members of the forces and those who have retired. I believe that that debate has been very valuable. When I listen to Opposition senators in Estimates committees, for example, I realise that they are now able to ask questions about procurement policies in line with an understanding that this Government has long term strategy goals for defence. I wonder how they would have got on if they had sat on Estimates committees at the time when they were in government. What could they have asked then about long term goals? I am sure that those members who were on the back bench committee of the Liberal Party at the time realise how little discussion was ever undertaken in their party room about long term defence goals. I could refer to some of the issues that they raised as back bench senators and members of the House of Representatives at the time, when they were totally ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> I could also refer to situations in which strategy goals were written down and discussions held within the Department of Defence by civilians in consultation with permanent Army and defence personnel, at the end of which some of the discussion papers were shredded. These were discussion papers aimed primarily at giving Australia a long term strategic goal. What happened to them? They were shredded. There was no public discussion in those days about where Australia was heading in terms of its defence requirements. Did I hear a word at all from any of the backbenchers in the Liberal Government who were present at the time that occurred?</PARA>
<PARA> I can assure the Opposition that the idea of a full public, open debate is something that is new in the history of Australian defence requirements in this country. For all the noise that Senator MacGibbon is making on the other side, he is nodding his head, because he knows that that is the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a threat from Senator MacGibbon. He is a man who is obsessed with toys for the boys, who gets excited when he sees rockets and other things going up into the air. He decided to threaten me. This is typical of the approach that he has taken over the years that I have seen him on Estimates committees, particularly when he is talking about defence. He talks about toys for the boys. Boy, he was a sucker whenever those boys from the Royal Australian Navy, the Army and the Royal Australian Air Force put their Christmas card requests to him. Senator MacGibbon was the one who always nodded his head because he was infatuated with the toys that they used to talk about. That is not the only thing that defence is about. Defence is about having long term goals, restructuring to fit in with those goals and making sure that procurement policies are rationally based upon those goals. Senator MacGibbon would not even understand that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Getting down to the question of the debate that Minister Beazley began, as we all know, there have been various reports-reports that have been made public by this Government. They have not been shredded and put in the wastepaper bin at Russell Hill but made public so that everyone who had something to contribute in this area was able to do so. We have never hidden from the fact that there ought to be a public debate about where defence is going in this country. Let us look at the Cross report on the capabilities of the Australian Defence Force and at the report of the Dibb Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities. The former deputy director of the Joint Intelligence Organisation, Paul Dibb, was asked to look at the fundamental areas of strategic appreciation, threat assessment and force structure priorities. That report was a watershed in the setting of goals for defence policy in this country. The Government did not agree with all that Paul Dibb put down. The Government was determined that there should be a debate about the issues that he raised. As we all know, at least Paul Dibb put the settings in place so that the debate could not take place in quiet rooms around the Senate or at Russell Hill but could help us set goals for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> As we all know, the 1987 White Paper not only laid down the goals and the structures that should apply in the future but also referred at length to the new role that the reserves should play. Senator Baume is acutely aware of that. I understand that he was a member of the reserves at one time. He is aware of the role that the reserves played in the past. In many cases, it was a rather insignificant role. He is well aware of the morale problems that occurred when the reserve forces were not taken seriously in certain areas. As I understand it, he has talked to a sufficient number of present reservists, who have told him that the integration of the reserves into the total defence structure of Australia is something that they support. Am I not correct?</PARA>

<PARA> Let us have a look at some of the actions that this Government took when it came to power. First of all, there was the new submarine project, which the recently sacked Opposition defence spokesman, Mr Peter White, wanted to scrap. That is a very important part in the defence of Australia, given our particular and peculiar geostrategic position. Other examples are the new Navy frigate program; the expanding Jindalee over the horizon radar, begun by the Whitlam Government; the airborne early warning; the Exercise Kangaroo 89, despite the Opposition's view that that should not have gone ahead. I also raise a question which might interest Senator Tambling: the studies of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) development priorities, which brought about the proposed move of an Army brigade to the Northern Territory. As Senator Tambling knows, it has been announced that 2 Cavalry Regiment is to move north. He is also very aware that the spokesman for the Opposition at the time, Peter White, opposed that idea, in addition to Kangaroo 89. Senator Tambling agrees with the view that I am putting today: that the Opposition spokesman of that period was totally out of touch with the real defence requirements of Australia. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JE4">Senator AULICH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tambling said so at the time and he has been honest enough today to reaffirm the view that the former Opposition spokesman, the potential Minister for Defence in this country, was totally off beam in terms of his attitude towards this very important part of the restructuring of the Australian defence forces.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Above all else, this Government has brought a sense of sanity to the overall view about defence in this country. We have said that the defence of Australia is not about leaving a few bureaucrats and the armed forces simply to make their bids to this Parliament but that it has to be based upon a proper debate about where we are going, what our potential threats are and how we restructure ourselves to meet them. It is not a question of toys for the boys-buying the best equipment that may not be appropriate for the task it is to be used for by the Australian defence forces. The defence of Australia involves taking a calm and rational approach. It is not about being a younger child helping Daddy in the United States of America or the United Kingdom in forward defence operations, either in Vietnam or elsewhere. It is about looking first and foremost at the defence of Australia and saying, `What is the most logical way to defend Australia?', not `How do we hide under the umbrella of some ally?'. The relationship with our allies and how we integrate with their armed forces is an important part of our defence but it is not the most important part. The most important part of any long term defence strategy is to set goals for the defence of Australia first and foremost, and setting them based upon a realistic appreciation of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the reserves themselves, there have been studies, as honourable senators know, of the Reserve Force in this country. The Defence White Paper says:</PARA>
<PARA> Our requirements for land warfare cannot be achieved without extensive Reserve participation. Accordingly, the Army Reserve structure is being reviewed and changes will be implemented progressively. Since World War Two the Reserve has provided the expansion base for the Army. It will now-</PARA>
<PARA>and this is the important point-</PARA>
<PARA>in addition, be required to contribute to operations which might arise in the shorter term as part of the total Army, at a level commensurate with achievable degrees of training and readiness. </PARA>
<PARA>Implementation of this policy-and remember this is the first time we have had a clear policy on this issue in something like 20 years-has led to the addition of a significant Reserve component to 6 Brigade. Previously an all-Regular formation, 6 Brigade is acquiring 49 Battalion of the Royal Queensland Regiment to give it its third infantry battalion. The second move was to add to headquarters of 1 Division-the main Regular formation-a Reserve-manned rear divisional signals squadron. The third move was to give headquarters of 1 Division a divisional headquarters defence company from the Reserve formation 2nd Division. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that in 1978 the Fraser Government's back bench committee on foreign affairs and defence proposed legislation to facilitate the call-out of the reserves in situations short of a formal declaration of war or a defence emergency. The Fraser Government took no action on that recommendation. It was left to the Hawke Labor Government to act on it. Now, as we all know, practical reserves call-out legislation is in place. Not one honourable senator on the other side of the chamber would disagree that the Hawke Government finally carried out that very sensible recommendation of the Fraser Government back bench committee on defence. It is again a situation in which, on policy matters, the Liberal Party of Australia has shown itself to be totally inadequate and unable to listen to those people who gave time, effort and thought to the question of the defence of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also identified an important role for the Reserve forces in the protection of vital installations and key points. This will be done through the creation of four brigade groups from Reserve units in north Queensland, Victoria, Western Australia, and South Australia and Tasmania. The effectiveness of the Government's determination to give the reserves a meaningful role to play is strongly demonstrated by Exercise Diamond Dollar held in 1987. General Jeffrey, who was then commander of 1 Division, said that, of the 7,000 troops who took part in that exercise, 1,000 were reservists, including an infantry battalion, a transport squadron, an armoured personnel carrier squadron, an engineer squadron, military police, a field hospital and individual support staff-in other words, pretty well the full spectrum. General Jeffrey summed up the Reserve input into that exercise. I think it is particularly important to quote him because General Jeffrey can give us here in the Senate today, through this quotation, an idea of exactly what the Government has planned for the reserves in terms of integration into the defence forces and what has been achieved so far by way of their cooperation and activity in that area. In the Australian of 7 October 1988 he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Reserve performed magnificently and the exercise simply would not have happened without their contribution. </PARA>
<PARA>Comments like this, rather than the whines from the negative Opposition, are the true measure of the success of the Government's policies with respect to the Reserve forces. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Baume, again because of his experience in this area, has rightly raised the question of the morale of the reservists. I have talked about how important it is that they be integrated into the permanent defence forces so that they have a place in the sun and their contribution is one in which they are regarded not just as boys on holidays but as people who have a very important role to play in the defence of Australia. We have talked about the appropriate legislation to allow us to call out reservists in situations short of total emergency or war. This Government has never put aside or discounted the role of the reservists. We know that their role is very important, particularly in any full scale war or emergency. But their role must be seen as one shared with the permanent defence forces. This Government is on record for, first of all, creating a defence debate; secondly, creating structures which are appropriate to the defence of this country; thirdly, creating strategies which are relevant to this country; and, fourthly, bringing together the reservists and the Army. If for nothing else, this Government can be applauded for moving in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA> If, as I indicated before, people like Senator MacGibbon think that the defence of Australia is all about buying toys-buying Leopard tanks, for example, which look wonderful on paper but are inappropriate for the defence of Australia-if he believes that that is appropriate, let him say so. </PARA>

<PARA> If nothing else, firstly, we have created that debate, secondly, we have created a sense of long term strategy and, thirdly, we have integrated the system in this country in a way which I believe will bear fruit in the future. Nothing is perfect. There are questions of morale that have to be addressed. Some of them are wider questions such as sociological questions. They apply also to the permanent defence forces. What does one do, for example, with Defence Force personnel when one is asked to send them, to make them really relevant, to places like Tindal? What does one do with their families? How does one cope, for example, with wives who want to work and who do not want to follow the traditional Army pattern of moving from town to town and from place to place? How does one make those decisions without affecting morale? These questions apply not only to reservists but also to the permanent defence forces as well. </PARA>
<PARA> This Parliament ought to look at the whole question of morale in a sympathetic and rational way and not just debate the issue of the reservists. The reservists are only part of the total picture of the defence forces of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Australian Democrats I enthusiastically support this urgency motion moved by Senator Peter Baume. It is with great pride that I look back 32 years to the beginning of my own 10 years in the Army Reserve. It was at that time, on day one, that I first met Peter Baume. I am proud of the fact that I spent 10 years in the Army Reserve although I did not spend all of those 10 years as an infantry officer. I am moved today to recall that it was in that context that Peter and I first met. It is from that that we probably share the sense of urgency about the issue that he has brought before the Senate today. After 10 years in the Army Reserve I went on to serve 10 years in the Regular Army. I specialised in training systems. Therefore I rise today to speak with enthusiasm and conviction about the predicament in which the Australian Defence Force finds itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before moving on to discuss this predicament I would like to make reference very briefly to the matter that Senator Dunn raised in her previous explanation. Yesterday she was confused about my role. She was rather offended at the fact that she was projected onto the Beecroft Peninsula as the resister to the military exercise. Perhaps I can explain my presence there. Not only am I committed to the Army and to the services but I am also committed to the environment. I am also committed to the civil and spiritual liberties of the Australian Aborigines. I found myself in a dilemma-a trilemma, if you like-concerning the circumstances that were about to take place on the Beecroft Peninsula. As a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade I am frankly puzzled about how the Australian Government can create a set of circumstances where a military exercise will be involved in pounding the peninsula, a place which holds 200 sacred Aboriginal sites and which has been declared a part of our National Estate. </PARA>
<PARA> I make that observation and explanation in passing because I would like to emphasise in contributing on behalf of the Australian Democrats to this debate that we as a party are very pro-defence. We believe in a strong, flexible and competent Defence Force. We demand that it be a neutral defence force in terms of its alignment and that it be essentially exactly that, a defence force. It must be potent, it must be flexible and it must be competent. By virtue of those requirements it will always be built, as historically it has always been, upon the foundation of a militia or an army reserve. It goes without saying that in a nation of 16 million people-Australia has the fifth largest national land mass on earth-we must be very creative and flexible in our thinking about how we structure our Defence Force. It will inevitably be dependent upon a militia. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Peter Baume has very adequately cited the historical evidence for that. In a briefing to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Subcommittee the other day, a civilian expert, Dr Ross Babbage, drew an interesting comparison. He said that we have moved forward in the last 50 or 60 years from the days when we could see a militia being made up of the courageous and willing who would mount their own horses, bring their own rifles, march to an assembly point and within weeks be part of an effective fighting force. Looking back on the history of the Anzacs, that force was transhipped across the world and fought with gallantry, extraordinary courage and great effect. The days of that militia are long since gone. The thinking of governments about our army reserve and our citizens' military forces unfortunately is still there. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats therefore put out the plea for an entirely new era, an entirely new age of the Army Reserve. We believe in a strong army reserve. We believe that it must be much bigger than it is now, that it must be much better equipped than it is now. But if it is to justify the expenditure for that, it must be much more flexible and it must be confronted with a diversity of roles which warrant the expenditure to create that sort of civil and military Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe we have reached a stage where we require-I have said it over and over again in this chamber-profound lateral thinking about how we defend ourselves. I have in my hand a paper entitled Defence in the 90s: The challenge of Change, which was a paper presented at the Australian Defence Force Academy in March of this year by Mr George Younger, MP, who is the British Secretary of State for Defence. In addressing the challenges of defence in the 1990s and into the twenty-first century he emphasised the need for flexibility and lateral thinking. The Australian Democrats contend that we are locked into conventional models of thinking about our defence. They will not serve us any longer. We spend $7.6 billion a year on a defence force which at this moment sadly is extremely demoralised, which is largely impotent and which by its own admission could not render the service to which it may be called. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not make those comments lightly. I am not the only one who has advanced those arguments in this chamber. Indeed inherent in the Cross report entitled Personnel Wastage in the Australian Defence Force tabled in this Parliament a matter of a few mere months ago is the suggestion-it is not exactly overt but it is a covert suggestion-that our defence forces are impotent. They are impotent sadly because people are not committed to serve in them for all sorts of good reasons. I will cite just a couple of paragraphs from this vitally important report. I am reading from the introductory segment which says:</PARA>
<PARA>The extent and magnitude of wastage . . . in some of those areas-</PARA>
<PARA>the report has cited some of the areas of wastage-</PARA>
<PARA>is such that it will adversely affect the ADF for at least the next decade. It also shows that retention strategies must be directed at both the needs of the broader ADF and those of specific specialist groups within the Force. </PARA>
<PARA>It cites the effects of this wastage as being:</PARA>
<PARA> a. decreased organisational health;</PARA>
<PARA> b. dilution of experience;</PARA>
<PARA> c. increased costs;</PARA>
<PARA> d. training deficiencies;</PARA>
<PARA> e. diversion of manpower;</PARA>
<PARA> f. reactive personnel management; and</PARA>
<PARA> g. loss of morale. </PARA>
<PARA>It says:</PARA>
<PARA>In sum the effects of wastage adumbrated above amount to a loss of operational capability. It is manifestly obvious that the prevailing excessive level of personnel wastage is damaging the organisational health of the ADF. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on in a volume of hundreds of pages to substantiate those generalisations. The management of the Defence Force had been equally substantially documented in a report entitled The Management of Australia's Defences 12 months earlier, in November 1987. I have cited the opinion of some academic experts. I referred earlier to the eminent Dr Ross Babbage from the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre of the Australian National University. In his book Rethinking Australia's Defence, which was written in 1980, he cited the problem of the Reserve as fundamental to the rethinking of Australia's Defence. He cited this at the beginning of the era to which Senator Aulich has referred. Senator Aulich has said that this has been a period of rethinking for this Government, but it has not adequately addressed the fundamental requirement that Dr Babbage cited nine years ago. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>We have seen a progressive deterioration in . . . (the) reserve component to its present state, which, despite the best efforts of its members, must be regarded as unsatisfactory and in urgent need of reorganization and rehabilitation. </PARA>
<PARA>He was quoting the Millar Committee of Inquiry into the Citizen Military Forces in his book in 1980. Those words are just as true today as they were then. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government may have begun the process, but it certainly has not resolved the problem. Brigadier Serong is well known to those who have served in recent years in the Australian Defence Force. I will quote Brigadier Serong's opinion as it was stated in the News Weekly of 15 March 1989:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We do have severe manpower problems, with no sign yet that they are improving. We are undermanned. It is not a matter of trimming the fat now . . . We are cutting into the bone and into the muscle. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that our defences are in crisis. They will have to be resolved by the rebuilding of the Australian Army and military reserve forces. The Beazley model has been predominantly oriented towards equipment and we have procured-these statistics are outstanding-75 FA18 fighters at a cost of $35m each. By the time we pilot them and provide the necessary backup, about 75 times $45m will have been provided to create an air force. The senior officer who commands them says that assuming there is no wastage of pilots it will be nine years before he can put three squadrons in the sky, with inexperienced pilots. That is not good economics. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Aulich is not listening to this. The Australian Democrats believe that the frigate concept is ill-conceived and the Royal Australian Navy will proceed to build at least eight, possibly 12 frigates which will just go down the same equipment path which is not directed towards the requirements of a newly conceived Australian Defence Force into the twenty-first century. Let me tell Senator Aulich about the superb Jindalee over the horizon radar as he may not know about it. We all acknowledge the fact that it is a superb Australian innovation. When it is in place 10 years from now the manning formula indicates that it will be manned between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. It will be a part time radar system, it will have the most sophisticated equipment that one could conceive, and the enemy will know that it is manned between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA> The realities are that the Beazley approach to defence in this country has failed; it has left us in crisis. The problem can be resolved only by profound lateral thinking about the structure of our Defence Force. That structure must be based upon a viable Army Reserve and not a Dad's Army-the image that most Australians used to laugh at and chortle over on the television. It must be a highly equipped, highly trained, sophisticated force commanded by itself. Senator Peter Baume is quite right: it is an absolute offence to the Army Reserve to say that it is not capable of training and commanding itself at the highest level. History proves that it has been and it will be again. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government must seriously acknowledge the fact that our defences are in crisis. The expenditure of $7.6 billion a year, when we have funded our bushfire brigades, coastal and surveillance patrols and emergency services by selling lamingtons on street corners, is just absolutely irrational. Senator Aulich claims that this is the Government of rethinking. It should do some lateral rethinking; it is thinking within traditional models. It should become imaginative and address itself to some truly profound new thinking about how we organise our defence forces around a revitalised Army Reserve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very interesting topic to be debating now, particularly in the light of the review which is coming up as part of the defence subcommittee's program for this year, which is a total review of the reserve structure in Australia. There are two problem areas which we need to look at here. The first is the insistence of the military and their conservative political allies on maintaining the myth of the need for a large, full time, fully equipped professional military force in this country despite the absence of a military threat in the foreseeable future. Secondly, there is the refusal of this same unholy alliance to follow the example of other countries which are prepared to adapt their military force structures to peacetime and the need to cut costs for economic reasons. I totally endorse the remarks that have been made by Senator McLean on the need for lateral thinking. We do need a creative and new approach. The old model will not serve for the Australian defence forces any longer because it is an old model trying to deal with new problems. The wastage rate from the armed services is testimony to this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that this country cannot afford an expensive military equipment program, decent support for personnel in the Australian Defence Force (ADF) and an adequate reserve. At the moment the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) is intent on building up the military equipment side of the armed services to the detriment of the personnel and, I would say, to the detriment of the effectiveness of the whole of the ADF because the reserves are not being utilised as much as they should be. The Government needs to take a total new look at the question of reserves as a matter of efficiency in the ADF. </PARA>
<PARA> Even if we could afford to service the three areas that I have mentioned-the equipment program, decent support and maintenance for the personnel, and an adequate reserve-the result would be that our neighbours would be asking themselves why Australia needed to be embarking on this extensive military build-up when there were no threats in the region. Indeed, the emphasis should be on developing non-military security such as trade, common security programs and promoting regional understanding. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the feeling in the majority of the Australian community that we need some kind of military defence, the obvious way forward is to look at what other countries are doing in the way of building up the reserve, and following their example where it is relevant to the Australian geostrategic situation. Countries we might look to for this kind of lead include the United States, Switzerland and West Germany. They are countries which put a lot more emphasis on their reserves at the moment and have many more part time personnel in their armed services than we do in the ADF. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem with Senator Peter Baume's motion is that I am not sure that the Opposition wants to build up the Reserve in addition to its desire to build up the ADF and to purchase all manner of highly sophisticated military equipment from overseas, such as nuclear submarines and possibly aircraft carriers. This is the dilemma. The Opposition never says where the extra money will come from for the increased expenditure in defence. I noticed with Senator Baume speaking that we do not have the usual defence spokespersons in this chamber having a go on this subject. It is something that I have asked before and have never got an answer from the Opposition. It cannot have it both ways. In peacetime Australia the population will not allow for a further increase in defence expenditure, so we have to look at either spending the money on personnel, which I believe would be better spent building up the reserves rather than building up the full time professional service people. It is patently obvious that that model is not working at the moment. We cannot have the military equipment and the personnel side being served with the current expenditure on defence. Somebody from the Opposition has to ask, `Where are the changes in emphasis going to occur? What is going to be the priority for defence expenditure?'. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem we are facing is not confined to the Australian military structure. In a number of advanced Western countries the cost of full time manpower-or more correctly, people power, if we consider the proportion of women now in the military-has risen, putting a heavy squeeze on new capital equipment, the construction of new defence facilities and other national security functions. Increasingly, countries which have spent an enormous amount on military budgets are being asked by their populations why there is all this outlay on military expenditure when there are crucial social security needs within their own countries, such as housing. The same could be said in Australia. Internationally, people are questioning the result of large outlays on military expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> As President Eisenhower said, every new weapon that is tested and every new missile that is launched is a theft from the poor and oppressed in the world. We could put an environmental aspect on this as well because we have so many really urgent environmental problems which could well do with the amount of money that is being wasted on the military at the moment. I believe that these particular areas of lateral thinking that we need to explore will come up for discussion in the defence subcommittee. I know that Senator Peter Baume wants to reply so I will not go into that any further now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this afternoon I was speaking about the Bounty (Ships) Bill 1989 and commenting on a company in my State of Tasmania called International Catamarans which has become a world leader in an innovative technology, using twin-hull vessels for ocean going transport. It is making a great contribution to Tasmania by injecting an estimated $35m into the Tasmanian economy. It has something like $50m to $60m worth of forward orders. It also expects to increase Tasmania's current 4 per cent share in the national shipbuilding industry quite considerably.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was interesting to note the very illuminating address that Senator McLean made earlier. I hung upon a particular fact he mentioned. He said that defence in Australia was in a crisis. I do not think anybody on this side of the chamber or anyone in Australia as a whole would disagree that the economy of Australia is in a crisis, particularly with regard to our balance of payments. I believe in this day and age every assistance should be given to industries that are contributing to improving our balance of payments. Our balance of payments situation is helped immeasurably by contributions made by companies such as International Catamarans, which is exporting ocean going vessels around the world. All the way up the east coast of Australia in your own State, Madam Acting Deputy President, a considerable number of catamarans are used for the tourist industry that were made under licence as a result of the technology and design that was put together in Tasmania. This very important shipbuilding industry, which unfortunately after the next six years will receive no assistance from the Federal Government by way of bounty, will not receive any further help. Nevertheless, I believe the integrity and the professional way in which it is going about its task will enable it to continue in a very important way by contributing to our balance of payments situation. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be remiss of me not to mention the efforts of the Sea Management Corporation which is based in Launceston and operating as Launceston Marine. It has also been very successful. Recently it obtained a $4.5m tender to undertake work on the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation vessel, the Southern Surveyor. This will involve the provision of new accommodation sections and laboratory and scientific areas on that vessel. Work is expected to be completed by the end of November. Given the significant competition when tendering for that vessel, it speaks very highly of the company's management and shipbuilding ability that it obtained the tender. The Tamar steel boats arm of the Sea Management Corporation is involved in the construction of high quality steel passenger and work vessels of up to 75 metres in length. Currently two 25-metre vessels are also under construction. This company is working towards putting Tasmania on the world shipbuilding map. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will be moving an amendment to this Bill in relation to the registration criteria. Three new modified registration criteria are contained in the legislation. It is the first of those to which the Opposition amendment refers, that is, that 75 per cent of the activities of the applicants for bounties must be devoted to the construction or modification of vessels for which the applicants are seeking bounty entitlements. The second criterion is that the applicant for the bounty must at all times employ 40 persons in ship modifications or constructions. The third criterion is that applicants must be prepared to submit a business plan. Existing requirements, including those which require applicants to be financially secure, to have access to waterfront premises and to be prepared to employ one apprentice for every eight tradespersons, will apply. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear to the Opposition that the first criterion-that 75 per cent of the activities of applicants for the bounty must be devoted to the construction or modification of vessels-is the one that may result in a significant level of bureaucratic interference. We will have a situation in which it will be the bureaucrats who decide which companies are able to build ships more effectively than others. I would not like to see a successful enterprise such as the one I mentioned earlier, International Catamarans, overregulated and interfered with by too much bureaucratic control. That is one of the main reasons the Opposition will be moving this amendment. We want to ensure that the Bill does not discourage potentially efficient producers, to the cost of the industry. Although the industry is small, it is one that has great potential to produce those very important export dollars that we strive for these days. The bounty legislation we are debating today is designed to assist the shipbuilding industry over the ensuing years. It seems to me that the implementation of those restrictive criteria would have unfortunately the opposite effect to what should be desired by this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Amendment Bill 1989, the purpose of which is to increase the levy paid per export tonne of uranium concentrates from Australia. The duty initially stood at 11c per kilogram and has applied since the first production and export from the Ranger uranium mine, which is a subsidiary of Energy Resources of Australia. The levy was paid initially in the financial year 1981-82. Since that time, presumably in line with the Government's philosophy of user pays-at least to the extent of 75 per cent-the levy increased to 80c per kilogram in 1986; rose to $1.02 in 1987; rose to $1.15 from July 1988; and is to rise to $1.30 from July 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This levy, which has been set to pay for the responsibilities of the Office of the Supervising Scientist (OSS), is not uniform amongst all uranium producers. It is paid by the Nabarlek operation, which for the time being has almost ceased production. At the moment it is putting what one would describe loosely as only very low grade gravel through its plant, simply to maintain itself, with the Government's encouragement, as the third mine in the three-mine policy. The levy is paid by the Ranger uranium mine. It is not paid by Western Mining Corporation Ltd's Olympic Dam project; nor by anybody else who is exploring for uranium in the Rudall River area of Western Australia, for example; nor by BHP Gold Mines Ltd, which is exploring in the conservation zone of the Kakadu-Alligator Rivers Region-allegedly for gold, but no doubt other significant minerals have been intersected. </PARA>
<PARA> The object of the legislation is primarily to provide funding for the Office of the Supervising Scientist, whose responsibilities until now have been for monitoring of the South Alligator River region. They have now been extended to the Coronation Hill area. The principal responsibilities are found in the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Act, under section 5. The functions of the OSS are to develop appropriate research programs relating to mining activities; to coordinate and supervise those research programs; devise and develop standards, practices and procedures in relation to mining operations for the protection of the environment; to devise and develop measures for the protection and restoration of the environment from the effects of mining; to coordinate and supervise implementation of legislative requirements relating to the protection of the environment; to advise the Minister with respect to the duties outlined above; to perform other functions that may be prescribed; and to do anything incidental or conducive to the performance of the foregoing functions. </PARA>
<PARA> In tandem with section 5, the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Act 1978 also establishes two associated bodies-the Co-ordinating Committee for the Alligator Rivers Region, which the Supervising Scientist chairs, and the Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute, which he manages. The research function is by far the largest activity of the OSS and is centred around the work of the Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute. </PARA>
<PARA> The Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Act defines some of the functions of the Co-ordinating Committee as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to consider programs for research into, and programs for the collection and assessment of information relating to, the effects on the environment in the Alligator Rivers Region of uranium mining operations in the Region;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to keep under review programs, and the carrying out of programs, referred to in paragraph (a);</PARA>
<PARA> (c) to make recommendations to the Supervising Scientist with respect to programs referred to in paragraph (a);</PARA>
<PARA> (d) to consider, and keep under review-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) standards, practices and procedures in relation to uranium mining operations in the Region for the protection of, or in so far as those standards, practices and procedures affect, the environment in the Region; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) measures for the protection and restoration of the environment in the Region from the effects of uranium mining operations in the Region;</PARA>
<PARA>The Office of the Supervising Scientist has been subject to more than one audit of its effectiveness. It has been subject to some criticism by the coalition parties and to severe criticism by the Ranger uranium mine, which made the point that more than $40m of taxpayers' funds has so far been raised by way of levy and spent by the Office of the Supervising Scientist. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I regret that I am unable to share Senator Dunn's enthusiasm because, sadly but accurately, I have a contrary view. The Office of the Supervising Scientist was set up, as a result of Commissioner Fox's Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry, to have more limited terms of reference and scope than those into which inevitably, like all such instrumentalities, it has expanded. The staff numbers reached 75 in 1985 and they have been maintained at around that level. The 1988-89 budget reached a new high of $6,576,000. Energy Resources of Australia says-I cannot be certain that the figures are accurate, but I have no reason to believe they are not because they have not been contradicted by either the Government or the Supervising Scientist-that the average annual cost per employee in the OSS is approximately 50 per cent higher than the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, 20 per cent higher than the Natural Resource Division of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and 28 per cent higher than the Alligator Rivers region unit-the Northern Territory uranium unit. Ranger tells us that in the 10 years from 1978 to 1988, OSS research work has produced no practical procedures or standards which Ranger can use to help protect the environment. We are also told that, on average, roughly $4m a year is being spent on research but that there is almost nothing of real practical value for protecting the environment from the results of uranium mining.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If honourable senators turn to table 2 of the document which sets out the cost of operations of the Office of the Supervising Scientist, they will note, for instance, that, in 1986-87-and this is the latest figure I have been able to find-$292,994 was spent on travel. Debate continues in respect of the location of the OSS. The Supervising Scientist has made it quite clear that he has no intention of leaving Sydney, that he is cosy and comfortable in that fine capital and that his skirmishes past the perimeter of the metropolitan area will consist of infrequent flights to Jabiru to monitor the activities of the organisation. It seems to me bizarre, by any measure, that an organisation which is set up essentially to monitor the effects of Ranger's mining is based in Sydney. Only by the most bizarre logic can one conclude that there is some rational reason for that. But, by normal logic, it has no justification. That has caused some concern and anxiety because it means that funds are being wasted. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter which is of concern to us is that the Office of the Supervising Scientist is funded by Energy Resources of Australia and not by the operations at Olympic Dam and, more particularly, not by the Coronation Hill joint venture. While the responsibilities of the Office of the Supervising Scientist have now been extended into the conservation zone in which the Coronation Hill project is situated and which is now attracting 10 per cent of the budget of the Office of the Supervising Scientist, no funding has been received from the joint venture partners in an operation which, if my memory serves me correctly, so far has identifiable resources valued at $500m. It would seem not unreasonable that if that company is to be visited by the Office of the Supervising Scientist, it should suffer uniformly the pain of having to pay for this burgeoning organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> One might ask why the Office of the Supervising Scientist would have responsibilities for the South Alligator River region but not Olympic Dam in the north of South Australia. I am sure that Senator Irina Dunn will be able to expound the virtues, the values, and the intrinsic qualities of the environment upon which the Olympic Dam mine has been built. She will, no doubt, tell us how that fragile environment has been damaged and scoured and scarred irreparably. Yet, it has not been found necessary to have the Supervising Scientist and his troop of 75 marchers monitor the environment in that region. The truth of the matter is that that job is done by two officers of the South Australian Department of Public Health at a very modest cost. I have not yet heard any suggestion that the monitoring has been done in an inadequate, unsophisticated or inefficient way. </PARA>
<PARA> It begs the question: why do we need 75 people, spending $6.6m a year, to tell us that the muzzles north and south of the Ranger uranium mine have the same levels of radium concentration? However, that is one of the wonders which, no doubt, will be explained to me by Senator Irina Dunn when she rises to give support to this wasteful amount of money. One can conclude that while we, on this side of the chamber, support the ongoing and dedicated surveillance, supervision and monitoring of the effects of uranium mining in the Kakadu region not only upon the environment but also upon man, we believe that it is being done in a very slovenly and inefficient way. I suppose if Senator Button were able to say what he honestly believes, he would find himself subconsciously nodding in agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I leave this area of the debate, I refer to the fact that the Office of the Supervising Scientist, notwithstanding the belief of some, does not have a role in terms of physically monitoring, or supervising the monitoring, of the various tests that are done in respect of the Ranger uranium mine. That is done by the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy. Its surveillance and check monitoring has, to my knowledge, not been subject to criticism. While this work has been subject to very considerable scrutiny by way of unnecessary duplication by the Office of the Supervising Scientist, it has been found to be, without exception, thoroughly effective. It seems to me that there is a great deal of unnecessary duplication taking place which could well be done away with. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to raise the general question of uranium mining in Australia. The tragedy is that we have this bizarre three-mine policy that even members of the loony Left, in their rational moments, understand not to have any basis of logic. That policy establishes a holding position to prevent the exploration and exploitation of any further uranium regions in Australia. That is the perimeter fence for them. The Government, as with coastal shipping and waterfront reform and, notwithstanding the pleadings of Senator Button, micro-economic reform in respect of Qantas Airways Ltd, does nothing. It is thoroughly paralysed. A considerable burden has been placed on every single taxpayer in Australia because this Government is straitjacketed in terms of its decision-making on uranium mining in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Graham Richardson, as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources which inquired into the resource potential of the Kakadu National Park, initially had the enlightened view that further exploitation, however sensitive the environment, was the appropriate way to go. However, Senator Richardson was confronted with some polls that showed that the Labor vote was haemorrhaging to the Australian Democrats and other funny little groups that attract the fringes of normal logical thinking. So suddenly overnight he converted to a born again greenie-not by logic, not by emotion, not by persuasion, simply by the polls. Notwithstanding that, when it came-as is now the case-to internal internecine debates within the Australian Labor Party in these matters, Senator Richardson is one of those who pragmatically say that the three-mine system is based on absolutely no logic, only political expediency. I quote him:</PARA>
<PARA> The real policy of the Labor movement has been one of political expediency, of public disapproval but the private approval of uranium mining. </PARA>
<PARA>I understand that he is joined by others in that view. In the meantime he is between a rock and a hard place in being able to persuade those in his Party that uranium mining has some virtue. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that Senator Cook, in answer to a question earlier, told us that we did not need any further production in Australia because spot prices are where they are and that the world's needs would be satisfied by buying spot. For goodness sake! Of course that is totally untrue. We only have to look at our levels of production and how they have grown in recent years compared to those of Canada for instance. Australia has about one-third of the world's low cost uranium reserve and we have one-tenth of the world market. By contrast, Canada has one-tenth of the world supply of low grade uranium and it has 33 per cent of the world market. That is a total reversal of the Australian statistics. That represents about $600m in trade annually. Just on those figures alone, we are losing $600m a year in trade. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Labor Party are wringing their hands and Bob Hawke is bursting into tears on the radio about the balance of payments in Australia and the effect it is having on the average taxpayer. When there is an opportunity to change that imbalance, what do they do? They retreat into the dens of darkness of their internecine conflicts and hope to struggle through without facing the reality of the light of day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Occasionally the truth, when spoken, does sound terrible, because it is. There is no kind way of putting it. The other reason that Australia is falling far behind in its level of production is the sequential development which took place in Australia's resources. We have a Government that thinks it knows better than the market place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Between 1975 and 1987 Canada's production rose from 3,500 tonnes to about 12,600 tonnes. In the last year or two our production has gone from about 3,500 tonnes to, I think, 4,000 tonnes. There is virtually no movement. Our production is absolutely static. In part, that is caused by this absurd proposition that we have a floor price. We keep pitching the floor price at a level that makes our uranium unattractive in the free market of the world. So while Canada, for instance, is able to write long term contracts, we are not because we want more for our uranium, but it stays in the ground. What absolutely absurd logic! I have no doubt that in terms of markets that has cost us dearly. </PARA>
<PARA> We have Senator Cook telling us that presently there is an oversupply. There was, and there still is, an overhang in the market, as Senator Button would know, but the reasons are historic; they are well known. We know that what happened in the 1970s led to oversupply in the early 1980s. We know that there were those oil price shocks. We know that there was a world recession. We know that, as a result of the oil price shocks, conservation policies were put into place in most Western world countries. So demand was reduced and electricity growth very much dwindled. We then had problems in the United States of America. The Three Mile Island incident was blown out of all proportion by the propagandists of this world. That, in part, led to half the 254 projects for nuclear reactors, which would have come on stream in the United States, being cancelled before they ever got off the ground. So by the 1980s there was an overhang. At that time demand could have been more than satisfied by the supply. As a result of that overhang, there has since been a closing down of high cost production mines-in my view mines that will not start again. We therefore can take them out of the production equation. Yet we now find that demand is running ahead of supply. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, Senator Cook tells us that we ought to look to spot prices. In answer to a question from I think Senator Parer, Senator Cook told us to look at spot prices to get some understanding of the world market. Senator Cook ought to look past his superficial and glib departmental briefings, ought to look behind the scenes and ask himself why spot prices are where they are and how relevant they are. He would learn that in 1988 spot prices accounted for 9.7 million pounds of U308. That was less than 10 per cent of the reactor requirements of that year. The 1988 spot price market volume was 13 per cent less than it was in 1987 and 41 per cent below that of 1985 volume. </PARA>
<PARA> As we all know, the vast majority of uranium contracts are long term contracts between the utilities and the producers. They are based on cost plus profit-not on an artificial price for the oversupply of unwanted inventories. So spot prices are not relevant to long term projection of prices; nor are they relevant to long-term contracts. Those spot prices should be considered or judged to be a reflection of neither the prices nor the demand we can expect in the 1990s and up to the year 2000. Until the year 2000 the demand is reasonably predictable because the reactors are either in the planning stage or in the construction state. Their timing of coming on stream is predictable and so is their demand. I do not pretend to know what will happen past the year 2000. In some part, it will be influenced by global attitudes towards the environment. Issues such as the greenhouse effect will play a significant part. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that in many respects we will be confronted with the use of either coal or uranium for the generation of electricity. Australia must confront those options, as must every nation of the world. It must be confronted by Australian society in terms of our contribution towards cleansing the environment and in terms of our preparedness to produce a less dirty form of material for the production of electricity. Once we start to confront that issue in a responsible and mature way, we will have to start to make value judgments about the level of our development of the resource and decide whether we are prepared to ship it out and allow somebody else to process it and get the downstream development value or whether we have the courage to have it developed in a very safe and responsible way in Australia and, as a result of that, receive the very much added benefits to our balance of trade. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it most regrettable that this Government is not prepared or able to confront the very real issues that bear down on all of us in Australia, and perhaps more on those who might fit loosely into the poorer categories than on others. However, because this Government finds itself straitjacketed by the left wing and some left wing trade unions, it is not able to do that which thinking, sensible members of the Government know it ought to do; that is, to abolish this facade of a three-mine policy; stop Nabarlek putting gravel through its plant to maintain that facade; get on with developing Jabiluka, Yeelirrie, Rudall River and the other operations which are able to go ahead; and allow the market forces to decide whether or not those mines are viable. I have no doubt that our contribution to the supply of uranium around the world will increase very significantly. We will be able to roll back the figures we have before us at present which show Canada to be taking our share of world trade and therefore enhancing its standard of living at a price extracted from the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it sad that we are confronted today with a piece of legislation which does nothing more than extract a levy from a mining company for the purpose of having that company monitored by the Office of the Supervising Scientist when we should be confronting the very real issues of the uranium industry in Australia generally. </PARA>

<PARA> This Bill seeks to increase the duty on exported uranium mined in the Alligator Rivers Region to reflect the Government's position that the costs associated with protecting the environment from the potential adverse effects of uranium mining should be borne, as far as practicable, by the industry carrying out those operations and not by the ordinary taxpayer. It is proposed that the levy be increased from $1.02 per kilo to $1.15 and that this will contribute an additional $0.8m for 1988-89 to the cost of the work of the Office of the Supervising Scientist (OSS), which is presently about 90 per cent funded by Energy Resources of Australia Ltd (ERA). The company claims that the duty is a heavy one which amounts to about 5 per cent of its operating costs. ERA is crying poor in this regard.

I agree, and I agree with the comments in this regard by senators who have already spoken in this debate. There is, I suggest, an obvious way to readdress this iniquity; that is, to require an equivalent tax from the South Australian company. Perhaps, also, if there had been an inquiry into the environmental effects of the Olympic Dam project before it was undertaken by a company which was originally supposed to mine gold and mine uranium only as a by-product, an OSS would have been established for South Australia or the existing responsibilities of the OSS would have been extended to cover that mine.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> We know that the OSS was established in 1978 as a result of a recommendation by Mr Justice Fox, who conducted the extensive inquiry into uranium mining in the Northern Territory called the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry. He recommended the establishment of the OSS to set standards and procedures for environmental protection of the region from the adverse effects of uranium mining, amongst other things. In recent times, relations between the ERA, the company which owns Ranger, and the OSS have become severely strained. The Supervising Scientist, Mr Bob Fry, wrote to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts on 29 April 1988, to offer the following explanation for the cause of this tension. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Relations with Ranger have deteriorated significantly in recent times due, I believe, to a concerted campaign by Energy Resources of Australia to discredit the Office and have it abolished. The immediate cause of this is the raising of the levy on uranium exports from the Region . . . I am increasingly concerned at the reluctance of Ranger to provide detailed information . . . Ranger's growing reluctance to co-operate and keep OSS informed is making it difficult for me to co-ordinate activities and indeed to avoid the very duplication of effort and inefficiencies ERA and Ranger complain about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have read the annual report. Later in the year, ERA began to press for the abolition of the OSS, saying that its functions could be performed just as well by the Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organisation or the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation. It also claimed that the OSS had not fulfilled its role as outlined in the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Act and it charged the OSS with being inefficient and with duplicating the functions of other organisations. An ERA submission claimed that the OSS had expended approximately $40m-as Senator Crichton-Browne pointed out-and had failed to produce any standards, practices and procedures of value to environment protection at Ranger. However, Mr Bob Fry, the Supervising Scientist, has refuted these claims by saying that ERA misunderstood the function of the OSS, which was to research environmental protection rather than to focus on Ranger's mining activity. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The standards we are developing are standards which protect the environment, not standards about the way they should operate their plant, not standards about the way they should lay layers of tailings, not standards even about the way they should apply water to a land application site. </PARA>
<PARA> They are all engineering matters which the mining company either knows how to do, or it doesn't know how to do and has got to find some consultant to tell them . . . </PARA>
<PARA>ERA's major objection to the OSS is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the apparent lack of any priority given to collecting information that might be useful to the mining companies. </PARA>
<PARA>ERA referred specifically to two activities-the spray irrigation of excess water and a new system of dealing with the tailings which did not involve a permanent cover of water in the tailings dam. ERA claimed that spray irrigation was recognised by the Fox Inquiry as a potentially useful water management technique but that the OSS only recently became involved with such a research program. Mr Fry, in reply, said that the Fox Inquiry referred to the evaporation of water from within a tailings dam through a fountain effect, and he pointed out that the irrigation program at Ranger sprayed water on an area adjacent to the mine. </PARA>

Mr Fry also stressed that the OSS research was conducted on the long term environmental effects of such a procedure, whereas ERA seemed to think that the OSS ought to be doing research on short term aspects. The tailings issue illustrates perfectly the different perspectives of ERA and the OSS. Mr Fry asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>What research could an environmental organisation like ours do to develop a pretty well-established engineering method of pouring a slurry out of a pipe?</PARA>
<PARA>ERA had not been forced by the OSS to conduct a $150,000 trial for tailings management, as ERA claimed. This was in fact required by the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy. I would like to put on record part of a letter written by the then Research Director of the Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute, Dr Glen Riley, to the Australian Financial Review on 2 December last year. This letter reveals the hypocrisy of ERA's recent complaints. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> ERA claims the research carried out by the Office of the Supervising Scientist (the `Commonwealth environmental watch-dog') to be irrelevant and too expensive, anyway. However, the costs of the OSS remain (after inflation) within the band foreshadowed in 1977 and accepted by government and industry at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Ranger, ERA's operating company, assisted in the formulation of the research program of this office and has for years served on the Co-ordinating Committee for the Alligator Rivers Region, one of whose functions is to assess research as it relates to the environmental effects of uranium mining. Never, during this time, has Ranger chosen to recommend a change in this research strategy that is being followed. This continuing implicit endorsement of the OSS research program confirms Ranger's opinion voiced to ASTEC (Australian Science and Technology Council) during an earlier review of the relevance and quality of OSS research programs. On that occasion Ranger said:</PARA>
<PARA> `It is vitally important . . . that the Office of the Supervising Scientist is allowed to continue in its present role and that it is afforded sufficient funds to maintain and improve its scientific status so that it can carry out its designated functions effectively.'</PARA>

<PARA> At that time Ranger appeared to recognise that this research role of the OSS was to study potential threats to the environment associated with mining activities and how these risks might be mitigated. It is not, nor should it be, the primary focus of OSS research to develop technical or engineering solutions to operational problems confronting Ranger. The OSS was set up to satisfy community concerns, not the pragmatic needs of the mining industry, although it would be short-sighted of the industry not to see that it too is a beneficiary of such research. </PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear to me that the OSS has a unique function and that that function ought to be preserved and strengthened in view of Australia's international obligations to protect the World Heritage area which completely surrounds the mine. This is a fact that Senator Crichton-Browne does not seem to recognise. After all, Olympic Dam is not surrounded by a World Heritage area. Even with the efforts of the OSS over the last decade to protect the environment, there have been potentially serious accidents. One last year involved the accidental dumping of up to 448,000 tonnes of radioactive low-grade ore onto the waste rock dump, which contains a much lower level of uranium. Water running off from the waste rock dump is generally collected in retention pond 4 (RP4) for release, while water run-off from the low-grade ore dump is collected in retention pond 2.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable senator is foolish enough to do that, as the Northern Territory Minister for Mines and Energy did-it was sufficient to provoke a ludicrous cartoon which Senator Tambling distributed in the Senate this morning-he is welcome to it. I cannot guarantee the effects. Perhaps they are already visible. The low-grade ore was dumped onto the waste rock dump when the discriminator equipment failed in May of last year. The fact that it was not discovered until November by the company's own health and safety officers, does not give one confidence in the ability of the company to monitor its own operations adequately. It was fortunate that the mistake occurred during the dry season, for otherwise the radioactive material would certainly have been washed into RP4 for release into the Magela Creek system, which is a major tributary of the East Alligator River. When I visited Ranger earlier this year the Manager told me that a crocodile lived in RP4. That may well be so, but it is not necessarily proof of the safety of the water in that pond. One would need to test the full range of aquatic organisms within the pond, particularly those which are sensitive to radioactive elements, to gauge the deeper and long term effects of the water on aquatic ecosystems.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3K4">Senator DUNN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The OSS has done it and found that organisms, and particularly fish, have died. In particular, the reproductive success of sensitive aquatic fauna is an important indicator of the toxicity of the water in the retention ponds. The accident on the waste rock dump was the subject of an internal memo written by Dr Glen Riley to the OSS last year. In relation to this mater he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I regard this situation as the most serious deficiency shown by Ranger in the long series of malfunctions and operational shortcomings since the mine opened. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than achieve better (or more sure) environmental control as they gain more experience, Ranger are moving the operation into a more hazardous situation. </PARA>
<PARA>Although a spokesman for the Northern Territory Minister for Mines and Energy, Mr Coulter, confirmed that the Northern Territory Government had considered prosecuting ERA over the incident, it decided against it on the grounds that the breach was accidental. He said that the incident was `very small beer'. I say that it could have been much bigger beer if the incident had taken place during the wet. There is a major disagreement between Ranger and OSS in relation to the release of water into Magela Creek from RP4. Ranger has built a spillway and merely wants the water to spill over, every time the creek reaches a certain level, into the beautiful Jalkmara Billabong which, in turn, flows into Magela Creek. The OSS wants the water to be pumped directly from RP4 to Magela Creek so that the levels of dilution can be more strictly controlled. When I talked to the General Manager of Ranger in February, he said that the spillway allowed the naturally toxic water from RP4 to collect in Jalkmara Billabong in a way which simulated the natural environment of the area. Now it is true that the waters of the area are of higher toxicity than elsewhere as a result of formic acid and other natural processes. However, the Ranger General Manager also said to me that since Jalkmara Billabong is on the site of the second ore body, it did not really matter what happened to it in the interim. I think that is a fairly careless attitude towards the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason that the OSS is opposed to the release of water into the Jalkmara Billabong is that it could cause a backflow along the Jalkmara Billabong which would collect for a much longer period than normal. When I put it to Bob Cleary, the General Manager, he said that it would not matter if the toxic water was held there since it simply simulates the natural environment of the billabong and that the vegetation would be able to remove the toxic material by oxidation, sedimentation or osmosis, or one of a number of other natural processes. When I asked him for evidence of the research that had been done on this, the reply was totally unsatisfactory. It was clearly a rule of thumb assessment and no scientific work had been done on it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have a science degree but I have co-authored a book which won a scientific award. Because the OSS lacks the powers to compel the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy to follow its recommendations, it has bent over backwards to cooperate with the company. One of the examples of such cooperation occurred recently when Ranger proposed to the OSS that it should get what Ranger called an arbitrator to assess two separate analyses that had been done by Ranger and the OSS on what constitutes a one in 10-year rainfall, that is, the conditions under which water from RP2, the restricted release zone, could be released into the surrounding water system through Magela Creek. There is a fundamental difference between the two models proposed by Ranger and by the OSS. Ranger wants to be able to release water from RP2 every time it reaches a certain level in the pond. The OSS wants the release to be made on a measure of local rainfall and claims that Ranger has not allowed for adequate storage in the retention pond. If this fact were recognised, Ranger would be forced to accept the inconvenience and the cost of deepening the pond or preparing another pond, or storing that toxic water at the bottom of the mine pit and facing the inconvenience of not being able to mine the bottom of the pit for the duration of the wet season. Then during the dry season Ranger would have the option of pumping that water back into RP2 or back into the tailings dam, which would then be semi-dry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The OSS disputed many of the findings of the report and received recognition from Professor Pilgrim and Associate Professor Corderoy of the University of New South Wales that there were mistakes in it. However, the damaging aspect of this is that an earlier version of the report went out with the word `final' on it. Ranger now claims that that is the final report and that it supports Ranger's analysis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very recent matter; it occurred only in the last couple of months. I am surprised that Senator Tambling is not up to date. There have been a number of minor infringements in relation to the release of water. I have already referred to one and I do not propose to go into it, but it resulted in the ludicrous image of the Northern Territory Minister for Mines and Energy drinking a glass of water from retention pond 4. That was the cause of a long letter from Senator Graham Richardson to the Australian newspaper, which indicated that RP4 contained toxic water. A spokesman for Senator Richardson said of the water:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Mr Coulter might be able to drink it, but that's not to say the rest of Kakadu's little creatures can do the same. </PARA>
<PARA>Such breaches illustrate a major difference between the two organisations. Ranger would like to release water and then get the OSS to go down and measure the effects. If the effects are not major it wants to say, `See, there are no effects on the environment'. That is not a very scientific way of approaching the protection of the environment. The OSS, quite properly, wants to conduct the studies in order to be able to have some kind of predictive measure of the effect of releases on the environment, particularly the long-term effects. Unfortunately, the OSS is hampered by a welter of legislation which makes its operations extraordinarily difficult. Dr Wasson of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation stated as much in his evidence as a private citizen to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . somebody has to cut through what I perceive to be a regulatory nightmare that has developed around Ranger. . . I would think that a lot of the problems Ranger has faced has to do with regulations cutting across one another and not knowing who is the final authority. I would think that if the Officer of the Supervising Scientist could, after due consideration, be given that responsibility it would be an excellent way of cutting through a lot of these problems. </PARA>
<PARA>I have to support Dr Wasson's statement. In fact, the Committee supported Dr Wasson's statement and said that it seemed to the Committee that the regulatory framework was complex and could lead to confusion. It also led the Committee to recommend increased responsibilities for the OSS and its strengthening, as appropriate, to take account of the issues discussed in the preceding paragraphs of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> The biggest problem regarding Ranger in the long run is what happens to the tailings dam. The company has rectified an earlier problem and has added more water to the tailings dam. A few months ago it was practically dry and there was a danger of a lot of radioactive dust blowing off the tailings dam onto the township of Jabiru and getting into the local ecosystems. There are about 350 traditional Aboriginal owners living in the park. If the Government had any consideration for those traditional owners and the inhabitants of the local Jabiru township, it would conduct continuing medical tests on their health. That should be done as a matter of urgency, particularly in view of studies in the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the great difficulties under which the OSS operates is the secrecy provisions of the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Act. The Government should look generally at the legislation under which the OSS operates and perhaps even think about changing it so the OSS can do its job properly. One of the ways of strengthening the position of the OSS would be to require the Northern Territory Government to implement the recommendations of the OSS so that the OSS is not put in the invidious position of having to go to an arbitrator that is, in fact, a second scientific body outside itself. After all, the OSS was set up to monitor and research the environment and to look at the effects of uranium mining. The OSS, and in particular Mr Bob Fry, has shown a great amount of reasonableness in the face of such powerlessness. </PARA>
<PARA> In the long run I believe that Kakadu National Park will make more money for Australia and the Northern Territory than will uranium mining and that any money put into the park as a tourist facility should be regarded by the Government as an investment. It is a major source of revenue and, properly managed, can be a joy and a delight to not only Australians but the citizens of the world. It is the largest World Heritage area in the tropics and we are all very concerned about it. Senator Richardson and the Government make noises about their concern for the environment and the greenhouse effect, but in my view it is completely inconsistent to have a uranium mine stuck in the middle of a World Heritage area. Natural ecosystems do not recognise human boundaries. Rivers flow across boundaries. In the wet season the whole area is flooded and any radioactive material that is released in one part of the park can be taken miles downstream to another part of the park. Although it may seem to be a very resilient environment facing such extremes of weather conditions each year, it is not. It is quite clear that it has a very delicately balanced ecosystem which must be preserved and protected not only because of the aesthetic pleasures that it offers but also because of its great importance to the world environment. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to take up the points raised earlier by Senator Coulter regarding nuclear energy, except to say that I support his comments. However, it still surprises me that many honourable senators continue to ignore the long-term environmental hazards of uranium mining when they propose nuclear fission as an alternative source of energy. I can only conclude that they are content to leave the problem of the disposal of radioactive waste to their grandchildren and great-grandchildren. I note that the Federal coalition would, in government, return control of both Uluru and Kakadu national parks to the Northern Territory Government and further expand the Commonwealth's uranium policy. Clearly, that would be disastrous for the area. It would be a disaster for Kakadu National Park because the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy has proven that it is not capable of looking after the area. It has consistently undermined the work of the OSS and has shown itself to be an arm of the mining industry. In my opinion, it would be better for the OSS to be given the full powers to enforce its recommendations to ensure that the brief that it was given under the Fox Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry is absolute. </PARA>
<PARA> Kakadu is home to one-third of this nation's bird species and a quarter of its fish species. It is also home to many rare and endangered species such as the pig-nosed turtle, the salt-water crocodile and the hooded parrot. Water is a crucial resource for the wildlife of the area. Towards the dry season its billabongs and rivers teem with birds that travel to the region for food. Thus contamination of the water presents a great threat to the wildlife and the ecosystems of the region. We must do all that we can to preserve them. For that reason I support the legislation. I would like to see the export levy go up even higher so that it covers 100 per cent of the costs of the OSS. However, 90 per cent will do for the time being. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will reply briefly on behalf of the Government to honourable senators' speeches on the Bills. I start at some disadvantage in being somewhat breathless after Senator Dunn's speech. I must say that the compilation of all that information must have been a very exhausting task for the honourable senator: certainly, it was exhausting to listen to. Her having so much information puts me at some disadvantage. I suppose the burden of Senator Dunn's speech is that she fulfils a description which was once given to Kingsley Martin, an editor of the New Statesman, in his latter years as a person buoyant with gloom because he was dedicated to catastrophe. It is unfortunate to see Senator Dunn in that category.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not intend to deal in detail with all the contributions to the debate. I had the advantage of hearing Senator MacGibbon's contribution, in which he asked some questions about the amendment to the definitions set out in the explanatory memorandum. The Government decided not to backdate the changes prior to 3 March because to do so would mean forgoing significant revenue. The decision was made quite deliberately. The expanded definitions are expected to cost some $20m a year. Should this Bill be passed the new and clarified eligibility criteria for the rebated diesel duty will commence on 3 March 1989, the date of Government announcement. No rebate will be paid for the period October 1986 to 2 March 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon also moved a second reading amendment which relates to the uranium concentrate levy. Honourable senators looked at it from different perspectives. Senator Dunn's solution to the problem was that if it is unfair to the one on which the levy is imposed, the way to level that is to impose it on the other one as well. Senator MacGibbon and other speakers approached the issue from a somewhat different perspective, saying it was unfair to impose it on one and not on the second one. The point about the levy is, first, that the Government does not believe that the export levy will significantly affect the competitive position of companies mining uranium in the Alligator Rivers region. In the Government's view it is a small price to pay to protect a part of Australia's heritage that, as Senator Dunn pointed out, is of international significance. I could give the Senate figures on the likely impact of the levy, but I do not propose to do so at this stage. The simple point is that the mining operations in the Alligator Rivers region not only are more environmentally sensitive but also are situated in a national park. That is not true of the other company's operations in respect of which the alleged discrimination would arise. So the Government does not accept the second reading amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> One or two honourable senators spoke on the Bounty (Ships) Bill. I think I can best deal with it in the committee stage of the Bill. Other honourable senators talked about the grain harvester bounty and the cultivation machinery and equipment bounty and there is a second reading amendment in relation to that issue also. The matter has already been discussed in the Senate by way of questions at Question Time and so on. As the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, I certainly regret that the degree of continuity which as a government we have provided in terms of the administration of industry policy was disrupted somewhat by this precipitate termination of the bounty; nonetheless, the Government has since introduced transitional provisions which will be the subject of amendments to this legislation which will assist companies to overcome the transitional period. The reasons for the change to the bounty were expressed at the time of the April statement and thereafter by me and there is no change in the fundamental reasons as to why that was done. In so far as the Opposition amendment expresses regret about that matter, I accept in some ways the spirit of it, although I do not accept second reading amendments to Bills of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA> This is at first sight a fairly complex set of Bills, but in reality they are fairly simple. Many of the provisions implement decisions of the Government previously announced. The debate has defined very narrowly the controversial aspects of the legislation and honourable senators have spoken on those controversial items. As far as I intend to at this stage, I have replied to those matters. I commend the Bills to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>On 12 April 1989 the Treasurer (Mr Keating) announced the termination of the Subsidy (Grain Harvesters and Equipment) Act and the Subsidy (Cultivation Machines and Equipment) Act as from that date, as part of the savings made by the Government in its April economic statement. The amendments propose transitional arrangements for the phasing out of the grain harvester and cultivation equipment Acts, which will give the industry time to adjust to the new trading environment. The Government considers this is justified because the industry has been able to establish that it had a high enough level of firm orders on 12 April 1989, the termination date for the schemes, to warrant a transitional period to cover such orders. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments provide that, where a manufacturer completes all the steps necessary to claim under the two Acts by 16 July 1989 for the purposes of satisfying a firm order placed with the manufacturer prior to 13 April, bounty will be payable to that manufacturer on the manufacture of that equipment, provided a claim for payment is lodged prior to 16 July. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments, which provide transitional arrangements, will have no financial impact, as the additional bounty payments for eligible grain harvesters and cultivation equipment will all be met from within the respective Acts 1988-89 financial year appropriations. I commend the amendments to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the Government for its amendments, which extend the termination date from 12 April to 12 June. As I read this Subsidy Legislation Amendment Bill, this also applies to harvesters. The amendments will have an affect on cultivation equipment, but virtually none on harvesters. This is because no harvesters are being manufactured and certainly none are being sold at this time of the year-except by or to anyone who may have especially tried to take advantage of this small give-away.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to express my concern that this subsidy had only until 30 June 1990 to run-and that date should have been retained because there would have been at least one season for the use of cultivation equipment, and one more for the harvesters. This is because harvesting plant is bought just before harvesting, which is understandable, and seeding plant is bought just before seeding. As far as the harvesters are concerned, this extension until 12 June will bring no benefit because the plant will not have been bought by then. As I said during the second reading debate, I hoped the Government would have considered treating Australian manufacturers in a slightly different way from multinational manufacturers which happen to be operating in Australia for the time being. </PARA>

<PARA> (2) Page 14, subparagraph 17 (6) (d) (ii), lines  1-3, leave out the subparagraph. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the current scheme which is in operation, to be eligible for bounty, shipbuilders must meet registration criteria as well as orderly development provisions. Today there are about 20 registered shipbuilders compared with over 30 in 1985. Since 1984 and up until April 1989, 45 shipbuilders had received registration, yet only 13 firms have maintained continuous registration during this period. Under the Bounty (Ships) Bill, the registration criteria are even more restrictive. It is argued that this is to offset the advantage of removing the orderly development provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told that these requirements are necessary to ensure that bounties are given only to shipbuilders with a long term commitment to the industry. Yet the requirement that 75 per cent of activities be devoted to bountiable construction and modification is quite an arbitrary figure-a figure that apparently the Government has just plucked out of the air. It is a provision that can be readily circumvented with creative management. The Opposition is concerned that there seems to be no basis for the figure of 75 per cent and that is why we have moved an amendment to seek its deletion. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what happens when a company is starting up. Initially, it may well be able to get off the ground but it could well have, in its operational activities, something that does not satisfy the requirement in respect of the 75 per cent involvement in bountiable construction and modification. Yet it could have all the shipbuilding skills that it needs to fulfil a task. Is the Government able to say that, because a company has these professional skills, it is not a serious player in the shipbuilding industry? Are all Australian shipyards-few that they are-able to satisfy the condition at present?</PARA>
<PARA> I notice that the Industries Assistance Commission is opposed to this present criterion; it actually recommended a reversion to tariff assistance if the more restrictive requirement was not removed. The Opposition will not go that far but we have moved to delete the 75 per cent requirement. In this respect, clause 17 (6) of this Bill provides:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister shall not register an applicant for registration unless:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . at least 75% of the applicant's activities will be devoted to the construction or modification of vessels of more than 150 but not more than 10,000 gross construction tons . . .</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government does not accept the amendments. The current arrangements for the Australian shipbuilding industry, which are further clarified in this legislation, have produced order out of the chaos in the industry. When the previous arrangements were first put in place, in excess of 70 shipyards in Australia-sometimes up to 90-were eligible for the bounty which was then payable. That encouraged fragmentation; ad hoc responses to particular situations; yards building a ship for a particular fisherman in response to a particular demand; and no concentration on technology and skills. The job shop mentality was very apparent in the shipbuilding industry in this country and it is not unkind to say that it was going out backwards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By producing some order in the arrangements we have made sure that the subsidy-which, after all, is taxpayers' dollars-is targeted towards those shipbuilders who meet certain criteria and who are prepared to become professional shipbuilders. In 1984-85, when these arrangements were introduced, if it had been said anywhere that Australia was likely to be able to produce ships for export, frankly, people would have laughed. At present, more than half a billion dollars worth of ships are being built in Australian shipyards, more than half of which are for export. Australian shipbuilders, under these orderly arrangements, have been able to gain markets in Europe, the United Kingdom, India, the Middle East and Asia. We have had a concentration of professionalism in the shipbuilding industry. Shipbuilders are the most successful finders of niche markets in export terms-probably of any industry in this country. They are producing vessels which are recognised internationally and our export performance attests to that. </PARA>
<PARA> These arrangements are designed to assist those shipbuilders who have the potential to be world competitive. They are there. World competitiveness is not a part time business. People have to decide to be in it as a vocation, if you like and, if they do, they are probably halfway towards making it. The 75 per cent requirement allows firms to have some degree of diversification in their operations, but it ensures that they be substantially involved in shipbuilding if they expect to be world-class players. If honourable senators lived in some international dream world and they wanted to buy a luxury cruise vessel, it is probable that the best vessels in the world are made in Australia by a company in Western Australia, and marketed overseas. If they wanted an international catamaran ferry, it is probable that the best vessels are now made in Australia and marketed overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> These successes have been achieved because of these development proposals and because people in the industry have concentrated their minds on becoming shipbuilders of world-class. They have been achieved because of proposals such as the one in this legislation which insists that shipbuilders' activities are at least 75 per cent directed to shipbuilding. Of course, this might not accord with pet theories which some people have. Pet theories have prevailed in Australian industry for many years but performance was never exactly as the theoreticians might have desired. We have in Australia a regime which is demonstrably successful and none of these successful Australian companies would have any difficulty with the 75 per cent rule. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon, who always suspects that people will subvert these proposals, said, `Why do shipbuilders not indulge in a bit of creative accounting or whatever? Is it not open to them to say that they will split a business-that part of it will attract a bounty because it will be 75 per cent shipbuilding and they will put their engineering job shop business somewhere else?'. That is quite possible, but it makes them concentrate their minds on what they are about in terms of their shipbuilding activity. I think that is an excellent thing. The Government does not accept these amendments. I commend the legislation, as drafted, to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer to those companies which are sitting on the borderlines-and I am sure that Senator Button and Senator MacGibbon have been lobbied very heavily by one company in Western Australia-in that they have contracts which mean that, for the time being, their shipbuilding activity represents more than 75 per cent of their total activity, but, when the contracts fall out some time down the track, they may fall below the 75 per cent level. I am sure those companies would like some assurance that, for the time that they remain above that limit, they will be eligible for the bounty and that, if they temporarily fall below that level, they will remain in a bountiable and registrable state. If they pick up other contracts quickly, they will remain registrable. If they remain below the 75 per cent level, clearly they will fall below the criteria and will not attract the bounty. As the bounty is payable on the completion of the vessels, if the answer to the first question is yes, such a company would be entitled to bounty while it remained above the 75 per cent level. What will happen to those vessels that may be only partly completed at the time the company drops below the 75 per cent level, even though the parts of those vessels that were completed while the company was above the 75 per cent level would have attracted the bounty?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I may be able to satisfy Senator Coulter. The company he is talking about is registered. Registration is an annual process. It has just been successful in a particular overseas contract. Some of the other correspondents from Western Australia are also registered, and there is no reason why they should not be registered again and again, provided they maintain that 75 per cent level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Coulter asked what will happen if companies are stuck with a ship half-built and fall below the 75 per cent level. It must be remembered that the bounty is paid on completion of the vessel, it is not paid along the track. There is always concern, which in the case of the companies in question is probably not justified, that at some time in the future they may fall below the 75 per cent level and that will be an issue for them. But I must remind Senator Coulter that the bounty is phasing out in any event and that by 1995 there will be no bounty at all under the proposals in the legislation. So what we are looking at is the period between now and then. It is very likely that those companies will continue to obtain registration, as they have recently done. As I said, the bounty is payable at the end of the shipbuild, and not halfway through. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to put on record my praise for the performance of those shipbuilders that have been very successful in the international market. But that success has come not only through their own merchandising and construction skills; it has been aided by the weakness of the Australian dollar on overseas markets and by the payment of the bounty itself. Like Senator Coulter, I am concerned about this. Six years is a long time in the life of a company. While the Bill provides that the bounty will disappear by 1995, there is still a long way to go-in fact, two terms of the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Hamer in his contribution this morning raised the point that when one has an investment in a shipyard, not only does it build ships but it also has an obligation to maintain its products, which are the ships that are being built. The yards that are involved in the export market, particularly those in the pleasure craft field, are very sensitive to cyclical swings. If there is a change in the economies of overseas countries and people go quietly for a year or two and do not buy 150-foot yachts and that sort of thing, a lot of the yards here will be in difficulty, and they must maintain their existence by doing maintenance work to keep their work force intact. I would argue with Senator Coulter that there is a need for a bit of flexibility and understanding of their position. I come to the question I asked when I first spoke on this amendment: How did the Government arrive at the figure of 75 per cent rather than 74 per cent, 73 per cent or even 65 per cent? What was the decisive factor that led to the 75 per cent figure?</PARA>
</SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="3699" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP>(5.56)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that the 75 per cent figure is an arbitrary one. At some stage one has to arrive at a conclusion about a number of issues relating to shipyards in terms of skilled personnel, technology and a whole range of issues. Inevitably, they are arbitrary decisions, and the figure of 75 per cent is arbitrary in that sense. I remind the Committee that there is not all that much money to go around in terms of this bounty, and it will not be going around forever. The more specific the requirement relating to the registration of yards, the more those yards which are up to world-class manufacturing will benefit. I agree with Senator MacGibbon's point that the value of the Australian dollar is important for this industry. It is going to be more important in the next year or two when we have a 15 per cent bounty or a 10 per cent bounty-or, as it will become, no bounty at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So while I understand the concerns, I think they operate very much at the margin. Although one or two companies out of the 23 or 24 that are recipients of the bounty have lobbied senators and so on, as Senator Coulter put it, it is quite a manageable issue, and I have no personal doubts about the future of those companies as shipbuilders. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek further clarification of the question I asked earlier, because I am still not clear about those vessels that might be under construction at the time a company falls below the 75 per cent level. The Minister has replied that the bounty is paid on completed ships, which is true. But the amount of bounty is calculated on the actual costs borne at the time. It is not calculated on the costs, as they might be inflated, at the time the ship is actually completed. The costs of construction listed in the Bill include design costs, direct labour costs, direct material costs, subcontracting costs, fitting-out costs, costs involved in the trialling and, finally, transportation costs. Let us suppose a company is within the level of bounty for the whole period and has the ship actually completed but has not transported and delivered the ship. In other words, when all the listed costs of construction or modification-and, presumably, they are all-embracing; they are all the costs for which the bounty is payable-have been incurred but the ship is not yet delivered, is that company then entitled to the bounty or not?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The short answer to that question is yes, it is. Might I say again, on the question of registration, that registration is for one year. On re-registration, the company is required to satisfy the registration criteria afresh. For a ship in the course of being built, though, the bounty which arises from its registration remains for that ship, and the question of deregistration is a discretionary one; that is, the Minister may cancel registration if the criteria are not met. That decision is appealable to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. In answer to what I might fairly describe as Senator Coulter's hypothetical question about `what happens if', that ship still gets the bounty.</PARA></TALK.START>

I return to my concerns about the gap where no payment is made for rebates. The Minister said that it would have cost too much money to have allowed a rebate through that period. How much money would it have cost? How many companies would have been involved? How many individuals would have been involved?

We do not know whether they would have been eligible during that period. But they are now and henceforth the cost of that will be $20m a year. There was a technical difficulty in determining eligibility in the past anyway.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct the attention of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce to the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Amendment Bill 1989. If we can lift ourselves above party politics and launch into the altruism that ought to prevail in these sorts of debates can I ask the Minister: Why is it that Energy Resources of Australia Ltd which owns the Ranger uranium mine is required essentially to carry the full burden of the budget of the Office of the Supervising Scientist to the extent that 75 per cent of its budget is paid for by the industry? I noticed in the second reading speech of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) that the cost associated with protecting the environment and also protecting the environment from potential damage ought to be quite properly borne as far as practicable by the industry and not by what the Minister described as ordinary taxpayers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is a cute definition that I do not understand. I am sure it means something to somebody. Why is it that the ordinary taxpayers who are shareholders in Energy Resources of Australia Ltd carry the full burden of the $4 billion for the Office of the Supervising Scientist whereas the ordinary taxpayers who are shareholders in the Coronation Hill joint venture project, which now comes within the terms of reference by way of amendment to the legislation because it is located within the conservation zone, do not make a contribution? If my memory serves me correctly in a question asked by Senator Puplick at the Estimates committee Mr Fry, in one of his rare visits to Australia, was able to tell him that 10 per cent-I think he was talking about 10 per cent of his budget; his answer was not clear-is now spent on the conservation zone. Why is it that Ranger should have to pay a proportion of the cost of the activity in that area when the object of the activity for the moment at least is designed to monitor the environment of an area which is being disrupted, modest as it might be, by the Coronation Hill joint venture partners and in no way is associated with the activities of the Ranger uranium mine?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crichton-Browne comes in here, if I might say so, calling for high-mindedness in this debate. Broad-mindedness has been defined as being the result of flattening high-mindedness out. If that is Senator Crichton-Browne's point, broad-mindedness is what we often get in the Senate. I made a contribution on this issue when Senator Crichton-Browne was not physically with us, no doubt he was in spirit. There are two or three points which I shall make which I hope are simple in respect of Senator Crichton-Browne's question. It is a sort of cap fits situation. Mining in Kakadu creates certain potential environmental hazards which the levy is designed essentially to address. That was the origins of it. It is not a tax on the uranium industry as such.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not on all of the uranium industry. It is on that section of the industry which produces the greatest risk of environmental damage in a national park. Senator Crichton-Browne then went on to ask, `What about Coronation Hill?'. The matter of a levy on gold mining operations at Coronation Hill or on any operations within the Kakadu conservation zone has to be determined in the context of developing a regulatory regime for the conservation zone and for mining proposals within it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the context of this debate we cannot deal with what is essentially an unreal situation now that mining is not taking place at Coronation Hill. If there is an environmental and mining regime to be put into place in association with the Coronation Hill venture, maybe it will attract a levy for the same sorts of purposes as the current levy in respect of Ranger. That, if I might say so, illustrates the point that it is not a tax on the uranium industry or part of it. It is essentially about mining activities and their environmental implications in national parks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Button made the point that it is not a tax on the uranium industry. I understand that. But it just so happens to be that for the moment the uranium industry, to the extent that Ranger fits within that category, is the only industry that is being taxed. I understand that it is not about the uranium industry. It can be well argued that the effect of uranium mining on the environment is decidedly less than the effect of other extraction industries that are involved in matters such as--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree. These include industries that require cyanide solutions and other such processing activities. I understand that. But the truth of the matter is that at the present time the Office of the Supervising Scientist has responsibilities that now go past stages one and two and the original responsibilities given to it under the Act. I assume the Supervising Scientist is collecting base line research data in the Coronation Hill area but I am not certain, having read what I have about his functioning up until now. He is certainly spending somewhere in the range of $650,000 a year in the conservation zone. He is only in the conservation zone because of the existence of the Coronation Hill joint venture project, otherwise he would not be there. The question I am asking is: Why is Ranger required to make a contribution to the funding of his activity which extends past its activity and goes into the conservation zone? In other words, simply put, Ranger is subsidising his environmental considerations in the conservation zone. Senator Button would know better than most that environmental considerations ought always to forerun mining activity. That is exactly why he is in Coronation Hill now. Exploration is taking place. The proven reserves clearly demonstrate that there will be a mine there. So the Office of the Supervising Scientist is now monitoring in advance of mining operations subject to approval from the Government. In fact, the Supervising Scientist is doing work related to a project which is presently taking place to the extent of exploration. I am asking why Coronation Hill is not making a contribution while Ranger is required to carry the difference.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but the honourable senator is putting a different argument about the playing field. He is saying that it should apply to Coronation Hill although he concedes in his remarks that environmental work is best done before mining operations start as well as during and after. The burden of the answer that I gave the honourable senator a minute or two ago was that when an environmental and mining regime is put in place for Coronation Hill, then the question of the levy will be dealt with in that context at that time. The honourable senator has to be a little patient.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not pursue it because Senator Button knows that there is a vacuum in terms of logic. There is a simple way of solving the problem; that is, if Ranger is expected to pay 75 per cent of the cost of the Supervising Scientist to the extent that he is required to do work in the Kakadu National Park as a result of Ranger being there, the same thing could easily apply, whether it be by way of levy or any other discretionary determination, to Coronation Hill. If he is spending $650,000 a year in the conservation zone because the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd is there, we simply say that 75 per cent of $650,000 is $540,000 and that amount is extracted from BHP. A levy is not required. There is nothing magical about an export levy, it is simply a mechanism for attracting funding.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am seeking to pursue the logic of the Government determination so far. Having said that, it is clear to me that nothing further will be elicited from the Minister. I want to take the Minister back to the question of the levy which has raised in the range of $40m. Under clause 4 the levy is being increased to $1.15, from 23 August. As we have just discussed, that is to accommodate 75 per cent of the costs of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. Staff numbers have increased from six to around 75, and have been around that figure for some little time. Senator Button will not be unmindful of the various criticisms made either in wisdom or in ignorance about the direction of the office's research and the location and the cost of the office in Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note that until 1986-87, the last figure I have, the Office of the Supervising Scientist has cost Australian taxpayers $2,650,000 simply in air fares. I do not have the calculations, but if we look at a total budget of $40m and we add on two more extra years, we see that 8 per cent of the total budget of the Office of the Supervising Scientist is spent on employees presumably by and large flying from Sydney to Darwin or Katherine and back to Sydney, or paying for the air fare of Mr Fry to travel around the world and make himself and all of us all the wiser for his experience. That is a very significant part of the budget. The Minister can see why some concern should be expressed by those of us on this side of the chamber about the level of the levy and the discriminatory way in which it has been imposed, perhaps by necessity. But certainly over $2.5m is a very significant part of a budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder whether the Government has looked at those sorts of figures and asked itself whether it is getting value for dollars, or whether all the research that is required is being done or in some way is not being fulfilled because of the requirement for air fares which, as I recall, are the result of the Supervising Scientist insisting that if he took the job he had to stay in Sydney and to hell with everybody else. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That may be right; I do not want to dispute that as I am not in a position to do so. In light of the work being done it is considered more cost effective to locate in Sydney those people who do not need to be in the Northern Territory to carry out their functions. With regard to the 8 per cent cost of air fares for the Office of the Supervising Scientist, clearly that arrangement with some of the staff in Sydney and 43 staff in Jabiru does involve travel, but any operation in the Northern Territory of Commonwealth employees involves travel because of the conditions which obtain to working in the Northern Territory or northern parts of Australia in respect of leave and other arrangements which inevitably make the operation more costly. That is a fact in respect of any operation, including private sector operations, which employ staff in the Territory. So the figure is likely to be higher.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not pursue it any more. I will conclude by saying that I noticed that Senator Button made the point that the advantage of having part of the operation located in Sydney is so that those who do not need to be in Jabiru can be in Sydney. It is not without significance to note that in 1985-86 when there were 65 permanent employees in the Office of the Supervising Scientist travel took up $400,460 out of a budget of $5.535m. The Minister is telling me that people are living in Sydney because there is no need for them to be up in the Northern Territory. There is an enormous amount of travel between Sydney and the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening we are debating cognately four Bills. One of those Bills which was to be debated this evening has now been deferred because of the tragic events in China. I share the Government's view that it is appropriate to defer that legislation for the time being. The four Bills before us are the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Rebates) Bill 1989, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1989, the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1989 and the Income Tax (Arrangements with the States) Repeal Bill 1989. It is obvious that debating four Bills of this kind cognately in the space of 30 minutes does not leave much time to say a great deal about any of them. I propose to consider them in reverse order, so to speak in ascending order of importance. The Opposition does not oppose the Income Tax (Arrangements with the States) Repeal Bill 1989 but shall move an amendment to the motion that this Bill be now read a second time. In relation to that Bill I shall move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of motion, add: ``, but the Senate notes that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the Treasurer is devoid of any policy on Federal/State financial relations;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the Treasurer has been unable to achieve effective restraint in State expenditure;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the Treasurer remains exposed to the effects of increases in State charges on the CPI; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the global borrowing limits are a fiction given the extent to which they can be circumvented''. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is nothing more than a political stunt. I put it to the Manager of Government Business (Senator Robert Ray) in particular that it is a waste of valuable parliamentary time when the Senate's legislative load is already so heavy. The Act, passed in 1978, has become moribund. That is not contested. But to be taking up parliamentary time to repeal it seems to me to be ludicrous. It was enacted in 1978 as a measure designed to provide the States with an opportunity to reduce taxation. It provided for up to 10 per cent of the tax revenue collected by the Commonwealth in each State to be allocated to that State explicitly in the form of grants. If a State did not desire the amount of revenue its residents could receive a tax rebate from that 10 per cent-which the State Government did not receive. In that way it was believed that a discipline would be imposed on State governments to encourage them to manage their financial affairs in a most efficient manner. This proposal was not taken up by the States at the time. The chances of tax reduction that it held out were destroyed by the vehement opposition to it by the then Premier of New South Wales, Mr Neville Wran. </PARA>
<PARA> It is regrettable that our Treasurer (Mr Keating) should spend time on playing political games in putting up this piece of legislation rather than getting about his assigned duties and, in particular, rather than formulating an effective Commonwealth-State financial relationship. I conclude my comments on that matter and simply pass on. The Opposition does not oppose the repeal of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1989. The Opposition does not oppose this Bill, but again we will be moving an amendment to the motion that the Bill be read a second time. I now foreshadow that amendment:</PARA>
<PARA> At the end of motion, add: ``, but the Senate notes:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) that this Bill arose fundamentally because of the Government's blatant exercise of attempting to manipulate the Consumer Price Index by lowering the excise tax on beer while introducing a sales tax on normal strength beer;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the Government's failure more generally to reform the ramshackle indirect tax system, which is littered with inconsistencies and anomalies; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) that the Commonwealth Ombudsman has criticised the administration of sales tax, in particular on the grounds that it is unfair to expect taxpayers to operate a self-assessment system in an atmosphere of uncertainty and without an efficient advisory service or a regular and timely monitoring system''. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill simply highlights the anomalies and inconsistencies of that ramshackle indirect tax system to which the second reading amendment I have just foreshadowed refers. The Treasurer has used the present wholesale sales tax system as a classic means of taxation by stealth. In the first nine months of this financial year sales tax revenue was up by over 24 per cent. That is well above the 14.4 per cent increase forecast in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not an isolated development. Last financial year sales tax collections rose by 19 per cent; that followed rises of 10 per cent in 1986-87 and 15 per cent in 1985-86. In the six years of the life of this present Government, sales tax revenue has gone up by about 150 per cent-roughly three times the rate of inflation in that period. However, this particular Bill was not prompted by an endeavour to reduce the tax burden; it is simply a political stunt. </PARA>
<PARA> After attempting in the last Budget to fudge the consumer price index (CPI) figures in the short term by reducing excise tax on beer, the Government ran into another one of its manifold unintended consequences. Carlton and United Breweries Ltd claims to have leased beer bottles from the manufacturers of those bottles, Bottle Co. of Victoria Ltd, since 1903. Following the change in the application of sales tax to beer in the August Budget that company, quite legitimately-as has been admitted by the Government-sought to take advantage of a pre-existing exemption in the sales tax law which the Government in its haste had totally overlooked. In doing so the company was not seeking to increase its own profit. It was seeking to pass on the advantages of that exemption to consumers by selling its beer at a slightly lower price than that of its competitors. I do not think reducing prices is a serious crime. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to complete my necessarily attenuated comments on this Bill by drawing to attention to the reference to the Commonwealth Ombudsman in the second reading amendment which I earlier foreshadowed. In recent statements the Ombudsman has listed a number of serious problems with the general administration of the sales tax system. In his report in the Administrative Review No. 50 of April of this year the Ombudsman noted:</PARA>
<PARA>The most significant problems are:</PARA>
<PARA> uncertainty about key provisions of the sales tax legislation giving rise to confusion both within and outside the Taxation Office, and to disputation;</PARA>
<PARA> disadvantage to taxpayers because the requirement to assess for themselves which goods are taxable and at what rate, leading to difficulty in the absence of an efficient inquiry system, in establishing correct liability for particular transactions;</PARA>
<PARA> absence of regular monitoring of sales tax returns by the Taxation Office so that taxpayers' errors are not detected in time to prevent significant arrears of sales tax, which continue to accrue until detection;</PARA>
<PARA> inconsistent advice and decisions from regional offices which may put some manufacturers at a significant competitive disadvantage; and</PARA>
<PARA> difficulties in obtaining refunds of overpaid sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA>The Ombudsman expressed the view that it is unfair to expect taxpayers to operate in a self-assessment system, in an atmosphere of uncertainty, and without an efficient advisory service or a regular and timely monitoring system. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is equally unjust, to penalise them for innocent errors resulting from these deficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA>It is true that those highly critical remarks were made as recently as only April 1989. I think, therefore, that it is fair to give the Commissioner of Taxation some time to respond to them, not merely in word but, I trust, in deed. Therefore, I say no more about it other than that the Opposition will certainly be monitoring that response. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1989. The Opposition will not oppose the second reading of this Bill, but I foreshadow major amendments at the committee stage which are designed to address one aspect of the Bill which I can describe only as remarkable. Indeed, it has been the subject of some remark by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. That Committee has drawn attention to the provisions of this Bill which would provide the Commissioner of Taxation, at his unfettered discretion, with the authority to provide information regarding taxpayers, whether individuals or corporations, to designated law enforcement agencies and also to the Comptroller-General of Customs. What is so remarkable-and, as I say, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has drawn attention to this very point-is that this extraordinary provision appears in a Bill, the main purpose of which otherwise is to make a number of wholely technical amendments and to repeal a number of provisions that are no longer operative in tax law. </PARA>
<PARA> I will deal briefly with those unexceptionable, if you like, aspects of the Bill. What they are really about is clearing up a few of the unintended consequences of the Government's own ill-considered legislation. For example, the Bill moves to exempt from capital gains tax a taxpayer's residence when it consists of habitation in a retirement village and the like. The fact is that in the past the Government has claimed that such residences were exempt from capital gains tax. However, as the Treasurer now says, just to make sure or, more accurately, to fix up an oversight, the Government is putting forward this particular change. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the coalition's proposed committee stage amendments about which I propose to say something now because I regard the matter to which they relate as significant. As I said earlier, the amendments relate to the intention in this Bill to amend the taxation secrecy provisions in order to allow the Commissioner of Taxation to disclose, at his discretion, tax information to specified law enforcement agencies, namely, the Australian Federal Police, the State and Northern Territory police forces, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the National Crime Authority, State and Territory corporate affairs commissions and the Australian Customs Service. The coalition is not satisfied either with that framework of proposals or with the safeguards, such as they are, contained in the legislation against the misuse of such powers. We are simply not willing to place in the hands of the Taxation Commissioner further powers to relay confidential taxpayer information to other government bodies without much more powerful checks upon that process than the Bill now contains and, in particular, without changing, so to speak, the point of initiation away from the Commissioner and into the law enforcement agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> We are particularly concerned about these provisions in light of the Taxation Office's already apparent failure to comply effectively with the tax file number legislation requirements. I note that earlier this year tens of thousands of letters containing highly confidential tax file numbers were posted to dead people and to the old addresses of people who years ago had moved from their abodes. Even more recently, Opposition members and senators have been made aware of further gross breaches of secrecy provisions with people's tax file information being sent to the wrong people. For example, a case was raised only very recently by the honourable member for Warringah, the Hon. Michael MacKellar, in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition wishes to establish a mechanism which will provide a check on the ability of the Commissioner of Taxation to provide information solely at his discretion to various law enforcement agencies. Effectively, what we shall be proposing at the committee stage are procedures very similar to the procedure which exists for information requests by the National Crime Authority. I repeat: We propose to place the initiative for such a request not in the hands of the Commissioner but in the hands of the law enforcement agencies. Where an authorised law enforcement agency officer considers that the Taxation Commissioner may have information that is relevant to the particular inquiry or may have acquired information which is relevant to establishing whether a serious offence has been committed or is being committed, the officer, we propose, may apply to a judge of the Federal Court of Australia for access to that information. That application would be required to be in writing and would need to set out particulars of the information requested. In turn, the Federal Court judge may-I repeat, may-order the Commissioner to disclose the requested information to the law enforcement agency and make further orders prohibiting that agency from communicating that information to unauthorised persons. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat: This is not the Government's proposal; these are the amendments which the Opposition shall, in due course, move in the committee stage to that proposal. We will provide for the Taxation Commissioner to be given the opportunity to bring to the notice of the judge any matter that the Commissioner considers should have been regarded in considering the application. The judge would need to be satisfied that that information was relevant to the investigation. We propose similar conditions to those which we are proposing in the case of the law enforcement agencies to apply to the Comptroller-General of Customs in terms of a request for information which he and his officers may also make in like case. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we propose that the Privacy Commissioner should monitor the provision of any such requested information and shall report to the Minister if the Privacy Commissioner thinks that the provision of that information is an invasion of privacy. I will have a good deal more to say about those matters when we come to the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks on that legislation by saying that I regard it as astonishing that the Government should bring forward a proposal of that kind tucked away in an otherwise nugatory and inoffensive technical, unassuming Bill, particularly so in light of recent events and the hullabaloo last year in relation to the tax file number and subsequently this year in relation to the administration of that legislation, even as finally enacted. </PARA>
<PARA> I come now to the final Bill before the Senate in the series of Bills being debated cognately this evening, that is, the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Rebates) Bill 1989. The Opposition will not oppose this Bill, but I foreshadow the following amendment to the motion that the Bill be read a second time:</PARA>
<PARA> At the end of motion, add: ``, but the Senate notes that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) even after the July 1989 tax cuts, the Hawke/Keating Government will remain the highest taxing Government in the post-war history of Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the long overdue tax cuts will substantially be eaten up by the consequences of the Government's high inflation and high interest rate policies; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) it is vital that economic measures be implemented to lower inflation and interest rates if Australia is to see a sustainable reduction in the tax burden and in the enormous net foreign debt of $103 billion''. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill, of course, delivers the personal income tax reductions and other changes which were announced in the 12 April economic statement by the Treasurer. However, the fact is that, as noted in that foreshadowed second reading amendment, even after the tax cuts are delivered on 1 July, this Government will still remain the highest taxing government in our postwar history. The truth is that the tax cuts to be granted at that time will return only part of the taxes that have been ripped off Australian taxpayers over recent years through the insidious processes of bracket creep. According to the very professional economic consultancy firm, Access Economics Pty Ltd, by the end of next year this Government will have plundered around $10 billion from taxpayers through bracket creep since 1985-86-basically, since the tax summit. The tax cuts being given at the beginning of next month are worth only around half of that amount. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator STONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague Senator Walters reminds the Senate, this says nothing as to the plundering through the sales tax mechanism to which I referred before Senator Walters came into the chamber. The new tax scales announced by the Government offer very little incentive to work harder for anybody earning over the second highest tax threshold of $20,600, which is, of course, about 20 per cent below average weekly earnings. The top rate of tax, 48.25 per cent-that is, 47 per cent plus the 1 1/4 per cent Medicare levy-cuts in at an income of still only $35,000, which is now considerably less than one and a half times average weekly earnings. Thirty years ago, the top rate-which admittedly was then somewhat higher, in the area of 66 per cent-did not become effective until one earned 18 times the average weekly earnings. As bracket creep continues to take its toll, almost two-thirds of Australian taxpayers will be facing the top two marginal tax rates within two years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The simple fact is that the Government cannot give sustainable tax cuts without cutting inflation, including wage and salary inflation. The Government cannot cut that inflation because it has abrogated economic leadership for the past two years almost, since the last election, in favour of cheap electoral stunts. One indication of this is the Treasurer's economic statement of 12 April last. It contained barely two sentences-one each-on Australia's two major problems of high foreign debt and high inflation. We all know what has happened since that statement was brought down not quite two months ago. We had figures only a short time ago showing that our foreign debt has increased even further from the figures which the Treasurer was no doubt basing his remarks on at that time, and at the end of March we had net foreign debts of $103 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has mounted some sort of personal campaign in the media designed to con Australians into the view that somehow that does not matter because, as he says, 61 per cent of these debts are liabilities of private corporations and they are not, therefore, the Government's responsibility. That, of course, is hogwash. Of course they are the Government's responsibility, because it is the policies of the Government which have produced the deficits month by month on the external balance of payments on the current account of this country, which can only be paid for, only be financed on the capital account, either through borrowings or through selling off bits of Australia. Of course, the Government has been presiding over policies which have resulted in both of those things being done at a very fast clip. Not only have we now totted up $103 billion of foreign debt, but at 30 June last, which is the latest date for which we have figures in this area, we also had totted up net foreign other liabilities, in the sense of ownership of land, companies, corporate equities and assets other than debt instruments, of $30 billion. At that time our total net foreign liability position in this country was $121.2 billion. </PARA>

The fact is that if it had not been for the policies of this Government, we would not have the deficits which have had to be borrowed. If Mr Elliott, Mr Bond or somebody else had not borrowed them, governments would have had to borrow them. Somebody would have had to borrow them, as Senator Maguire well knows. It is totally disingenuous, to use a parliamentary expression, for the Prime Minister or Senator Maguire to attempt to persuade the people of this country that it is not the Government's fault.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to the matter of high inflation. As we all remember very clearly, the Treasurer, in last August's Budget, told us that by this time inflation would have dropped to no more than 4.5 per cent. He even went so far as to forecast beyond that: that in the financial year on which we are about to embark, it would drop further to between 3 per cent and 4 per cent. What have we got? Even on the new fudged figures we have got a consumer price index running at 6.9 per cent in the 12 months to the March quarter, and almost certainly rising even further in the current quarter. So we will finish the year with an inflation rate of probably over 7 per cent compared to the Treasurer's 4 1/2 per cent. The Commonwealth Treasury, working for this Government, as is its duty, in figures prepared for the recent Premiers Conference and Loan Council meetings in Canberra a few weeks ago, in putting forward information to indicate to the States the amounts of the financial assistance grants which would be likely to be paid to them next financial year, made the point-it had to, because it had to provide these forecasts for that purpose-that in the 12 months to the March quarter of next year inflation would run at 6.9 per cent. So the Government's own agencies are currently forecasting that inflation will continue to run at its present extravagant levels. Because of these two major problems of high foreign debt and high inflation, the Government simply cannot give tax cuts that are sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax cuts which will be given, or which the Government is purporting will be given in a few weeks time, on 1 July, will be eaten up, as our second reading amendment says, by the consequences of the Government's high inflation and high interest rate policies. In the last 12 months alone housing loan mortgage rates have risen by 3 1/2 percentage points, which in itself goes a very long way to eating up the consequences of a tax cut which is broadly estimated to be $20 a week after tax for the average weekly wage earner. In addition, the inflation rate is bowling along merrily at 7 1/2 per cent, and the wage and salary package which has been negotiated between the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions will increase wages and salaries, according to the Government's estimates, by 6 1/2 per cent, although most independent commentators expect the increase to run at 7 1/2 to 8 per cent. Judging by the recent rate of wage drift I would say that even that may turn out to be an underestimate. This will speed up even further the process of bracket creep to which I have referred. The Bill which purports to represent the final fruits, which is meant to bring home the bacon, as the Treasurer promised his Party and ministerial colleagues at the time of the Budget last year, will bring home the usual litany of fraud, deceit and failure of which the Government can now be totally convicted. I move:</PARA>

<PARA> (a) even after the July 1989 tax cuts, the Hawke/Keating Government will remain the highest taxing Government in the post-war history of Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the long overdue tax cuts will substantially be eaten up by the consequences of the Government's high inflation and high interest rate policies; and</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening we are debating a range of taxation measures which have been introduced by the Hawke Government. The most important is the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Rebates) Bill 1989 which is the legislation giving effect to the April economic statement tax cuts which will come into effect on 1 July. I support the package. The legislation gives effect to the cuts in personal income tax announced in the April economic statement. The measures will not only provide substantial benefits to millions of Australians but also be crucial to the future growth of the Australian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the Liberals the only real growth industry in the Australian economy was the tax avoidance industry. Labor has not only confronted the tax avoidance industry but also brought record growth to Australia. Our aim has been to reform taxation for all Australians-not to just pander to sectional interests as the Liberals did. Labor is united in purpose, strategy and resolve to cut income taxes for lower income earners in this country. In government, the Liberals showed that they were ideologically, politically and economically incapable of cutting taxes for all Australians. The wages-tax trade-off to which this legislation gives effect is a central element of the Government's strategy to drive Australia's inflation rate down. </PARA>
<PARA> We have just heard the greatest exercise in hypocrisy from Senator Stone, the former head of the Australian Department of the Treasury. The chief architect, if you like, in the Public Service of the Liberals' economic policies in the late 1970s and early 1980s lectured us at length this evening about so-called runaway inflation in the Australian economy. The facts are that when Mr Stone, in his previous incarnation, was at the Treasury and in charge of the economic levers in Australia we had double digit inflation. Up to the March quarter of 1983 prices were running at an annual rate of 11 1/2 per cent. Of course we know what happened in March 1983: the Liberal Government of which Senator Stone was the chief economic adviser was swept out of office; it was hurled from power by the Australian people because they said, `No more double digit inflation; no more double digit unemployment'-and that was the Liberal Government's record. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before us provides increases in household disposable income of around 12 per cent per annum. Effectively, that will be at half the cost to employers and the inflation rate. As a result of the wages-tax trade-off, we estimate that this year gross wages will grow by only around 6 1/2 per cent. That is a very rare occurrence in a buoyant economy. In an economy characterised by strong and rapid economic growth, as is the case at the moment, it is the most usual practice to have rapid wage growth, not wages constrained to the 6 1/2 per cent growth that we face this year. That sort of outcome is in stark contrast to that achieved by conservative policies and philosophies; it is in contrast to the Liberal and National parties' wages outcomes when they were in government. The legislation before us tonight is in marked contrast with the coalition's tax record. Tonight Senator Stone tried to lecture us and said that the Government is a high tax government. The fact is that when the Liberals were in power in 1982 and 1983, the lowest tax bracket in the Australian income tax schedule was 30c in the dollar. That is the reality. As a result of the proposed tax cuts in the legislation we are debating this evening, the bottom tax rate will be cut not to 25c in the dollar, but to 21c in the dollar, a stark comparison with the record of the Liberals and Nationals in government. </PARA>
<PARA> The income tax cuts have been funded from this Government's Budget surplus. We are now covering our expenditures by revenues. We have a Budget surplus. That has resulted from stringent fiscal restraint and it has been funded, importantly, by Labor's crackdown on the tax cheats in the Australian community. A lot of the revenue has come from hurtling against the wall the tax avoidance industry in the Australian economy. Our policies are in stark contrast to the Liberals' tax changes of 1982, tax changes which were made on top of the wages explosion when wages grew at 15 per cent and 20 per cent per annum. That wages explosion heralded the worst recession in 50 years in the Australian economy. Labor's tax cuts are the outcome of the unprecedented tax reform undertaken by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of reform, the Liberals in government let tax avoidance and tax evasion become a national scandal and a disgrace. Under the Liberals, income tax was voluntary for the rich in Australia. Instead of supporting Labor's reforms, they have opposed almost every measure against tax avoidance and tax evasion. I simply refer to the fringe benefits tax which was fought tooth and nail by Opposition senators and to the free lunch crackdown by this Government. The Government stopped the practice of the pin-striped brigade at the big end of town going out and having expensive lunches and charging them to the taxpayer. Working class families could not charge lunches in expensive restaurants against their tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that Senator Boswell came into the chamber this evening because I well remember him at the end of 1985 when we were cracking down on the free lunch, when we were consigning it to the garbage bin of history, telling us that the restaurant industry would collapse. That is what he said. He is in the Hansard record time and time again claiming that the restaurant industry would collapse. When we distil that argument to its basics, we see that Senator Boswell and his ilk were really saying that Australians were going to stop eating. That is what it really came down to. Now he is again mouthing off about this Government's tax cuts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We also introduced the capital gains tax which is significantly protecting our income tax base against tax avoidance. The introduction of that very important tax indicated that at last Australia's national tax system had arrived in the twentieth century. At last we had come into line with the major countries in the world in having a tax on unearned income through capital gains. Our revenues come from the fringe benefits tax, the free lunch crackdown and the capital gains tax. Opposition members knew when they were in government that the ordinary taxpayers in Australia were bearing the burden of tax avoidance schemes designed by and accessible to only the rich, yet they failed to stop it. We had Liberal Party rhetoric about tax cuts. That contrasts with their broken election promises and their increased taxes. I well recall the fistful of dollars advertisements in the 1977 election and the dollars that were taken back within months of that election early in 1978 by Mr Howard when he was the Treasurer of this country. The Liberals' record in government gives them no credibility at all on taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight Senator Stone, the former head of the Treasury, the former chief public servant in charge of economic policy in this country, tried to lecture members of the Government for being part of some sort of high tax government. I simply refer Senator Stone to the 1968 Budget Papers, which show very clearly that during the life of the Liberal-National Party Government in the 1970s and early 1980s in this country, the share of taxation in our national income, the share of taxation in our gross domestic product, did not fall but rose. Taxation rose faster than Australia's national income, when the Liberal and National parties were in power, by a whopping 1.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Stone should not lecture this Government about how we are a high taxing government and claim that taxes have risen under a Labor government when clearly the record shows that, despite the rhetoric of the Liberals in 1975 and 1977 when they went to the polls saying that they would cut taxes in this country, the share of our national income taken by taxation rose under them. It is against that record that the Labor Government's tax cuts, to take effect from 1 July, are welcomed by Australians. The tax cuts are not piecemeal measures; they are substantial cuts with substantial benefits for the Australian economy. They are central to the accord, the wages-tax trade-off that this Government has developed to keep down the pressures on costs and to ensure that our international competitiveness is enhanced in the world community. The Australian community is well aware of the advantages of these tax cuts. For example, an advertisement from a leading Australian retail chain, K Mart, which is part of Coles-Myer group, advertises: `Tax cuts all round. K Mart makes the good news better'. It is encouraging people to get in and get the bargains, because that store is well aware of the importance of the disposable income of many Australian families. This particularly large retail organisation understands that the tax cuts are real, significant and large. I quote from the Australian Institute of Family Studies, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Overall the Government's tax package redresses substantially all of the deficiencies in the tax-transfer system affecting families and single individuals (since 1976). </PARA>
<PARA>I was stunned and shocked tonight by the utter hypocrisy of Senator Stone in lecturing this Government about so-called bracket creep or fiscal drag, that is, the movement of taxpayers into higher tax brackets as a result of inflationary pressures. The reality is that a Liberal government introduced tax indexation as a means of overcoming bracket creep and fiscal drag, and then scrapped it. Senator Stone was the Government's chief economic adviser at the Treasury for the whole period that the Liberal and National parties were in government, when they played around with tax indexation as a means of overcoming fiscal drag and then threw it out of the window. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the record. In 1976 the Liberal Party said, `We have to bring in tax indexation to keep governments honest'. That is on the public record. The Liberal Government introduced the indexation of tax brackets in 1976 to overcome the so-called bracket creep in the Australian tax system. There was indexation of tax brackets in the 1976-77 and 1977-78 financial years. But that was the end of it. The Liberal Government then halved the indexation factor-it adjusted for only half the inflation rate for the 1978-79 financial year-and then suspended it totally. That Government threw indexation out of the window in 1979-80. Tonight we have heard Senator Stone telling this Government that it is somehow syphoning off revenue from the Australian taxpayers through fiscal drag and bracket creep, when the reality is that, despite a Liberal government being elected on the promise of keeping governments honest in Australia, it threw out this measure in 1979-80. The Liberal Government experimented with it again in the financial years 1980-81 and 1981-82. Even then, it was adjusted for only half the increase in the inflation rate in the Australian community. Then it was thrown out of the window again, finally, in 1981-82. That is the record of the Liberal Party on bracket creep. </PARA>
<PARA> I might add that, when using the data I have used this evening, I have quoted extensively from Mr Andrew Peacock, MHR. When he went onto the back bench in the early 1980s he documented the Fraser Government's move away from both tax index- ation and its commitment to adjust tax brackets for inflation. Let us not have any more lectures from Senator Stone and the like because the Liberal policy on tax indexation in practice is just like its policies on economic management when it was in government-stop-go, stop-go and grind the economy into the ground. The reality is that the Liberals have done as much for tax indexation in Australia as King Herod did for baby-sitting. That is what they did in office. Let us have no more Liberal nonsense on tax indexation. The Liberals promised it and they threw it out the window. </PARA>
<PARA> In this connection I would like to quote again from the comments of the Institute of Family Studies on the tax package. In its April statement this year the Institute said:</PARA>
<PARA> Nearly all income groups will pay less tax under the new scale than they would have paid if the  1983-84 tax scale had been fully indexed. </PARA>
<PARA>So the Institute of Family Studies is saying that, for nearly all income groups, the Hawke Labor Government has effectively given tax cuts which are larger than would have been given had the tax scales in Australia been fully indexed for inflation from the time that Government came to office. Let us have no more nonsense from those opposite about bracket creep and fiscal drag. Clearly, they are uninformed on the subject. Clearly, they are hypocritical in coming in here and trying to tell us about how we should run the tax scales in this country. I am pleased to say that the tax cuts announced in the April statement focus on low to middle income earners. They bring substantial increases in the take-home pay of ordinary Australians. The tax package concentrates on criteria such as fairness and equity and social justice. Recently, while campaigning in the Mount Gambier area of South Australia, I addressed the workers at two large timber mills-the Woods and Forests mill and the Softwood Holdings Ltd mill, both of which have thousands of employees--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7I4">Senator MAGUIRE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is based on pinus radiata which has been planted by men and women. We harvest the native trees in South Australia for timber production. So, clearly, a man-made resource is being harvested. I point out that the response of the workers in those two mills to the tax cuts was overwhelmingly good. They were very positive towards the increases in their disposable incomes through income tax cuts and, in particular, to increases in the family allowance and the family allowance supplement. Last Friday I also had the same feedback when I was campaigning in Adelaide with Mr Bob Catley, the Federal candidate for Adelaide. We went to the Tubemakers Ltd plant in Adelaide-a very large industrial enterprise-and we had an enormously positive response to the income tax cuts. The Liberals try to belittle these tax cuts. They try to claim-as Senator Stone has tried to do-that somehow they will be eaten up by interest rate rises. But they know that people out in the electorates have been looking for reductions in personal income tax and increases in the family allowances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The impact on individual households is significant indeed. For example, a single income family with a dependent spouse and two dependent children and on $290 a week gross or $15,000 a year, in effect, will get a $24 a week wage rise as a result of the increase in the family allowance and the reductions in personal income tax. A single income family on $20,000 a year will get a large percentage reduction in its tax burden. In fact, the number of dollars it will pay in tax in the next financial year compared with this financial year will be reduced by a massive 17 per cent. In dollar terms, that family's tax burden will be reduced by more than one-sixth and it will get the biggest reduction in average tax rates-its average rate of income tax will fall by 3.4 percentage points. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the most important part of this package is that, from 1 July onwards, many thousands of Australian families will no longer face personal income tax. From 1 July the net tax for many Australian families will be zero. The reason for that is that family assistance payments, through both the family allowance supplement, for single income families with gross incomes up to about $20,000 a year will exceed their total tax liabilities. One of the great achievements of this Hawke Government will be to free many lower and middle income families totally from the burden of income tax. They will be getting back more in family payments than they will be paying out in tax. For example, a single income family with two teenage children on a gross income of $20,000 a year will pay a total in tax next financial year, after allowing for the increase in the dependent spouse rebate, of $2,117. Their family assistance-that is, the family allowance and the family allowance supplement-will total $2,594. So they will be getting back from the Federal Government through family assistance $477 more than they will be paying in personal income tax. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7I4">Senator MAGUIRE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tambling has to get out into the community and have a look at the concept of average weekly earnings, because it does not really apply in my State of South Australia. For example, many of the employees at the timber mills in the Mount Gambier district are still earning a gross wage of less than $300 a week. Many of the people at the mill I visited in Adelaide last week are earning more like $400 a week. We have to get back to reality and focus our thoughts and considerations on those people who are earning those sorts of incomes in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Conceptually, we now have in Australia a negative income tax. We have now moved under this Hawke Labor Government to a negative income tax for many tens of thousands of families. Over the 1960s and 1970s in the United States, Canada, Western Europe and Great Britain, the concept of a negative income tax was talked about as a way of alleviating poverty by focusing government resources more on the neediest people in the community. Instead of their paying tax to the government, it was to pay to them. Single income families in this country on incomes up to about $20,000 gross next financial year will be receiving more from the Australian Government, the Hawke Labor Government, in family assistance payments through the family allowance and the family allowance supplement than they will be paying in personal income tax. That is a terrific step forward. As I have pointed out, the average effective tax rate, allowing for family assistance increases, will be zero or negative for many low income families. </PARA>
<PARA> I have pointed out that family allowance increases form part of this package. There seems to be a misconception in the community that it is only the family allowance supplement that is being increased as part of this package, but essentially every family that has been receiving the family allowance payment this financial year will get an increase in the family allowance next financial year. That is a very important point that we in the Government must communicate immediately and directly to the Australian community. The family payments in the package are central to Labor's concept of improving the social wage. That is a broad measure of the welfare of Australian households. It is not a monetary wage concept, which, of course, is the focus of the Liberal and National parties concerning the treatment of families. They talk about cash wages and cash incomes, but they do not look at the range of services that governments provide in the health, education, welfare and housing areas, which all add to family welfare and standards of living. This tax package is moving down the road towards a broader concept of the social wage by focusing even more resources on lower income families with children. Under the Liberals and the Nationals, the concept of the social wage was non-existent. All increases in income, if any, came through wage rises. At the end of the coalition government we saw the massive wages explosion of 1981 with money wages growing by 15 to 20 per cent per annum and double digit inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the lecture here tonight from Senator Stone about the evils of inflation and his claim that Labor has failed to deliver on inflation, the reality is that when he was over the road down in the Treasury Building at the beginning of 1983, inflation under the Liberal-National Party Government was at double digit levels. It was 11 1/2 per cent per annum. He has the cheek to come in here tonight and lecture us on inflation, telling us that somehow we are not meeting our targets on inflation. The reality is that we do not have 11 per cent inflation or even 10 per cent inflation at present; we have got the rate of increase in prices as measured by the consumer price index down to below 7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fascinating to look at the international comparisons that the Liberals and the Nationals make about inflation. Up until about three months ago every time they talked about price rises in the Australian community they compared us with Margaret Thatcher's England. They talked about how our inflation rate was higher than that in the United Kingdom. It is fascinating how, all of a sudden, comparisons about inflation by Liberal and National spokespersons have forgotten to focus on the United Kingdom. I checked the international papers and found the reason why. Mrs Thatcher, that messiah who the Liberals trek to London to meet and ask how she has governed her country for 10 years, that competent economic manager, they believe, has now got inflation running at over 8 per cent. In Australia it is less than 7 per cent. Is it not incredible? Interest rates are on the way up in Britain and there is a record balance of payments deficit. This is the person Opposition members trek to London to see, to grovel at her feet and say, `Mrs Thatcher, how do you run your wonderful economy? It is terrible in Australia'. When they come back they forget about it and forget to make a comparison, because in Australia we do not have double digit inflation or even 8 per cent inflation, as they have in Britain; we have an inflation rate of less than 7 per cent under this Hawke Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the record under this Government. As a result of our economic and tax policies, we have got away from double digit unemployment and double digit inflation, which was a horrific legacy of the Liberals at the beginning of the 1980s. The coalition Government's record on taxation was one of farce, fiasco and failure. A decade ago the Liberals claimed they would cut taxes. They have failed. Today this Labor Government is delivering real tax cuts for the Australian people. In reforming taxation Labor has shown real energy, initiative and enterprise. The beneficiaries will be the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I came into the chamber tonight to address one Bill only, the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1989, and to foreshadow an amendment to that Bill which will call for the abolition of the 20 per cent tax on recycled paper. But having listened to Senator Maguire, I cannot help but comment more broadly than that. What he was talking about seems to indicate yet again the poverty of both the Government's economic policies and those of the Opposition. Both indicate a clear subjugation of social and political policy to economic ends rather than the other way around.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was interested to hear what Senator Maguire said in the latter moments of his address when he was talking about the social wage and negative income tax. We have a very large number of people in Australia at present on various forms of benefits-pensions, family supports and supplemented family supports. All those things are subject to means tests, and a means test necessarily involves an enormous bureaucracy to supervise it-to snoop on single mums and see whether they do not have a de facto lover who might be living with them, et cetera. I wonder why the Government does not understand the good sense of going all the way and creating a national support income so that everybody will get an income from the Government. Money that one earned beyond that income which one got from the government would simply be income on top and one would pay tax on the total amount. If one were very wealthy most of that national support income would go back to the Government by way of tax. At one stroke it removes all of the problems of means tests. It removes all the costs of bureaucracy and also would elevate the standing of those people who, in their own eyes, are now dealt with as second class citizens. For instance this includes pensioners who must travel on public transport between 10 o'clock in the morning and 3 o'clock in the afternoon to get reduced fares and who must line up in public hospitals for benefits that only those with a particular pension card are entitled to get. </PARA>
<PARA> The development of a national support income which was paid to everybody irrespective of means test would at one stroke remove many of the anomalies to which Senator Maguire was referring and with which he was attempting to make a totally artificial distinction between policies of the Government and the Opposition. The facts of the matter are that inequity in Australia has increased during the time of the Hawke Government as it has in Great Britain under Margaret Thatcher. There is much greater difference now between the income and the wealth of the wealthy in both countries and the increasing number of poor and disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> What one clearly needs to do is to develop a radically different approach to wages, to prices and to tax. As I indicated in a speech the other day, if one removes from centre stage the economic consideration, puts people centre stage and then works an economic policy to serve the interests of the people, one would come up with a totally different pattern. That not only would include something like a national support income but also would mean attempting to take the tax out of wages altogether and shift that tax onto non-renewable resources. That bears very much on the amendment to which I will refer in a moment, namely, the removal of the 20 per cent tax on recycled paper. There are clear indications that the way in which we have levied a large part of the tax burden on wages in a situation involving those who can demand increased wages, simply moves to increase the demand for wages. The higher price for labour leads to attempts to reduce the number of people employed and shifts investment away from labour into capital investment. It therefore increases the demand on resources. The move should go the other way. We should be putting the tax onto material consumption, lowering wages and lowering the tax on wages. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other things to which I have referred on several previous occasions is the establishment of a national capital account to put alongside the gross domestic product. This, of course, bears directly on the use of trees for the manufacture of paper. We do not put any value on trees in situ. It appears to be cheaper to take new trees out of the forest and turn them into paper than it is to collect paper which has already been used and recycle it. If we introduce a differential tax on paper which is manufactured de novo and paper which comes from pulp that has already been used, we are in a sense getting to a situation which recognises the value of the forests in situ. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a rather indirect way of doing it, but it works in much the same direction. There are substantially good reasons for doing this. I point to the 1.6 times 10 to the fifteenth grams of carbon that go into the atmosphere each year from the cutting down of forests, principally the tropical rainforest, but not inconsiderably forests elsewhere that are chopped down to manufacture paper, the further consumption of resources which go into the paper mills by way of the energy demands of those paper mills, the pollution of water supplies in the manufacture of paper and the pollution of lakes, rivers and oceans in the effluent stream. All these things are ultimately a further cost to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it at present Australia does not recycle any paper back into paper. The 30 per cent of paper which is recycled goes into cardboard. It is essentially a one-trip recycling because at the next stage it is merely burned. If we are to place less burden on the forests and on the atmosphere and less pollutional burden on water supplies in effluent discharges, then it is clearly desirable to achieve a much higher level of recycling. That could be achieved by removing this tax burden on paper manufactured from recycled pulp. At the moment I understand that if one wants to use recycled paper in Australia, one has to import that paper from overseas. The removal of the 20 per cent sales tax on recycled paper would in the short run advantage, relative to Australia, those manufacturers overseas who are already manufacturing that paper. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Richardson has pointed out, he is in favour of the Australian Federal Government using recycled paper and I understand that he is moving in that direction. I also understand from his press releases that he is attempting to encourage other governments in Australia to move to the use of recycled paper for many purposes because the manufacturers in Australia indicated that the amount of paper coming through the Federal Parliament and through Federal Government departments would not be sufficient to maintain a viable recycling industry. But if one adds other governments in other States, and if one can encourage private industry also to use recycled paper, then the volumes become large enough to establish a viable industry. </PARA>
<PARA> If we have a society which is predicated on economic signals and economic indicators-decisions are largely predicated on economic considerations-it is absolutely appropriate to use the price signal to move this industry in this direction. Back in 1967, in a very important essay called The Tragedy of the Commons, I think it was Garrett Hardin who pointed out that if one wanted to move a society in a certain direction, one could not rely on so-called education and conscience to get the job done because unless the economic indicators were changed those people who developed a conscience with respect to a particular activity would simply put themselves at a disadvantage. Of course, that is exactly the situation that we are in at present-those who choose to use recycled paper pay a slightly higher cost for doing so. The removal of the sales tax from paper made from recycled pulp would get the price signals working in exactly the same direction as conscience. Those who had a conscience would get an advantage from using that recycled paper. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh has just come into the chamber. If this amendment is successful, and if the prediction I make is correct-that is, that this measure would encourage a much larger percentage of Australia's pulp to be used three or possibly four times before being turned into cardboard and discarded-the contribution which the forest industries would make to gross domestic product would fall. The industries would say that that was a bad thing. But even if their contribution to gross domestic product were to fall, the country as a whole may well be much better off. I make the point, as I have done in the past, that the size of the gross domestic product is not necessarily an indication of the social benefit which a country derives from the throughput of its resources. So I foreshadow an amendment I will move in the committee stage to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1989, namely, to exempt paper made from recycled pulp from sales tax. </PARA>

<PARA> (a) even after the July 1989 tax cuts, the Hawke/Keating Government will remain the highest taxing Government in the post-war history of Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the long overdue tax cuts will substantially be eaten up by the consequences of the Government's high inflation and high interest rate policies; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) it is vital that economic measures be implemented to lower inflation and interest rates if Australia is to see a sustainable reduction in the tax burden and in the enormous net foreign debt of $103 billion'. </PARA>
<PARA>Those amendments basically sum up the disaster that this nation is now facing under the economic mismanagement of Mr Keating. It is extraordinary, for example, that the Prime Minister and Mr Keating are going around pretending that, because the foreign debt is not owed by the Government itself-that 60 per cent of it is owed by the private sector-therefore somehow the Government is not responsible. Actually, the appropriate word is `irresponsible'. The Government is irresponsible to claim that it has no responsibility for the size of that foreign debt. Clearly, if this Government's economic policies meant that Australia could pay its way in the world we would not have to beg $1.5 billion worth of cash each month to settle our overseas bills in the way we have to at the moment. It was a vital part of the last Budget that that monthly bill would be reduced to something like $750m a month instead of the $1.4 billion that we have been running at. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's forecast for the current account deficit was about $9.5 billion, whereas it now looks like being $15 billion. The reason for this is simple: this Government's economic management has been absolutely hopeless. It has depended almost entirely on monetary policy. There is no doubt that monetary policy simply has not worked. It is not good enough to rely on interest rates to regulate this economy. One of the disastrous consequences of this Government's reliance on interest rates, and how they do not work in controlling the economy, can be seen by looking at the housing sector. I do not want to go into this area too much tonight because I hope to have an opportunity to discuss it on another occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple reality is that the banks and the building societies have not felt capable, in a competitive environment, of passing on to Australians the real cash flow impact of higher interest rates. That means that the banks have chosen to extend people's mortgage loans for many years-in fact, for some people to infinity. This means they will never pay off their homes. That decision has been taken by the banks so that Australians will not suffer a massive withdrawal of money from their pockets as a result of huge interest rates-but their debt will become greater. In other words, they are not suffering the pain now but they will suffer it in the future. The reality is that sooner or later that pain will be suffered for a variety of reasons. One of the reasons is that the Government wants people to suffer. It is vital for the Government's economic policy for the people to suffer. </PARA>
<PARA> The banks and building societies have softened the blow on Australians with these huge interest rate rises by not increasing the amount that most Australians have to pay each month on their mortgage. This has had one extraordinary consequence. It has reduced the effectiveness of the Government's monetary policy. One of the reasons the Government's monetary policy has failed is that it has not had an enormous impact on consumption. In the area of housing, one of the major debts Australians face, there has been no increase relative to the size of the increase in interest rates and no increase in the size of the money being drawn out of circulation to reduce the level of consumption capacity that people have. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequences of that are very simple: if the Government increases interest rates but the amount of money that people pay each month is not increased, then monetary policy is not working. If the Government's strategy is to reduce demand by increasing interest rates, then clearly that objective is being frustrated if the banks do not charge people more per month. That is exactly what has happened. That is one of the reasons why these high interest rates, and rising interest rates, simply have not held down demand in the way this Government wanted. That is why these huge interest rates have not stopped the big rises in imports that the Government wanted to stop. This demonstrates the Government's total failure to understand what really happens in a free market economy. It, its economic planners and its apparatchiks are only competent, apparently, in an area where there is control. But those controls have all gone. There is now a free market and, as a result, the Government's reliance on monetary policy has been shown to be a cruel fraud because it does not work. The Government has to screw that policy tighter and tighter to have the same sort of impact that it had hoped to achieve with much lower interest rates. Of course, those more modest interest rate rises were reflected immediately in higher mortgage repayments. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that the Government can be cheerful about is that every time it puts up interest rates-and so far this financial year they have gone up from 13 1/2 per cent to 17 per cent-it gets a higher tax revenue which effectively is paid for by the home seekers of Australia. They are helping to supply Mr Keating's tax revenue. At a later opportunity, I hope to go into that matter in some detail. Let us recognise that one of the greatest beneficiaries of the Government's high interest rate policy is the Government's tax revenue. People should not forget that. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of revenue, it is relevant to look closely at the April 1989 statement of Commonwealth Government financial transactions, which was released only last week. That statement shows, for example, that in the area of outlays, the public debt interest burden on the Government, which one would have thought would have gone up in view of higher interest rates, has, in fact, declined. That is due to the lower than expected volume of notes issued which has been partly offset by the impact of higher yields. Also, as the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) tried to interject, the Government is making fewer claims through the public sector borrowing requirement. But the fact is that public debt interest rates have not gone up. It is quite clear at the moment that this Government's policy of higher interest rates brings it a net benefit rather than a net loss, and that net benefit is largely being met by the mortgage payers of Australia. In other words, the last people one would think this Government would want to punish are on the top of the list. This Government seeks to punish them by concentrating its policies on high interest rates and doing nothing else. </PARA>
<PARA> Some other interesting matters arise out of this statement of Commonwealth Government financial transactions. The statement reveals that the outlays for the year as a whole are expected to be close to the original Budget estimate even though by April they were running a little behind. It is interesting to note that while there were shortfalls in some areas, these are being offset by higher than estimated outlays in other areas, particularly in defence where running costs and outlays on defence industries have been higher than estimated. Assistance to other governments, which is linked to the consumer price index (CPI), has increased more than expected. Assistance for natural disasters has also increased. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us concentrate briefly on the question of the CPI-linked increased payments. This Government's inflation policy has collapsed. Not even Government Ministers like Senator Walsh would pretend that the inflation result for this year will be at all satisfactory. That collapse is one of the major problems this nation is now facing in its relationship with the rest of the world and its capacity to protect itself from the inevitable disaster when our commodity prices fall and when the Australian economy ceases getting the benefit of the once-off kick that it has had in the last few years when the terms of trade fortunately stopped falling and temporarily moved to our advantage. The disaster is that we are now in serious economic crisis despite the fact that our terms of trade have been temporarily advantageous to us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Stone says, they are the best since 1976. But one wonders how long that situation will remain. In fact, already there are clear indications of significant falls. I think a $1 billion drop in the total returns from wool is expected next financial year. We have already seen some of the metals commodities coming well and truly off the top. The instability generated by the current problems with China would certainly raise some questions about what will happen with world trade. This is apart from serious concerns about the economic future of the United States of America.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the other side of this equation. In our amendments we noted that, even after the July 1989 tax cuts, the Hawke-Keating Government will remain Australia's highest taxing government in our postwar history. Let us just test that. In the 10 months to April this year we have seen exactly what is happening to revenue collections. It seems to me that the key point to look at is what pay as you earn (PAYE) taxpayers-the great bulk of Australians; people who work for a living and get paid a salary-are paying. PAYE collections from this extraordinary, grasping, high taxing Government have so far this year gone up by 17.5 per cent compared to the same period last year. The Budget forecast that net PAYE collections would go up by 13.8 per cent. At the time we said, `Hey, that's a bit rough. You are supposed to be holding down taxes and here is yet again another attack on the taxpayer'. But we find that collections are not going up by 13.8 per cent; they are going up by 17.5 per cent. That is an extra $1.2 billion a year in taxes more than the forecast rise of $4.3 billion for this year. No wonder this Government can pretend that it is handing out some great benefits by way of tax cuts. When one adds the $4.3 billion that the Government budgeted and for the $1.2 billion extra it will get, that magically adds up to $5.5 billion. What is the volume of the tax cut? It is $5 billion. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Stone" NAMEID="LJ4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. So on these figures alone the reality is that so far this year this Government has collected about $600m more than the tax cut it will hand back. What monumental hypocrisy from this Government! It has tried to pretend that somehow it is doing something absolutely wonderful when in fact it is still ripping off more than it is giving back by way of tax cuts. That is apart from the enormous expense facing people who are trying to pay off their homes. For example, people with average mortgages have to face enormous interest bills. I hope to have the opportunity to deal with that at greater length at another time. We also see, among these extraordinary rises in income tax collections, the prescribed payments system. There has been an increase of 36.6 per cent in the amount collected under the prescribed payments system, to over $1 billion-an increase of over one-third compared to the 22 per cent increase that was forecast. In fact, the Government has collected almost as much in 10 months as it was supposed to collect in the full year. Company tax collections have gone up by 15 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting, though, that non-PAYE taxpayers have paid a substantial amount less. In other words, all these big increases in tax revenue have taken place despite a drop of almost 20 per cent in non-PAYE tax collections. This is fascinating. The excuse for this is that it reflects delays in processing returns of provisional taxpayers at the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). It also involves higher than expected levels of refunds, the incorporation of provisional taxpayers and an apparent shift in the composition of investment portfolios away from interest income towards insurance company and friendly society bonds. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the key element is delays in processing returns of provisional taxpayers at the ATO. If that delay is not caught up with within the next two months-and I doubt that it will be-we will see next year a massive, hidden in-built dam wall; a wall of water, or a tax flow, will come rushing in. In other words, the figures for the huge tax collections we will see by the end of this year will not fully reflect the real level of tax debt which is to be collected when the delays in processing returns are eventually overcome. The figures I have given today show that this enormous and continuing rise in Government tax revenues will not fully reflect what this Government is ripping off the taxpayers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us now look at another area-sales tax, the area where the Government said it would not have any consumption tax. We have had a 23.8 per cent increase in sales tax collections this year. The Budget forecast was 14.4 per cent. That means, on an annual basis, an increase of approximately $700m. According to the statement of the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) this increase is supposed to reflect the strength of sales of motor vehicles, and non-retail and investment goods and the impact of the 1988-89 budget measure on beer. Of course, one of the amendments to be considered tonight is to deal with that matter, which was a fiddle aimed at cheating on the CPI. That cheating on the CPI had some unintended consequences which now must be fixed. </PARA>
<PARA> Here we have a huge increase in consumption taxes, even above its Budget forecast, from a government which said it was not going to go into consumption taxes because they were somehow obscene. The fact is that in the six years of the Hawke Government there has been a 150 per cent rise in consumption taxes. That is three times the rate of inflation. It hits hardest on lower income earners, particularly families with young children, who are consumers of food such as orange juice, ice-cream and flavoured milk-items on which the Government has, for the first time ever, put a consumption tax. It is a hidden attack on the pockets of Australians, particularly Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the matters that confuse me slightly is the customs duty collections in the period to April, which were only very slightly higher, 1.9 per cent higher, than the collections for the same period last year. I would have thought that the massive increase in import volumes and import values-I regret I have not got the figures in front of me-should surely have brought a significant increase in customs duty. This statement indicates that there has in fact been a compositional shift towards goods dutiable at higher rates, and I presume that means a big increase in the number of motor vehicle imports. Despite that, there has been only a 1.9 per cent increase in collections. The Finance Minister's statement says that this is because there has been a reduction in tariff rates and import prices resulting from a higher value for the Australian dollar in 1988-89. That really surprises me. I cannot imagine that will end up being correct, although I notice that in the Budget Papers the Government was expecting a 2.5 per cent fall in customs duty on imports. That is not because of a higher Australian dollar; it is because it expected its economic policies to work, and of course they have not worked. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to see the sorts of things that Mr Keating was saying on 19 July 1988 and how he was stressing that we could not have tax cuts. I wonder what has happened since July 1988 that has so improved our economic position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. Yet in July 1988 Mr Keating was saying the strongest possible things, jawboning about how it was not appropriate to have tax cuts and how it was vital to maintain a tough fiscal stance, a tough wages stance and a tough monetary stance. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the unions think we're just mouthing some empty rhetoric about a tax-wage trade-off and the quality needing to be there before we produce the goods, then they're mistaken . . . </PARA>
<PARA> We will hang on to the surplus if they don't play the game. </PARA>
<PARA>They were certainly playing some sort of game, because they played the game well enough for Mr Keating to give them the surplus, $5 billion of it, by way of tax cuts, to give them a wage rise as well, and a promise of more to come, and no requirement on productivity whatsoever at this stage. It sounded impressive to the foreign investors, but it was meaningless nonsense. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> If Australia doesn't make provision now when there's a bit of sunshine around in terms of commodity prices, if we don't pay a bit of debt off and restructure the economy now, if the terms of trade ever turn down on us again we'll cop it right in the neck. </PARA>
<PARA>He is right; we are going to cop it right in the neck. This is what he was saying less than a year ago. He said that the country could not rely on improved commodity prices, and:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to speak for very long. I did not hear Senator Stone's speech, but I understand that he was critical of bracket creep, fiscal drag, or whatever one wants to call it. It is worth noting that on 17 February 1982, the present Leader of the Opposition, Mr Peacock, when he was not a Minister in the coalition Government, said in Parliament:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the last six years the Government has made certain reforms in the taxation field. These have been spelt out by the Treasurer and important among them was the introduction for a time of tax indexation, one of the fundamental elements of Liberal Party policy in recent years. Yet full indexation applied only in 1976-77 and 1977-78 and half indexation of the standard rate scale applied in 1978-79 and 1980-81. Now it has been abandoned altogether. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether Mr Peacock was aware of Senator Stone's views, but it is worth putting on the record what Mr Peacock said about the coalition Government at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three second reading amendments in relation to this package and I will comment briefly on each. The first second reading amendment, which has been moved in relation to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Rebates) Bill, asserts in the first paragraph that this Government is the highest taxing government ever. I have two comments to make on that. Firstly, the level of tax as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) compared with what it was in some previous period should be adjusted for the fact that health expenditure via Medicare is now on the Commonwealth Budget to a much larger extent than it is on the household budget. Secondly and more importantly, it is easy to run a low tax policy if one is willing to run an irresponsible Commonwealth Budget deficit of the order of 5 per cent of GDP, as the previous coalition Government was doing when it was booted out of office. </PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment, which is in relation to the Sales Tax (Exemption and Classification) Amendment Bill, contains a paragraph stating:</PARA>
<PARA>the Government's failure more generally to reform the ramshackle indirect tax system, which is littered with inconsistencies and anomalies . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That clearly signals an intention to introduce a broad-based consumption tax. Cheekiest of all is the amendment to the Income Tax (Arrangements with the States) Repeal Bill. The second reading amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA>the Treasurer is devoid of any policy on Federal State financial relations;</PARA>
<PARA>The 1978 Act which this Bill seeks to repeal was the foundation stone of the Fraser Government's much vaunted new federalism policy of 1975. That policy was to return to the States the power to levy their own income taxes, thereby reducing their demand on the Commonwealth Budget for financial assistance and other grants. It was enacted by the Fraser Government in 1978, but it was never enforced. I would have thought that the survivors of that Government, most of whom are still in the Parliament, would be the last people who should be censorious about any government failing to pursue a meaningful policy on Federal-State financial relations. This was the jewel in the crown of Fraserism-new federalism. The Act was passed and nothing happened afterwards, nothing at all. The people who were responsible for that are the last ones who should be censorious about what any government does in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to say any more, other than to point out what would be fairly obvious by now; that is, the Government will not accept any of the second reading amendments. A number of amendments to two of the Bills will be moved at the committee stage. Some of them will concern privacy matters and will be handled by Senator Tate. The others will be handled by me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I foreshadowed during the second reading debate when dealing with the three Bills cognately, the Opposition has proposed seven pages of amendments to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), which have been circulated to the Committee. All those amendments are in respect of clause 28 of this Bill. As I said in my earlier remarks, these amendments relate to a provision in clause 28 for a major increase in the discretion available to the Commissioner of Taxation to make taxation information in his possession, whether in respect of individuals or corporations, available to certain specified law enforcement agencies, including the Australian Customs Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is the view of the Opposition that this Bill represents yet another erosion of the safeguards against the privacy of taxpayers' affairs. While we would support any reasonable measure-I repeat, any reasonable measure-to assist law enforcement agencies in the pursuit of their duties, we believe that the Government has gone much further in these Bills than can possibly be justified. In saying that, the Opposition is in part influenced by a whole series of events in the history of the current Government. For example, we have had the notorious Australia Card-the so-called ID card-legislation, which was withdrawn ignominiously by the Government because of a major technical defect that we discovered within it. It was finally defeated in this place shortly after I came into the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> We then had the extremely unhappy experience with the tax file number legislation in its original form-the arrogant proposals put forward by the Treasurer, Mr Keating, which required in the end to be very significantly amended by the Opposition with, I am glad to say, the support of the Australian Democrats. Associated with that, there was a major extension of the privacy legislation designed to provide some additional protection other than that which was finally contained in that legislation as a result of the Opposition's amendments to provide an additional degree of protection to the privacy of taxpayers. As I say, those are two major pieces of history which, to say the least, do not argue well for the bona fides of the Government in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the tax file number legislation was eventually passed here late last year, we have had a whole series of very unfortunate incidents, to use no harsher a term, arising out of the administration of that legislation by the Australian Taxation Office. I do not want to appear to be blackguarding the Australian Taxation Office. In my previous career I worked with the people in that Office for many years and I put it on the record that I always found them good colleagues with a proper sense of their duty to the public. But I am bound to say that in the last few years I, too, have had to concede, to those who are more critical in that area than I have been previously wont to be, that some worrying signs are developing in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> It is against that background that the Opposition has considered these provisions in the legislation that is now before the Committee. Clause 28 of the legislation contains, as I said, very wide-ranging provisions which provide for taxation information to be made available by the Commissioner of Taxation to law enforcement agencies, including such bodies as the State and Federal police forces, the State corporate affairs commissions-which, although in one sense law enforcement agencies, are not normally thought of as being in that category; they have much wider-ranging duties and responsibilities-the Comptroller-General of Customs, and the Director of Public Prosecutions. The list goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> Those of us who speak for the Opposition have a rooted objection to what is proposed here. As I said before, we fully accept that if one of these law enforcement agencies has a legitimate reason to believe, as a result of its investigations into a particular matter, that information in or thought to be in the possession of the Commissioner of Taxation would be material to the pursuit of its investigations, we have no objection to an application being made by that agency for access to that information. But we believe it proper-indeed, vital-that any such application should go through a proper process and that it should be made to a judge of the Federal Court of Australia. The judge in question should have the powers to seek further information on the matter, including information from the Commissioner of Taxation, and satisfy himself or herself that the request is a legitimate one and not simply some sort of grand fishing expedition, for example. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand-and I suppose it is conceivable I could be corrected-that the Government is likely to oppose the Opposition's amendment in this area. I find that very disappointing. Indeed, I go so far as to use a stronger term than that: I find it astonishing. First of all, this provision which I am now addressing finds its place in a Bill, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1989, which is otherwise totally devoted to a whole series of quite minor, non-contentious, technical, unassuming-one might almost say `boring'-amendments, the sole purpose of which is to repair the usual string of deficiencies in the Government's previous drafting. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet tucked away at clause 28 of the Bill we find three pages of the most enormous import, matters certainly not capable of being described as in any way consisting solely of technical amendments or fixing up previous deficiencies in the law. We also find that there are some safeguards put into those passages of the clause, but, in our opinion, they are totally inadequate. The fact is that there is presently a crisis of confidence in the Australian community about the security of personal information provided to bureaucracies generally but particularly to this Government's bureaucracy and I have to say again-it gives me no pleasure to do so-particularly the Taxation Office. It is not any part of our purpose in being here simply to stand by and let the Labor Party give the Commissioner of Taxation unfettered discretion in releasing strictly confidential tax data relating to the private affairs of individuals or corporations-even to law enforcement agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> This year has already produced a litany of disasters from the Taxation Office. Back in February or March we had tens of thousands of letters containing tax file number information which were simply posted to the wrong addresses. Even in more recent weeks reports have been coming in to the offices of coalition senators and members and perhaps, for all I know, to Government members and senators and to Australian Democrats, of confidential taxation information being given to people unauthorised to receive it. Quite recently in one case information on over 30 people was reported to have been wrongly supplied to a person in South Australia. As I said in my earlier remarks, we had a case which was made public in the other chamber a week or two ago by Mr Michael MacKellar. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of all of that, we will move these amendments which have been circulated, with three objectives in mind. Firstly, we believe that the responsibility for initiating action for the release of such information should not be within the discretion of the Commissioner. Responsibility for initiating action should rest with the law enforcement agencies concerned and should be based upon some reasonable belief on their part that in the light of investigations that they are carrying out the Commissioner is reasonably believed to have information which would assist them materially with those investigations. Secondly, we also believe that any approach by a law enforcement agency for the release of otherwise confidential tax information should require approval, as I said earlier, from a Federal Court judge and that the judge must be satisfied that the information is relevant to the particular investigation. Finally, the third purpose of our amendment is to ensure that the Privacy Commissioner should monitor the provision of any request for information of this kind and should report to the Minister if he considers the provision of the information constitutes an invasion of privacy. I should say, for the information of the Committee, that these proposals in the Opposition's amendment are closely modelled upon those of a very similar kind in the legislation governing access by the National Crime Authority to taxation information. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of politics are well accustomed to the Australian Labor Party posturing as a party having a deep concern for civil liberties. What in fact these changes that are now being proposed by Mr Keating reveal is a total disregard for such concerns. It is a totally hypocritical regard for such concerns. I wager-I have no basis for saying this but I would not be surprised; perhaps I should be more cautious rather than offering to wager-that very few members or senators on the Labor Party side of either this chamber or the other are aware that these sorts of provisions are in this Bill. I think that, if they had been aware, we would have heard of it before this time by some leak to the press or someone beginning to jump up and down within the Labor Party itself. I should go out of my way to say that there are people within that Party who are genuinely concerned about civil liberties, invasion of privacy and all the things which are infringed by this Bill and the restoration of which our amendment is directed to. I seek leave to move the amendments together. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One matter which has bedevilled the combating of serious crime in Australia is the protection of turf, the undue jealousy that somehow builds up within an organisation such that it holds on to information for itself which may be of use to another law enforcement agency, and we are contemplating several of them in this Bill, in a way which does not allow the pursuit of the person who is responsible for a serious crime either against a person within our community or against some institution, for example the Government itself, in the fact that a major fraud is being practised against it. What has been a pleasing feature of the maturity of the Australian community over the last four or five years has been the gradual realisation that those barriers, those hurdles, that exist between agencies and departments of the national Government, ought to be, by permission of this Parliament of course, lowered or dismantled, or a way should be found by which the hurdle can be circumvented in a reasonable way in order to achieve the aim of combating criminal activity in our community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The clause of the Bill that is being debated at the moment is one more step in that attempt by our community to enable the Commissioner of Taxation to provide information to law enforcement agencies where it is relevant to the pursuit of some trail which will lead to the conviction of a person for a serious offence or in relation to the profits of crime which are generated by engaging in nefarious and illegal activity. I think that is probably the first answer to one of Senator Stone's concerns; in fact, this does not confer an unfettered discretion on the Commissioner of Taxation. It is quite wrong to say that an unfettered discretion is conferred on the Commissioner of Taxation; in fact, the discretion is fettered in the sense that it may be exercised only in order to release information which is relevant to establishing whether a serious offence has been committed or where it is relevant to the proposed making of an order relating to proceeds of crime-the confiscation of the assets and profits of those engaged in criminal activity. So indeed it is a fettered discretion, I would submit, in the sense that it has to be for defined purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, a serious crime is an indictable offence which, generally speaking, is a more serious offence carrying a consequence perhaps of 12 months or more imprisonment. That would be a general way of describing indictable offences, or we would point to them in the various Australian criminal codes or common law schedules of crimes. So it is fettered in the sense that it has to be for a specific purpose. Indeed, if the Commissioner of Taxation releases information otherwise than for those purposes, then he is guilty of an offence against section 16 of the taxation Act, the secrecy provision, and is subject to a very severe and stringent penalty. So I think we have to see this as a fettered discretion in that sense; it has to be for a specific purpose which, if not adhered to, exposes the Commissioner of Taxation not only to a very severe penalty but also to the very danger which I think Senator Stone is speaking of-that is, the ethos, the understanding, that, if information is provided to the Taxation Commissioner, then on the whole one may expect that it be held very confidentially within his organisation. To have that sort of confidence undermined by a case which pointed to a lax implementing of the will of the Parliament in relation to this matter, and the imposition of the penalty under section 16, would bring such discredit on the Taxation Commissioner that I am sure that he would always be most prudent in ensuring that any release of information under this proposal was for the fettered purposes outlined by the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important to note that the information can be used only for intelligence purposes. It cannot be either voluntarily disclosed in a court or required, coerced or compelled to be disclosed in a court of law, except where the offence relates, I think, to a revenue offence or to a matter under the proceeds of crime legislation where a conviction has already been recorded. Once again there is an attempt by the Parliament to say that we believe that it is important that this information be passed from the Taxation Commissioner to one of the nominated law enforcement agencies. But part of the privacy aspect is that the information not be revealed in court, even under coercion, or, as I say, compelled from a person appearing in a particular case of litigation. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, it is true to say that Senator Stone has indicated quite rightly that this measure represents something of-I think he called it-enormous import. He was using it to contrast with the more technical provisions surrounding this clause, or series of clauses. It is of import. There is no doubt about that. It should raise questions in the mind of anybody who is concerned with protecting the privacy of material that is made available to any government agency-in this case, the Taxation Office. For that reason, it is important that one recalls the role of the Privacy Commissioner in relation to the disclosure of this sort of information to a law enforcement agency. Senator Stone may well ask in relation to my first point: how would anyone know that the Taxation Commissioner was putting out information that was not within the fettered confines of the objectives set by the Parliament? That is a fair question. The answer is that every disclosure of such information must be notated on the file. When we passed the privacy legislation last year we ensured--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said that it did not mean an unfettered discretion. I know what I have said, even though I may be more preoccupied with the test match that is going on at the moment. But I am concentrating on this Bill and on the committee stage at the moment. The Privacy Commissioner has a very real role. Information privacy principle 11, which was contained in the privacy legislation passed by this Parliament, provides:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Where personal information is disclosed for the purposes of enforcement of the criminal law or of a law imposing a pecuniary penalty, or for the purpose of the protection of the public revenue, the record-keeper shall include in the record containing that information a note of the disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said, this enables the Privacy Commissioner to audit the Tax Office database to ensure that it is complying with the information privacy principles and to take such steps, whether by way of indicating that a prosecution should be launched or by way of report to this Parliament, if he considers that that particular power is being abused. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe I have indicated the real nature of the discretion, not unfettered, that is being placed in the hands of the Taxation Commissioner in this particular instance. I have indicated that, if he wanders outside the particular objectives for the disclosure of information, he will be guilty of an offence, and the Privacy Commissioner will pick that up by auditing the notations on the files. The information can be used by law enforcement agencies only for the purpose of carrying out their investigations as part of the intelligence and information which they sift through in order to gather admissible evidence, but it cannot be admitted in court as evidence and cannot be either voluntarily given or compelled in some judicial proceeding. I believe in that situation the Parliament is able to prudently carry out this reform, this innovation, this change, to the usual way in which matters are held tight and secret within the Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst it is true that the Opposition has modelled its proposed amendment on a provision dealing with the way in which the National Crime Authority may gain access to taxation information, that particular provision, that methodology, that way of going about things, has never been used, implemented or been the way in which the National Crime Authority has obtained information from the Tax Office. Rather, section 3d (1) of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 has been used. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Notwithstanding anything in a taxation secrecy provision, the Commissioner may communicate information to the Authority for the purposes of a tax related investigation. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that indicates a model which is more akin to that which the Government has adopted in relation to this particular legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The crisis of confidence-the term which Senator Stone adopted in relation to the Tax Office-is probably too strong a term. The legitimate misgivings which are aroused in the public when they read of the unwarranted and negligent, to say the least, disclosure of information about the taxation affairs of citizens that is not authorised and should not be made available can be satisfied by the sort of regime which is put in place and the sorts of safeguards which I have outlined. I ask the Committee to support the Government's proposals. </PARA>

I would like to draw the Senate's attention not simply to the whimsical behaviour of the Labor Party in its recent Liverpool State preselection but also to a preselection coming up this weekend for the Senate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Only two. One was his maiden speech and the other was when he spoke during a matter of public interest debate on 7 November 1985. There have been no speeches since. These two speeches involved a total of 4,200 words. These two speeches, when related to his income over four years, amount to $72 a word. I know of no member of the Senate apart from Senator Morris who is worth $72 a word. I regret if I offended anyone by talking about price but I thought it important. That price would obviously rate highly in the consciousness of those people who have referred these matters to me in the run up to the preselection on Saturday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is not to say that Senator Morris has not participated in other ways in this chamber. In that period he has asked 80 questions. I think that at times the word `Dorothy' has been used in this context. There were two notices of motion. Senator Puplick well remembers one of them. I think that after that one Senator Morris may have lost his enthusiasm for notices of motion. The Senate will remember that that notice of motion involved a congratulatory message to Mr Wran and an expression of regret at his departure as Premier of New South Wales. Senator Puplick very sensibly moved that the matter be dealt with forthwith so that we could all participate with some comment on Mr Wran's record as Premier of New South Wales. I well recall that, as a result of that, the Labor Party voted against Senator Morris's motion coming before this chamber. Of the two notices of motion of Senator Morris, there was certainly a 50 per cent failure rate. Once again, I submit that if people wish to talk about the cost or the price of Senator Morris, it could be looked at as being fairly high. </PARA>

It was quite happy for him not to be here, and I can understand why. But the reality is that with the connivance of his colleagues he was absent for 40 per cent of the votes taken in this place since his election. What was he doing? Why was he not here? We in the Opposition were not given the credit or the benefit of any advice on that score. All we knew when we looked at the figures was that he appeared to have been absent without leave for 40 per cent of the decisions taken by this Senate. It may well be that, had the good senator been here, those decisions would have been different. His contribution, had he made one, may have changed our minds. His attendance, had he been here, may have influenced a vote. But I regret to say that his 40 per cent absence rate made it very difficult.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Obviously, one can put one's face in the door, get one's travel allowance and then depart from this place without actually participating in any divisions, so I had a look at the number of sitting days for which Senator Morris was in fact marked present. I found that, of the 331 sitting days so far, he was absent for 54. That, of course, does not equal 40 per cent; it equals only 15 per cent or so. In other words, although he was marked present for many days, he simply did not turn up to the great bulk of the divisions or, in fact, any of the divisions which took place on the days he was marked present. I simply say to the good senator that these sorts of matters are ones that no doubt have interested those people who have drawn them to my attention, who clearly do not wish the good senator to be there--</PARA>

I will not go into the details of all the other committees. I must say, though, that the honourable senator attends the House Committee quite often, and that is natural, because I have often been interested to see that he attends them, in view of his clear conflict of interest as the President, or an official, of the Liquor and Allied Trades Union of Australia, when he was dealing in what seemed to me to be matters affecting the interests of both the Senate and his labour constituency in a way which certainly had the potential for a conflict of interest.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> He cited the case of Senator Morris, whom he said was receiving a monthly tax-free expense allowance of $450, totalling $5400 a year, and a honorarium of $200 per working day when not engaged in other official capacities, probably totalling a minimum of $30,000 a year. </PARA>

<PARA> It is understood the union's committee of management voted unanimously a month ago to continue Senator Morris's honorarium and expenses, which have been increased with National Wage case increases since 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the members of the committee was Mr Reeves, who votes `yes' to avoid tipping his hand that a challenge was on the way. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee has since decided that the union should pay Senator Morris's legal fees in the action against Mr Reeves. </PARA>
<PARA>Apparently that legal action has been settled. What I wonder-perhaps this is a question which the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) could answer-is whether, when the union pays legal fees such as this, fringe benefits tax is payable? Perhaps I can give notice of that and in Question Time tomorrow we will see whether the Minister has a coherent response to that question. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been advised by those who are trying to ensure that Senator Morris is not re-elected that in the legal case that was settled a whole range of accusations were made. I do not know the merit of them and I do not seek to argue the case for or against them, but I will inform the Senate what was put to the court. No doubt it will be of great interest to those who will be making pre-selection decisions on Saturday or Sunday. It relates to the fact that Senator Morris became secretary of the union after the June 1970 union elections when, together with a team of candidates, including Mr Patrick Reeves, he was successful in ousting the communists from the union at that election. I congratulate him on that result. However, in about 1972 the candidates who ousted the communists commenced contributing sums of money from their union wages to a fund to assist candidates nominated by their group in future union elections. From time to time other persons who were employees of the union and members of that faction would contribute to that fund. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the honourable senator and the union secretary, Ken Jeffreys, were signatories of that fund. The fund was supposed to be used only for the purpose of paying for election expenses for their faction. The members of their faction met regularly and trusted the honourable senator, only inquiring of him as to the balance of the fund from time to time. In court it was asserted that he never gave them an account of the funds. At the end of last year the honourable senator's alleged refusal to provide information in respect of the fund and further, by reason of the honourable senator drawing both the senatorial salary and his salary as president of the union, Mr Reeves and others advised him that, as a result, they would be standing against him at the union elections in June this year. They then requested their contributions from the fund and allegedly the honourable senator refused to pay them their share of their union election fund. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, it was alleged in the court that Mr Reeves was forced to commence action in the Supreme Court to receive his funds and, further, to get some form of account as to how those funds had been disbursed. It was alleged in the court that the honourable senator initially refused to give any form of account, but after many court appearances, he provided a copy of a receipt for funds paid into the trust account of his solicitors, who are the solicitors for the union, for an amount of approximately $103,000. His Honour Mr Justice Waddell, ordered particulars of the fund to be provided. In the affidavit that the honourable senator filed in those proceedings, he advised that accounts had never been kept, notwithstanding the fact that the fund had been in existence for over 15 years. He did not even have any of the invoices that had been presented to the fund to pay the costs of the election. No-one should be surprised by that. Anyone who knows anything about the right wing of the Labor Party in New South Wales will know how to handle donations from Harris-Daishowa and where the Treasurer (Mr Keating) learnt his particular form of accounting which enables him to come up with all sorts of extraordinary results. In any event, the solicitors for Mr Reeves issued a notice to produce upon the honourable senator requiring all records relating to the fund. According to the court records, the honourable senator was able to provide only two passbooks in answer to that request. </PARA>
<PARA> The solicitors for Mr Reeves at the time attempted to serve a subpoena upon the other signatory of the fund, the Secretary of the union, Mr Jeffreys. I understand that Mr Jeffreys has suffered from ill health and there may be a simple answer for the fact that the process server made seven attempts to serve Mr Jeffreys at his home and at the offices of the union. When counsel for Mr Reeves advised Acting Master McLachlan of the Supreme Court of these matters, apparently for the first time in many years he ordered substituted service of the subpoena and found he was satisfied that Mr Jeffreys was attempting to avoid service. I will not go on with the other great detail I have here, beyond saying that counsel for the plaintiff advised the court that on the day--</PARA>

Senator Baume, in a brilliant and very clever speech, has created an atmosphere which certainly casts imputations on the motives of Senator Morris and reflects on him in a very subtle way.

The fact that they are privileged in court and the fact that his statement is privileged here does not thereby convert those statements into statements which are not personal reflections on a senator. In fact, they are personal reflections on a senator. That is the whole tone of the speech and it seems to me that he has gone too far in that respect.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is the funds account held on behalf of the group which had contributed money for union elections. The sum of $20,000 had been removed from the funds account held at the Commonwealth Banking Corporation on the authority of both Mr Jeffreys and the honourable senator. In light of the fact that there was no election for the union during that year, why was the money withdrawn? That is obviously a question that, no doubt, many people would be asking. As I said, the matter has been settled. It is simply part of a considerable volume of transactions. I just wish that I was able to afford the level of mortgages that Senator Morris has-$716,000, according to the documents I have here, which sum seems to emerge from very considerable property transactions which I certainly could not afford.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we have seen Senator Michael Baume indulge in tonight is nothing new in this chamber. It is nothing unusual for one political party, just before a pre-selection, to attack a member of another in order to embarrass him at his pre-selection. Unfortunately, while it is a method often used in this chamber, it is rarely successful; and I do not think Senator Michael Baume has been very successful tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the case against my friend and colleague Senator Morris. It is only a year and a half ago that we in this chamber were lauding one of the greats of the Liberal Party. We said what a wonderful bloke he was-experienced, sharp, and so on. Yet from 1981, when I took my place here, until 1987 he made two speeches. His name was Reg Withers. There was hardly an interjection, hardly a question and hardly a speech from him. When the sad day comes that Senator Morris leaves this chamber we will probably make the same speeches and say that Senator Morris is the Senator Withers of the Labor Party, because that is the point Senator Baume made. It must be a fact that Senator Michael Baume was congratulating Senator Morris because, if he was not, he was putting the boot into the great Reg Withers, who made only two speeches in more time in this chamber-while I have been here-than Senator Morris has been here. The second point that Senator Baume insinuates, in his sneaky and grovelling style--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="1" SPEAKER="The PRESIDENT" NAMEID="10000">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">The PRESIDENT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! Senator Ray, you will have to withdraw that remark.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw that, Mr President. Senator Baume insinuates that there is something wrong with Senator Morris being on the House Committee. I do not attack the farmers on the Opposition benches who sit on rural affairs committees as having a conflict of interest. I do not attack the lawyers who sit on the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. `So what!', is all I can say. The first of Senator Baume's two great points is that Senator Morris has made two speeches. In doing that, Senator Baume is either praising Senator Morris or condemning Senator Withers. His second point concerning conflict of interest, as I say, is total rubbish.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Then he criticises Senator Morris because Senator Morris may derive some income from outside this chamber, with Senator Stone, who has admitted in this chamber that he has been paid for his newspaper articles, chortling away in the background. There was another journalist, I remember, without the courage to put his own name to articles. He used to put the name of Steve Martin to his articles. I wonder who that could be. He did not have the courage to put his own name, but I bet he got paid for the articles-didn't you, Senator Baume? Three times now Senator Baume has made attacks. Firstly, he indirectly attacked Withers. Secondly, in an attack on conflict of interest he attacked half his colleagues on his side of the chamber. Thirdly, we then had the hypocritical cant of accusing other people of earning outside income when he has had his own snout in the trough. I wonder how we judge an individual like that. I wonder what he will go and say to Neil Brown who is a Queen's Counsel. Did he not collect any of his fees? Did he fly around the country when he was on the nose and not on the Opposition's front bench and not collect any money, or is this a snide attack on a well-known Peacock supporter? I wonder. </PARA>
<PARA> I will tell honourable senators of a pretty crude and low attack to which we have never responded in this chamber since the court case. Senator Baume says, `That is typical of a right wing machine; look at Harris-Daishowa'. Why does the honourable senator not look at the decision? The individual concerned was not charged with the serious offence but with the minor one. Why does the honourable senator not look at what the magistrate said in declaring Mr Loosley's honesty and character? That is more than the honourable senator could say for Community Polling and the rest of the skulduggery, as exposed by Starr and others in the New South Wales branch of the Liberal Party. That was much worse. But the honourable senator came into this chamber and tried to have Mr Loosley convicted. He accused us of a cover up when our behaviour was exemplary. That matter was investigated, referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions and taken to the magistrates court, where the lowest possible fine was applied and Mr Loosley's character was cleared. </PARA>
<PARA> But no, Senator Baume, with his nose in the gutter, wants to dredge that up again. He is just lucky that his Party is in government in New South Wales. It is a pity that the honourable senator does not investigate the various malpractices there. The honourable senator has only to come honest once in New South Wales. We had allegations about 400 of the dead voting. We set up an inquiry into Senator Bishop's allegations, amongst other things, and found that there was no basis whatsoever for those accusations. And so it goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not object to the honourable senator coming in here and attacking a colleague just before his preselection; that is part of politics. If Senator Morris cannot stand that heat he will get out of the kitchen; but I know that he will not. It is part of the process. It has rarely worked. It worked with Senator Fred Chaney when John Dawkins endorsed him just before his preselection. That is the only kiss of death I have ever seen work, which does not really say much for Mr Dawkins; it just shows how pathetic the preselection voters were in Western Australia that they fell for the red Fred line. But on the subject of preselection we all have skeletons in the closet; we all have a lot to hide. </PARA>

Senator McGauran may go to the toilet if he wants to, but I would rather he stayed here and listened to this. Senator McGauran got endorsed for the National Party of Australia. Senator McGauran paid for an expensive campaign. Senator McGauran got elected here as a National Party member. However, the crunch came. Three sitting Liberal senators plus Senator McGauran wanted to be on the Opposition ticket. As the Opposition can win only three seats, someone had to drop off. They negotiated for weeks and months and, finally, poor old Senator McGauran was asked to ride off into the sunset to protect three sitting Liberal members. Then, as a result of Liberal preselection, Senator David Hamer was dumped and Senator McGauran is left looking like the greatest mug ever. These things happen. We feel a bit sorry for Senator McGauran with his preselection problems. I am sure that he would have some sympathy for Senator Morris.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have Senator Stone's preselection. What a wonderful event that was. Senator Stone was hired by Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen-I do not know for how much money-as a consultant. Then what happened? Joh was looking for candidates. He said, `Great, we will have you. We will get rid of your trusted friend and colleague, Stan Collard, as he is expendable. Even though he is Leader of the National Party in this chamber, we will give him the flick and we will put in Senator Stone'. And on it goes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting tonight to see just how many failed House of Representatives members have come in here for a vicarious thrill. Senator Short, my Victorian colleague-Carlton supporter though he may be-failed in Ballarat; Senator Baume failed in Macarthur; and Senator Tambling failed in the Northern Territory. Everyone who has been thrown out of the House of Representatives has trotted in here tonight, having secured a preselection for the Senate. The Senate is almost becoming a retired House for the has-beens of the House of Representatives; which is a pity. At least I never succeeded in getting into the House of Representatives. I am in a slightly different category. What we had tonight was all the poor old failures looking for a vicarious thrill and trying to stop someone else's preselection when they have failed in House of Representatives seats. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had some good preselection battles this year. Looking back on it, Liverpool made the semi-finals. There is no doubt about that. There was the fight between Senator Teague, Senator Chapman and Senator Hill, who made the quarter-finals of preselection. But as to the grand final, the all-time champion preselection-there it is, sitting dressed like a canary in the front row. That was the big one, the grandaddy of all preselections. I must say that we on this side had divided loyalties in that preselection. </PARA>

<PARA> There have been other interesting preselections. Does the Senate remember the preselection of the honourable member for Berowra, Dr Harry Edwards? What a top one! Forty-eight people turned up, but when the ballot box was opened up there were 49 votes in it. People are still looking for the forty-ninth voter, the invisible man that voted in the Berowra preselection. The most pathetic preselection of all occurred last week. The Opposition knew that there was a preselection on because Senator Calvert, Senator Watson and Senator Newman were jumping on every item so that they could impress everyone back home. That was the wooden spoon preselection of the year. It was really a terrible choice. </PARA>
<PARA> We had the great Victorian preselection. Victoria has always had the reputation of being the maddest State politically. We had that screaming in the headlines week after week: `Will Macphee win Goldstein?'; `Won't he win Goldstein?'. It went backwards and forwards-Kroger v. Macphee-week in, week out in the media. What happened after the leadership spill? The candidates all buzzed off down to a Richmond restaurant, drank wine with each other, said what good blokes they were and headed off into Deakin to try to win the preselection there. We had Mr Ken Aldred, the failed member for Henty-who got preselection for Bruce in 1983 because his name started with A and for no other reason-finally dumped out of Bruce. Then there was poor old Shippo, Mr Roger Shipton, who was dumped out of Higgins at last, not for Elliott but for an acolyte of Elliott's. We have had a good preselection season and we have seen a lot of victims. </PARA>
<PARA> Next Saturday we are to have another big preselection in Deakin, between Mr Aldred and Mr Macphee. The whole party machine in Victoria is trying to get behind Mr Macphee. They were behind him last preselection, but they had knives in their hands. This time they are behind Mr Macphee. I must correct the record. I saw in the newspapers this morning that Mr Aldred had denied that he tried to join the Australian Labor Party in 1971. He was right on that. Mr Aldred tried to join the Labor Party in 1973. He tried to join the Murrumbeena branch. I personally held up his application because I thought he was a Liberal Party stooge. But a year later he got Liberal Party preselection for the seat of Henty. He is reported in the newspapers this morning as denying that. I say to the preselectors of Deakin: bear that in mind. In 1973 he was almost Comrade Aldred; in 1975 he was MHR for Henty-Liberal Party, if you don't mind. </PARA>
<PARA> We can go back over a lot of preselection history. We will not get particularly far. The Opposition can raise some of our classic preselections. There was the one in Shortland in 1971. Do honourable senators remember Peter Solomon? Was that not a bobby-dazzler? All this comes to tonight is that Senator Michael Baume has put together a motley set of allegations against Senator Morris, none of which has held much water. If that is the best that Senator Baume can do, I hope he does a job on me before my next preselection. </PARA>

What we have heard from Senator Michael Baume is what people generally call a bucket job. It is not a good one, not a competent one, not even a humorous one; it is a pointless one. The reality is that Senator Morris will romp in at his preselection whenever it is held because he has got the support on the ground. No amount of Opposition senators' rather turgid style here tonight will change that. I interrupted listening to honourable senators to listen to the cricket. We were 1 for 47. Fair dinkum, that is the only wicket that has gone down tonight. Honourable senators opposite have really struck right out. We could be very cruel and start picking off the Opposition side.

I close on this note because I had to mention it the other day: Senator Michael Baume is a friend of the Australian Labor Party. I hope that Senator Morris, deep in his heart, can forgive him and find him a friend, because, in our hour of need, when we were struggling in the 1987 election, who came to our aid? Who got on to Tasmanian talkback and who delivered the bacon from the Labor Party? `Mr Steve Martin', alias Senator Michael Baume. Thank you very much, Senator Baume. Then when we thought we were in a bit of trouble-the economy may not be going as well as we would like-the Liberal Party has a leadership spill. And the honeymoon period starts. Who does the coup de grace again? Steve Martin, alias Senator Michael Baume, comes to our aid again. He said, `If I was running a Labor Party campaign, that's the way I'd do it'. Thank you very much. </PARA>
<PARA> I have only this point in conclusion: Senator Michael Baume is not Secret Agent 143 5/8, member of the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party. I have to deny that scurrilous allegation. I hope that Senator Morris, in his heart, will learn to forgive him. He is a friend of the Labor Party. Over time we will find that he has probably increased Senator Morris's votes at the preselection rather than reduced them. </PARA>

We have just heard from Senator Michael Baume an attempt to place on record allegations-all untrue-that opponents of mine in the current election for the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees Union of Australia have been trying to peddle for some time.

Pat Reeves, the person who is leading the unity ticket, who Senator Michael Baume is supporting, asked his solicitor, through his barrister, on four occasions to settle the case. It was settled. Unfortunately, it was settled before a judge of the Supreme Court on the basis that the contents of the settlement could not be divulged. Senator Michael Baume knows that because I spoke to him, through my research assistant, this morning.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The letter states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I have been asked by my instructing solicitors to record certain events which ultimately led to the settlement of the abovementioned matter. </PARA>
<PARA>That is Reeves v. Morris. I continue:</PARA>
<PARA> To the best of my recollection the following occurred:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) The initial and original suggestions for settlement of the matter came from Mr Evatt of Counsel. He invited me, on a number of occasions, to seek instructions to pay his clients various sums of money in settlement of the proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> Having sought those instructions, I then indicated to him that we were not prepared to settle the matter as we were confident of our prospects of success;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Nearer the time of actual settlement, I had a number of general conversations with Mr Haffenden of the Counsel, who by that stage had replaced Mr Evatt, regarding the hearing of the matter. The general prospects of settlement were discussed and I indicated to Mr Haffenden that, as my client was still confident of his prospects of success in the action, I was not instructed to put any offer of settlement. However, I indicated to Mr Haffenden that, if he had instructions to settle the matter, he should put an offer to me. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently, Mr Haffenden put an offer of settlement to my instructing solicitor, Mr Ludemann, and me. On instructions, that particular offer was rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> (iii) With regard to any allegation of fraud against Senator Morris, at one of the earlier Notices of Motion to strike out the Plaintiff's second or third Statement of Claim (which was successful) I invited Mr Evatt, in open Court, to plead any allegation of fraud that was to be alleged and maintained against Senator Morris. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Evatt indicated in open Court, based upon his instructions no doubt, that there was no allegation of fraud being raised against Senator Morris. </PARA>
<PARA> From the evidence led by the Plaintiffs, there was never any evidence of fraud. Further, I note that the full amount that Mr Reeves alleged should have been in the Fund was accounted for. In fact, on uncontradicted evidence, there was a greater amount in the Fund. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter is signed by G. S. Charny, QC. Senator Michael Baume has tried to sling mud in this chamber tonight. He has stepped into the gutter and has tried to implicate me in a situation. He knows that I have preselection coming up on Sunday this week. I am pleased to tell the Senate that I have the full support of my Party in New South Wales-left, right and centre. I can assure Senator Baume that he has done the Liquor and Allied Industries Employees Union in New South Wales the greatest favour of all time by raising this matter tonight because for the last five months we have tried to prove beyond any doubt that he has been involved with the Pat Reeves gang to try to take control of the Liquor Industries Union in conjunction with a person who is running on that ticket by the name of Heggie. Everyone knows who Heggie is. Heggie works for Qantas Airways Ltd at the airport and is the husband of Mrs Heggie, who is the Liberal mayoress of Fairfield Council. She stood unsuccessfully for the Liberal Party in the seat of Cabramatta against a colleague of ours, Mr Newman. </PARA>
<PARA> So let us be clear on where all this stems from. Senator Baume is supporting a person by the name of Bill Wood. Bill Wood was sacked by the union in 1969-not by the union leadership but by the union membership-at the Sydney Town Hall. He was sacked again in 1975 by the Federal Council of the union for the misappropriation of money. That is the sort of person Senator Baume is supporting here tonight. These are the sorts of people whom Senator Baume has put on the record he has been supporting over the last six months. It goes back to 18 months ago when I led him into a trap, when he asked that question and I did not answer it. Senator Graham Richardson would know that because I spoke to the honourable senator about the matter then and told him what it was leading to. He fully agreed that I should not reply to those allegations at that point of time. </PARA>
<PARA> We have exposed Senator Baume tonight for what he is. We have exposed the Pat Reeves unity ticket for what it is-a combination of extreme right wing Liberal Party people trying to take over the liquor industries union. The ballot started yesterday. When my members throughout New South Wales read this transcript tomorrow-now that Senator Baume has delivered his seal of approval and come out of the cupboard-I am quite convinced that the John Morris team will be elected by a substantial majority. I am pleased to say that I am quite confident that on Sunday I will be selected as the No. 1 person from the Labor Party to represent New South Wales. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Monday evening this week, Senator Zakharov tabled a document prepared by an anthropologist entitled On Shaky Ground. She spoke about the Kakadu National Park and the Coronation Hill project in the Northern Territory. Senator Zakharov herself was, I believe, most certainly on shaky ground. Senator Zakharov's assertions about the role of the Northern Territory Minister for Mines and Energy, the Hon. Barry Coulter, in circumstances surrounding the Coronation Hill site are plainly ludicrous. She said that Mr Coulter had put pressure on Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd to put pressure, in turn, on the Jawoyn people for an agreement on sacred sites protection. I have checked this claim with Mr Coulter, who reports that it is merely a rerun of a line promoted by the former director of the Northern Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites Protection Authority, Mr Bob Ellis, a person who subscribes heavily to conspiracy theories. It is simply not true. Barry Coulter, in the face of apparent conflicting interest about the location of a key Aboriginal site, commissioned an anthropologist, Mr Steven Davis, to report to the Northern Territory Government on the facts of the matter. That report did not sit comfortably with Mr Ellis, who sought in many ways to denigrate it and its author with a series of unpleasant personal attacks. Mr Ellis mounted a year-long campaign on this issue against the Northern Territory Government and others, in particular Mr Coulter. Mr David Cooper, the author of the document tabled by Senator Zakharov, is closely identified with Mr Ellis. Senator Zakharov's comments about Mr Davis should be seen in that light.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator also accused Mr Coulter of claiming that a non-Aboriginal person, mining engineer Joe Fisher, had been the custodian of sites in the area for 40 years. It would be a nonsense to suggest such a thing, just as it is a nonsense for Senator Zakharov to suggest that that is what Mr Coulter said. What he said was that Mr Fisher had brought to the attention of the Northern Territory Administration in the early 1950s the fact that a number of sites significant to Aboriginal people were located in the South Alligator Valley, and that most of the information about sacred sites being promoted today by various organisations actually emanated from Mr Fisher's studies. In other words, it was thanks to Joe Fisher that such sites were identified and the first steps taken for protection. As the Aboriginal Land Commissioner has noted, the Jawoyn people had not had any connections with the region for many years before Mr Fisher's research. Senator Zakharov has sought to make mischief out of this undoubted fact. She is acting as a mouthpiece for white activists in this matter, and not on behalf of the Aboriginal people themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Zakharov points out that she has drawn upon the report which she has tabled, titled On Shaky Ground, authored by Mr David Cooper of the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Protection Authority. Senator Zakharov makes it clear that Mr Cooper's report has made use of the original video material compiled by Mr Davis in the course of his inquiry. The document which Senator Zakharov tabled states on page 4 that the video `is currently the subject of the legal action'. The Aboriginal Sacred Sites Protection Authority gave an undertaking to honour restrictions on the usage and availability of this material, which is the subject of legal proceedings before the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. That undertaking does not appear to have been honoured. Mr Cooper's paper, tabled by Senator Zakharov, and the honourable senator's subsequent use of that material, is a breach of those undertakings. Senator Zakharov clearly abused her parliamentary privilege and has put herself above the law in ignoring the restrictions placed on this material in the process of Supreme Court proceedings. Mr Davis has at all times complied with the undertakings not to disclose any such material which is subject to the present proceedings in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Zakharov also states that a photograph of a restricted Bula painting which recently appeared in the Australian newspaper she believed to have originated from Mr Davis. This is absolutely false. Mr Davis did not take that photograph, nor did he send that photograph to the Australian or any other publication. Senator Zakharov states that she was disturbed to discover material in the video shown to women. Senator Zakharov may recall that Mr Davis pointed out to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts that the video tape was, in terms of Aboriginal tradition, restricted and should not be seen by Aboriginal women or uninitiated men and that it was left to Senator Zakharov to make her own decision as to whether she should see it or not. Senator Zakharov will also recall that she stated that it was her standing as a senator which she felt would exempt her from the traditional Aboriginal restrictions which apply to women. She made her own decision to see the video tape material. However, Senator Zakharov's conversation with Mr Davis on this point was not recorded in the Hansard as Senator Zakharov had failed to direct the recorders to proceed with recording the conversation at the outset of the in camera evidence. It was only when Senator Zakharov was reminded by Senator Townley of this lapse in recording of the in camera material that she then directed the recording to continue. However, it would seem that Senator Zakharov now conveniently has used her ineptitude in the management as a chairperson of the Committee to absolve herself from having breached traditional Aboriginal restrictions. Let me remind Senator Zakharov that within Aboriginal tradition the traditional penalty for the breach of such traditional restrictions by a woman would normally be death by spearing. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Maybe not. I expect that Senator Zakharov hopes that her position as a senator still exempts her from Aboriginal restrictions. Senator Zakharov also uses the same argument when she states that the Aboriginal custodians have been denied natural justice in that the video transcript, as presented by Mr Davis, was not made available to the Aboriginal custodians to check the integrity of the transcript.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Zakharov should also be reminded that Mr Davis pointed out in that same initial in camera conversation, which she failed to have recorded, that it was only the viewing of the video material which was restricted in Aboriginal material as it shows paintings and elements which were restricted within Aboriginal tradition. Mr Davis clearly pointed out that he did not wish the transcripts of the video conversations to be restricted but, rather, a public document. It was Senator Zakharov who asked for the transcript material to be incorporated into the Hansard as in camera evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> When the in camera proceedings before the Senate Committee on Wednesday, 29 October 1986, were forwarded to Mr Davis for his perusal, he contacted the Secretary to the Committee and again pointed out that it was not his wish that the transcript of the video tape be held in camera but, rather, that it be a public document. He was advised that it was best for the time being to leave the material in the in camera evidence and that the option would be available in the future to have the restrictions lifted and the material subsequently be made publicly available. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Zakharov states that Mr Davis's report resulted in an inquiry into the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Authority. Senator Zakharov further points out that the Sacred Sites Review Committee, which conducted the inquiry into the Authority, did not include the issue of Coronation Hill in its final report. If Senator Zakharov had researched her information adequately, she would have found that the Review Committee decided that it would not address the matter of Coronation Hill in its report as the Review Committee simply did not want to prejudice the outcome of proceedings before the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory, and Senator Zakharov would have done well to have followed the same lines. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw the Senate's attention tonight to the parlous condition of the Cain Government's WorkCare scheme in Victoria and to give the Senate some details of just one of the huge number of rorts that are making a major contribution to this situation. WorkCare in Victoria is but a step away from bankruptcy. The scheme has been in existence for only some five years, but already its unfunded liabilities have climbed to around $4 billion. These are the liabilities of the taxpayers of Victoria. In the last 24 hours, Premier Cain has put Victorians on notice for a horror State Budget in August. He is reported in today's press as having said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Whatever way you look at it the numbers just don't add up. We're going to be spending less this year than last year because we haven't got it to spend. </PARA>
<PARA>That would have to be the understatement of the year. When we take into account WorkCare's $4 billion of unfunded liabilities, we realise that not only WorkCare but the Government of Victoria is bankrupt. The Victorian Government has shown a cynical disregard for the interests of the State by refusing to take action on WorkCare. The Treasurer, Mr Jolly, has had a report by an all-party parliamentary committee inquiry into WorkCare since July 1988. He has taken no action on it whatsoever. The reason is that the Victorian unions, now led by John Halfpenny in his capacity as Secretary of the Victorian Trades Hall Council, have refused to give their agreement to cutting out the scandalous waste, inefficiency and fraud that is occurring. I use the word `fraud' advisedly. There is mounting evidence to show the extent of that fraud. Tonight I want to reveal just one example of it, but that example can be multiplied one thousand fold. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of the work which has led to these disclosures has been done by Victorian Liberal State shadow Ministers and, in particular, Mr Phil Gude and Mr Alan Stockdale. They deserve the thanks of every Victorian for their efforts. So serious is the situation that Mr Gude has today called for the indemnification of all people employed by doctors, health professionals, lawyers, claims agents and private investigation firms who come forward with information to assist in stopping the multimillion dollar rip-offs that are occurring. This call by Mr Gude follows a similar one last week by the Victorian Allied Health Professionals Association. Two members of that association, who were employees of a private rehabilitation provider, were sacked last month for providing information to the Victorian Accident Rehabilitation Council, known as VARC. Despite repeated requests, Victorian Accident Rehabilitation Council has not been prepared to provide any form of indemnity to the two persons. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite intolerable that the only casualties where rorts and abuses by employing private rehabilitation providers are exposed are the employees who had the courage and the integrity to expose the rorts and abuses. According to advice I have received, there is strong evidence to indicate that VARC is engaged in a conspiracy designed to cover up a multimillion dollar Workcare rehabilitation scandal. The Victorian Treasurer has not even been prepared to hold a full public inquiry into what may well be the biggest public scandal ever in Victoria's history. The Premier, Mr Cain, should sack Mr Jolly immediately if he has any sense of propriety or integrity and any concern at all for the interests of Victoria, because the Treasurer is guilty of gross negligence. So too is the Premier. </PARA>
<PARA> I want now to provide the Senate with details to support the grave allegations I am making tonight. I will do this by reference to the case involving the two dismissed employees of a private rehabilitation provider, to which I have already referred. The two dismissed employees are Mr Nigel Reece and Mr Brendan O'Kane. The firm which employed them until their dismissal last month is CPS Rehabilitation Service, a firm of occupational health consultants. The firm has offices in Victoria, Sydney and Adelaide. Mr Reece was the firm's manager for the Ford Motor Co. account. Mr O'Kane was a rehabilitation consultant at the Ford Motor Co. of Australia in Geelong. In March of this year, and again in May, Mr Reece advised the General Manager (Rehabilitation Management) of VARC, and VARC's legal advisers, Sly and Weigall, in writing that many hundreds of CPS invoices were billed to the WorkCare rehabilitation payments agency for services provided by specific CPS consultants when, apparently, no such service was in fact provided by the specified consultant. Mr Reece also advised VARC that all such non-commencement billings to the WorkCare rehabilitation payments agency, and other authorised payment agencies, were stored in the CPS computer database, and that this was readily accessible. </PARA>
<PARA> On 30 March 1989 Mr Reece wrote to VARC advising that between November 1987 and mid-1988 CPS received overpayments for WorkCare billed services totalling $97,550. This sum comprised duplicated payments, overpayments and payments for non-CPS cases. Mr Reece said that CPS isolated these overpayments from general revenue and held them in a `suspense account'. At the end of the 1987-88 financial year, the $97,550 was transferred out of the suspense account, written into profit, then transferred back into the suspense account. In November 1988, on the decision of a full CPS board meeting, the total was transferred into general revenue, and hence into profit. Mr Reece also provided this and related information to Sly and Weigall in a conference. I am advised that he has not been given access to the transcript of that conference. On 18 January 1989, in conference with Sly and Weigall, Mr Bernard O'Kane provided additional evidence of fraudulent billing by CPS. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, it is a very detailed and involved case and I seek leave to table the following documents, having sought the Government's permission: the record of the conference held on 18 January 1989 between Mr O'Kane and Sly and Weigall; a file note by Mr Reece dated 18 January 1989; a memorandum dated 14 March 89 from Mr Reece to VARC and to Sly and Weigall outlining details of the CPS overpayments; a letter from Mr Reece to VARC dated 30 March 1989 giving further details of the overpayments; a letter dated 4 May 1989 plus attachments from Mr Reece to VARC giving details of specific CPS overpayment invoices billed to WorkCare Rehabilitation Payments Agency; and a letter dated 31 May 1989 from the principal of CPS to Mr Reece offering a settlement on condition that Mr Reece dropped his legal action against CPS for unfair dismissal. Part of the CPS offer was that, `No further statements whatsoever regarding CPS to be made to any third party by you', and that, `The terms of this agreement be kept confidential'. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Reece, needless to say, has rejected this brazen bribery attempt out of hand. If the evidence I have provided to the Senate tonight is typical of the fraud that is occurring within the WorkCare system in Victoria--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has received 435 pieces of correspondence conveying complaints over the $2 coin. Some of this correspondence reflected the views of more than one person. On the basis of the records available, there were at least 206 written complaints about the $1 coin. The bulk of the complaints about both $1 and $2 coins were received in the period immediately following their issues to the public.</PARA>
<PARA> The experience in Australia and elsewhere is that it takes some time for people to become accustomed to a change in the currency, something which affects everyone's daily life. While it is common for there to be complaints immediately following any change to the coinage, these usually decline as people adjust to the change.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) With regard to an article in the Australian Financial Review entitled `Plastic power ready to take over shopping', will every major bank, building society and credit union in Australia be linked by a cashless, plastic network before the end of the month of March 1989.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The electronic funds processing at point of sale (EFTPOS) systems, which allow customers to use plastic cards to transfer funds from their accounts with financial institutions directly to retailers' accounts, are becoming more widespread in Australia although the volume of transactions carried on EFTPOS systems is still not large. A key feature of EFTPOS developments in Australia has been the increasing number of linkages between the systems of different financial institutions. Most of the EFTPOS systems of the major and state banks have now been linked. Most other banks and most building societies and credit unions are able to offer their customers access to the terminals of at least one of the major or state banks.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The development of EFTPOS system has been closely monitored by the Australian Payments System Council. The Council, established by the Treasurer in 1984 and chaired by a senior officer of the Reserve Bank, is required to foster interconnection between payments systems and to ensure that competition amongst all financial institutions benefits consumers. In September 1986 Commonwealth and State Ministers endorsed a code of conduct on electronic funds transfer systems drawn up by a Working Group comprising representatives of Commonwealth and State Governments. The code carefully defines the rights and obligations of users and providers of electronic funds transfer systems (including EFTPOS). The code requires institutions which issue plastic cards for customer use in electronic terminals to, inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) establish in their electronic banking contracts certain rights and obligations, particularly in the important areas of liability for unauthorised electronic transactions and liability for technical malfunctions;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) follow certain minimum information disclosure requirements in providing these services; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) establish procedures to ensure that disputed electronic transactions are centrally recorded.</PARA>
<PARA> The code is not statutory but the conditions of use documents issued by institutions to cover users of plastic cards in electronic terminals are legally binding. The Working Group which drew up the code has been liaising with financial institutions since 1986 to ensure that card issuing institutions publish conditions of use documents which conform with the requirements of the code.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Community Services and Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I have provided Senator Vallentine with a listing of studies known to the Australian Radiation Laboratory.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that the available studies show that there are two major pathways for exposure of mineral sands workers to radiation: external gamma radiation for some of the concentrates, particularly monazite and xenotime, and internal radiation from radioactivity in dust inhaled during the secondary separation process. The radiation arises from the natural thorium and uranium series radionuclides present in the ore.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian studies show that, in general, radiation doses received by workers are likely to be below the limits recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council. However, in some areas of the secondary separation process, there are high concentrations of airborne dust containing radioactivity. Continuous occupation of these areas without respiratory protection equipment could lead to unacceptably high intake of radioactivity by inhalation. Consequently, dust masks should be worn by workers in these areas and occupancy should be restricted by designating them `controlled areas'. I am advised that the industry is investigating strategies for inhibiting dust generation at source.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No epidemological studies of mineral sands workers are available to my Department.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I am advised that no evidence is available on possible synergistic effects of the materials listed in (1) with known carcinogens. The subject has been studied in a related area, namely that of lung cancer risk from inhalation of radon daughters. There is evidence to suggest a synergistic effect between radon daughter exposure and cigarette smoking. (See `Lung cancer risk from indoor exposures to radon daughters'. Publication 50 of the International Commission on Radiological Protection, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1987).</PARA>
<PARA> (4) A detailed understanding of the mechanism of cancer induction by radiation is not yet available. Radiation induced cancers could be associated with the materials listed in (1) through their various contents of thorium series and uranium series radionuclides. The extent to which radiation is an initiator or promoter of cancer is not clear, although there is some evidence to suggest that the available data is best described by models which attribute an initiating role to radiation. (See `Health effects models developed from the 1988 UNSCEAR report', publication NRPB-R226, National Radiological Protection Board, Chilton, UK, 1989, and `Sources, effects and risks of ionizing radiation', UNSCEAR 1988 Report to the General Assembly, United Nations, New York, 1988).</PARA>
