<TITLE>Pornography</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That we the undersigned, having great concern that Canberra is now the ``Porn Capital'' of Australia and because of the spread of moral pollution in our nation, call upon the Federal Government to introduce immediate legislation in support of existing State Legislation:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. To provide strict controls over the importation, production, sale, hire or mailing of video-cassettes particularly in the A.C.T., with the open sale and/or hire of only G, PG, and M-rated video cassettes; and the total prohibition of the sale or hire of R rated video-cassettes, so that R rated films can only be viewed in an adult theatre by persons over 18 years. We totally reject the concept of ``X'' rated or ``N.V.E.'' rated video-cassettes, which would allow the legal sale and hire of hard-core pornographic videos for viewing in the homes of our nation, which would endanger our children; and</PARA>
<PARA> 2. To give whole-hearted support to Senator Walter's Private Member's Bill to implement the recommendations of the Select Committee on Videos; and</PARA>
<PARA> 3. To dramatically improve the Federal Attorney-General's Guidelines for Classification of Video tapes/discs, which restrict the importation, production, sale or hire, screening in private homes and especially mailing by Australia Post, so as to include the total prohibition of any pornographic, obscene or blasphemous video cassette, or film which exploits or degrades women as sex objects, or which contain child pornography, bestiality, sodomy, group sex or violent sex acts with women, such as rape and pack rape, sadism and torture, etc., or which promotes homosexuality or lesbianism;</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honourable House will protect our society, especially women and children from moral pollution and its harmful effects,</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, that:</PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned about the increase in violent television programmes for children and particularly those programmes promoting violent toys that are available for sale in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray;</PARA>
<PARA> That you support the Broadcasting (Prohibition of Violent Programmes for Children) Act 1988 which has been presented by WA Independent Senator for Nuclear Disarmament, Jo Vallentine. This act aims to prohibit the broadcasting of children's TV programmes that are violent and that promote toys modelled on characters, weapons or other war accessories which are also available for sale in Australia.</PARA>

<TITLE>Kangaroo 89 Joint Military Exercise</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable President and members of the Senate in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned shows:</PARA>
<PARA> From June to September 1989 Australia will host the Kangaroo '89 joint military exercises involving 28,000 Australian and United States troops from the air, navy and land forces;</PARA>
<PARA> The exercise co-incides with a massive increase in Australian military expenditure on frigates, submarines, helicopters, and joint military exercises;</PARA>
<PARA> Your Government's own defence paper states that Australia is without direct threat of invasion;</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian and New Zealand Governments are prepared to intervene militarily in the Asia Pacific region;</PARA>
<PARA> And believing that the Kangaroo '89 exercises are designed to:</PARA>
<PARA> Stimulate fear of invasion in the public;</PARA>
<PARA> Encourage acceptance of increasing Australian militarisation and continued dependence on the US alliance;</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners request that the Senate, in parliament assembled, should:</PARA>

<PARA> Allocate the $230 million due to be spent on the exercise to public health, housing, education, and other urgently needed social and welfare projects.</PARA>

<TITLE>Television Transmission, Tasmania</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned residents of Tasmania respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the mountainous terrain and geography of Tasmania makes VHF television transmissions the most suitable for the State;</PARA>
<PARA> That more than 30,000 Tasmanians will have to purchase new television receivers and new antennae if commercial television in the State is forced to change from the VHF to the UHF band;</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore request that the requirement by the Department of Transport and Communications to force Tasmania's two commercial television stations to change from the VHF to the UHF band by 1993 be immediately rescinded.</PARA>

<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>The Honourable President and members of the Senate in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA> Medicare cannot pretend to be a Universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access to items 6469, 274 and 275 on the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners humbly pray and request that the Senate will vote against any attempt to restrict access to abortion or any abortion-related items on the Medicare schedule.</PARA>

<PARA> That your petitioners deplore the Federal Government's decision to remove 53 Pharmaceutical drugs-including the best available for the treatment of high blood pressure, cancer, epilepsy, high cholesterol and uneven heartbeat,-and place them for cost saving reasons only on a special list requiring Authority from a Canberra bureaucrat, and;</PARA>
<PARA> that we believe a patient's doctor is clearly the best judge for medication needed for their particular illness and that it is therefore wrong and unfair to force that doctor to waste valuable time referring to a case to a person in Canberra who has no personal knowledge of that case.</PARA>

<PARA> community toy libraries provide a valuable service in the educational and social development of children;</PARA>
<PARA> the financial hardship facing Australian families today is making it increasingly difficult for families to provide for toys and other such educational aids from the family budget;</PARA>
<PARA> we call upon the Government to exempt community run toy libraries from the 20 per cent sales tax payable on toys in a bid to reduce the effect of declining living standards on child development.</PARA>

<PARA> 1. the right of the people of a country to make law independent of politicians should be a basic and independent right;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. consequently there is an urgent need for constitutional reforms.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled, should:</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament; the humble petition of the undersigned showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> that Kingsford-Smith Airport is becoming increasingly congested and existing facilities are inadequate to handle the number of aircraft or their passengers.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government's plans to divert aircraft from Mascot to Bankstown and/or increase landing charges for peak periods will do little to relieve congestion and will place enormous financial and other burdens on commuter airlines and their passengers.</PARA>
<PARA> We therefore call on the Federal Government to take heed of airline and travel industry warnings and-</PARA>
<PARA> 1. give immediate approval for the construction of a third runway at Mascot</PARA>
<PARA> 2. upgrade existing radar and other air-traffic control facilities to enable Australia's high safety record to be maintained.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That your petitioners are offended and outraged by the direction of the AIDS Programme in Tasmania, in that it actively promotes Homosexual Acts and in particular anal intercourse, and that taxpayers money is being used to fund literature which directly promotes homosexual behaviour as a normal and desirable human activity.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore urgently and strongly request that the Federal Government and the Minister for Health review the National AIDS Programme and withdraw funding for this literature, and from any other aspects of the AIDS Campaign which encourages or condones anal intercourse.</PARA>

<TITLE>Recycled Paper Products: Taxation</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Fewer trees would need to be used for the production of paper if recycled paper was more readily affordable and available.</PARA>
<PARA> Presently the expense of producing recycled paper is a deterrent to its widespread use.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the components of the cost of recycled paper is government taxes on this paper.</PARA>
<PARA> By abolishing any tax on recycled paper, the Government could reduce the cost of recycled paper, and encourage more people to use it.</PARA>
<PARA> This would result in less trees being destroyed in the production of paper.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore request that the Senate urge the Government to abolish tax on recycled paper products, in order to encourage people to use recycled paper, and save more of our trees.</PARA>

<PARA> The systematic cultural genocide of the peoples affected must be prevented.</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore your petitioners humbly pray that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. the Australian Parliament establish whether or not Romania has satisfied fully her obligations under the Treaty of Trianon (1920) and the Peace Treaty of Paris (1947),</PARA>
<PARA> 2. if found that Romania violates these agreements, the signatures representing Australia jointly or singularly be withdrawn from the thus invalidated documents,</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is today providing its substantive response to the unanimous report on vocational registration of general practitioners by the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance. Six sitting days' notice of motion is being provided so that the Government's response can be considered in detail by the Opposition and the Australian Democrats prior to the issue being debated on Thursday next week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is pleased to announce that it has accepted all of the recommendations of the Committee, and that it has been advised by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) that the college also accepts all of the Committee's recommendations. Further, the Australian Medical Association has responded positively to the report, and has advised that it `recognises the need for involvement of the AMA in the light of the recommendations', and discussions are under way about AMA involvement with the Government and the RACGP in the Standing Review Group on General Practice.</PARA>
<PARA> As was recommended by the Committee, included with the Government's response are the draft regulations proposed under sections 3f and 3g of the legislation to establish the proposed vocational registration eligibility committees and the vocational registration appeal committee. The draft eligibility criteria, as defined by the RACGP and referred to in the regulations, are also attached.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government also gives its commitment that at the earliest possible opportunity section 3h will be amended to require the Minister to exercise his powers under that section by regulation, not determination. This package therefore fulfils the requirements set by the Select Committee prior to proclamation of the legislation. I commend the Government's response to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA> (ii) that there has been a general union policy of forceful opposition to Troubleshooters over a number of years with an aim of driving the company out of business,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) that the unions involved, by threats of industrial action, directly and deliberately induced builders to break their contracts with Troubleshooters, contrary to the common law and to act contrary to Section 45e of the Trade Practices Act 1974, and</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) that Troubleshooters is entitled to damages;</PARA>

<PARA> (e) condemns the Hawke Government for its total failure to support small business against the intimidatory and predatory attacks of militant unions; and</PARA>
<PARA> (f) notes that Mr Justice Woodward's judgment is fully consistent with the Liberal and National Parties' approach to industrial relations, namely to encourage greater flexibility in the labour market and to provide greater opportunity to people in the workforce to negotiate mutually acceptable terms and conditions of work leading to greater efficiency, productivity and competitiveness.</PARA>

<PARA> (i) a large and growing foreign debt (now $108 billion net) increasing the likelihood that Australian borrowers could experience difficulty in servicing that debt,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the fact that Australia's debt service ratio has fallen out of line with other AA1-rated countries since the last downgrade in 1986,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the Government's inability to control excessive domestic demand growth,</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) insufficient progress in Australia in generating additional export-earning capacity and in restructuring industry to achieve productivity gains,</PARA>
<PARA> (v) the continued slow pace of structural adjustment, which makes Australia ill-positioned to weather the next downturn in the global business cycle without further large increases in foreign debt,</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) intransigent rigidities in Australia's labour and transport markets which constrain our international competitiveness;</PARA>
<PARA> (vii) the failure of the Government to apply a total policy mix that is sufficiently rigorous to balance the external accounts,</PARA>
<PARA> (viii) the Government's excessive reliance on tight monetary policy bolstering the Australian dollar, thereby stimulating imports and discouraging exports, and</PARA>
<PARA> (ix) the failure of the Government's 1989-1990 Budget to decisively address the issues of external imbalance and productivity;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) recalls that, on 27 September 1988, the Acting Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) hailed the veracity of Moody's credit ratings; and</PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition has decided to reintroduce this Bill to give the Government and the Australian Democrats another opportunity to ensure that there are effective sanctions for those who defy the orders and decisions of the Industrial Relations Commission. The current pilots dispute provides a perfect illustration of the powerlessness of the Industrial Relations Commission to enforce its directions. The only sanction available to the Commission was to cancel the pilots award-something which predictably did nothing to bring about a cessation of industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA> Two weeks ago, when this Bill was last brought before the Senate, I pointed out that no amount of jawboning by the Minister for Industrial Relations could hide the fact that the Government had deliberately and knowingly left itself virtually powerless in the face of a sustained campaign of industrial action such as that being pursued by the pilots. I pointed out that, given the lack of effective compliance provisions, there would be little else the Government could do other than seek to tough out the dispute, which I predicted would cause major disruption to the lives of thousands of Australians and seriously damage the Australian tourist industry. My prediction has been borne out totally by the events of the last two weeks. Tourism-this country's major earner of foreign exchange-has been dealt a massive blow by the dispute, a blow from which it may take years to recover. The senior analyst from Moody's, Roger Nye, in explaining why that agency has yet again downgraded Australia's credit rating, has referred to the current pilots dispute as an example of Australia's failure to achieve structural adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill offers an alternative to the current debilitating dispute. It contains effective compliance provisions that would ensure that directions of the Industrial Relations Commission to stop industrial action, such as the one made earlier in the pilots dispute by Justice Coldham, are properly enforceable. The Bill is still very relevant to this dispute. The mere cancellation of the pilots award does not remove the jurisdiction of the Industrial Relations Commission to deal with the industrial dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill would insert a new division into the Industrial Relations Act 1988. Under this division, the Commission would be empowered to issue directions to stop or prevent industrial action. Such a direction could be given to any party to the industrial dispute, a member, officer or employee of an organisation that is a party to the industrial dispute, or any other person engaged in industrial action in relation to the industrial dispute. Where, on the application of the Minister or a party to the industrial dispute, the Federal Court is satisfied that a person has breached or is intending to breach a direction of the Industrial Relations Commission, the Court may issue an injunction enforcing the direction. </PARA>
<PARA> Failure to comply with such an injunction would constitute contempt of court and would be punishable with the same power as is possessed by the High Court in respect of contempt of that Court. This would enable the Federal Court to issue heavy fines to any union or other body or person in breach of an injunction, and could lead to the eventual sequestration of assets, if the fines were not paid. The chief advantage of this approach is that it would provide a quick and effective remedy to unacceptable industrial action. Speed is of the essence in any effective sanctions procedure, as the primary aim should be to bring about the cessation of the conduct in question, not penalise those taking part in the action months or years later. Experience has shown repeatedly that when organisations which are acting illegally are faced with the reality of such heavy fines for defying court orders they quickly come to their senses. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, any person who suffers loss or damage as a result of conduct in breach of a direction, may sue the person or organisa-tion concerned in the Federal Court. This could have obvious relevance to disputes such as the current airlines dispute, where many innocent third parties are caught up in a struggle between a union and an employer. Action taken in breach of a direction by an officer, employee, member or agent of an organisation is deemed to have been taken by the organisation, unless the organisation establishes that it took all reasonable steps to prevent the person from taking the action. These provisions would replace the existing bans clause provisions which were described by the former Minister for Industrial Relations, Ralph Willis, as having `fallen into disrepute' and as being `substantially moribund'. Two weeks ago I said that the Government had no real argument against the need for effective compliance provisions. I quoted Mr Willis, who pointed out when introducing the 1987 Industrial Relations Bill:</PARA>
<PARA> An essential element of any industrial relations system which provides benefits and protections to registered organisations and their members is that there should be an effective means of ensuring adherence to the principles on which the system is founded and compliance with the decisions of its institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>Since then the Government has openly backed the use of legal remedies against the pilots. Senator Aulich, who spoke in the debate two weeks ago will have to eat his words:</PARA>
<PARA> the worst possible thing to do to improve industrial relations in this country is to get people into the courts and the common law system. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, it is ironic that the Government has opposed the introduction of effective legal sanctions into the conciliation and arbitration system-yet supported the use of external remedies such as the common law and the Trade Practices Act-an astounding reversal from its position in 1987 when it took the view that there should be no sanctions available outside the system. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that any system of conciliation and arbitration whereby the decisions of the arbitrator effectively only bind one side of the employer-employee equation is clearly defective. The Government recognised this, and its 1987 legislation contained provisions that would have provided a directions/injunctions procedure along the lines contained in this Bill. Those provisions were flawed, containing as they did the potential for lengthy delay. And of course they were eventually withdrawn, under pressure from the Australian Council of Trade Unions, which would not accept any improvement in the compliance powers of the Industrial Relations Commission, that were not accompanied by the emasculation of common law and Trade Practices Act remedies. As a result the existing Act contains the `moribund' provisions referred to by Mr Willis. This Bill would provide Government, employers and the Commission real teeth to ensure that Commission decisions are adhered to and would provide real protection against those who try to pursue their ends through industrial blackmail. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government and the Australian Democrats in the debate on this Bill two weeks ago raised a number of issues concerning the detailed drafting of this Bill. The principle underlying this Bill is that there should be an effective directions and injunctions procedure which would provide a quick and effective remedy for those who are suffering from industrial action in defiance of the Industrial Relations Commission. If the Government or the Democrats have concerns about the detail of the Bill it would be proper to consider these in the committee stage, after the Bill has received a second reading. It would be quite inappropriate to throw out the principle underlying the Bill for the sake of details of the sort raised in particular by Senators Cooney and Maclean. I indicated, for example, during the debate on this Bill two weeks ago, that I would wish to consider some of the points raised by Senator Cooney, such as the breadth of penalties that would be imposed for contempt of court. It might be appropriate for example totally to exclude any question of possible imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill seeks to implement an important element of the Coalition's industrial relations policy. Our policy is based on the principle that where employers and their employees see a mutual benefit in doing so, they should be free to sign legally binding voluntary agreements on pay and conditions. Those agreements will have the force of awards and will contain a provision that no industrial action be engaged in during the course of the agreement. We believe this approach will enable pay and conditions to be related directly to the circumstances of the individual enterprise, something which is not possible under an across the board approach. It is not part of our policy to permit one side of the industrial fence to use industrial muscle to coerce the other into reaching an agreement against their own wishes and interests. That is why our policy is explicit in requiring effective legal sanctions when parties are abusing their industrial strength. </PARA>
<PARA> Where a mutually satisfactory agreement is not possible, employers and employees remain within the conciliation and arbitration system. We do not seek to dismantle that system, though we would expect that as the advantages of voluntary agreements come to be appreciated, more and more people will move in that direction. But it will not be an overnight change. Because the Industrial Relations Commission will remain and will continue to play a major role in wage determination and dispute settlement it is essential for it to have the power to enforce its decisions and directions. This Bill seeks to rectify a major defect in our industrial relations system. It is a defect that both the Government and the Democrats have been willing to acknowledge in the past. Both the Government and the Democrats can show they are serious about improving the operation of our industrial relations system by supporting this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Geneva Conventions Amendment Bill 1989 is set out in identical terms to the bill of the same name introduced by the government in the House of Representatives earlier this year. The purpose of that bill was to amend the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 so as to enable Australia to ratify Protocols 1 and 2 additional to the Conventions. Before ratifying the Protocols, it was necessary to enact domestic legislation which created offences in regard to breaches. </PARA>
<PARA> On 7 March 1989, the Opposition announced that it would reject the legislation because the United States has not ratified the Protocol and `this has obvious and direct implications for the defence of Australia'. It was also claimed that ratification would unreasonably hamper the armed forces and that Mr Hawke's admittance-in his much publicized `my dear Ron' letter to ex-President Reagan-that ratifying the Protocols posed a number of `operational complexities' meant the legislation was flawed. </PARA>
<PARA> This Geneva Conventions Amendment Bill 1989 seeks to give legislative effect to recent advances in international humanitarian law. The Australian Democrats believe that, as such, it is supported by the general community. I am introducing this private member's Bill, therefore, to keep faith with the many groups and individuals in this country who have worked hard to have this Protocol established and to give Senators a chance to vote on an important bill which has been stalled in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> International humanitarian law is concerned with the lives and welfare of individual human beings in peace as well as in war. The written law which deals with the fate of human beings during armed conflict has been developed over the last 120 years. </PARA>
<PARA> It began at the battle of Solferino in 1859, in which Austrian, French and Italian armies were engaged. More than 300,000 soldiers fought the battle and there were at least 40,000 killed and wounded. A young Swiss banker, Henry Dunant, saw what happened after the battle. He wrote a book titled `A memory of Solferino'-the theme of which was to urge his readers to, if not prevent, at least, alleviate the horrors of war. </PARA>
<PARA> His book shocked the world, led to the founding of the Red Cross and to the development of written international codes of conduct during armed conflicts. The first practical result of Dunant's efforts was an international conference which led to the formation of the International Red Cross. </PARA>
<PARA> The Swiss Government, urged on by Dunant and the international committee which later developed into the International Committee of the Red Cross invited other governments to attend an international diplomatic conference to draft an agreement. Diplomats from 15 European countries and an observer from the USA attended the conference in Geneva in 1864. </PARA>
<PARA> They drafted a convention which was the beginning of written international humanitarian law covering armed conflicts. The 1864 agreement, signed by the 12 European nations, provided that during future wars in which they were engaged they would care for all sick and wounded military personnel, regardless of nationality. </PARA>
<PARA> It was a modest enough beginning, but since 1864 there has been a series of international conferences to extend and develop humanitarian law. The most important was the Geneva conference of 1949 which resulted in four Conventions being adopted. These have since been ratified by 145 nations. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1977, at another Geneva conference, two Protocols were adopted and signed by 87 nations. The Protocols were developed after exacting work by many bodies, in particular the International Committee of the Red Cross, over an extended period from the early 1950s. Finally, a diplomatic Conference convened by the Swiss Federal Council held four sessions in Geneva from 1974 to 1977 to negotiate the final texts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Geneva Protocols deal in greater detail with matters such as civil defence, tackle questions of the means and methods of warfare which the framers of the Conventions had not felt themselves able to do, and extend the protections spelt out in the Conventions to non-international conflicts. </PARA>
<PARA> They were intended to extend the provisions of the four Conventions and to introduce new principles. These Protocols incorporated the new and important concept that the principles of the law governing armed conflicts between nations should apply also to conflicts between armed forces of a State and organised dissident forces within boundaries. Protocol 1 spells out that International Humanitarian Law applies to armed conflicts ``in which all peoples are fighting colonial domination and alien occupation and against racial regimes in the exercise of their right to self determination.''</PARA>
<PARA> The Conventions may be seen as an almost complete consolidation of written international humanitarian law applying to armed conflicts. </PARA>
<PARA> Protocol 1 covers international conflict and is concerned with the protection of victims of international armed conflicts. It requires the parties to such conflict to distinguish between the civil population and combatants, and between civil objects and military objectives, and to direct their operations only against enemy combatants and military objectives. Protocol 2, which is concerned with the protection of victims of non-international armed conflicts, will be ratified at the same time as Protocol 1. No additional legislation is required to enable ratification of Protocol 2. </PARA>
<PARA> This Geneva Conventions Amendment Bill is 73 pages in length and includes provisions relating to the wounded, sick and shipwrecked, the methods and means of warfare combatant and prisoner-of-war status, and the civilian population. The major change to the law is in Clause 5 of the bill which incorporates the obligation to punish `grave breaches', as defined in Protocol 1, into our domestic law. Examples of `grave breaches' include physical mutilations and medical experiments, attacks on civilian populations, and the unjustifiable delay in the repatriation of prisoners of war. </PARA>
<PARA> Other provisions confer jurisdiction on a court to determine the status of a person claiming to be a prisoner of war, and extend existing protection against misuse of emblems to such identity cards, signs, signals, insignia or uniforms as are prescribed for the purpose of giving effect to the Protocol. </PARA>
<PARA> Like the 1949 Geneva Conventions, the Protocols strike a balance between `military necessity' and `humanitarian considerations.' Rules of humanitarian law are always the result of a most complex process of compromise between exigencies of an effective national defence on the one hand and the common will to uphold certain human values even in war on the other. </PARA>
<PARA> The underlying principles can be simply stated: (a) the human dignity of all individuals must be respected at all times; and (b) everything possible must be done, without any kind of discrimination, to reduce the suffering of those who take direct part in the conflict or have been put out of action be sickness, wounds or captivity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's arguments against ratification of the Protocols are weak and meaningless. Their claim that ratification would hamper the armed forces conflicts with reported advice from the Chief of Defence Force Staff and the government's senior military adviser, General Peter Gration, that Australia's military could sign the Protocols and still successfully wage war. Hopefully the Opposition is not suggesting that Australia should condone military attacks on civilians and the other types of barbaric behaviour which this Bill seeks to outlaw. </PARA>
<PARA> Another trenchant critic of ratification has been Brigadier P. J. Greville. Brigadier Greville suggests that ratification of Protocol 1 would:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) jeopardise servicemen's present legal position;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) impose crippling restrictions upon our ability to wage war;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) may well prolong some conflicts;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) could jeopardise even further the lives of servicemen taken prisoner; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) could put a defenceless Australian civilian population even more at risk.</PARA>
<PARA>I am totally unconvinced by the arguments advanced by Brigadier Greville. I am disturbed by his claim that Protocol 1 goes too far in that:</PARA>
<PARA> ``it attempts to isolate the civil population from the effects of war, and this is wrong in principle, could have an adverse effect in practice.''</PARA>
<PARA> I find this a simply unsupportable and, indeed, an incredible assertion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats support the summary of Trevor Findlay, editor of Pacific Research of February 1989, who wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> Brigadier Greville has given a confused rationale for Australia not ratifying the protocols, but no sound reasons why Australian armed forces would want to conduct indiscriminate attacks against civilians or do any of the things the protocols attempt to outlaw-even if our enemies attempted them. Of course there will be marginal cases, instances in which international law will be unclear and mistakes made in the `fog of war'. But the dilemmas faced by military commanders regarding the use of force in the vicinity of civilians have always existed. For instance, Brigadier Greville asks, `how do you classify a teenage conscript soldier?' The protocols in fact attempt to clarify this by setting the minimum age for combatants at 18. Is the Brigadier suggesting that without the protocols the situation would be clearer? The protocols are a legitimate attempt by the International Red Cross to clarify the situation. Australia as a responsible member of the international community, should support these endeavours and ratify the protocols. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has shown its concern for the fate of the civilian population in times of war. The Australian Democrats believe that Australia should now ratify both Protocols and thereby show to its own people, to its neighbours and to the world at large that this country is willing to accept binding obligations of a strictly humanitarian character. Other nation States of the region are examining the Protocols at present. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the fact that the United States, the United Kingdom and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have not signed the Protocols, global support for ratification grows and well over 70 nations have ratified Protocol 1 to date. </PARA>
<PARA> Rejection of the Protocols by Australia would discourage other States of the region from ratifying the Protocols. All governments take into account the attitude of other countries when deciding on ratification of treaties affecting national defence. Furthermore, a treaty will only be accepted by a growing number of States if there is a certain momentum. Non-ratification of the Protocols by Australia would certainly reduce that momentum. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has introduced the Bill into Parliament on March 2nd of this year. The Opposition announced its rejection of the Bill on March 7th. Despite the fact that the Government had the numbers-with Australian Democrat support-in the Parliament, the Attorney-General who had stressed the importance that the Government placed on Australia's ratification of the Protocols simply adjourned debate on March 9th. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Bowen stated in his press release that `the Bill's underlying principles were of such importance and self-evident value that any attempt to push the legislation through without bipartisan support would be highly inappropriate.' To this I ask why. On most of the major issues of the day in this country, bipartisan support is lacking but that has not prevented the Government from pushing ahead. The Government has to explain why it has given the Opposition veto power over the human rights of civilians caught up in bloody conflict?</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats response to this statement is that the Bill is, indeed, of such importance and of such self-evident value that it must be pushed forward in the face of ill-informed and anti-humanitarian attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be clearly understood that the government introduced this legislation and has thereby expressed its will and determination to ratify both Protocols. If Parliament now fails to approve my bill (or the government's original bill) then Australia would be seen as deliberately rejecting the Protocols-as distinct from simply not getting around to signing them. We would be the only country to set about such a high profile rejection and hence would be setting a deplorable precedent. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely the government must be aware that this would be the first time in history that a Red Cross humanitarian treaty was rejected by a democratically elected Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this Bill to the Senate as a pledge of our regard for the continuation of humanitarian endeavour during the horrors of modern warfare. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to respond to the Budget Statement and associated papers brought down in the Senate on 15 August this year. This Budget is best described as another Keating special. It has in it the same kind of misleading presentation we have now grown accustomed to receiving each year from the Treasurer (Mr Keating) when he brings down the Budget Speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The speech itself, of course, has become a travesty of what Budget speeches used to be. The television glossy, which is now what it has become, contains a minimum of information and certainly no information at all on matters which would be thought to be likely to have the slightest disadvantageous effect upon the Government's electoral prospects. That information has to be sought by members of the public to the extent that they can afford to purchase the Budget Papers and actually comb through them or rely upon the efforts of the media to assist them in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say that the media-notwithstanding my often repeated criticism of some of its analytical reporting quality in this country-does do an extraordinary job on Budget night and in the days following the Budget in getting to the detail of the Budget Papers which have now assumed quite mammoth proportions. But none of that information is to be found in the Budget Speech. None of that is to be found in the television presentation. None of that is to be found in the series of what I think my colleague, Dr Hewson, has called the `dog and pony shows' being conducted by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer around the country in the subsequent weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> This year the highlight of this misleading presentation of the Budget was to focus attention, or to seek to focus the attention, of the financial markets upon the bottom line figure for the $9.1 billion surplus. Let me make it quite clear that the Opposition is glad to see the Government budgeting for a large surplus. We would be even gladder if it were not for the fact that that surplus in this year was obtained in part by some interesting creative accounting, or what in previous years the Labor Party would have called `rubbery figures' when they were being produced by Treasurers on this side of the political spectrum. To the extent that there were rubbery figures in earlier Budgets-and there certainly were from time to time-they were not as elastic as those in Mr Keating's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary to elaborate on the point a little in order to address the question of whether we have had from Mr Keating what he desperately wants the financial markets to believe, namely, a Budget this year which produces an additional degree of fiscal or budgetary restraint upon the economy. I would have to say that when one has examined all the appropriate entrails of the Budget Papers, one cannot accept that judgment. At best, one would say that the degree of fiscal restraint emanating from this Budget is unchanged from 1988-89. If one were to take a somewhat less generous interpretation of some aspects of the figures, one would say, as have some commentators, that, if anything, on balance the Budget this year slightly relaxes the degree of fiscal restraint apparent last year. But I do not regard that as a matter particularly worth debating. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many more key points than I have time to produce. My judgment that the Budget this year, on balance, shows about the same level of fiscal restraint as last year is based on two key aspects of the Budget figures. The first is that, quite interestingly, in the dying months of 1988-89 the Commissioner of Taxation simply did not collect about $1.25 billion of provisional tax which it had been estimated he would collect. The result of that is that he will collect it this year. That has two effects. First, last year's Budget surplus finished up at $5.9 billion instead of $7.1 billion. That is the first bit of sleight of hand that we have seen in the Budget figuring this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The second instance of a similar sleight of hand is that Mr Keating has decided to bring forward into this year's Budget receipts two items of taxation which otherwise would not have been received until next year. First, by a very significant change-one which has much more far reaching implications than the point I am now speaking about; and I hope to come back to that-Mr Keating has decided to bring forward very considerably the timing of company tax payments. Companies will now be required to pay within 15 days of the end of the year 85 per cent of what they estimate to have been their tax assessments for the year just ended. Without spending further time discussing that measure, the result will be to bring into Consolidated Revenue in 1989-90 $885m which normally would have been brought in next year. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Treasurer has decided that companies with large payrolls-payrolls over $5m per annum-will now be required to remit to the Tax Commissioner twice a month instead of once a month the pay as you earn (PAYE) deductions that they make each fortnight from their employees' payrolls. The effect again of that one-off change will be to increase this year's Budget revenues by $550m. It will not affect next year's Budget revenues because, of course, it is a once-off change. The result of those two measures is to increase this year's revenues by $1,435m-call it $1.4 billion, for the sake of the rounding of the figures. So we have had $1 1/4 billion of last year's revenue being allowed to float over into this year; we have had $1.4 billion of either next year's revenue or a once-off revenue effect brought into this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Without those two bits of creative accounting-to use a kindly phrase-Mr Keating's Budget this year would have been not $9.1 billion, but about $6.5 billion. If that revenue float had not been allowed to move out of last year into this year, last year's surplus would have been just over $7 billion. We have actually gone, on what would have been, shall I say, a normal basis of approaching the budgetary position, from a surplus of about $7 billion to a surplus of $6.5 billion. I do not want to spend too much time saying one is smaller than the other and therefore this year's fiscal restraint has been relaxed, but when one actually looks into the figures, as I have just tried to do in brief, one certainly cannot say that the degree of budgetary restraint has been increased. There is no basis for that. Mr Keating knows that perfectly well because, of course, his Department would have told him so. That has not, of course, stopped him from going around the country saying that it has been increased. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is that particularly important? It is particularly important because it had been the hope, now sadly dashed, of people in the lead-up to the Budget, when we were getting these stories, that the Budget surplus would be considerably bigger this year than last year, that there was going to be a genuine increase in fiscal restraint from the Government and that that would have allowed the Government to relax somewhat the monetary screws that Mr Keating has been tightening ever since April last year-for the last 16 months now. Not at all: because the budgetary restraint now, in reality, is no different from what it has been all along, there is no basis for Mr Keating to relax interest rates in the near future. He has reluctantly been forced to face up to that conclusion on a number of occasions under questioning at various luncheons, dinners and other media occasions in the days succeeding the Budget. The $9.1 billion bottom line figure was the big thing that Mr Keating was selling on Budget night and that the Government has tried to sell ever since. </PARA>
<PARA> The other big thing-if I may say so, equally duplicitous-that the Treasurer tried to sell on Budget night and since was that he has actually addressed this country's savings problem by his measures in the fields of retirement income policy and of superannuation arrangements, the incentives for providing more savings by way of superannuation. What a joke! What a totally duplicitous joke! Indeed, quite by coincidence, the views I am about to state in this regard have been re- inforced only this morning in the feature article in the Sydney Morning Herald by Ross Gittins, which points out, I think I may say in extremely cogent terms, just how duplicitous this attempt by Mr Keating to tell us that he has solved our savings problem has been. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say something about the elements of that piece of duplicity. First of all, on retirement income policy I think we have very little to say by way of criticism about what Mr Keating has done. What he has largely done, in fact, is to pick up the Opposition's retirement income policy, which was launched about a year ago. He has picked it up and taken over quite a number of elements of it-and good on him for doing so; we are totally happy with that. I only wish he would pick up more of our ideas on economic policy. The country would not be in the shambles it is if he were to do so. On the retirement incomes aspect of this particular piece of Mr Keating's other pea and thimble trick, I have no more to add. </PARA>
<PARA> It is on the other side, on the so-called superannuation incentives, that the real duplicity exists. What Mr Keating has actually done here is to say that in five years' time there will be some improved arrangements for superannuation. How is that supposed to solve our savings problem today? How is that supposed to solve our balance of payments problem today? How is that supposed to address our foreign debt problem today?</PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting also to ask oneself why, apart from the attempt to once again hoodwink the Australian public about the national interest so far as the Budget is concerned, Mr Keating has moved yet again into the superannuation policy field-a field which, I may say, he has been tilling assiduously almost every year since he has been in office, but always in the other direction. In every previous year he has increased the taxation burden on the superannuation industry or, if one prefers, diminished the taxation incentives for people to save through superannuation. This year he has gone in the other direction. One has to ask oneself why that is, apart from, as I say, trying to pull a major confidence trick upon the Australian people. The magnitude of that confidence trick is, incidentally, well demonstrated if one simply reflects that in the measures introduced only in last year's Budget in this area-leaving aside the previous ones-Mr Keating pulled in, and is this year collecting, an additional billion dollars in revenue from changing the superannuation arrangements. Now he is promising the savers of Australia that he might give a little of that back in five years' time. They might even get a small amount of it back in the next few years, but even in five years' time it will be of the order of $200m a year. Meanwhile, Mr Keating will have gone on picking up his billion dollars a year. So much for the incentive to save. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, let us be quite clear that the other reason why Mr Keating has gone back, so to speak, on his tracks in this area is simply that he has found out that in the wake of his decisions last year-the decisions, remember, which were not going to cost anybody one cent-those measures, on the contrary, have had the most deleterious effects upon the superannuation industry, particularly as they affect the position of lower income and lower to middle income people. Under the arrangements which Mr Keating put in place last year it was still advantageous for upper middle income and high income people to take advantage of the taxation incentives for saving through superannuation. But it became very much a marginal calculation as to whether it was still advantageous for lower income people to do so, or even for lower middle income people to do so. Suddenly, Mr Keating's own constituency in the trade union movement found out it was not so easy to get people interested in getting into the superannuation area, which would have been one of the selling points that Mr Keating had agreed with Mr Kelty they would have to bolster the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), and the trade unions' position in the scheme of things, not to mention putting them in the position of putting their hands around the windpipe of the economy some years down the track. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken to this point about the two major aspects which Mr Keating has tried to use to sell this Budget as yet, once more, the latest answer to this country's problems. We have had this every year from Mr Keating and the country's problems have gone on getting worse and worse and worse, as we have just seen in the foreign debt figures issued yesterday and in the further turning down of thumbs by international credit rating agencies as was shown on the Moody's announcement yesterday. We will come to that later today. </PARA>
<PARA> But leaving aside those two aspects of Mr Keating's Budget, let us look at the fundamentals which that Budget should have been addressing. Let us see how well it addresses them. What are the fundamentals of our economic problems in this country today? Everyone would acknowledge that the Budget has now been brought back into surplus-as I say, not in a manner which we would have judged as best for that purpose; by not cutting spending but by way of raising taxes-to a point where, once again, this year taxes will run at a record proportion of the national product. Indeed, 25.2 per cent of GDP will once again, on the Government's own estimates, be collected this year and that is a record. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, let us concede that we are glad to see the Budget in surplus and let us not spend further time, therefore, in debating as to whether it should have been better brought into surplus by cutting spending rather than by putting up taxes. Let us look, however, at the other aspects of the economic fundamentals which are much more sadly lacking-foreign debt and the rising level of foreign ownership of Australia. The thing which underlies both of those phenomena is our continuing deficit on the balance of payments, our continuing incapacity to live within our means. Inflation is endemic in Australia and that was what honourable senators will recall Mr Keating called in his Budget last year Australia's No. 1 economic disease. There is not much sign in this year's Budget of addressing that No. 1 economic disease. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of those fundamental things that are wrong with the Australian economy today, we have the crushingly high level of interest rates with first home owner mortgage interest rates stuck at 17 per cent and, in some ways even more importantly, I would have to say, overdraft rates for the 750,000 small businesses around this country at 21 to 25 per cent, depending on the individual credit ratings of farmers and other business people. In turn, because of those very high levels of interest rates and the fact that they sit there looking attractive to overseas lenders, we have a very high level for our exchange rate; that is, very high in terms of the underlying quality of economic performance of the country whose currency is involved. We have, in other words, an exchange rate that on the basis of this Government's policies-I emphasise that phrase-is clearly overvalued. Why is it overvalued? It is overvalued because Australia has become a haven for hot money. With 90-day bank bill rates still touching 17.9 per cent, having been at one stage well over 18 per cent, how can we be surprised?</PARA>
<PARA> Because our exchange rate is up where it is, imports are much cheaper-in Australian dollar terms-than they would otherwise be and our exports bring in less to our export producers in Australian dollar terms than they otherwise would. For that and other reasons we have a massive balance of payments deficit. Yesterday the Australian Statistician published new figures for foreign debt-indeed, not just foreign debt but for what the Statistician now calls our international investment position, taking account of both foreign debt and other forms of liabilities to foreign owners. The figures are, frankly, quite intimidating. As of 30 June this year, foreigners owned nearly $70 billion of Australian corporate equities; we owed $137 billion in debts to foreigners; and with other investments, which I do not have time to go into, the total of our overseas liabilities amounted to $221 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that on the other side of the ledger we do have some foreign assets. Australians own nearly $43 billion of corporate equities. They would be principally owned by those very same superannuation funds that the Treasurer is now going to make the linchpin of our savings policies. I can confidently predict that when he does the investors will continue to invest overseas just as much, just as high a proportion, as they are now doing, given the retrospective prospects of doing so overseas as opposed to investing at home. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some foreign borrowers from Australians-$8 billion. Our Reserve Bank has assets of $20 billion which the Government continues to claim belong to it. I would like to hear the views of the Governor of the Reserve Bank on that matter. Adding all those amounts together, we have foreign assets of about $80 billion. When we wash up those figures together our net position at 30 June this year was net foreign liabilities of $140 billion, including $108 billion in net debts. How did the Budget address that situation? It did not. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Keating has tried to con the Press Gallery in this place by saying that he is doing something about our foreign debt position because the Commonwealth Government is paying off some of its debt. That is certainly true. It is paying some of its debt. That is like saying that a man who is in debt with three different bankers pays off banker A by borrowing from banker B. That is what Mr Keating is doing. He will be paying off banker A-that is, Commonwealth debts. In order to do so, as long as we have the reality of that underlying balance of payments deficit, some other Australian will have to borrow exactly the same amount from banker B. It is about time that the media stopped repeating this stuff from the Treasurer which is designed in the most cynical way to throw dust in their eyes. I am surprised that the media continue to accommodate this situation and continue to repeat material which is so cynically calculated to deceive them. Were I a member of the media I would be a bit indignant about that process. I might go out after the Treasurer and ask him an awkward question or two. I would look forward to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the media are beginning to catch up with Mr Keating. I look forward with great optimism to their doing so at a greater pace than they have done up to this time. The reason we have this continually increasing level of foreign debt and this continually increasing sale of Australian assets to foreigners is that we continue to live beyond our international means. We had last year a deficit on our balance of payments of $17.4 billion. Mr Keating predicts in the Budget Papers that we will have $18.5 billion this year. No improvement! Stuck at over 5 per cent of the gross domestic product-an extraordinarily high figure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the same sense inflation is stuck. Mr Keating is predicting that we will have an increase of 7 1/2 per cent this year in the consumer price index. That is virtually unchanged from the 7.4 per cent last year and the 7.3 per cent-or was it 7.1 per cent?-of the previous year. It is virtually stuck. There is no change in the disastrous policies which have produced, I repeat, a net foreign debt of $108 billion and a total net foreign investment liability position on our national balance sheet of over $140 billion. Because we have this apparently endemic, apparently unchanging level-certainly not an improving level of inflation-and this continual running into the red in our external account, we will continue to have very high interest rates, or something like them, for a long time yet. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Keating conceded in a remark last week that he expects that we will have to suffer high interest rates-perhaps not quite as high as the present levels-for two or three years yet. While I welcome that concession to reality under this Government's policies, there are no policies in place which will mean that that period will be confined to the next two or three years. On the contrary, there are no policies in place which will prevent that continuing even into the distant future-the really distant future. Three years is distant enough, after all, for most people to be contemplating interest rates anything like we have at present. </PARA>
<PARA> To add to all this, the Government-particularly in the person of the Prime Minister-has now aggravated, and virtually helped to bring on, a disastrous dispute between the air pilots and the companies that employ them. That dispute will not merely produce the greatest difficulties for the travelling public of Australia-which it is already doing-and the greatest financial difficulties for the major airlines concerned but, what is much more important than either of those things in terms of magnitude, it will produce, if it continues, the gravest economic crisis for Australia because of the effects it will have on our tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Our tourism industry has now become our single most important export or foreign exchange earner. Last year alone it earned $6.5m in foreign exchange-even more than wool. Last weekend the front pages of the Japanese newspapers were filled with-guess what?-news of the airline pilots dispute in Australia! This week our travel agencies, our major hotels and so on have been receiving communications from Japanese travel agents-I have heard of about 20 to date-who are saying, `Sorry, we are cancelling all future tourist trips to Australia'. I do not have time to elaborate on that theme now. We said something about it yesterday. But I ask: Where is the Government's policy taking us?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Keating says that he is going to crush demand by using crushingly high interest rates. Let us assume, without arguing it for the present, that that is right. It is not right, but let us assume that it is. What will Mr Keating do then? When demand has been crushed, when interest rates start to come down a little because there is no longer any demand for credit because people have nothing worth borrowing for, where do we go then? If imports do start to fall off and the balance of payments starts to look a bit better, if Mr Keating starts to rev up the economy at all, we will go straight back into another balance of payments crisis and interest rates will go back up again. We will continue to have, because the accord has determined that we will have, 7 1/2 per cent inflation, or something pretty close to it. We will have the classic situation of stagflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Do honourable senators remember stagflation? Stagflation equals high inflation and economic stagnation. That is what this Government is delivering to us. I believe that Mr Keating's Budget of 15 August, because it failed to address any of these problems, has totally failed to meet the economic needs of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is probably fair to say that in many respects I agree with the comments of Senator Stone on this Budget in that it is very largely a con trick that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) produced with a great flourish. It is probably also fair to say that on those grounds-and at least on first inspection-it is one of the least controversial Budgets to be presented to the Australian people for many years. The Budget looks good on the surface. As Senator Stone said, it is only when one starts to delve below the surface that one realises that there is very little substance, very little improvement and very little benefit offered in the words, allegedly of wisdom, that the Treasurer offered to the Parliament and to the Australian people when he brought down this Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Certainly, small and staggered benefits have been offered to pensioners, although there is yet again no relief in sight for home buyers. The changes to annual rather than quarterly payment of provisional tax will assist many small businesses, but the proposal to bring forward company tax payments, while being only a temporary measure for this year, in that this year is the only year on which it will have a significant impact, may well offset much of the benefits to many organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> Extra money is being directed to alleviating the problem of youth homelessness, but the sources of that problem, that is, family poverty and youth joblessness, have not been given much attention at all in this Budget. The Government is looking at some superficial ways in which to pull back criticism and offset some of the popularity slump it has suffered in the last few years. Public sector borrowing is now down to zero and the Government has pledged its full $9.1 billion surplus to pay back outstanding domestic and foreign debt. Yet there is nothing in this Budget to address the problem of burgeoning private sector debt, which is, and has been for decades in Australia, the major component of our foreign debt, encouraged by a taxation system for companies which is amongst the most generous in the world and which has led, as a consequence, to a plethora of debt based, rather than equity based, financing systems in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> What has the Government responded to in this Budget? Basically, it has responded to three issues. Firstly, it has responded to the need to encourage long term saving-something which has been talked about a lot in this country but which has rarely seen any active involvement by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, it has responded to the need to placate its traditional supporters by, as I said, appearing to offer additional benefits to welfare recipients, or at least to those welfare recipients who are represented by some fairly well organised groups in the community. Thirdly, it has responded to the demand from a variety of economic gurus for a domestic surplus, despite the fact that very few other countries have, in the past, had a significant domestic surplus. As I have said, excluded from the Budget, therefore, are things such as benefits for sole parents, benefits for families living in poverty, and benefits for homeless young people under the age of 16 years. What is more significantly missing is a general attempt to prevent child poverty, as distinct from patching up the worst of it when an election is approaching. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, no attention has been paid to the problems facing mortgage holders. In this, Australia remains significantly different from similar countries which place a high value on home ownership, namely, the United States and the United Kingdom. Australia still does not offer targeted tax relief to people who are paying off a mortgage in order to buy their own home. In Australia, we limit that benefit to only those people who are investing in the market. What is worse, we allow them not only a tax benefit but also a negatively geared tax benefit, so they get double the benefit. As a consequence, they are able to compete for borrowings at a beneficial rate because they know that, although they are borrowing at 18 per cent or 19 per cent, when it is written off against their tax liability they may be paying as little as 11 per cent or 12 per cent. Of course, they could also afford to borrow more, thereby feeling able to bid more at auction or to pay more for homes. Generally, this is pushing up housing prices, not at the $4m mansion level, but in the ordinary domestic home market. </PARA>
<PARA> One needs to ask why the Government is doing all this. The answer lies largely in the fact that for the last few decades Australian governments have operated on several economic theories which, if they were ever relevant to this country, most certainly are no longer relevant. Most of them can be detected in this year's budgetary planning, including that most favourite of all theories held dear by economic theorists, the trickle down effect. This argument has been pursued for decades by such international economic luminaries as Enoch Powell, when he was Minister of Housing in Britain. It is based on the theory that if governments encourage only the wealthy to become more wealthy, by giving them all sorts of tax concessions, by deregulating or by letting them go their own way with little hindrance, sooner or later the benefits of that will trickle down, will seep down, will flow down, to the less economically well off. If that happens at all, it certainly happens later rather than sooner. In the meantime, a lot of people are left in significant poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> The trickle down effect did not work for Britain in the 1960s when people like Powell were pushing the argument in health, housing and other welfare areas, and it certainly will not work for Australia in the 1980s. Yet, we have in power at the moment a government which sets its priorities in favour of those who are already able to look after themselves. In 1988, for example, the Government, with the enthusiastic support of the Opposition, offered a $2 billion benefit to Australian companies-some of the biggest of which were already paying no tax-by cutting further company taxes. A 20 per cent tax cut was given to Australia's companies by cutting the company tax rate from 49c in the dollar to 39c in the dollar at a time when some of the biggest companies in the country were working the system, to an extent that no ordinary family can, so that they were paying no tax at all. What this means is that in coming years these companies will be in the negative tax bracket and the Government, that is the taxpayers, will be returning to them large amounts of money. </PARA>
<PARA> In this year's Budget all that the Government could offer to pensioners was a $2 a week increase. This goes only some small way to helping them catch up on some fairly disastrous 1986 budgetary decisions which also went through with the support of the Liberal and National parties, namely, delaying the consumer price index (CPI) increases for pensioners, discounting the ex-serviceman's pension increases, telling 45-year-old women on class B widows' pensions that once their youngest child reaches the age of 16 he or she has to get a job or get unemployment benefits, and cutting Austudy for 15-year-olds in their last two years of school. None of these decisions hurt those on high incomes and all of them significantly disadvantaged the worst off in the country. </PARA>
<PARA> I suspect that the reason for this odd set of priorities lies in the myths that surround and support the economic debate in Australia, myths which among other things have people believing that Australia is a country which is excessively taxed, which is a welfare state and overpays its workers, thereby making us non-competitive on international markets. Newspapers, for example, give headlines to a petulant American rating agency like Moody's Investors Service Inc. when it arbitrarily drops Australia's credit rating but ignores comments by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) questioning the validity of this reduction. The media runs stories from business leaders claiming that Australia's wages are ridiculously high but do not ever ask: In comparison to whom? They publish unchallenged statements from other businessmen that Australia has to get in line with the rest of the world as far as welfare payments and wages are concerned without asking: Which countries of the rest of the world? I suspect that in the case of people like John Elliott we know the answer to that question: he means the Philippines. Those sorts of people who are writing those sorts of stories, with very few exceptions, write about company executives threatening to go overseas unless Australia's tax and welfare payments are lowered without asking where those companies can go in the world to get a better tax break or to pay lower wages other than to Third World countries. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear in Parliament and elsewhere that Australia is going down the economic gurgler because we have a current account deficit and, until recently, a domestic deficit. Why? As a senior official from the OECD pointed out this morning on AM, Australia is almost unique in the world only in that it has a domestic surplus. So why the criticism of Australia as being worst off compared to the rest of the world? Britain, the United States of America, most European countries and Japan all have gross public debts higher than Australia's. The answer to our record current account deficit is, therefore, not to be found in further cuts to public expenditure, despite what the Opposition and its spokespeople out in the business community would have us believe. The problem for Australia lies in the fact that successive governments have encouraged private foreign borrowings and have failed to encourage savings. In this way, of course, they could not be more different from a country such as Japan which recognised two things after World War II: firstly, that it had to move from being a rural based economy to an industrial-based economy and, secondly, that this required cheap money for investment and that in turn required the Government to encourage savings by not taxing the interest on those savings. That was based on yet another decision taken by the Japanese Government which has never been taken by any government in this country and that is that is has to look beyond the next election for solutions and results. In this country, if governments and the business community cannot come up with a scheme for building the world's best mouse-trap by tomorrow, they do not make any attempt to build one at all. It is quite different from countries such as Japan and West Germany which faced huge restructuring problems of the sort I hope Australia never has to face and which made a determined attempt to solve those problems over a 30 to 50 year period. It did it by establishing management-worker relationships that most people in this country would give their right arm for. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that despite Moody's, despite comments from the knockers, Australia has exhibited very high rates of economic growth by comparison to other western world countries. Employment has grown at almost twice the OECD average and private domestic consumption is well down. We also spend less on social welfare as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) than any other industrialised nation, and have a lower tax than almost all of them. In addition, Australia's wages system and its system of other benefits to workers are less than those in most other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is worth while looking at a comparison between some of Australia's workers and workers in a country against which we compete, from which we import goods, to which we try to export goods and the culture of which is somewhat similar to ours. If we look at a country such as West Germany, which had a restructuring problem after the War and which produces goods similar to those which we produce here, we will see that the facts are quite different from those which the myth pushers would have us believe. If we look at salaries, for example, we will see that a worker in the automotive industry in Australia earns $US14,300. A car worker in Frankfurt earns $US22,600-nearly a third more. Workers in West Germany do not work longer hours than their Australian counterparts. They get more holidays-five weeks in comparison to Australia's four. They get an additional five days leave each year in order to care for a child under the age of 8. They get a 47 per cent leave loading on their five weeks annual leave. Australia gets 17 1/2 per cent. In West Germany maternity leave is paid in the private sector and it is looking at paternity leave. In addition, a woman who comes back to work after taking maternity leave is given time off for nursing. So let us not pretend that our wages system in this country makes us non-competitive with similar countries. Let us not pretend that we are not productive enough because we have four weeks annual leave and that we have 10 public holidays a year. West Germany, I point out, has more than that. Let us not pretend that we coddle our workers by giving them a 17 1/2 per cent leave loading and that no other country in the world does. This is simply not the case. If we want increases in productivity in Australia we need to take a leaf out of the books of those countries which have good management-worker relations, hence worker loyalty and high productivity. The alternative for Australia, of course, is to engineer a huge pool of unemployed of the sort that allows Third World countries to keep wages low and workers in a constant state of fear of losing their jobs, hence in a constant state of stress. I hope that nobody seriously considers that that is an option for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Far more attention should be paid not to the perceived or alleged high level of wages in this country but to the high levels of interest rates which are currently crippling both home buyers and many businesses, and to the fact that our private sector foreign debt continues to rise. Senator Stone mentioned during his speech the whole issue of high interest rates and criticised the Government, as indeed I did yesterday, for not doing anything to reduce that. I think it is important to recognise that there is a connection between a current account deficit, between our trade deficit, between the encouragement which we are deliberately undertaking as a country for increased foreign investment in Australia and the high interest rates that are currently facing Australian families and forcing many of them out of their homes. </PARA>
<PARA> In our haste to achieve a bigger surplus we also forget that a surplus is achieved at somebody's expense. Either somebody pays more in tax or someone else gets less of a particular service so the Government can cut expenditure. While everybody is always happy to point out who should be paying more tax or who does not deserve a particular service very few people are prepared to make that sacrifice themselves. So by urging a government to produce a bigger surplus, as many in the business community have, people are in effect leaving it up to the Government to decide where the money will come from, and, of course, in the last few years it has come from cuts to social security, health and education; areas that impact most significantly on people in low income areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer now is bringing forward into this financial year some of the tax remittances that some companies would be paying in the next financial year so that he can brag, as Senator Stone said, about the size of his surplus. In doing so, he will achieve the surplus. Of that there is no doubt at all. We will get at least a $9.1 billion surplus but what has the Government done in all of this about the other problems we face in the economy-inflation, the current account deficit and the foreign debt?</PARA>
<PARA> I think it is also worth remembering that a Budget surplus represents opportunities forgone. Some of the $9.1 billion could have been used to provide a better education system, a better health system, mortgage relief to home buyers or assistance to our exporters who are competing against subsidised goods from the United States and the European Economic Community and, of course, to protect them in some way from the trade barriers erected by so-called free trading nations such as the United States and Japan. Australia at the moment is trying to go it alone in what it is trying to argue ought to be a free market global economy. It is trying to remove the protection that we have traditionally offered to our traditional money earners in this country, that is the rural sector, as our major exporting unit, and it is doing it in the face of no decrease at all in the protections offered by the United States and by European countries to their exporters. Maybe we ought to be looking at some of the non-tariff barriers that those other countries are raising against our goods and undertaking a little bit of retribution. While that may not sound like the polite thing to do it is unquestionably the economically sensible one. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most important initiatives outlined in the Budget Speech were in the retirement incomes area. We are, of course, still waiting for specific details of how the changes to the reasonable benefits limits and the new rules on vesting and preservation will affect the plans of people who are about to retire as well as, of course, future retirees. However, it seems that in this area at least the Government has finally decided to implement policies designed to encourage Australians to save for their retirement. In this way, of course, we can reduce the burden of supporting an ageing population through the social security system, although I have to point out again that it is not excessive in global terms. The Government's proposal to encourage saving is a tax driven one which means less money will be going into Consolidated Revenue and this in itself is only the other side of the outlays coin. The Australian Democrats are certainly attracted to the broad thrust of the changes to encourage private pensions, that is annuities, to integrate the tax and social welfare system and to encourage more savings through superannuation. But I think it is important that nobody gets too enthusiastic about this until we have seen the proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has also foreshadowed the possibility of wage increases being paid as superannuation along the lines of the 1986 productivity award. Again, it is worthwhile pointing out here that in most other countries, particularly European countries, there is a much more significant contribution to superannuation by both employers and employees than has ever applied in this country. Paying increases in the form of superannuation of course contributes to national savings, reduces the inflationary impact of direct wage increases and gives Australian workers the possibility of some degree of self-sufficiency in their retirement, just as long as, of course, some other government down the track does not decide to do what the Menzies Government did in the early 1950s after a wartime Labor Government tried to institute through the tax system a national form of superannuation and undo the whole lot, simply absorbing it into Consolidated Revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> There is some prospect of longer term savings through superannuation savings and planning in this country. This may just bring us in line with some other countries. As I said a moment ago, most other Western countries have had in existence for decades a much more extensive self-funding superannuation system. In France, for example, employees contribute over 12 per cent of GDP to the social security system and in that country a person is entitled to a pension at 80 per cent of his last year's salary once he turns 60. This compares considerably more than favourably with what Australia gives it retirees at the age of 65, and I might point out that in France, as in most other European countries, this amount is indexed for inflation. In Japan workers contribute 4.4 per cent of gross domestic product into the social security system and this helps that country fund a retirement system whereby a Japanese worker retiring at the age of 60 is entitled to a pension equal to average weekly earnings. In this country we are still struggling to bring pension levels above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I remind honourable senators that Japanese wages and salaries are higher, as they are in West Germany and in most other countries, than in Australia which brings me back to the point about the myths that abound in the media and the community regarding the Australian economy and, in particular, our competitiveness on world markets. We frequently hear from those who consider themselves to be captains of industry that Australia ought, as I said earlier, to get with the rest of the world on things like wages and working conditions, that we are a welfare state, that our public debt is crippling us, that our economic growth is too low, our trade deficit is too high, job creation is limited, and we are overtaxed. In fact, none of those things are correct. Our major problems do not lie in any of these areas. Instead they can be linked to four other problems. All decisions made in this country are short term ones; whether they are made by government or the private sector, everybody blames everybody else for whatever goes wrong; as a nation we are simply not saving enough and hence investing enough local money for cheaper borrowings by developers; and fourthly, the foreign investment profit outflow cycle is hitting new and ever more wondrous heights each year. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the myths and the actualities have been reflected in the 1989-90 Budget. The first has resulted in the extraordinary efforts that the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) have made to record yet again a significant surplus. The second is reflected in the long overdue proposal to encourage long term savings and, hence, to reduce domestic consumption by providing incentives for people to plan for their own retirement income. As both Senator Stone and I have already said, the surplus is in many ways a cosmetic benefit. It will impress those people who believe that a government is a competent, good economic manager if it has a domestic surplus. Mind you, where this leaves other countries in the world such as the United States, the United Kingdom and most European countries, which regularly have economic deficits, is anybody's guess. However, it is good news for surplus worshippers and may put an end, if only temporarily, to some of the gloom and doom stories about Australia's economic position in comparison to our major trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to Senator Stone's comments about high interest rates hurting ordinary Australians and keeping the dollar high. It is worth while pointing out that, while he criticises this, he failed to point out that this policy of the Government is a deliberate response to demands from economic rationalists for increased foreign investment in Australia to offset private sector foreign borrowings. To the Australian Democrats, a more preferable option would be to pull back or inhibit private sector foreign borrowings by removing negative gearing on overseas financed investment. The effect of lower interest rates would be beneficial to our trade problems. As I tried to explain to Senator Button yesterday during Question Time, the higher the dollar, the lower the price of imported goods, with the result that there is more likely to be high domestic consumption of imported goods. Also, of course, the higher the dollar, the higher the cost of our exports on overseas markets. Bringing down the dollar reduces private sector foreign borrowings and, miraculously, will see a drop in our current account deficit, because our foreign debt will fall and export income will better balance import payouts. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Government failed in this Budget to offer incentives to our exporters competing, as I said, with subsidised European Economic Community and United States products. We cannot continue to pretend that this is a free market that we are operating in; it is not, and every year the United States Farm Bill makes matters worse. All in all, this Budget is best described as a trick, a con and a continued kowtowing to economic rationalists which will prolong most of our economic problems and will not improve in any real way at all the financial situation of most Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week we were debating in some detail the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill. As I mentioned a week last Friday when I first started to speak on this legislation, it is a shame that the Government has rammed this through the House of Representatives without due consideration, because it is a very important Bill concerning the restructuring of Aboriginal administration. Unfortunately, I believe the Bill is fundamentally flawed. Apart from a number of other reasons, it confuses advocacy with administration, and welfare with self-help. Aboriginal Australians will have to adapt to the structure as opposed to the reverse. To me, this Bill is an exercise in political self-indulgence and could well and truly open the door to racial divisions upheld by the legal force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is right and proper that Australians should strive to enable disadvantaged fellow Australians to attain basic levels of health, education and self-management. It is quite another thing to surrender to a guilt industry denigrating our Western heritage that made possible the development of this country and, like it or not, that provides the wherewithal to assist Aboriginal Australians. The neurotic guilt finds expression in calls not for freely given help, but for compensation, and in such puerile actions as the boycott of Bicentennial functions by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand). It does nothing to raise Aboriginal living standards, and is inimical to creating better understanding. </PARA>
<PARA> I take strong issue with the statement contained in the preamble that, as a consequence of these and subsequent deprivations, Aboriginals have become the most disadvantaged group in our society, dispossessed without compensation. I do take strong issue with that, and I am sure most Australians would join with me in that. It is highly arguable that the Western concept of land ownership should be applied to Aboriginals' links with land, and certainly unjust that the divisive question of land rights should be intruded into legislation that is supposedly-and I emphasise the word `supposedly'-concerned with the delivery of services to Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition remains to be satisfied that a preamble to an Act of Parliament can somehow have no possible legal force, and cannot foreseeably be used to give legal standing to claims for land, or any other form of unspecified compensation for one group of Australians on the basis of race. While the Government maintains that the preamble lacks legal force, it does not provide legal opinions to this effect. It would stretch credibility to imagine that, in some future High Court challenge to obtain Aboriginal land rights, the present Minister for Aboriginal Affairs would deny that his preamble was meaningless in law. </PARA>
<PARA> I must reiterate the gross irresponsibility of intruding into the preamble the term `self-determination', which is either meaningless and a fraud or actually connotes the right of a group of Australians to attain the fantasy dreamed up by Mansell and his cohorts of a self-governing Aboriginal state. That is of great concern. It should never be allowed to come to pass. Yet this Government is actually condoning what Mansell has advocated. The intentions of this Labor Government may be one thing, but the effects of this Bill may be another. It may be too late before Australians realise the reality of that. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not alarmist to canvass these possibilities when we look across the Tasman and see how Maori extremists, and their well-paid lawyers, use the ramshackle 1840 Treaty of Waitangi as the basis for demands for vast tracts of Crown land, for rights over the billion dollar New Zealand fishing industry, and for other privileges in a spirit of inverted racism. When one talks to New Zealanders they universally now express concern at how far the Government has gone with the Maori community and on what basis they have gone to those extremes. </PARA>
<PARA> This mischief, threatening racial harmony, has been powerfully assisted by the action of the New Zealand Labour Government in passing the Waitangi Tribunal Amendment Act in 1985, opening up the possibility of massive retrospective claims. I have been speaking in the past few months to New Zealanders who now live in Perth and who have expressed that concern at how powerful the Maoris have now become and been condoned by the Government to the exclusion of the rest of the New Zealand community. This Parliament should, therefore, exercise extreme caution before incorporating generalised and emotive language into practical legislation. Either it achieves nothing or it does all Australians harm. That is the choice with which we are confronted with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am proud to support the Aboriginal affairs policy of the coalition that has as its aim the promotion of Aboriginal self-sufficiency in place of dependence, and their participation in the mainstream of national life. It is very much our intention to increase the proportion of funds that actually reach those Aboriginal Australians in need and, through our underlying policy of cooperative federalism, end the duplication of services, which not only costs the Aboriginal community an enormous amount of money but also costs the taxpayers generally a lot of money. To this end, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs will play a reduced coordinating role and a revised Aboriginal Development Commission will work to achieve self-management and enterprise, and this is all a far cry from what we are seeing in this Bill before the Senate today. </PARA>
<PARA> We will encourage better consultative mechanisms so that Aborigines can advise service providers as to their local needs, but we also believe that representation is best achieved through participation in the mainstream democratic system. For these reasons, as a Liberal I cannot support a Bill establishing an unworkable bureaucratic hybrid, dressed up in the language of guilt and division, foisted upon Australian Aborigines by devious and cynical means, and likely to leave effective power with a government and a Minister who have demonstrated both authoritarianism and irresponsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, this Bill is fundamentally flawed. There has been insufficient consultation with the Aboriginal communities. The Minister has been quite determined to ensure that this does not happen in terms of the consultation, and I think it is time that this Senate rejected this piece of legislation and accepted it for what it is worth in that rejection, because it is not going to benefit the Aboriginal community at all. I would respectfully suggest that some of those who have made a contribution from the Government side actually get out there into the Aboriginal communities, talk with some of the Aboriginal people and see what it is they want, because it is certainly not this Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill and it is certainly not what is going to be foisted upon them as a result of this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill 1989 is one of the most important proposals for change in Aboriginal affairs that we have seen in this Parliament. I believe that it is misconstrued and that it is an unwise change, and I am totally opposed to it. I do not trust the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) and I do not believe that his deception in the construction of this Bill has been sufficiently widely perceived by the Aboriginal communities of Australia, nor by the public of Australia, nor even by his own colleagues in the Government. I therefore will direct my remarks to what I see as the central weaknesses of this Bill and illustrate how those weaknesses are seen to be all the more dangerous, given the events of the last two years while this Minister, Mr Hand, has been responsible for Aboriginal affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I concur with my colleagues' remarks, in particular those of Senator Peter Baume in his systematic criticism of this Bill. I, like him, reiterate that there are many of us in this Parliament who have an enduring concern for the well-being of the Aboriginal people of Australia. From the beginning of my time as a senator, more than 11 years ago, I have paid regular visits to the Aboriginal communities of my State of South Australia. It has become a regular annual expedition to visit the most remote communities, the Pitjantjatjara communities, in my State of South Australia. Time does not allow me to give a summary of my readings and my assessments year by year over the last 12 visits to those Aboriginal communities, but let me assure the Senate that my opposition to this Bill is spurred as much by what I have seen happen under this Government's Minister over the last two years as it is by my positive concerns for the Aboriginal people of my State of South Australia, indeed throughout this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been put forward by Government spokesmen that this Bill brings about three major reforms. It, first of all, consolidates Aboriginal programs under one umbrella, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). Secondly, it sets up a national representative council elected from 17 zones throughout Australia and the elected persons must be members of the 60 regional councils to be set up also by this legislation. So we have, in what would appear to be a governing position in this new umbrella body for all Aboriginal programs from the Commonwealth, some 17 elected Aboriginal people. However, that is a facade and a hollow shell. I will come to that later on. The third reform is the setting up of the regional representative councils. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe there are fundamental fallacies in all three of these so-called reforms. Before I mention those fallacies, let me introduce that critique by referring to the important concepts of self-management and self-determination. They are motherhood concepts and they are supported by every member of parliament whom I know and who has made any comment at all about Aboriginal affairs. So when we have pages and pages of rhetoric from the Government about this Bill achieving self-management and self-determination, do not let anyone be gulled. Let us look beyond to see what actual practical steps are being given to these important concepts. I believe that the facade of this Bill does appeal to self-management and self-determination, but that the actuality is that the practical decision making and power given in this Bill are retained even more centrally by the Minister, and that this is a deceit on those who are actually aspiring to self-management and self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA> The second introductory remark I would make is that Aboriginal affairs for the last 20 years-indeed, for the last 200 years-has been beset by many difficulties, and so it is easy at any time for persons to stand up in Australia, even in this Senate chamber, and find fault with one or other program that is actively pursuing goals in Aboriginal communities. Many people, looking at the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) or at the context in which Aboriginal Hostels Ltd works, or indeed at the Department of Aboriginal Affairs itself, can, with a lot of material, point criticisms at these three major bodies. That in itself is not any reason for virtually abolishing all three and incorporating them together into one new umbrella organisation called ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA> Do not let us be distracted by the fault finders in the present system. I take the general approach that, with regard to the gross inadequacies in the way in which this Government has handled Aboriginal affairs and Aboriginal programs, including in the Department, in the ADC and in Aboriginal Hostels, the appropriate way ahead is to reform those existing bodies and to ensure that they are accountable to the Aboriginal communities and to the public through this Parliament and that there is a genuine and practical encouragement of self-management and self-determination in making those existing programs work. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me go to my critique of the three reforms. First of all, I do not believe that bigger is better. I do not believe that, by amalgamating the three major existing organisations into one, they will all of a sudden magically become more successful. In the same way, I do not believe that amalgamating universities magically makes them more effective. We need to look at the detail before we can assess whether that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a deceit as well in that this national representative council, ATSIC, gives a feeling of an Aboriginal parliament, but it is not an Aboriginal parliament even though it has legislative-that is, policy-functions and executive functions. It would be wrong for any who felt there was some appeal in the concept of this being like an Aboriginal parliament to take that concept any further because we are one nation, we are one people, and there is one Parliament. The important programs that relate to Aboriginal communities need to be addressed in their own practical ways without any such notion of a separate apartheid parliament for the Aboriginal people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> My main criticism of this consolidation is that it increases ministerial control over Aboriginal affairs and denies the presence of the existing structures that have already been moving towards greater Aboriginal self-management and self-determination. I will come back to that point in a moment. The national representative council should not be pointed to, in the way that Senator McMullan did in his speech, as a step forward because it is representational. It is a hollow shell when the Minister still has control. It does not even begin to approach, nor should it, an Aboriginal parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Some 60 regional councils are to be set up. The Bill does not tell us their boundaries or the election rules. We do not, therefore, know how they will interfere with the existing Aboriginal community arrangements that have been established in the States and in conjunction with Commonwealth programs. I fear that the 60 regional councils will cut across the stable and reasonably successful local community associations, particularly those under the auspices of the States, which have important responsibilities in Aboriginal affairs. By interfering with those stable associations, the regional councils will act to the detriment of the Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA> I see this Bill as a partisan push by an untrustworthy Minister. Let me back up that statement. I do not frequently call a Minister untrustworthy. The Minister has lost the trust of the entire Opposition in this matter and he has lost the trust of at least half the Aboriginal people. The numbers would be even greater if they knew the deficiencies in this ATSIC proposal. The Minister is from the socialist left of the Australian Labor Party. He has had an agenda to put forward his own reform, his own structure on the way in which Aboriginal affairs should be conducted in this country. When the Senate set up a select committee to inquire into the Minister's concept, it met with all manner of controversy in the submissions that were put to it, leading to a divided report to the Senate. My Opposition colleagues Senator Peter Baume and Senator Boswell gave a substantial minority report which totally opposed the concept of ATSIC and not just this legislation. The way in which the Minister has contrived to get political numbers in Aboriginal organisations about the country, to win by the numbers some public support for the ATSIC proposal, is a fraud. It has cheated open discussion and substantial evidence being brought to the discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> I will outline the clauses of the Bill which give powers to the Minister. Under clause 8 the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) will be able to give any new functions to ATSIC and, presumably, take those functions away. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Peter Baume" NAMEID="ME4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Without the Parliament's knowledge; I agree. Clause 12 (1) empowers the Minister to require ATSIC to follow his own general directions. Under clause 21 the Chairperson and two other members of the 20-member council are to be directly chosen by the Minister. He is to appoint the full time chairman of ATSIC. He is also empowered to appoint two other positions: a legal expert and a financial expert. In a Yes, Minister fashion, those experts could hold sway in a council of 20. The Minister will also appoint the Chief Executive Officer. Under clause 38 (1) the Minister can suspend a commissioner for misbehaviour. Clause 38 (7) defines misbehaviour as any disagreement with the Minister's instructions. Therefore, if a commissioner disagrees with the Minister's instructions, he will be deemed to be misbehaving through that disobedience and immediately sacked from the Commission by the Minister's practical decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under clause 42 (1), the convening of meetings is to be determined by the Chairman, not by the Commission. The Chairman will be able to determine when the meetings of the Commission can take place and the Minister can override such a determination at any time and convene the Commission. Under clause 42 (4), a quorum for the 20-member council will be 12, but it can be eight. Twelve members are required to begin a meeting, but there may be only eight remaining by the end of a two-day meeting. As the numbers dwindle, the agenda will need to be stacked to get matters discussed. I am not being cynical; I have observed this sort of thing happening in such bodies over the last two years. Clause 44 provides for the Chief Executive Officer-the person who runs the entire staff, in a body that is likely to have a budget of about $20m-to be appointed by the Minister. The Bill before us actually says that the Minister need not consult the Commission in the first appointment and that, if he disagrees with the second, third and fourth appointments, the Minister will make his own appointment. Even the acting Chief Executive Officer is to be appointed by the Minister. Under clause 60, the estimates will be as determined by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 73 empowers the Minister to give financial directions to the Commission. Under clause 83, the Torres Strait Islander Advisory Board is to be appointed entirely by the Minister. Under clause 89, the 60 regions will have boundaries determined by the Minister. Under clause 104, the election days, polling places and the election rules will be-guess what-determined by the Minister. Clause 110 says that the election rules may be determined by the Minister. Clause 128 says that the 17 zones from which councillors will be elected can be varied from time to time by the Minister. Clause 147 (3) says that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation must have a corporate plan specified by the Minister. Clause 154 says that the nine directors of the Development Corporation, which is effectively taking over the existing Aboriginal Development Commission's $100m budget, are to be appointed by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to the way the Minister has, in fact, dealt with the pre-existing body-the Aboriginal Development Commission. Let me remind the Senate that the Minister was appointed in mid-July 1987 and that nine months later he interfered with the ADC by requiring it to support this ATSIC concept. But, lo and behold, the ADC commissioners at that time had entirely different views. They did not believe ATSIC was in the best interests of the Aboriginal people. When it became clear that they were disobeying the Minister, two weeks later he sacked them all except one, the Chairman. He could not get rid of the Chairman because the Chairman, Mrs McPherson, had been appointed by the Governor-General. There was one other who was also appointed by the Governor-General and who was retained, that is, Zona Martin. The other eight were all sacked on 11 May. The Minister said, `You are not sufficiently behind the ATSIC concept'. Then he appointed eight hand-picked persons who were behind the ATSIC concept to become the spokesmen or the majority voice in the ADC. Those persons were: Patrick Dodson, Esther Carroll, Robert Lee, Getano Lui, Lois O'Donoghue, Terry O'Shane, Peter Yu and Charles Perkins. Let me say that, of those, Lois O'Donoghue is well known to me as a South Australian. She has a very careful and sincere support for the ATSIC concept and I would like to know her views much more clearly, but in some of my remarks hereafter I do not wish to make any inference with regard to Mrs O'Donoghue. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me ask for the incorporation in Hansard of one paragraph of the General Manager's inclusion in the annual report of a summary of the ADC's year, 1988, and also an organisational structure for the ADC. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The documents read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> During a very difficult year the Commission has been able to attain ambitious targets in program performance, achieve significant progress in computerisation of systems, document manual procedures, particularly in program areas, and achieve a very high standard of accountability to Parliament. Communication with Aboriginal people has been very successfully maintained through the efforts of the full-time Chairman, part-time Commissioners, and Regional and Branch staff in 25 locations around Australia. Despite the difficulties of the year Commissioners and staff should be well satisfied with their cost-effective administration and program performance throughout the year. All will no doubt look forward to 1988-89 as a year of challenge but one in which the ADC can continue its excellent work in the area of economic and social development for Aborigines throughout Australia. </PARA>

He's destroying our whole case before the Senate Committee. </PARA>

<PARA>What this, along with all of the other public material, indicates about the 1988 ADC year is that there was a civil war launched by the Minister within the ADC in May of 1988. This is confirmed by all that we know about the ADC. This civil war was the direct objective and responsibility of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand. He, on 11 May, sacked the ADC commissioners and on 13 May appointed the eight new ones to go about his bidding, to achieve his objectives and to subvert the legitimate views of the old ADC that were directly opposed to ATSIC. He wished to silence the then Chairman, Shirley McPherson, and the General Manager, Michael O'Brien, and he wished to defend the ATSIC proposal by putting in people who were going to systematically further his own political line. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us be reminded that this was a crucial battle to win. The ADC was the principal body to be replaced by ATSIC. If the public are to learn what the ADC's view is about ATSIC, it is going to be a most important piece of information. So we see that throughout 1988 and 1989 there was a civil war raging in the ADC. I regard both sides of that civil war as having been less than frank to the Senate Committee and having been less than frank to the public and to this Parliament in frankly saying that there were two views-a view imposed by the Minister through his eight cronies that he had appointed to the Commission and the views that had been well developed by the old Commission and still held by the Chairman and General Manager. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleagues in this place referred to a number of elements arising from that civil war to the Privileges Committee of this Parliament, of which I was a member. We went over days and days of inquiry and some two or three feet of papers to try to analyse this. I have no criticism of the protagonists in the ADC itself. My criticism is reserved for the Minister, Mr Hand, who deliberately subverted the ADC to his own political line. The tactics of the Minister's men in the civil war were conspiratorial, secretive and dissembling, using every delegated power to the hilt for their own advantage and using the violence of numbers to bully a conclusion through. That is the context in which we are to assess this ATSIC legislation. That is the kind of tactic that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, has used to try to subvert public opinion to support this Bill. The Senate should not be conned by this Minister. He is an untrustworthy Minister, and this legislation, which gives him increased power in Aboriginal affairs at the expense of the Aboriginal people of Australia, should be wholly rejected by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no evidence that the Minister has encouraged discussion built on trust, openness, free debate, the tendering of clear evidence or soundly established material. My criticisms are not directed to the Minister's puppets but to the Minister himself. He should be ashamed of himself; he should be censored, and he should not be rewarded by the Senate giving him the prize which he has sought to gain all along during the last two years when he has been the Minister. I draw the attention of the Senate, in particular, as I have just a minute or two in which to conclude, firstly, to the fact that the ATSIC legislation gives new power to the Minister in the ways that I have described. He can appoint the chairman and the chief executive officer. Certainly Shirley McPherson would have gone in May 1988 under this ATSIC arrangement. Secondly, it gives the Minister a new power to appoint the Commission's chief executive officer. There would not have had to be that conspiratorial stratagem that I have referred to to get rid of Mick O'Brien-the Minister could have done it himself under the ATSIC Bill. Thirdly, the ATSIC Bill increases the powers of the Minister with regard to all of its operations and, in terms of being able to get rid of commissioners who disobey the Minister through so-called misbehaviour, this is a contemptible Bill. I urge the Senate to reject it and to support the minority findings of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs that it is a Bill which is unjustified, unnecessary and culturally inappropriate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator MacGibbon suggests, the senator from the Australian Democrats is out taking a poll on what she should do. I cannot confirm the accuracy of that suggestion, but it sounds reasonable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me return to my point on this matter. It is not so long since we understood that the Australian Democrats would be adding their voices to those of the coalition parties in this place in opposing this Bill, I will not say root and branch because that has never been the position of the Australian Democrats, but at least to the extent of joining with us in bringing to bear an appropriate power of analysis-if I can put it that way-on the details of this Bill. Of course, that would not satisfy the coalition parties, who regard this Bill as fundamentally flawed, and I will come to that point in a moment. It had been our hope, at least, that in putting forward the manifold amendments which we shall advance when we reach the committee stage we would have have had the support of the Australian Democrats in, at least, a large part of that process. We now understand that is not to be the case, although I understand there are one or two amendments which the Democrats may either propose themselves, or join with us in proposing. One should be grateful for these small mercies no doubt. I will come back to that aspect of the matter too. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to the nub of the matter. We have before us a Bill which has grown out of a process now approaching two years in length-certainly well over 18 months-commencing with the presentation by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) of his paper to the Australian people setting out what he felt to be the appropriate way to go in this area. It was a paper, if I may say so, remarkably devoid of any reasoned, coherent thought and rational construction as to why the existing machinery for the handling of Aboriginal affairs in Australia-that is to say, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the Aboriginal Development Commission and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies-should be abolished, although the last of them is not now to be abolished, and replaced with this fantasy from Mr Hand's imagination, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). </PARA>
<PARA> At no time has the Minister ever deigned to inform the Aboriginal people-let alone the Australian people more generally-as to why this should be done. After all, one might think, if one brought a more commonsense approach to these questions and not the ideological approach which Mr Hand brings to bear upon all questions from his position as leader of the left wing faction of the Australian Labor Party-since, clearly, the administration of Aboriginal affairs policy is less than satisfactory, to use words in diminuendo-that the appropriate course for the Minister to take was to set about improving the administration of his own Department; to set about improving the delivery of services of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC), and to set about improving-if he expresses dissatisfaction with it, as he apparently has in the past, although he is not now pressing the point-the performance of the Institute of Aboriginal Studies. As I said, one might have thought that would be the commonsense way to go. Not a bit of it! Mr Hand has preferred to put forward this massive new development, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. He has put it forward without seeking to justify doing so, without providing a coherent explanation for his actions and without telling us what it is that this new commission is supposed to do that could not be done by an improved administration of his own Department and an improved performance by the Aboriginal Development Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Far from setting about the improvement of those two bodies for which he has ministerial responsibility, on the contrary, the Minister has totally neglected the administration of his Department. He has barely made contact with his Department since assuming the portfolio after the last election. He is almost unknown in his own Department, except at one remove and through the media. His recently resigned departmental secretary, Mr Charles Perkins, who, of course, has not been faultless by any means in the administration of that Department, nevertheless, has justifiably been able, now that he is free to do so, to make some perfectly proper and fair complaints about the performance of his Minister and his lack of access to him in the course of his own performance of his, Mr Perkins's, duties. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite the contrary, rather than setting about improving the administration of his own Department, and, if dissatisfied with the performance of the Aboriginal Development Commission, putting in place in that Commission people who could make it perform better-improving the quality of its staff, and so on-what did the Minister do? As Senator Teague and others on this side have cogently told us, what he did was sack every member of the Commission whom it was within his power to sack. Indeed, he would have sacked the Chairman, Mrs Shirley McPherson, had it been within his power and he has, in the end, managed to get rid of her also. </PARA>
<PARA> So, far from setting out to build constructively and to deal seriously with the administrative responsibility with which he had been entrusted, this Minister has set out on a wrecking expedition. He has wrecked the Aboriginal Development Commission and, indeed, in terms of this Bill, he now seeks to abolish it. As we know from recent revelations in the Press, he seeks to abolish it in practice even before this Bill becomes effective-should it be, with the assistance of the Australian Democrats, that it does become effective. He has, as I say, totally neglected the administration in his own Department. That is the first responsibility of a Minister of the Crown. If he is dissatisfied with the performance of his own Department he should do something about it. Mr Hand has done nothing about it other than to repel the advice tendered to him by his Department and to retreat into his own private closet with his own private left wing activist advisers. He has exacerbated the situation. He has continued the breakdown of the administrative performance of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, surely the first question that any sensible person approaching the Bill before us would ask is: what is the purpose of the Bill? What purpose is it meant to serve which could not already be served by the existing administrative agencies-the Department and the Commission-if their performances were improved, as any hardworking responsible Minister would seek to achieve. Since there is no obvious answer to that question, notwithstanding the hundreds of thousands of words that have been spoken on this matter to date, one must ask what is the hidden agenda behind Mr Hand's action in seeking continually for the past 18 months to foist this legislation upon the people of Australia and, indeed, to foist it upon the Aboriginal people themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> As other speakers have said in this debate, there has been a total breakdown of the consultative processes between the Minister and the Aboriginal communities in this country, a total reneging by Mr Hand on the promises to that end that he had previously given and hence, of course, a very widespread feeling of dissatisfaction amounting in some cases to outright protest, and even more than that in many of the Aboriginal communities concerned. Mr Hand, notwithstanding that-although his first duty is towards those communities-appears to be prepared to press on regardless and to ram this legislation through the Parliament as it has been rammed through the House of Representatives, with the use of the guillotine, in its present formation and, of course, also in its previous formation before the earlier Bill was left to lapse on our Senate Notice Paper. </PARA>
<PARA> A totally new Bill-the one now before us-was introduced by way of response by the Minister to the extremely critical and condemnatory report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs which was tendered, I think, on 28 February of this year. My colleagues Senator Peter Baume and Senator Ron Boswell presented a damning minority report to add to the already-in themselves-very damning criticisms unanimously agreed by all members of the Committee including the Australian Labor Party members and the Australian Democrat member. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that in the light of those criticisms the Minister has, as I say, introduced a new Bill. But let us not allow the Minister or anyone else to think that we have been fooled by the fact that he has undertaken this cosmetic operation and that we are going to roll over, put up our paws in the air and say, `Thank you very much'. We are not going to allow our tummies to be tickled because he has given us a new Bill-a new Bill with not quite so many flaws as the previous Bill, but almost as many. </PARA>
<PARA> There are so many things wrong with the current Bill that it is quite impossible, within the compass of the time available to me, even to enumerate them, let alone elaborate upon more than one or two of them. Let us start right at the beginning with the fundamentals. The whole fundamental approach of this Bill is flawed. That point has been very well brought out by a most interesting article. In last year's December edition of the IPA Review-the quarterly publication of the Institute of Public Affairs in Melbourne. Professor Colin Howard, the Hearn Professor of Law at the University of Melbourne, in an article entitled Australia's Proposed Race Law, very cogently points out:</PARA>
<PARA> If and when the Bill comes to life again-</PARA>
<PARA>he was, of course, writing at the time when it was quite clear that the original Bill, so to speak, was in the process of becoming defunct and was under savage attack and was subject to serious questioning by groups, including the Senate select committee of inquiry to which I have just referred-</PARA>
<PARA>one thing above all should be squarely confronted. It is that the Bill aims to set up an organisation closely resembling a mini-parliament for the sole use and advantage of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. What this will mean is that a section of the Australian population will have been singled out by reference to race for separate representation based on a separate voting roll. If anyone suggests that this resembles apartheid, the answer will no doubt be made that in the first place the Bill does not deprive Aborigines or Torres Strait Islanders of any rights they may already enjoy-</PARA>
<PARA>I am not absolutely sure that that is true, incidentally, in practical terms although, certainly in legal terms, that may be the case-</PARA>
<PARA>but on the contrary adds to those rights, and that the Government is trying to help them, not repress them. The fact remains that they are being singled out, and the process enshrined in law, on undisguisedly racial grounds. </PARA>
<PARA>Professor Howard goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Some of the consequences may not be welcome. Among other things, a body will have been brought into existence with which the Federal Government can negotiate a treaty analogous to the Treaty of Waitangi reached between whites and Maoris in New Zealand a century-and-a-half ago. </PARA>
<PARA>I might digress for one moment to remark that, increasingly, all detached and objective observers of the New Zealand scene express increasing concern about the developments in race relations in that country between the Maori people and the non-Maori inhabitants arising out of the developments, including the legal developments and the developments relating to the ownership of land in particular, based upon, or purporting to be based upon, the Treaty of Waitangi. I return to Professor Howard's article:</PARA>
<PARA>Although there are supporters in this country of the idea of a treaty, there are others who legitimately have misgivings about it. It can be said, for example, that land rights have caused enough trouble already-</PARA>
<PARA> Again I digress for one moment to remark upon the furore which is consuming public debate in the Northern Territory at the present time because of the blundering and, at the same time, bullying actions by Mr Hand, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, and the Labor Government in what they now propose in the provision of so-called living areas to particular Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory by way of Commonwealth legislation, by way of Commonwealth title and by way of overriding the properly elected government of the self-governing Territory. Again here in Australia is yet another example of trouble over land rights. That will not be the end of it. I return again to Professor Howard's article:</PARA>
<PARA>It can be said, for example, that land rights have caused enough trouble already without giving one side of the argument the status of a quasi-national independent community. It can be said also that in the long-run it is folly to enact a racial law which manifestly divides Australians instead of uniting them. </PARA>
<PARA>Professor Howard concludes his article by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>It is a fundamental cause for unease that, contrary to our professed political ideology, the ATSIC Bill if it becomes law, will have revealed us as being as racist as anyone else. We should not be in the business of deliberately creating a sub-nation with a sub-parliament with enormous powers to claim land and other properties as its own-</PARA>
<PARA>those latter claims will be the subject of very considerable debate when we come to the committee stage of the Bill-those enormous powers, as Professor Howard quite rightly describes them, written into the Bill, to `claim land and other property' as the Commission's own-</PARA>
<PARA>Whatever the motives, this is a recipe for racial disaster. </PARA>
<PARA>I have to say that I agree with all of that, without even coming to the constitutional questions, the addressing of which Professor Howard is obviously highly qualified to do. He is the Hearn Professor of constitutional law at Melbourne University. I go not to those strictly legal questions but rather to his comment that it can be said also that in the long run it is folly to enact a racial law which manifestly divides Australians instead of uniting them. It cannot be denied that this Bill and what will follow from it will manifestly divide Australians. It is already beginning to do so. It is only that the Government has by and large so far, I have to concede, been remarkably successful in keeping it quiet that the process of division within our community between Aboriginal Australians and non-Aboriginal Australians has not already become much more heated than it has. I promise you, Mr Acting Deputy President, the longer this Bill proceeds-and if, as I fear, it is enacted-the longer we go on with the processes and procedures that will flow from it, the more divisiveness there will be created. Indeed, there are those who would argue that that is precisely the hidden agenda behind this Bill: to create divisions within the Australian community where none need or should exist. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Peter Baume said when opening the second reading debate for the Opposition, the test of this Bill is not whether it makes some minor improvement in the conditions affecting the lives of Aboriginal Australians in this country. I say in passing that I do not believe that the Bill will do that. But if that were all it did, it could not possibly be justified that we should be proceeding with this waste of parliamentary time and with this massive upheaval of the whole existing administrative structure. A far better course would be to effect those minor improvements by cleaning up the Minister's own rotten administrative act and his own appalling performance as a Minister, if that were all the Bill were to achieve. As Senator Peter Baume has quite rightly said, the test of this Bill is whether it will produce a major improvement in the conditions under which Aboriginal people live in this country, whether there will flow from it major improvements in Aboriginal health, Aboriginal welfare and Aboriginal living standards. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Crichton-Browne quite rightly reminds the Senate by way of interjection, this Bill is not about those fundamental needs of the Aboriginal people of this country. It is about politics. Have the Aboriginal people of this country not suffered enough at the hands of successive governments? I do not absolve previous governments, both Labor and coalition, from some fault in that regard for bringing their own paternalist views to bear upon the situation and the problems of Aboriginal people in this country. I can only say that what the Minister proposes in this Bill is a quantum leap in the application of politics to practical problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What have we seen as we have watched the level of Commonwealth spending in this area grow to where it is now about $800m per annum? What have been the tangible results? I do not want to say there have been no tangible results. But I do want to say that the results have in no way justified the expenditure of the enormous sums of public moneys involved and have in no way justified the call upon taxpayers to those extents. Yet the Minister now proposes that these public funds should simply be handed over to be administered by this new Commission to be elected-if that is the right term-by 60 separate regional bodies each of which will elect 20 people. So we will have what Professor Howard rightly calls a mini-parliament of no less than 1,200 people, all of whom will no doubt be granted salaries, travelling allowances, living allowances and all sorts of other perquisites-all drawn from the public purse. I do not have much doubt as to the degree of political manipulation that will be brought to bear upon the communities involved to ensure that the people with the right kinds of political activist views are sent forward to be representatives in this mini-parliament. So much for the practical results. </PARA>
<PARA> In the brief time remaining to me let me not omit to note the passages with which the Bill before us today commences. Although the so-called preface is, I trust, to be excised from the Bill by way of amendment-one of the amendments which I understand the Democrats will be supporting-nevertheless we should not overlook the fact that the Government has included such a preface in the Bill that has come before us, the Bill which was guillotined through the House of Representatives in such a short space of time and with such little debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Peter Baume described this Bill as perhaps the most important piece of legislation in the Aboriginal affairs area ever to have come before the Parliament. I would go further than that and say that it is one of the most important pieces of legislation ever to have come before the Parliament in the total area of our society and of our Parliament. Let us just look at one or two paragraphs of this preface. I do not have time to canvass it in full. The preamble states:</PARA>
<PARA> AND WHEREAS the people whose descendants are now known as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of Australia were the prior occupiers-</PARA>
<PARA>nobody could contest that they were the prior occupiers-</PARA>
<PARA>and original owners of this land . . . </PARA>
<PARA> AND WHEREAS they were dispossessed by subsequent European occupation and have no recognised rights over land yet recognised by the courts other than those granted or recognised by the Crown;</PARA>
<PARA> AND WHEREAS that dispossession . . . </PARA>
<PARA>and so it goes on. What do honourable senators think will be the end result of that process, of these words with which the Government has commenced this Bill? I will leave that to the judgment of the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill of 1989. Unfortunately, Senator Stone ran out of time, but let me touch upon the matters he was referring to. He was referring to the preamble to the Bill which sets out a number of statements which, presumably, this Government is declaring as statements of fact. The preamble states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> AND WHEREAS the people whose descendants are now known as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of Australia were the prior occupiers and original owners of this land;</PARA>
<PARA>The preamble talks about dispossession having occurred and about compensation not having been provided. It talks about there having been no agreement between the Aboriginal people and the invaders-as the Government would have us believe-in respect of the use of Aboriginal land. The last paragraph of the preamble states:</PARA>
<PARA> AND WHEREAS the Australian Government has given effect to its longstanding commitment to protect the rights of all of its citizens . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It then qualifies that by referring in particular to a certain group of Australians. It qualifies the even playing field in terms of protecting the rights of all citizens. It is not just an esoteric debate; it is not simply an academic statement that the Government is making when it talks about `prior ownership'. It goes to the heart of the legal argument that is put in respect of land rights. The moment we dismantle the argument of prior ownership, the question of land rights becomes one of equity, fairness and reasonableness-subjective judgments to be made by all Australians. That is why those who believe in uniform land rights hold tightly to that argument, the legal argument, because in that way they can put aside what is fair, reasonable, equitable, tolerable and acceptable to all Australian people. It is held by those who make these statements that the Aboriginal people had, by legal definition, `prior ownership' of Australia. Mr Holding, the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, said on 8 December 1983:</PARA>
<PARA> The prior ownership of Australia by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people must be acknowledged by this Parliament and understood by all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say, in the same House of Representatives debate:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the people whose descendants are now known as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia were the prior occupiers and original owners of Australia . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He was saying that as the Minister and, presumably, as a lawyer. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . from the time of arrival of representatives of King George III of England, and the subsequent conquest-</PARA>
<PARA>that is what this revolves around, the word `conquest'-</PARA>
<PARA>of the land and the subjugation of the Aboriginal people, no settlement was concluded between those representatives and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people . . . </PARA>
<PARA> He went on to say, inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA>That is not to say that the Parliament of this country, on behalf of the citizens of this country, cannot recognise the prior ownership by the Aboriginal people of the continent. Nor do I suggest that the conquest of this continent by non-Aboriginal forces should be ignored or disguised as peaceful settlement. Quite the contrary. I hold the strong personal view that unless and until those matters are recognised both on a community basis and by way of formal recognition in the Parliament of Australia, this nation will lack integrity and credibility in the field of human rights in the eyes of its own citizens as well as of the international community. All the policies which my Government is currently pursuing are based firmly in the recognition and acknowledgment of Aboriginal prior ownership and their dispersal and dispossession. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Holding was stating what subsequently has been stated by Mr Hand. Mr Hand said that it is clearly his view that:</PARA>
<PARA>There is a widely held belief that we cannot come to terms with our history unless we reach some form of compact, agreement, treaty or makarrata-the name is not significant-between the Aboriginal and Islander and non-Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA>To establish, as the Government seeks to do, that Australia was not occupied but invaded, as I say, has legal ramifications. Firstly, by definition it purports to suggest that Australia was an Aboriginal nation, that there was a complete social, economic and political structure and that, as a result, occupation was not possible but only invasion or conquest. In the case of conquest, it is generally recognised that privately owned property in a territory which has been acquired by conquest remains unaffected by the transfer of sovereignty unless or until the new sovereign brings about some alteration in its condition by means of his own domestic law. In the case of occupation or settlement, on the other hand, the basic assumption is that there are no rights at all existing at the time of occupation. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, if there is a simple occupation, the laws of the land are automatically those of the occupying sovereign. In the case of invasion, in respect of private property the laws in respect of that property and in respect of that land remain those of the original inhabitants-those who have been invaded-until such time as the sovereign, or unless the sovereign, imposes by a positive act quite different laws. That is why the question of how sovereignty was applied is therefore directly relevant to the validity of the land rights claim and to compensation for unlawful dispossession or acquisition of private property. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of terra nullius does not rest simply on whether Australia was inhabited. The argument is not simply whether there were people in Australia at the time of settlement, but whether there was an Aboriginal nation with recognisable legislative, executive and judicial organs. In other words, was there a nation in the proper sense? That is the significance of the argument that is being put by Mr Holding, Mr Hand and the Australian Labor Party generally. That is why they have put the preamble in the legislation. I do not necessarily argue that they are putting it there for the intention of interpretation by the High Court of Australia so that a case could be held but, to the extent that they are able, they are still seeking to press that argument. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hand continues to talk about the question of a makarrata. Let me say something, once and for all, in respect of that word, which is used quite deliberately by Mr Hand. It is an East Arnhem Land word which means the coming together of two warring groups after the letting of blood by way of retribution of one against another. It is in that spirit that this Government is putting to us that there ought to be an arrangement, in the same way as it is putting to us continually that there ought to be, by legal definition or, at the very worst, by social compulsion, compensation for dispossession. Holding said it in his statement; Hand has said it on a number of occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> Compensation, in a more contemporary world, is described as reparation. I would have thought that the Treaty of Versailles following the First World War was a lesson to all of us that reparation is not an effective way of ensuring a spirit of goodwill and cooperation following any treaty or agreement. That was acknowledged very directly following the Second World War when no such agreement was entered into. That is the point, I assume, that Senator Stone was coming to in respect of the purpose of the wording of the preamble. It is not there as some esoteric, academic inclusion in the document for the casual reader to run his eye over; it is a deliberate inclusion to demonstrate a statement of fact that the Government is prepared to accept. That is what it is there for. It is a deliberate act. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, this legislation, which to the best of my knowledge has support from a very modest number of Aboriginal communities, will plunge us again into an Aboriginal political imbroglio from which perhaps this time we may not be able to retreat. As Senator Stone said earlier, it is not an attempt to improve those matters in respect of Aboriginal affairs which need improving, but is simply the ideological pursuit and obsession of a Minister hell-bent on imposing his social experiment on not only the Aboriginal community but also all Australians. It has nothing to do with improving harmony, and least of all with improving living standards and making the environment a better place for the Aboriginal people to live and flourish in. </PARA>

<PARA> The other paper was presented by Ms Elizabeth Savage, from the Department of Economics at the University of Sydney. Ms Savage is not a member of any political party. Her paper was entitled, `A Woman's Worth: Taxation and Australian Women'. It dealt with what the likely effects of certain reforms to the taxation system might be for Australia's women. Both papers are quite interesting. I have shown them to Senator Reynolds and I seek leave of the Senate to table them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, when the Government presented its White Paper on AIDS, I was able to open the debate on behalf of the Opposition in response to that White Paper. It is not my intention to recanvass those issues but simply to draw attention to two aspects in relation to the consultative process which the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) put in place in order to develop the White Paper. This started with the initial publication of a discussion paper, the so-called Green Paper. Mr Acting Deputy President, you will recall that as a result of the Government's initiative a series of working parties was established to canvass issues raised in the Green Paper. These six working parties toured the whole country, took an incredible amount of evidence and eventually presented a series of reports and papers to the Government. I had the honour to chair one of those panels-panel No. 5-which was dealing with the question of testing for HIV-AIDS infection. In May 1989 we published our report, the title of which is simply, `Consultation Paper No. 5: Report of the Working Panel on Testing for HIV AIDS'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to take this opportunity today simply to record my personal thanks to the other members of that panel. They were: Dr John Ballard from the Department of Political Science at the Australian National University; Professor Tony Basten, Department of Immunology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, formerly the Chief Commonwealth Scientific Adviser on AIDS; Professor Ian Gust from the Fairfield Hospital for Infectious Diseases, who has now been appointed to the position of Chief Commonwealth Scientific Adviser on AIDS; Miss Maureen O'Brien, a community health worker and nurse from the Gay Men's Community Health Centre in Melbourne; Dr David Plummer, from the Department of Microbiology at Monash University, who is also Chairman of the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations; and Professor Robert Sanson-Fisher, from the Department of Behavioural Sciences in Medicine at the University of Newcastle. In addition, our panel was assisted by Dr Andy Butlin, from the Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health as secretary. I wish simply to place on record my personal appreciation for the enormous amount of work which the members of that panel did. </PARA>
<PARA> We held meetings in Adelaide on 7 February, Perth on 8 February, Hobart on 17 February, Melbourne on 17 February, Sydney on 21 and 22 February, Darwin on 23 February and Brisbane on 24 February. In addition, with the cooperation of State authorities we visited prisons at Parramatta and Long Bay in New South Wales and at Wacol in Brisbane in order to examine the status of their facilities for dealing with HIV infected prisoners and the general policies put in place by the prison authorities for dealing with prisoners infected with the virus. I wish also to place on record my appreciation of the cooperation from the New South Wales and Queensland State Ministers responsible for prisons for allowing us to visit prisons and have access to the prison officers and, more importantly, to talk in a quite unsupervised, unstructured and free-ranging fashion with people who, in fact, were incarcerated in those institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> I indicated yesterday in my speech on the question of AIDS policy how important it was now to address the significant issue of intravenous drug use. It may be of interest to honourable senators to know that on 4 August the Hon. Virginia Chadwick, MLC, the New South Wales State Minister for Family and Community Services, gave an address which deals with the question of changes undertaken in New South Wales, particularly in relation to strategies adopted to improve the welfare of young people who are particularly at risk as far as drug use behaviour in that State is concerned. I seek leave to table a copy of the paper the Minister presented on that date. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Finally, I draw attention to a publication which came to me today from the poisonous pen of Mr Peter Sawyer dealing with questions of AIDS policy which is related in part both to this matter and also to the current debate which is under way on the question of the welfare or otherwise of Aboriginal persons. I simply draw attention to the fact that this latest outburst from Mr Sawyer is one of the most insane and disgraceful pieces of gibberish that I have ever come across. What Mr Sawyer says in part in his current newsletter, or whatever it is, is that people should be cautious about participating in public health schemes designed to vaccinate people against the hepatitis B infection. He claims that the reason they should be cautious is that the vaccine currently being used around the place is a vaccine which he claims was developed in the 1970s from blood products specifically taken from homosexuals who had been exposed to the infection and, as a result, it is likely that this vaccine carries within it the AIDS virus and, in fact, programs particularly in the Northern Territory to immunise Australian Aboriginals with this vaccine and in Queensland to immunise Torres Strait Islanders and Thursday Islanders will lead to an epidemic of the AIDS virus in those communities and potentially put them all at risk.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Quite clearly, the program is intended to extend the reach of the hepatitis B campaign to prevent the spread of a disease more infectious and, in some respects, more deadly than AIDS, particularly in those communities. It is absolutely not just the height of irresponsibility but a mark of insanity for this lunatic Sawyer to be peddling a line which not only is scientifically untrue, and is factually completely inaccurate, but also is designed to frighten people from participation in a significant public health program which is quite vital. I am particularly grateful to my friend and colleague, Senator Grant Tambling, who has drawn my attention to this current publication of Mr Sawyer's. I would simply like to say that I hope that no intelligent person would be in any sense fooled by these lunatic ravings, and that it is important to understand that not only is this part and parcel of an ongoing campaign by Mr Sawyer, but also it plays upon the fears of people about the AIDS virus and about groups who may have been particularly infected or at risk from the AIDS virus because of their behaviour. It is all part and parcel of the process by which debate is attempted to be pushed off the tracks. So far we have avoided that in Australia; we have managed to avoid it because both sides of the Parliament have a commitment to ensure that the AIDS programs are properly put in place, that they have bipartisan support, and that other related public health measures, such as the hepatitis B vaccination campaign, are dealt with in a similar fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, I simply wanted to take the opportunity to make a few remarks, to thank my colleagues who worked with me on the testing panel, to bring to people's attention the extremely significant address given by the New South Wales Minister for Family and Community Services, and to forewarn people once again not to be fooled into making irrational judgments about public health policy in Australia on the basis of gross misinformation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I want to canvass a further extension of what a happy little work force Australia has at the moment with the pilots on strike, railway workers on strike, teachers on strike and, in Western Australia, the people who process the milk on strike. Everyone is looking at the moment at going on strike.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The main reason for my comments today is that another attack has now been made on the pharmacists. It was very concerning that, with this quite deliberate attack that the Government has launched in reducing the pharmacists' incomes, Senator Cook did not even take the opportunity in last night's adjournment debate in the Senate to respond to the comments that Senator Calvert had made about his concern about the treatment of pharmacists. Senator Cook, as we well know, is the Minister in this place responsible for that area, and he did not even care to respond. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am very concerned about is the effect of this measure by the Government, a measure that we have expressed concern about for some months and a measure that is not only further exacerbating the problems experienced by the pharmacists in the reduction of their incomes, but is also now putting forward the real possibility of further pharmacies closing up. Of course, in the short term, as we read in the West Australian of today's date, chemists may close for a half-day protest because of moves to cut pharmacists' incomes. The Government may not think that this is taken seriously, but even its mates are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Salaried Pharmacists Association of Western Australia has expressed concern about this. It has said that this would undoubtedly-and I agree-place many of its members' jobs at risk. The Association's secretary said that he would ask the Trades and Labour Council to endorse a national stoppage of pharmacies in protest. Then the situation is further inflamed by that Einstein in the other place, Minister Staples, who just labels the Pharmacy Guild as hotheads and yet will not even listen to people on his own side who, I understand, at yesterday's Caucus meeting expressed grave concerns-in particular, Mr Tony Lamb from the Labor Party, who said that the decision was unfair. It is interesting, because the Government clearly is not listening to what its own people, the pharmacists and the Opposition are saying. </PARA>
<PARA> The sad reality of it is that the effort against the pharmacists has been going on for some time. Over the last two years, in Western Australia alone we have seen the closure of nine pharmacies, all country pharmacies. Four of them have been in one-pharmacy towns-Lake Grace, Three Springs, Morowa and Beverley-and there have been two closures in Esperance. What concerns me is that we are going to see more in the very near future. There are nine pharmacies in the Kalgoorlie-Boulder area, one in Kambalda and one in Southern Cross. Those one-town pharmacies, particularly in the country, remain very vulnerable. While the Government may say that some of these closures occurred in 1987, before this latest round of actions against pharmacy incomes began, it shows that some country pharmacies were already vulnerable to closure and that further action will make them even more vulnerable. We are also worried that fewer pharmacists operating in the larger centres will mean far less personalised health care advice for the customers as the workload increases for those who remain. It has got to the stage of crisis. There are 1,380 pharmacies in Western Australia, but many of those are now facing losses of $30,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just the pharmacists, but also those who are employed in pharmacies, who will be affected. I gather that many of my colleagues-I am certainly not the only one-have received letters from very distressed staff working in pharmacies who are very worried, particularly at this time of high interest rates, increased inflation and everything else, about losing their jobs. But how can it be stopped when the Government has, as I say, taken a stream of measures that has seen a steady decline in incomes? First of all, the Government reduced the professional fee by 10c per item. That of itself meant approximately a $5,000 loss annually to pharmacists. Then it cut the wholesale margins by 5 per cent. It also doubled the maximum prescribable quantity of drugs so that people did not come back as often for repeat scripts. Then we get the latest 23 per cent cut in pharmacy incomes, $1.05 off each prescription. Where is this leading?</PARA>
<PARA> I think we should be very worried about the loss of accessability for many in our community, particularly the aged and those who are less mobile. As we go on with more and more of these closures, we will restrict the availability of pharmacies for old people who not only have transport difficulties in getting to pharmacies but also need very careful advice from a pharmacist. That is currently readily accessible through the pharmacy network, if one wants to call it that, but we are going to be confronted with the people who need after-hours medication. People do not generally haunt their pharmacists unless they are very sick. But how in the world can the pharmacists keep on opening their doors when they are losing money hand over fist? All this will mean is that there will be fewer pharmacies open for fewer hours and that pharmacies will therefore be less accessible. </PARA>
<PARA> Where do the people in the country, in these one-pharmacy towns, then go? Do they go 120 kilometres down the road to get their medications? Let us not forget that people are generally on medications out of necessity and not for the fun of it. The person who runs out of a drug that is critical to his ailment would not be the first to have his drugs run low. What will happen when a person in a situation such as that has to travel hundreds of kilometres to get to the next pharmacist?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government, I believe, is simply being dishonest in claiming that our pharmacies are inefficient and need an imposed rationalisation-rationalisation, my foot! What the Government is talking about is simply closing the pharmacies down. Pharmacists are certainly good small business operators. They are well respected in the community. Anybody who needs any reinforcement of that should look at the last national poll on the respectability of various occupations. Naturally enough, we did not rate too high but the pharmacists had an approval rate of 76 per cent, above all other professions. Yet this Government is hitting them for six. </PARA>
<PARA> A cynic might well say that this is just the latest attempt by the Government to penalise those who may not vote for it. We see attacks on the doctors, we see constant attacks on the farmers and we see attacks on the airline pilots. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has become very macho in his attitude to the airline pilots, in the same way in which Minister Staples-if he could be at all macho-has tried to be macho on this issue. Because they do not believe that most of these people vote for the Labor Party, they feel they may as well slip the boot into them. This country is getting to a very sad state when political judgment is taken into account instead of what is best for the community and what is best for various industries. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1983 Australia spent only 0.4 per cent of gross domestic product on pharmaceuticals compared to 0.6 per cent in the United States and 1.16 per cent in Japan. Quite frankly, it is not the fault of the pharmacists that drugs become more expensive. We may have more pharmacies per head in Australia than the Government chooses to quote in selected overseas countries-it does not give us the full story, it just selects countries-but the Government ignores the fact that in the United Kingdom many doctors are able to dispense pharmaceuticals and in Scandinavia a single pharmacy may have several separate outlets. That is the reality, yet the Government chooses to ignore it. </PARA>
<PARA> We go further down the list of what this Government has done in terms of pharmacies. It has taken many preferred drugs off the pharmaceutical benefits list because it considers them too expensive, so people have been forced to have less expensive drugs, regardless of whether a cheaper drug does the same job or is as effective as another drug. It says, `Let us attack the whole system. The Government knows best what is going to benefit the people of Australia'. I would go so far as to say that it is in fact the doctors and the pharmacists who know what drug is best for their patients, not some harebrained Minister, or government in particular, with some harebrained idea, hell-bent on penalising anyone who may not vote for it. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly hope that the Government will see reason and reject the latest proposed decrease in the incomes of pharmacies. This cut of 23 per cent is, as I say, the culmination of a series of actions initiated or condoned by the Government attacking the profitability of pharmacies right throughout Australia. In particular, I am concerned about the 1,380 pharmacies in Western Australia, a very large and isolated State, where people will have to travel hundreds and hundreds of kilometres to get their required drugs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. I ask: Is it reasonable to expect that a country which is a major commodity exporter like Australia would benefit from high commodity prices, and that this would be reflected in an improvement in the current account and foreign debt position? How does the Minister explain that, given the further major improvement last financial year in Australia's trading conditions, there has been a blow-out in the current account deficit and a 20 per cent increase in net external debt over the 1988-89 financial year? Will the Minister confirm that, as a percentage of gross domestic product, Australia will this calendar year have the worst current account deficit of any Western industrialised nation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, a country which is commodity dependent in terms of its exports, as Australia is, is likely to benefit from high commodity prices. All the first part of Senator Lewis's question is designed to point out is that the terms of trade have been favourable for Australia in the last couple of years, something which they were not a couple of years before that, and indeed there may be some marginal signs of movement in respect of particular commodities which affect the terms of trade. So one would normally expect that a commodity dependent economy would be pleased by high commodity prices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He then goes on to attempt to tie a number of other issues to that question. One of the reasons, of course, for the terms of trade imbalance in the past year or two has been the very high level of growth in the Australian economy, the consequent very high demand for imports, and the fact that imports in some areas have been at record levels. In some cases they have been encouraged by high consumer demand; in some cases encouraged by very high, record levels of investment in certain sectors of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA> It is, in those circumstances, not entirely surprising that the current account deficits have been continuing at the levels that they have in the last couple of years. Of course, a current account deficit is not a new phenomenon in this country. Only twice in the last 14 years, I think, has the value of exports from Australia exceeded the value of imports. It is not a new problem; it is just a problem which has been exacerbated by high levels of demand, last year particularly, and by increasing levels of imports associated particularly with increasing levels of investment. Of course, the art form, as I certainly would argue it, is to carry out over time the necessary structural adjustments in the Australian economy which will help it diversify.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the last part of that question is quite clearly yes. The article in the Australian today is headed `Growers back Wheat Board in docks row', and it reports a resolution passed at the annual conference of the Queensland Grain Growers Association supporting the Wheat Board's decision last week to negotiate for reform rather than confrontation with waterfront unions. If I might quote an excerpt from the Australian's report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The association has agreed to support rather than confront-</PARA>
<PARA>quoting Mr Ian MacFarlane, the Vice-President of the QGGA. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>We haven't backed down on our position to see a need for enterprise employment.</PARA>
<PARA> If negotiations for reform are not finalised by October 30, and that's the latest date, then we would force the issue into arbitration.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian observes in its final comment:</PARA>
<PARA>The QGGA's support for the Wheat Board is a setback for the Grains Council.</PARA>
<PARA>As far as this matter is concerned, I think a couple of things should be placed clearly and firmly on the record: the Queensland Grain Growers Association is not, for example, a radical organisation of grain growing dissidents away from the mainstream. It is not a group of alternative agriculturalists. It is, indeed, the mainstream organisation in Queensland representing grain growers. Its previous presidents have become presidents of the Grains Council, and Mr McKechnie, the present President of the Association, is a son of a former National Party Minister in Queensland. What we have here is an organisation speaking on behalf of Queensland grain growers in a context in which Premier Mike Ahern has come out and endorsed the Australian Grains Council's New Right, Rambo, unilateralist approach-`Let's intervene; let's confront'. In the context of Ahern doing that, the Queensland organisation representing grain growers has said, `No. We prefer a non-confrontationist approach'. The answer to the first part of the question is: Yes, of course, the Queensland National Party Government is out of touch with its own rural base.</PARA>
<PARA> The second element to be referred to is that yesterday we had the unedifying spectacle of Senator Grant Chapman talking about the monstering of the Australian Wheat Board by the Grains Council of Australia, outright intimidation by the Grains Council of the Wheat Board, because of the decision the Wheat Board made of itself.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, Senator Chapman cannot have that argument, because Minister Kerin made it quite clear that the Wheat Board would stand alone and make its own decisions and so it has. That is a clear example of monstering by the Grains Council. In that context, what has the Queensland body representing grain growers done? It has in fact denied the position of the Federal body and of Senator Chapman's silly notice of motion yesterday. Therefore, while there is no doubt that the Queensland Grain Growers Association is strongly going to put the interests of its members in the context of waterfront reform, it is doing it in the rational context proposed by the Government and will do it legally. It has turned its back on unilateralism and confrontationism and has accepted that certainly waterfront and shipping reform in Australia, as this Government has been saying for a long time, is necessary. But it is not a question of whether it is necessary or not, but how best to get it. It is said in effect that the best way to get it is the way this Government is proceeding and not the headline-grabbing unilateralist, confrontationist approach the Opposition advocates.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Monday of this week, 28 August, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal delivered a final judgment on the levels of remuneration for pharmacists under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS). The PBRT has called for a major restructuring of the PBS and the way in which pharmacists are remunerated. This is not a Government decision.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walters ought to understand that, because she has been obfuscating this point. It is an independent tribunal and, by sullying its independence, I believe Senator Walters is indeed committing a libel. Most pharmacists, unfortunately, and some journalists, do not understand the independence of the body.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Stone interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Stop prattling away, Senator Stone. The PBRT reached its decision after a two-year inquiry and 600 submissions. Contrary to some reports, the Government submission did not suggest any preferred fee level but rather concentrated on the need for structural reform. The proposal is entirely the PBRT's affair. It is effectively the umpire's decision. The Tribunal recommended substantial changes to the system of payments because the subsidies now provided to pharmacists to cover the costs of providing PBS drugs were not supported by the data supplied to the Tribunal. In other words, the PBRT has found that the payment system to cover the costs of dispensing PBS drugs was excessive. As a result, the payment per service will be reduced by a total of $1.05 per item in three stages over 12 months. The abolition of the 25 per cent mark-up on PBS items is included in this figure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Earlier this year the Minister, Peter Staples, and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia were on the point of finalising negotiations to present a united submission to the Tribunal. However, at literally the last minute, the Guild broke off negotiations and decided to go it alone. This is the result of that. Had the Guild accepted the Government's offer to reach a negotiated agreement, there would have been scope for overcoming several of the major structural problems in the PBS. Unfortunately, the Guild strategy to go it alone has backfired badly for its members.</PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that the PBRT was established under the Fraser Liberal Government. In fact, this very independent body was a key element in the former Liberal Government's thinking when it set up the PBRT. As Mr MacKellar said when introducing the PBRT legislation in 1981:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that there are a number of advantages to be gained by establishing a public tribunal. First, it will remove from the political arena the question of the level of fees paid to chemists and for dispensing of pharmaceutical benefits. Both the chemists and the Government will be bound by the tribunal's decision. Secondly it will provide a forum in which all interested parties may publicly argue their case whilst ensuring that the levels of chemists' remuneration are determined by an independent body. Thirdly, it will remove the need for the Government to finance cumbersome and costly inquiries of the sort that have been conducted since 1964-1965.</PARA>
<PARA>I conclude by saying that the door remains open to pharmacists to resume useful negotiations with the Government at any time. In fact, it is my understanding that the Minister responsible, my colleague Peter Staples, is meeting the Pharmacy Guild of Australia tomorrow. If there is a postscript to my concluding comment, it is the report of the Tribunal. Last night we saw a senator in this place from the Opposition ranks, who had not read this report, leap to comment and editorialise about it. This inquiry has lasted a long time and taken a lot of submissions. The very least the critics can do is actually read what the inquiry found.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, it would not surprise Senator Macklin that many of the reports he reads are often not the truth. The ones that Senator Macklin has read in this case certainly are a long way from the mark. Most senators would be aware, of course, that all Chinese nationals legally in Australia on 4 June were permitted to extend their entry permits to 31 July 1990. Those who are here illegally, whilst not permitted to extend their permits, are not being required to leave at this time. I think these arrangements were very generous for the People's Republic of China (PRC) nationals, because they were granted irrespective of their circumstances. To the extent that some PRC nationals may wish to seek refugee status in Australia, these provisions at least afford a temporary protection for those individuals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As of 18 August, almost 5,500 Chinese had extended their entry permits under the special provisions. At the same time some 9,500 changed to resident status applications and some 5,700 refugee status applications had been distributed. The number of applications so far lodged is some 270 and 100 respectively. We as a Department are not encouraging people to rush in at the moment with these applications until the situation in China becomes more clear cut. But it should not be taken that because people do not apply immediately that in any way lessens their long term claims. The honourable senator asks what sort of privileges do these individuals have, for instance, on the question of the right to work. All PRC nationals have been given the right to work. The only restriction is those who are currently undergoing a course. They may be limited to 20 hours a week. Otherwise they have the right to work whether they are here legally or illegally. Normal eligibility conditions apply for special benefits. My colleague the Minister for Community Services and Health, Dr Blewett, through his powers under the Health Insurance Act, has declared that PRC nationals in Australia temporarily on 4 June who have chosen not to return to the PRC at present will be covered by Medicare from that time until the entry permits cease.</PARA>
<PARA> On the final matter, which is not a matter for my portfolio again-the question of eligibility for Austudy-the honourable senator would, of course, be aware that at this stage it is only available for those people who are Australian citizens or permanent residents in Australia. Nevertheless, I am advised that Mr Dawkins has undertaken to give the honourable senator a response to his letter which raises these matters. No doubt it is somewhat delayed because he is on sick leave at the moment, but at some stage in the near future I hope he can get back to the honourable senator with a full answer on the question of Austudy.</PARA>

If an individual accepts bribes consisting of items or services such as the provision of an aircraft hanger, the refurbishment of a tip truck, or maintenance of major items of earthworking equipment such as a D9 bulldozer, are those items or services assessable as income for taxation purposes? If so, would the tax liability fall on a family company if the items or services were transferred to it? If an individual or family company failed to declare such tax liabilities would that constitute a breach of the Income Tax Assessment Act for which the individual or directors of the company would be liable for prosecution? Is the Australian Taxation Office pursuing the taxation ramifications of allegations of bribery made on last Monday night's program of Channel Nine's A Current Affair?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the last part of the question, the secrecy provisions in section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act preclude the Commissioner of Taxation from disclosing any information about what investigations or assessments are being issued to individuals. So I cannot, therefore, answer that part of the question which asked whether the Taxation Office was following this matter up or what is it going to do about it, or words to that effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to the other parts of the questions I have with me a private sector publication called the Australian Master Tax Guide. This is a private sector publication and not a publication of the Australian Tax Office. Nevertheless, it is regarded as being reputable and reliable, I think, by the Tax Office and by almost everybody else. On pages 307 and 309 of that publication, the matters raised by Senator Schacht are dealt with. In general-again, without commenting on these specific items to which Senator Schacht referred-bribes are, for income tax purposes, taken as assessable income. Whether a family company would be liable for the tax would depend on the relationship of the individual to the company and the nature of the transfer of items and services to it. Failure to declare as taxable income such bribes of that nature would be an offence under the Income Tax Act. I do not want to say anything in relation to the matters which were telecast by Channel Nine on Monday night. Indeed, I believe it would be quite improper for me to comment on those matters because it might prejudice somebody or other getting a fair trial. I believe that Mr Ahern acted very properly in referring those matters to the appropriate authorities in Queensland.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what Senator Puplick may think, but that is not necessarily relevant. The answer to the question is simply that the parties involved in the waterfront dispute are subject to the jurisdiction of the Industrial Relations Commission. They are organisations of employers and employees and are subject to that jurisdiction. You cannot draw an analogy with the pilots dispute-what Senator Lewis calls the pilots strike-because the pilots are not subject to the jurisdiction of the Industrial Relations Commission. They have taken themselves outside that jurisdiction. Therefore, the only remedies available are not ones of formal conciliation; they are not ones of formal processes of reconciliation; they are ones which are available at common law or available in terms of the provisions of the trade practices legislation. Those are the remedies which are being used by the airlines in connection with the pilots dispute. That is a different matter from the issue which the honourable senator raised.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have in fact seen some reports, I think more particularly arising out of Melbourne, in recent weeks where financial counsellors and financial counselling organisations have been at the forefront of protecting and asserting the rights of individuals in their relationships with credit organisations. That advocacy work is one part of the work that they conduct which is quite valuable. Senator Zakharov also mentioned counselling work, which is important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the other area of work that they undertake, which is also vitally important, is research work. As part of the Government's general concern and commitment in this area we did amend the Bankruptcy Act to the extent that there will now be an obligation on registrars to ensure that debtors have been referred to sources of financial advice before they formally and irrevocably go bankrupt. That particular role of financial counsellors in that situation is also one that was acknowledged by the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> Having acknowledged the importance of these services, we also feel that there is a commitment to assist organisations and counsellors, and more particularly individuals, who need to rely on the services of such personnel. The Budget provided an allocation of $1m for a financial counselling program. It is a program which has been jointly developed by me and the Minister for Social Security, Mr Brian Howe, particularly to address the problems of low income families and other social security clients and recipients. There is very much an area of need-one that the Government has recognised-that should be a priority for Government consideration. That need is recognised as being exacerbated and heightened when there are deaths. In that respect, older social security clients and recipients are the ones we are looking at helping with the financial counselling program. Those people need greater assistance in traumatic situations such as when there is a death in the family. That circumstance leads to more expense, and greater assistance in the management of their financial affairs is required.</PARA>
<PARA> The problem that we have federally is that this responsibility has been met by the States and some States have met it in a much more comprehensive way than others. Some States do not provide enough, if any, assistance. Financial counselling services are particularly required in rural areas; in capital cities those services may be supplied by government. With the $1m allocation we will isolate the areas of need; we will locate them and address the need. In doing so, we will acknowledge the continuing role of the States and the continuing commitment and responsibility they need to have. We will examine ways of ensuring that the commitment can be maintained, if not developed.</PARA>
<PARA> The other part of the Government's response is in cooperation with the credit industry and credit providers. Some time ago I announced the formation of a task force, consisting of representatives of consumer and industry groups. The task of that task force will be to prepare detailed guidelines for a credit education and research foundation. I anticipate, as, I think, do all involved in the task force, that the foundation will provide assistance to financial counselling networks and to the industry along the lines of education and research material. That task force is still meeting. I anticipate that by the end of the year it should have provided us with some guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, in response to Senator Zakharov's question, the Government recognises the need for and the valuable role played by financial counselling organisations and we are addressing particular and diverse ways of assisting them.</PARA>

I am not sure of the actual day, but it happened some time in the last week. I can report that it has already been returned to its owners. Obviously, seizing a boat is a pretty tough action for the Authority to take, but it had to be taken because Sunlover Cruises had chosen to disregard the Authority by sending without a permit a number of boats to Green Island. The difficulty is that Green Island has been under rather intense tourist pressure now for some time. In fact, something like 250,000 people visit it each year. That has put great pressure on facilities such as sewerage. It is interesting to note that the Queensland Department of Conservation, with the Authority, has called for a moratorium on any future visits being agreed to. Until we can resolve some of the difficulties on Green Island with the pressure that 250,000 people are putting on it, both the Queensland Government and the Federal Government are as one on the question.</PARA></TALK.START>

What comes out at the other end is 85 per cent and it pays only a 15 per cent tax whereas previously it would have been a 30 per cent tax on 100 per cent. But that is getting much too complicated for Senator Walters to understand, I am sure. Senator Watson is quite right, however-of course it is well known that he is one of the few numerate people in the Opposition-in that the new arrangements ultimately slightly favour the people who are the beneficiaries of such schemes but they change the timing of the tax payments.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Although I do acknowledge that a preliminary pilot study of 700 households was carried out in Sydney last year to test the feasibility and methodology required for the major survey, this project appears to have come to a standstill since then. Does the Prime Minister intend to fulfil his promise to the women of Australia, particularly those women whose primary work focuses on the unpaid work force, and carry out this survey? If he does, when will the survey be undertaken? When the results of this survey are known, will the Government take the necessary steps to include the value of women's unpaid work, estimated recently by Melbourne University's Centre for Applied Research on the Future, to be $140 billion annually, for the purposes of calculating gross domestic product?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Powell is right. A trial survey was done in Sydney commencing in June 1987. The results were released in May 1988. Those trial results have been very useful in preparing for a fuller survey. The Prime Minister stands by his promise that a major time use survey will be undertaken and the Australian Bureau of Statistics is preparing its work schedule for 1990-91 to 1992-93-these things are always done substantially in advance-and that work program will include further work on time use.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the second part of the question, the Australian national accounts are compiled in accordance with recommendations in the United Nations document, a system of national accounts called SNA, which does not include unpaid household work in gross domestic product. The SNA has been developed to facilitate economic comparisons between different countries. It can do so only to the extent that countries follow its recommendations and, in line with this, Australia's national accounts do not include unpaid household work.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to answer this question in much the same way as I did an earlier question today which relates more to the strategy of the Budget than particular measures. Of course, the strategy of the Budget is to continue the process of fiscal discipline for the time being, to continue present monetary policy with a view to reducing demand in the Australian economy and a range of measures which have been debated and discussed in the course of the Senate program since the Budget. Certainly Professor Hughes, in her review of the export market development grants scheme, touched on a number of issues which affect export propensity. She referred to a number of macro-economic issues of which the more fundamental ones, as I recall it, were monetary policy, the level of savings in the community and, of course, the issue to which Senator Archer refers, the level of the currency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not know-I do not think anybody does-whether a particular Australian dollar rate can be described as the optimum rate in terms of export activity. Of course, the currency has depreciated by some 12 per cent since earlier this year, having been a year or two ago at a considerably lower level. Senator Archer couches his question in terms of the trade weighted index. Although the Australian dollar is generally measured against the United States dollar, except for a period in 1985-86, the currency has been pretty stable as against the trade weighted index.</PARA>

<PARA> Concerning the second part of the question, the sheep that leave Australia are inspected by veterinarians who are qualified to carry out that responsibility. All sheep that leave here are given a clean bill of health by them. In some cases, but not all, veterinarians have travelled on sheep ships. Indeed, one ship that was turned away from one of the ports in Saudi Arabia contained Australian veterinarians who could not, with their experience, find evidence of the disease that it was later alleged those sheep had.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not know of a way in which we are more able to guarantee the quality and disease-free status of sheep that leave this country than the inspection service that is in place now.

As far as the second element of that question is concerned, we have yet to see-because the Saudi Arabian authorities have not made it available-the evidence of their testing upon which they base the allegations of disease status. In view of that, I do not accept that the case of disease as alleged by the Saudi authorities is necessarily proven, and I do not think the honourable senator should accept it either. I do not know the reason for the refusal of those sheep, and I think that has been a view expressed by Mr Kerin and Mr Duffy. We are mystified and puzzled as to why they are rejected.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, on 29 August, Senator Chapman asked me a question about the proportion of wool purchased at auction in the financial year 1988-89 by the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC). I undertook to obtain an answer to the honourable senator's question as quickly as possible. The proportion of wool purchased at auction by the Australian Wool Corporation in1988-89 was 5.2 per cent of the total offering. The rate of AWC purchases was 16.4 per cent in June 1989 and 39.2 per cent in July 1989, and amounts to approximately 45.3 per cent so far this month. That tallies with some of the figures in the honourable senator's question. But the annual wool selling season commences in July each year and tends to follow a seasonal pattern. Traditionally, demand is weaker in the earlier months of each selling season because overseas buyers are not normally as active then, with many processors being closed during the height of the northern summer season.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So far this season the trade has purchased approximately the same quantity of wool as at the same stage of the season last year. However, increased production of wool, coupled with delays in shearing because of wet weather at the end of last season, has resulted in an increased volume of wool being put on the market in recent weeks. Buyers therefore have greater choice in their purchases. In addition, high overseas stockpiles, notably in Japan, have resulted in reduced activity by Japanese buyers. China and Russia are also not active in the market at present, primarily because of foreign currency shortages. However, the Australian Wool Corporation expects both China and Russia to re-enter the market in the coming months, and as overseas stockpiles are reduced other overseas buyers will become more active, which is expected to result in the market moving more in the seller's favour.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Puplick asked me a question about the dumping of waste oil in Sydney. I was asked first whether I was aware that 15,000 litres of waste oil was illegally dumped into the Sydney sewerage system by a contractor to the Garden Island naval dockyard. The actual figure is 5,000 litres of oily waste from HMAS Perth. It was a normal activity, carried out under a legal contract with a licensed contractor in accordance with New South Wales State regulation. The contract is with the Department of Defence and not with the Garden Island dockyard. Next I was asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Is the Minister aware that this contractor has been under investigation by the Sydney Water Board and the New South Wales waste management authority for previous illegal dumping activities?</PARA>
<PARA>The Royal Australian Navy is not aware of any previous illegal dumping activity by this contractor. However, the Navy was aware that the Metropolitan Waste Disposal Authority was investigating the activities of this contractor and other contractors and the Navy had been cooperating fully with the Metropolitan Waste Disposal Authority in that investigation since May. That entailed the Navy providing full details of the quantities and type of waste removal from ships and establishments. Using that data, the Metropolitan Waste Disposal Authority then found discrepancies with its disposal data, which caused it to investigate further.

<PARA>Is the Minister also aware that the contractor operated a system that did not use the required reporting arrangement, and that this continued with the full knowledge of the management of the Garden Island dockyard?</PARA>
<PARA>I get back to the point that the contract is not with the dockyard management, but with Defence via the Navy. In the Navy's monitoring of the contractor activities the Navy was happy that the full reporting system required by the Metropolitan Water Board, known as the four-docket system, appeared to be operating in compliance with the contract. Waste disposal contracts for the Navy in Sydney are arranged by the Commonwealth Defence Contracting Organisation and include a specific clause calling for the proper disposal of wastes at licensed tips in accordance with State legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> Next I was asked whether I was aware that, had these illegal dumping activities been initiated by a private company, under New South Wales laws that company could have been liable to fines of up to $1m and its directors liable for gaol terms of up to seven years. Certainly, I was aware that penalties in New South Wales had been increased. I take Senator Puplick's word that they are to be the new penalties. I was next asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Is the Minister aware that this is yet another example of the Commonwealth activity being carried out with total disregard for State pollution control laws?</PARA>
<PARA>It was not Commonwealth activity; it was activity by a contractor. That contractor will be subject to the full force of whatever New South Wales laws apply in this case. I was asked finally:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . will the Minister give an undertaking that if the New South Wales Government proceeds with a prosecution of the management of the Garden Island Dockyard the Commonwealth will not claim crown immunity . . .</PARA>
<PARA>In the light of the responsible attitude taken by the Navy and the full cooperation it has given the New South Wales Government from the inception of the investigations into this case, the prospect of action against the Navy does not arise, nor therefore does the issue of crown immunity. The Navy has suspended the use of the contractor and is reverting to last year's successful contractor, who is fully licensed to continue waste disposal operations from Navy ships. Pending the outcome of prosecution proceedings, Defence will look to drawing up a new contract. There is nothing at all to stop New South Wales prosecuting the offender.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two events yesterday stood out like advertising billboards along that road to Argentina on which Senator Walsh warned us some two years ago the Government was placing Australia's feet. The first was the downgrading by Moody's Investors Service Inc. of Australia's international credit rating from AA1 to AA2. The second event was the bulletin from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on foreign investment which revealed that at 30 June last Australia's net foreign debt has risen to $108 billion. Both events delivered in their different ways their verdict upon the Government's 1989 Budget. Yesterday, in a succinct 2 1/2-page press release, Moody's laid out the chronic structural problem facing the Australian economy and, in doing so, highlighted the failure of this Government effectively to tackle that problem. But before we examine the whys and wherefores of the Moody's downgrading statement, I first want to address myself to the reaction of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to that statement and his well-worn tactic of shooting this particular messenger. The Treasurer's reported reaction to yesterday's announcement was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Moody's judgment is ill-founded and vindicates the Government's decision to put Australia's reputation and independence above that of a New York company. </PARA>
<PARA>What a petty, mean spirited and, above all, ill-judged response to this particular verdict by an internationally reputable and internationally respected credit rating agency. Let us, however, note that the Treasurer's language yesterday was very mild compared with what I can only describe as his hysterical reaction to Moody's initial downgrading of our credit rating in September 1986, not quite three years ago. At that time he called Moody's judgment an incompetent judgment. Later he called it a lightweight and illogical judgment. It is nothing compared with the Treasurer's incredibly petty and churlish decision to black-ban Moody's Investors Service by denying it access to Government officials, including those of the Treasury and the Reserve Bank of Australia, during a visit to Australia in recent months to conduct its latest ratings review. This sort of behaviour is typical of this Treasurer's approach to problems-the approach of the New South Wales right wing of the Labor Party. It is this type of arrogant disregard that has led him continually and consistently over the last few years to deny the vulnerable state of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us also note the inconsistency in the Labor Party's position in regard to Moody's. It was after all less than a year ago, on 27 September last year, that Mr John Dawkins in his capacity at that time as Acting Treasurer, in a matter of public importance debate in the other place and just prior-as it happened-to the Victorian election said that Moody's Investors Service Inc., a major international credit rating agency, had:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . awarded Victoria the highest credit rating that any State can achieve. Do honourable members really think that Moody's, relied on around the world by lending agencies to establish the credit rating of a State government or other government, would give Victoria the highest credit rating if it were in such a parlous position . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is what Mr Dawkins said last year about Moody's Investors Service. What has changed in less than 12 months about the standing of this particular agency? The only thing that Moody's has done since last September for it now to be considered by our Treasurer incompetent, unprofessional, one of a bunch of monkeys-these are all the Treasurer's usual flowery expressions-is to have dared to draw attention to the policy failings of the `world's greatest Treasurer' and his Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Ironically-and I think justifiably-the Treasurer's puerile denial to Moody's of access to government sources, his intemperate language in describing Moody's verdict upon his failed policies has merely served, as it was predictable that it would do, to highlight Moody's decision and has put the Treasurer, his Government and the policies for which they are responsible under closer scrutiny than otherwise would be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the Treasurer who can be accused of incompetence by his own colleagues by having highlighted, through his own intemperate actions, the decision that was announced by Moody's yesterday. The fact, as everyone in this chamber-including honourable senators on the other side-are well aware, is that Moody's is a highly respected international credit rating agency. Its ratings are highly valued by customers, especially those in the United States, in assessing the risk of investing money in listed securities. Indeed, in some US debt markets, if companies do not have a credit rating they cannot get a loan. They cannot issue. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also instructive to recall that three months after Moody's first downgrading of Australia's credit rating, Standard and Poor's, that other highly respected credit rating agency, also downgraded its credit rating for Australia. The Government is making much of the possibility that it might not follow Moody's decision this time. It might not. Let us wait and see. So what? It will not in any way diminish the standing of Moody's or of its rating in the eyes of those customers who wish to place a greater weight upon one than upon the other. </PARA>
<PARA> Putting aside Mr Keating's vitriol, the only other response that he has made to Moody's decision is to say that the Federal Government has no net overseas debt and has not borrowed in the market for more than two years and that therefore Moody's decision is quite irrelevant. The first claim, that the Federal Government has no net overseas debt, is questionable. The Reserve Bank's assets, which the Treasurer is using as a base for that claim, are not the assets of the Commonwealth Government, legally speaking. And in any case it is an interesting concept to think that we might spend up our reserves in order to pay off Commonwealth or, for that matter, any other debt. After all, what are reserves for?</PARA>
<PARA> The second claim, that the Commonwealth Government has not borrowed in the market for more than two years, is correct, as a matter of fact. However, the Treasurer is neglecting to mention-I consider he is doing this both wilfully and mischievously-that the Moody's decision does not affect the debt of the Commonwealth Government only. The release by Moody's yesterday made it quite clear that its decision also affects five Commonwealth authorities, including such bodies as the Australian Industry Development Corporation, Qantas Airways Ltd and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia; nine State government authorities; and five private sector institutions-all of which are active borrowers in overseas markets. All of them, to the extent that they want to borrow tomorrow, will have to pay somewhat more for such borrowings than they would have had to pay three months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not say that those borrowers would have had to pay more the day before yesterday because during three months to yesterday the markets had been prepared for the further downgrading of our credit rating. That is why, as the Prime Minister said with such a flourish yesterday-and no doubt as Senator Walsh will say shortly with, to give him credit, a lesser flourish-the markets received the downgrading yesterday as a `yawn'. The disgraceful impression which the Government is trying to present to the Australian people as a result of that market-based yawn is that it does not matter. In fact, the yawn derived from the fact that the markets have, to all intents and purposes, known for weeks that this downgrading would happen and they have already adjusted to it. When the downgrading was actually confirmed the markets made no further flicker of interest. They simply said, `We knew that yesterday'. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us be quite clear, to be more specific, that this ratings exercise affects the debts of bodies such as the Australian Industry Development Corporation; the Australian Resources Development Bank; the Australian Wheat Board-the Australian wheat growers' agency will have to pay slightly more in future if it wants to borrow abroad than it did before; the Commonwealth Bank; National Australia Bank Ltd, Westpac, National Mutual Group Finance Ltd, Queensland Treasury Corporation, State Bank of New South Wales and about 10 other similar enterprises. What Moody's did yesterday-what it always does in these circumstances-was in effect to rate the sovereign risk of Australia as a nation, not just the debt of the Commonwealth Government. It is, however, the Commonwealth Government's economic policies that have led to this downgrading of the debt of most of our issuers in foreign bond markets. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986, when Moody's first downgraded Australia's credit rating, when we first lost our AAA rating, it was possible for the Government to plead the excuse-as Senator Button did to some extent today, when he began to respond to Senator Lewis's question-that there had been a major fall in our terms of trade and that that was the reason why our balance of payments had gone into such a deficit, why our debts had begun to balloon and why we are in such a mess at this time. In other words, it was not our fault that we were being downgraded. No such excuse is open to the Government now for the further downgrading of our credit rating that was announced yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last 2 1/2 years our international terms of trade have been dramatically improving. In 1987-88, they improved by over 9 per cent. In 1988-89 they improved by over 15 per cent. The fact is that the Australian economy has been riding high on a commodity price boom. What are the problems? I quote directly from Moody's press release of yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA>The factors that Moody's considers crucial to its rating action include the following: (1) the government's inability to control excessive domestic demand growth-(2) insufficient progress in generating additional export-earning capacity and in restructuring industry to achieve productivity gains-and (3) the continued slow pace of structural adjustment, which makes Australia ill-positioned to weather the next downturn in the global business cycle without further large increases in foreign-currency debt. </PARA>
<PARA>Later in its press release, Moody's notes:</PARA>
<PARA>Moreover, the current Labor government has been unable to rein in domestic demand in an overheated economy, despite the opportunities provided by the recent upswing in the business cycle. The Commonwealth government has achieved a growing fiscal surplus on its own account-</PARA>
<PARA>that point is fully acknowledged; that is why Moody's waited for the Budget to be released-</PARA>
<PARA>but political and social factors have prevented the application of a total policy mix that is sufficiently rigorous to balance the external accounts. The government has relied primarily on a tight monetary policy-</PARA>
<PARA>or, at any rate, high interest rates-</PARA>
<PARA>which has bolstered the Australian dollar, thereby stimulating imports and discouraging exports. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not a new analysis. The Opposition has been putting forward that analysis in this place and elsewhere for, I was going to say months but I should almost say, years. It is, however, worth remembering that only two weeks ago the Reserve Bank of Australia expressed very similar sentiments in its annual report. Those sentiments have already been the subject of debate in this chamber and I do not propose to repeat them this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not all. On Monday of this week, the Government's Committee for Review of Export Market Development Assistance, chaired by Professor Helen Hughes, who is a very distinguished economist, who has served the World Bank and other bodies of that kind for many years and who is now back in Australia, noted in its report:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government's response to the current situation of high demand and inflation coupled with labour shortages and a growth of imports that has far outstripped that of exports, has been to continually tighten monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Interest rates have been driven up in an attempt to slow domestic demand and import growth. </PARA>
<PARA>But this has created serious problems for exporters, both through increasing costs and reduced prices as the exchange rate rose and eroded competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA>Moody's makes a special reference to the Treasurer's oft repeated references to the Budget surplus. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>Moody's noted that the recent federal budget covering the current 1989-90 fiscal year generates an even larger surplus and contributes to the needed growth in national savings. Nonetheless, the rating agency believes that the budget fails to decisively address the issues of external imbalance and productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> This is precisely the position which was taken by the Opposition in our Budget response in the House of Representatives on the Thursday following the Budget, and again by me this morning. What Moody's is saying is that the Government has failed on micro-economic reform. Micro-economic reform was to be the so-called hallmark of the third Hawke Government. What type of micro-economic reform is Moody's talking about? Again, a quote from its press release makes it clear. On the type of considerations it looked at for the downgrading, Moody's notes:</PARA>
<PARA> The first is a persistence of structural weaknesses embedded in Australia's domestic and international position, such as intransigent rigidities in the local labour and transport markets. These constrain international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>What could be more apposite than that comment at this time when we are seeing, perhaps, the worst example in Australia's history of `intransigent rigidities in the local labour and transport markets', both combined in the form of the airline pilots dispute? The airline pilots dispute was, I will not say brought on, but it was certainly greatly exacerbated, reinforced and, indeed, has now been held in place, by the actions of this foolish Prime Minister, this vain man, who sees himself propping up the power of this ex-colleague in the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the man who used to be called his apprentice, Mr Bill Kelty, and the power of the trade union movement against the Australian Federation of Air Pilots and its members. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of doing so, the Government is not merely dragging down the airline industry; it is not merely disrupting the travel plans of thousands of Australians. It will also bring the Australian economy to a state of crisis if the dispute continues for much longer. The Australian tourism industry will sink to its knees under the weight of this Government's and this Prime Minister's-I repeat it-inspired, enforced and reinforced support for this course of action. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, these are the areas that the Opposition identified long ago as crucial areas in need of immediate reform. But the Labor Party, hamstrung by its affiliation with the trade union bosses, as exemplified by the airline pilots dispute that I have just been referring to, simply cannot act in these areas of what Moody's rightly calls `intransigent rigidities in the local labour and transport markets'. The fact is that, when all is said and done, the Moody's decision yesterday was clear-cut and unremarkable. If anything, the mild reaction to it in our markets, as I said earlier, illustrates that this was exactly what the markets were expecting it to do. That is why they were not surprised. That is why it has been described as a yawn. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by referring to only one of the many comments in this morning's press which take the Government-surprisingly strongly, given the quality of much of our press analysis of these matters-to task for its reaction yesterday. I refer to the article in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald by Mr Ross Gittins. Mr Gittins begins by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer claimed yesterday that the downgrading of Australia's credit rating by Moody's Investors Service is unjustified. Don't be bamboozled. </PARA>
<PARA> If you want to know why we were downgraded, look no further than the separate announcement that Australia's net foreign debt climbed by $18 billion last financial year to $108 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> During a year in which the prices we received for our commodity exports were high and rising, our balance of payments should have improved. Instead, it got worse. </PARA>
<PARA> Moody's action is, as the Opposition claims, a vote of no confidence in the Government's management-</PARA>
<PARA>or rather mismanagement-</PARA>
<PARA>of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>I could not have put it better myself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it very difficult to take this debate seriously because it is based upon the notion that Australia-an entity known as Australia-can in any realistic way be assessed as a credit risk. I think that stands somewhere between the absurd and the ridiculous, because implicit in it is a belief that the Commonwealth Government is qualitatively the same sort of borrower as the shakiest paper entrepreneur. I do not think Senator Stone would argue that it is somewhere between absurd and ridiculous to take that position, but he himself said that Moody's assessment is an assessment of what Australia is worth, or the soundness of Australia as a borrower. It is based on a ridiculous presumption.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No wonder Reuters-not only the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)-said that the Moody's report was a yawn. However, it does seem to have been taken somewhat seriously by Senator Stone. If one looks at the terms in which his motion is framed, one will see that he refers to the effect on Australia's standing in the world, implying that he is more interested in the symbolism than in the underlying reality. Indeed, he is obsessed with the symbolism. There is less excuse for Senator Stone to be obsessed by the symbolism than there is for the more simple people who have not had Senator Stone's years of experience in the Department of the Treasury and so on. No wonder he thinks that the Moody's report, which really is of hardly any relevance, is important. </PARA>
<PARA> If it is to be claimed that this Moody's assessment has anything at all meaningful to say about the quality of the Commonwealth Government as a borrower, let us note firstly that the Commonwealth Government has no net foreign debt at all and has not had for some time. On a net basis, the Commonwealth Government owes nothing overseas. There have been major reductions in the Commonwealth Government's domestic debt. If we produce another four Budgets the same as this Budget, the Commonwealth Government will have no debt whatsoever, no gross debt even, either overseas or in Australia. There will be no gross debt at all. In another four Budgets like the present one, we will be in that position. Even in this year, if we, the Government, chose to do so, we could almost entirely wipe out the gross foreign debt that we now have. We could do it with this year's Budget surplus. The Government has decided not to do that because, principally, foreigners who are holding Australian government securities will not part with them except at extraordinarily good prices. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, we could redeem the gross foreign debt that the Commonwealth owes but it is not good business to do so because the foreigners who hold Australian government securities do not really want to get rid of them. They want to hold them to maturity. That is what the foreigners who hold Australian government securities want to do. They have not taken much notice of Moody's in the past, and there is a good reason for that, which I am coming to. The following comments are made on page 10 of today's Australian Financial Review:</PARA>
<PARA>Foreign investors who took Moody's last downgrading of Australia's credit rating to heart and kept out of the Australian fixed-interest market have given up the chance to almost double their money. </PARA>
<PARA> A 10-year Commonwealth bond purchased by a US investor just before Moody's downgraded Australia to AA1 in September 1986 would have returned 91.4 per cent over the past three years-or 24 per cent a year . . . </PARA>
<PARA>People who followed Moody's advice just three years ago and got rid of Australian bonds sacrificed that sort of return, a return that they would hardly have got anywhere else in the world. Even with extremely risky investments, they would not have got that sort of return. Now that they know that they should not have acted on the Moody's assessment of 1986, they have no intention of getting rid of their Commonwealth government securities. The experience of the last three years has taught them that Moody's assessment, however relevant it may or may not have been to the most marginal Australian corporate borrower, has absolutely no relevance to the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer (Mr Keating) made the point in his press release that the reason we were retiring only a moderate amount of foreign debt this year is that foreigners do not want to part with their Australian government securities. They may have taken some notice of Moody's in 1986 and because of that experience they will not take any notice, or much notice, of Moody's this year. Senator Stone said-and this is further evidence which demonstrates the absurdity of the proposition that whatever Moody's says ought to be regarded seriously-that the Australian Wheat Board will be affected by this Moody's evaluation. If that is true-and I do not believe it is-what Senator Stone is saying is that an organisation totally hedged with an internationally tradable commodity is not a good credit risk for an overseas borrower. If one believes that the Wheat Board will be affected by the evaluation, one also has to believe that the Wheat Board, totally hedged with a commodity which is saleable on an overseas market, is not a sound borrower for some foreign institution from which the Wheat Board may be seeking funds to pay growers in advance of the actual sale of the wheat crop. </PARA>
<PARA> Even though one develops a fairly thick hide in politics, I find it pretty offensive that this Government should be berated by the Opposition on matters like government debt. This Opposition, which was in government for 30 years between 1949 and 1983, did not produce one Budget surplus in any of those 30 years. It did not repay one cent of Commonwealth debt; it did not produce one Budget surplus. Yet, it has the audacity to berate the present Government which has produced three Budget surpluses in a row-$2.2 billion, rising to $5.5 billion and to $9 billion this year. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that later on. It requires a great deal of chutzpah on the part of the Opposition to berate this Government for its record on fiscal responsibility when one looks at its record. I might add that there is absolutely no indication to date that should the coalition get into government it would be any more responsible in the future. The Opposition has lightweights like Senator Newman-non-entities, admittedly-still on the front bench who passionately supported a motion a couple of months ago to buy two aircraft carriers which cost $6 billion and to blow another $3.5 billion a year on defence alone on a recurring basis-$6 billion capital and $3.5 billion recurring. That is the sort of twaddle that comes out of the mouths of some of the lightweights who sit on the Opposition front bench. I know that Senator Stone and probably Dr Hewson would not do that. Indeed, should there be a coalition government I believe that for the first 18 months or maybe even two years there would be a deliberate attempt to drive the economy into a recession in the belief that, having done that, it could smash the unions or, as it would prefer to put it, fully deregulate the labour market. If all of those things happened half way through the term, Senator Stone and Dr Hewson would get rolled by the lightweights and the opportunists in a Peacock government in a desperate attempt to refloat the economy prior to an election. That is the sort of thing which would happen if the Opposition succeeded in winning an election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make one final comment about the financial institutions in New York-a generalised comment which does not apply to all of them but, in this context, a comment which is worth repeating. I visited New York just under a year ago and spoke to a number of people who could be described reasonably as merchant bankers or merchant banker types. Naturally, we discussed the state of the United States budget deficit and the US current account deficit. With one or two exceptions, those people did not seem to believe that the US had any problems. I then went to Washington and spoke to some senior members of Congress and some senior public servants who, firstly, did believe that the US had a problem but did not expect anything much to be done about it. Secondly, they were not at all surprised to learn that the people in New York did not seem to think the United States had a problem anyway, which is another way of saying, really, that some of these people at least in New York are not particularly good judges of anything, a point which I suppose Moody's demonstrated very clearly to those who were naive enough to take Moody's advice three years ago and got rid of their Australian Government securities and thereby forwent returns of 24 per cent on those securities. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that on a net basis, as I mentioned before, the Commonwealth Government is an external creditor, not a debtor. Some Commonwealth Government authorities do have debts, State government authorities have net debts and State governments have net debts. However, the bulk of the borrowing or of the money owed externally by Australia is private debt incurred by individuals or by corporations. I will refer here to fixed income research done by First Boston Australia Ltd. I cannot give the name of the publication; my copy does not have the front page. However, on page 8 there is a listing of both the foreign debt and the market values of a number of Australian companies. They are the three largest both in terms of their foreign debt and of their overseas market values. The financial institutions are the ANZ Bank, the National Australia Bank and Westpac with debts and assets varying from $15 billion to $30 billion. Because they are financial institutions they are qualitatively different and I will not say any more about them. </PARA>
<PARA> But there are trading companies: foreign debt of the Bond Corporation is $3,900m; the market value of its overseas assets is $3 billion. Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd has foreign debt just over $4 billion; the book value-for some reason the table does not include a market value of BHP's foreign assets-is nearly $5 billion. Elders-IXL has foreign debts of nearly $4 billion and market value of foreign assets nearly $7 billion. I will give the figures for one or two of the other large ones: News Corporation has foreign debts of just over $5 billion and the market value of its foreign assets is of the order of $14 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Haines will probably say it is a dreadful thing that this has happened but, leaving that aside, the fact is that a number of large Australian companies have borrowed very heavily overseas and they have used that money to purchase overseas assets. Indeed, if I remember correctly, in the period of about three or four years leading up to mid-1988, Australians acquired additional equity investments abroad of the order of 5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). Leaving aside again the question of whether it is a good thing that it has happened, the fact that it happened of course was to overstate the size of Australia's net foreign debt because extra debts had been incurred to buy additional equities overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to what some other people think about Moody's. I am sure that most members of the Senate and the public would have heard some of the broadcast I am about to quote this morning on the ABC's AM program. I refer to an interview with Mr David Henderson, the head of the Department of Economics and Statistics at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. I will just quote a little from the transcript. The interviewer, who was Peter Thompson, said:</PARA>
<PARA>First of all, increasing debt levels, are they a worry, should Australia be concerned?</PARA>
<PARA>Henderson replied:</PARA>
<PARA>I don't think the situation has changed very much, recently. I don't think it's a matter for great concern, no. </PARA>
<PARA>Thompson:</PARA>
<PARA>So a debt which--</PARA>
<PARA>Henderson:</PARA>
<PARA>I think the current level of the current account deficit is higher, I think, than can be sustained and higher than the Government would wish to see sustained. </PARA>
<PARA>We would have no quarrel with that. Continuing, Mr Thompson said:</PARA>
<PARA>And the consequences of that?</PARA>
<PARA>Henderson said:</PARA>
<PARA>The consequences are not necessarily very serious. </PARA>
<PARA>And then later, Mr Thompson said:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, what are the key issues then, the Government must focus on in Australia, whichever political persuasion that Government is, to keep living standards high. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Henderson replied:</PARA>
<PARA>I think the key issues are not the short term issues, which are being so much discussed right at the moment, particularly after the change in the Moody's rating. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, David Henderson has not taken Moody's very seriously and I suggest that nobody else should take it very seriously either. Just to make my own position quite clear, let me say before concluding that nothing I have said should be taken or interpreted as meaning that Australia's overseas debt, continuing current account deficit and our continuing poor savings performance-poor, that is, measured against what it needs to be; not poor compared to a few countries like the United Kingdom and the United States-are not problems. They are problems. But it is trivial and ludicrous to spend a couple of hours in the Senate today discussing something as inconsequential as whether Moody's put an extra numeral or a higher numeral against something which it calls Australia's credit rating, or somebody calls Australia's credit rating, because it is based on the ridiculous assumption that there is something called an Australian entity and that all Australian would-be borrowers are qualitatively indistinguishable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the benefit of people who have tuned in to this debate within the last little while, I would point out that we are debating a matter of public importance introduced by Senator Stone which reads as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The further blow to Australia's standing in the world arising from the further down-grading of our international credit rating by Moody's Investors Service. </PARA>
<PARA>I would suggest that other than inside Australia it is unlikely that the downgrading of Australia's international credit rating by Moody's Investors Service Inc. is indeed going to have much effect, and inside Australia at the very most it is going to be leapt upon gleefully-as it has already been today-by Opposition members and troglodytes from the H.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stone says that the Prime Minister has accepted the policies of the H. R. Nicholls Society, which simply proves my point. In fact if both the other major parties were not so hell-bent on hanging onto outmoded policies from the H. R. Nicholls Society or other bodies-clearly policies not in Australia's interests-we would not be in the position of having Moody's or indeed any other ratings agency, marking us down and causing even a modicum of ripples in the hearts and minds of Australians as has happened in the last 24 hours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yes, we have a foreign debt problem; we all know we have a foreign debt problem; even the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) has admitted that we have a foreign debt problem. Hardly anybody could deny that fact and still retain any credibility at all, but we need to ask why we have a foreign debt problem. And the answer is because successive governments have encouraged private sector overseas borrowings by allowing companies which borrow on the international money market to write the interest costs off against their Australian tax liability, reducing it in some cases to zero. What organisation is not going to take advantage of such a wonderful way of reducing its tax liability? What company is not going to move to debt rather than equity financing, given that sort of incentive? Of course, that is precisely what happened. </PARA>
<PARA> We could argue that the aim of allowing this sort of tax deductability was justified, at least in the beginning. The strategy was allegedly to encourage investment and development by Australian businesses, thereby creating employment and increasing productivity. That was then supposed to lead to an increase in export items and an increase in import replacement items, thereby reducing our trade deficit. Instead, what has happened is that a series of taxpayer-subsidised, overseas-funded and non-productive takeovers have occurred as Australian businessmen play monopoly with each other's shares. Few extra jobs have resulted. Since the same businessmen that are taking advantage of negative gearing on their overseas borrowings are frequently complaining about Australia's low level of productivity, one can safely assume that there have been no benefits there either. Indeed, I venture to say that very few new products, either for export or as import replacements, have resulted as a consequence of businesses taking advantage of what is now little more than a tax rort. Where are all the new export goods that were supposed to come from this new investment that is taxpayer-subsidised? Where are the new import replacement goods that were supposed to come from this investment funded by overseas borrowings? The answer is that, by and large, there are none. So much for balancing our trade figures by encouraging investment of this sort. All that has happened is that our largely privately-owned foreign debt has increased in both gross and net terms. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Stone has already pointed out this afternoon, in the last three months gross debt was up by $8 billion to $137 billion and net debt up by $4 billion to just over $108 billion. That is the increase in both our gross and net debts over the last three months. Allegedly on those grounds but, I suggest, more likely through a rather unpleasant form of truculence-given that, although Moody's has downgraded us, we have not been attacked by Standard and Poor's, the other major ratings agency-Moody's decided to downgrade Australia from AA1 to AA2. That was a move that puzzled commentators, not least of whom was a senior official from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development who noted on the radio this morning what many of us already knew: that Australia is not the only country in the world with a high foreign debt. Both the United States and the United Kingdom have high foreign debts. Nor are we the only country in the world with a high trade deficit. Both the United States and the United Kingdom have a high trade deficit. Indeed, where Australia differs from those two countries is that we have a domestic surplus while the others run at a domestic deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> However, all of this seemed to be irrelevant to Moody's, who decided to rate Australia just below Belgium, just above Ireland and on the same level as Spain in the scheme of things as far as risk for investors is concerned. That is really all the ratings are about. Essentially, Moody's is saying to overseas investors, `Go ahead and invest in Australia if you like, but demand from them higher interest rates because there is a risk you might not get your money back'. One is compelled to ask: What difference will this make since it has been both Labor and coalition policy to keep interest rates high in Australia in any event in order to lure foreign money into the country to offset in particular last year's high levels of Australian business borrowings from overseas? What difference will it really make in the scheme of things?</PARA>
<PARA> The other solution put forward by the other major parties in this country to the problem we are currently facing is to sell off as much of Australia as businesses or individuals from the United Kingdom, the United States, Saudi Arabia, West Germany, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan will buy. Their response to what is a very real problem was: do not worry about the long term problems that may come from that; sell it for the short term benefits that this may have. But this is a response with its own attendant problems. Australia's high foreign debt means that 25 per cent of export income is eaten up by servicing that debt. What a waste. It means that our current account deficit will continue to reflect interest repayments on past borrowings as well as the rent and dividends paid to foreign owners of Australian assets, all of which goes out of the country. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall some months ago sitting in the chamber and listening to National Party senator after National Party senator complaining that our beef industry in both Tasmania and Queensland is almost totally owned by the Japanese at all levels. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The whole area is being heavily dominated by the Japanese, to our detriment. The transport sector in this area is dominated, too. It is not doing Australia any good at all. It means that our current account deficit will continue to reflect those sorts of interest repayments, rents, dividends and so on going outside Australia into the pockets not of Australians but of foreign owners. All this money is flowing out of the country. Our export income is simply not enough to balance it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situation is getting worse. Treasury predicted last year that the current account deficit for 1988-89 would be $9.5 billion; it was in fact $17.7 billion, and about two-thirds of that-that is, $12.6 billion-came from repaying past foreign debt. We are caught in a vicious circle caused and now continued by outmoded, discredited economic theories that have meant that Australia has now lost control of its own economy. This means that the Hawke Government and the Liberal and National parties will continue to make it easier for foreign investors to buy Australian property, land and enterprises. In the short run, the more foreign currency we can get by flogging off Australia, the less we have to borrow. But in the long run, by selling off Australia, we further lose control of the economy and saddle future Australians with the problem of paying off the rent, profits and dividends to foreign owners. It means that Australians will continue to suffer high interest rates and the effects of expenditure cuts, despite the fact that most of the foreign debt has been borrowed by the private sector for financing takeovers that add little or nothing to our export or import replacement capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> What is worse, the private sector borrowers get a taxpayer-funded subsidy for those borrowings while ordinary Australians are suffering a further reduction in their living standards because private Australian companies have gorged themselves on those foreign borrowings and created this massive foreign debt. In an article in the current Australian Business, entitled `Who Really Owes the Foreign Debt', we discover, as Senator Walsh has already mentioned, that the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd owes $20.3 billion, Westpac Banking Corporation $28 billion and the National Australia Bank Limited $15.5 billion. I wonder how much of their record profits-because we know they are making record profits-is going to repay any of this debt each year. I suggest very little. Their priority is their shareholders, not the state of Australia's foreign debt. We know that Bond Corporation owes $3.9 billion overseas; BHP, $4.1 billion; Elders, almost $4 billion; and News Corporation, $5.1 billion. Again, I wonder how much of this is due to borrowings used to buy shares in each other's companies and to limit tax payments through negative gearing and, I suggest, a large amount of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Failure of successive governments to act in these areas means that neither the Hawke Government nor the Liberal-National alternative has a solution to our economic problem. They both stand for high interest rates, expenditure cuts, privatisation and deregulation, and we have already had a good dose of all of those theories with no noticeable effect of any benefit to this country. Australians continue to import more than we can pay for. I remind Senator Stone that more of this Government's legislative program has got through this Parliament because he and his colleagues support it than has got through because we do. I listed a few of those pieces of legislation this morning-predominantly legislation that hits low income earners. The fact of the matter is that Australians continue to import more than we can pay for, the current account deficits set ever-increasing records and the foreign debt continues to grow. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the solution? First of all, we need to reduce our reliance on imports. We could learn a lesson, for example, from the Menzies Government when it experienced a balance of payments crisis in the early 1950s. As the value of exports fell when the price of wool fell after the Korean War the Government realised we had to import less. The then coalition Government did the sensible thing, something which is apparently anathema to the modern Liberal and national parties and this Labor Government: it cut imports. (Extension of time granted) The Menzies Government did not rely on mega surpluses and mega interest rates perhaps to cut imports some day a bit down the track; it did it by imposing import restrictions. It is essential that this Government take similar action. We are not living in a free trading world. Every other country in the world imposes restrictions of some sort. They may not be tariff barriers but they are quite frequently non-tariff barriers that have quite the same effect. If we are not going to increase our export market or make the increase in the exports of any value because of the size of our dollar, we have to cut imports through a variety of measures-for example, by putting a tax on luxury imports and imposing quantitative restrictions on imported goods that can and should be produced in Australia. Anybody who looks at the figures knows that in the single category of food, beverages and tobacco in excess of $2.2 billion was contributed to our balance of trade deficit: Brazilian oranges, French champagne, American cigarettes, imported cheeses, dried fruit, biscuits-you name it-in this category contributed over $2.2 billion to our deficit. They can all either be done without since they compete with Australian products or bear a luxury tax, and the users would be none the worse off. The only thing that is wrong with that suggestion is that it is unfashionable to the market-worshipping deregulators who pass for economists today. One thing is certain: some different action has to be taken. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If we needed any proof of the adage that the quality of language used by this Government in order to camouflage unpleasant truths usually falls in inverse proportion to its degree of desperation to hold on to office at any cost, we had it today when we heard Senator Walsh speak. Quite clearly, the statements that emanated from Senator Walsh, as Minister for Finance and spokesman leading for the Government in this debate, demonstrates that the Government is not above cheap slurs and shots at organisations such as Moody's Investors Service Inc. for bringing down what is nothing else but a report on the factual situation in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Probably the most significant things about the Moody's report is, first, the further downgrading of Australia's precious credit rating, but secondly, that this has happened twice in a space of three years. That would have to be something of a record. I defer to my colleague Senator Stone on the question of whether any other nation or economy of comparable size would have suffered the same kind of downgrading twice in three years. That is the point-that is what is occurring and the situation is not being addressed by this Government. It is recognised by those opposite, as Senator Walsh himself acknowledged, that they are doing nothing to change the policies. That is the point of this debate. That is the point about the Moody's report and they are the matters which Moody's drew to our attention. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has, in its way, given a predictable response to the Moody's report. It has called the statements by Moody's politically inspired and, somewhere else, incompetent. Why would Moody's be politically inspired, for heaven's sake? What political interests has it in the matter? It has its reputation at stake, and the interests of those people who are borrowing or lending money to Australia at stake. It certainly would not be interested in seeing Australia's economy go down for political reasons. Quite the reverse, it would want to ensure that it was on the up and up from the point of view of ensuring that its integrity stayed in place. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has been made of the fact that the markets seem to have taken this all in their stride. Everybody knows why that occurred; it is because the signals coming out of Moody's were there for several months and the markets have taken all this into account in the last several months of trading. If we look at the stock market, however-and this is perhaps the most indicative point that we should note-on a comparison of Australian stock market indices with those of America we see that Australia has nowhere near recovered the losses of the October 1987 crash, whereas the United States stock markets, and I think the English stock markets as well, have advanced beyond the level of October 1987. The fact that our stock markets have not recovered as fast as those of overseas nations again demonstrates how badly Australia is regarded overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget presented just recently and upon which no debate has yet occurred has done nothing to bring about change in those perceptions which we have just outlined. We in the Opposition acknowledge that there are considerable problems and we have the policies, which we have announced, to take the Government to task on these issues. This contrasts very clearly with the Government's approach, which seems to be nothing more or less than, `Don't worry, just be happy'. </PARA>
<PARA> What does Moody's actually say in the course of its report? First of all, it surveys the debt problem and gives us some information about that. But the most significant thing to which it draws Australia's attention is Australia's capacity to service-that is, repay-the debt we are building up. The only way the debt can be repaid in net terms is from our overseas earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the capacity of Australia to pay? When we look at the statistics in the Government's Budget Papers we see that interest and principal repayments in the year that the Government came into office, 1983, took 26.5 per cent of exports, but today, under the Hawke-Keating Labor Government, take no less than 63 per cent of export earnings. That means it has increased by almost 250 per cent in the period of this Government's tutelage. That demonstrates a lack of policy, a lack of direction, a lack of concern with the real interests of Australians. It is that which Moody's is looking at: the capacity of the Australian economy to get itself out of its problems, to develop more export growth so that it can repay that debt. That is the point of the exercise. That is what Moody's is saying to us and, if we are at all intelligent in governing the affairs of this nation, we must have regard to how those problems can be redressed and the situation improved. </PARA>
<PARA> Cleverly, in its usual way of a public relations exercise, the Government has sought to turn the debate away from the capacity of Australians to repay that debt by measuring it in terms of a proportion of exports towards another measure by telling us time and again that we are measuring our debt against the percentage of gross domestic product needed to repay it. Everybody knows that is a distorted way of displaying the capacity of this country to borrow. We must come back to the essential point about exports and how in net terms we can repay our debt from exports. </PARA>
<PARA> In some of its statements, Moody's has very clearly drawn attention to the lack of capacity of the Government. Senator Stone spelt it out very well. I first mention a statement referred to by Senator Stone, namely, the insufficient progress in generating additional export-earning capacity in restructuring industry to achieve productivity gains. That is quite clearly evident in the Budget Papers as well. We do not have to believe Moody's on that; all we have to do is look at the Budget Papers, which show the import penetration figures and the lack of competitiveness. Those factors mean that Australia is in a parlous position. We are talking about borrowing more and more overseas to improve our export earning capacity, yet we are failing to do that. In essence, that is the essential problem we face with our debt. </PARA>
<PARA> Moody's also referred to the continued slow pace of structural adjustment, which makes Australia ill-positioned to weather the next downturn in the global business cycle. That is possibly around the corner if the world economy goes into a recession in the next year or so and we remain exposed because of our huge foreign debts and our inability to service them. If exports turn down rather than up, our future will be gloomy indeed. When the time comes, it will hit us like a ton of bricks. </PARA>
<PARA> Other considerations are mentioned in the Moody's report, which refers to shortcomings in the Australian economy. The first is the structural weaknesses of the economy itself. There is also the domestic and international position and such matters as the intransigent rigidities in the local labour and transport markets. All those things are critical to an understanding of the problems in the Australian economy. But the Government has no policies to address them. It does not seem to want to take on its brothers in the Australian Council of Trade Unions by making changes in the labour market. It does not believe in the policies which have been outlined by the Liberal and National parties and which would take us into a new era of industrial relations, leading to joint and constructive results in the improvement of productivity and cost reduction. </PARA>
<PARA> Moody's also drew attention to our heavy reliance on commodity exports, which places our foreign exchange earnings at the mercy of fluctuating terms of trade. Since Mr Keating took over, these things have had quite a number of runs when we refer to terms of trade. First, they are bad; then they are good. They seem to move in opposite directions all the time. The point is that we are exposed to that fluctuation because of our heavy reliance on primary produce in our exports. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh said that the Commonwealth Government's debt was not at issue here. In saying that, he ignores entirely the point that the Government is responsible for the policy of the whole nation, not just that of the Commonwealth Government. It is not the question of the Commonwealth's debt itself which is at issue; it is the nation's debt and the nation's capacity to repay that debt that is the issue. That is the point. I do not care how many times we say that in the course of this debate. The national situation is at issue and it is very clever of Senator Walsh to try to turn the debate on to that ground in an attempt to blind the Australian people from the real issues. But we in the Liberal and National parties will not let the debate be diverted from that issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Moody's drew our attention to the poor policy mix, to the fact that high interest rate monetary policies have restricted our export capacity and enhanced our capacity to import more and so disadvantaged our current account deficit. All in all, we have to say that Moody's report is a devastating criticism of the Commonwealth Government's policies. It does not come on its own; it backs up the recent report of the Reserve Bank of Australia. As we have seen, it backs up only what the markets are already saying to Australia. We have already been given evidence that the markets have taken this in their stride because they know the real situation of Australia. The Government has no concern for the views of consumers, the small business community or home builders in its inappropriate mix of policies. But the market knows what the Government is doing wrong. Apparently, the Government will not admit its mistakes. How long can the Government's head in the sand attitude go on while we in the Parliament stand aside and watch the Government continue to say nothing and do nothing to change the situation? In the Government's eyes, apparently everything is wrong but the Government itself. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by returning to the essential point that Australia's ability to repay its debt is the issue. We need more investment in export earning industries. We are not doing well in that area because we are not putting enough investment into it. I give a final example of the problem that our debt brings to Australia. If in one payment we had to repay in gold all our debt-some $149 billion-we would have to load something like 8,204 tonnes of gold on to 410 semitrailers stretching head to tail for 8 1/2 kilometres from the vaults of the Reserve Bank in Martin Place to the Botany Bay container depot. If we wanted to use wheelbarrows, we would need 164,000 of them to cart the gold. Every month an extra 100 tones of gold, or another five semitrailer loads, is added to the debt. That illustration quite clearly demonstrates the nature of the repayment problem we are facing and how the Government stands condemned for not addressing the problems which Moody's has quite properly drawn to our attention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that Senator Stone has put up quite an amazing proposition. I have often said that one must, in this place, debate policies. But as Senator Stone has put forward this proposition, one cannot help but look at his track record over a number of years, both in the Department of the Treasury and as the Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate. I know that Senator Stone would hem and haw and cry and moan, because he knows as well as anybody, if he is honest with himself, that his track record is not too hot. To say the least, it could be called very disappointing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I understand it, Senator Stone was a longstanding member of the Australian Treasury. An officer at a pretty senior level, he had a reputation of being one of the movers, the makers and the breakers, the thinkers and so on of that department over many years. As I understand it, he was a senior officer at the time of the 1961 recession which, of course, put a couple of hundred thousand Australians out of work. As I understand it, he was a senior officer of Treasury which rejected the first attempt ever made to deal with the structure of Australian industry-the Vernon Committee of Economic Inquiry which was commissioned not by a Labor government but by the then conservative Government led by Sir Robert Menzies. But Treasury was opposed to the report of that committee. That report hit the fence. As a result, Australia was left with all the structural problems in the 1950s and 1960s associated with our inefficient industries that we are still trying to get out of today. This Government is making a much better attempt, despite its difficulties, than anything that Senator Stone was able to do in his negative period in Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA> Then, as I understand it, he was posted off to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) during the 1960s. I do not know how many Third World economies the IMF helped collapse or how much deprivation was created by the severe shock of the economic policies it imposed on Third World countries during that period. Senator Stone returned to Treasury and became its head. His most singular achievement was being in the Treasury at the time of the 1982-83 recession when unemployment in one year alone increased by over 250,000 people. </PARA>

Stone, head of Treasury. That was his position. Shortly after that, I suppose much to the relief of most of us, he did maybe the honourable thing-he resigned from Treasury and headed off into private enterprise. He did this after a record distinguished by nearly 30 years of economic pessimism, of putting people out of work. </PARA>

<PARA> Mr Henderson made some very interesting comments during the interview on AM. He was asked by the reporter:</PARA>
<PARA> First of all, increasing debt levels, are they a worry, should Australia be concerned?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Henderson replied:</PARA>
<PARA> I don't think the situation has changed very much, recently. I don't think it's a matter for great concern, no. </PARA>
<PARA>The reporter then said:</PARA>
<PARA> So a debt which . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Henderson replied:</PARA>
<PARA> I think the current level of the current account deficit is higher, I think than can be sustained and higher than the Government would wish to see sustained. </PARA>
<PARA>The reporter then asked:</PARA>
<PARA>And the consequences of that?</PARA>
<PARA>David Henderson said:</PARA>
<PARA>The consequences are not necessarily very serious. </PARA>
<PARA>The reporter said:</PARA>
<PARA>Well of course, it's being argued in Australia that a high current account deficit, if it continues, must mean a declining standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Henderson answered:</PARA>
<PARA>No, not true. I don't think the Australian situation is very different in this from the British situation. </PARA>
<PARA>Some comment was then made about the British situation. The reporter asked a further question:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, what are the key issues then, the Government must focus on in Australia, whichever political persuasion that Government is, to keep living standards high. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Henderson said:</PARA>
<PARA>I think the key issues are not the short term issues, which are being so much discussed right at the moment, particularly after the change in the Moody's rating. The key issues concern the direction which economic policy has been taking in Australia in recent years and there I think, there's reason for Australian people to think that things have been going rather well . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The reporter asked:</PARA>
<PARA>In what respect? What are the things . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Henderson answered:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . as indeed they have in my own country. So some parallel, even though you've got very different Governments in power. </PARA>
<PARA>The reporter then asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, where should the Government then be given praise for what it's done?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Henderson said:</PARA>
<PARA>I think the Government should be given quite a lot of praise, though it's not alone in the OECD, for what it's done in respect to public finance. It's reined in public expenditure at the Commonwealth level; it's changed around the Government fiscal balance to now a surplus in the public sector borrowing requirement; it's done a lot to liberalise financial markets, as you know-that's been a very drastic program which I think is already probably paying off in better performance. Almost alone, not quite alone-Japan, note Japan, and New Zealand are with them, but there are very few OECD countries that have actually undertaken trade liberalisation in the 1980s on balance, Australia is one. They've done less probably in the way of labour market reform but I think probably that will be increasingly on the agenda. </PARA>
<PARA>Before the members of the Opposition get all enthusiastic about labour reform, I want to refer further in the interview to his comment about the question of labour reform. The reporter asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Does the OECD support the move towards more collective bargaining?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Henderson answered:</PARA>
<PARA>I don't think we have a view on that. How do you mean more collective bargaining, excuse my question?</PARA>
<PARA>The reporter then said:</PARA>
<PARA>A movement away from the centralised system of wage fixation, which we have in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Henderson replied:</PARA>
<PARA>The OECD has not taken a position on that and in his private capacity-because I asked him-the OECD colleague of mine who knows most about that, says that his personal view is that this, in the circumstances of the Australian economy, this still serves a very useful purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, the centralised system of wages. The person in the OECD who is in charge of making reports on wage structures says that the collective system of wages still serves a very useful purpose in this country. On all the counts which Senator Stone and Senator Messner have raised in this debate, we have heard from a senior figure in the OECD-who I have never heard of, I must admit, until today on the AM program--</PARA>

<PARA> I want to mention quickly the fact that the Opposition has given no credit to this Government for a major structural change within the Government's fiscal policies and the impact of the Budget surpluses we now have. This year it is estimated that we will have a Budget surplus of about $9 billion. That means that in the three years to 30 June this year there will be a total surplus of $17 billion. It is said in the Budget Papers that all up the total Commonwealth debt-overwhelmingly domestic debt-totals $41 billion. That means that if that surplus is averaged out at about $6 billion over the three years to 30 June, at that rate we will be able to pay off the total Commonwealth debt. That would mean a significant structural change to the Budget in that the $7 billion now listed in the Budget for interest payments would no longer be required and, therefore, there would be money available on the outlays side to be given either as tax cuts or in some other area to which the Government may choose to give spending priority. That is a major structural change for which this Government should be given great credit. </PARA>

<PARA> Finally, I return to the points made by Senator Stone. If he is so keen about Moody's Investors Service Inc. giving a credit rating for Australia, I suggest that, as a National Party senator from Queensland-the leader of the biggest number of National Party senators from any State-he invite Moody's to inspect the way in which Queensland manages its business. Why does he not ask Moody's to go to Queensland and have a look at the report on the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct? What sort of credit rating would the National Party Government in Queensland get after the findings of the Fitzgerald report on the rorting, corruption and tendering system of the National Party Government, a party of which Senator Stone is a member? That is a question, the answer to which we will not hear from Senator Stone-not one squeak. We should remember that he is only in this place because Joh Bjelke-Petersen put him here. Now we find he is running for the House of Representatives seat of Fairfax. Who got him the preselection for Fairfax? It was Sir Robert Sparkes, the head kicking, arm twisting thug of the Queensland National Party. I understand he only got up by one or two votes against the former member for that area, Mr Slipper. </PARA>
<PARA> Before Senator Stone starts criticising this Government's economic policies he ought to have a good look at the people he represents and is associated with in Queensland and their performance. The National Party in Queensland is the most corrupt in the history of Australia. There is no doubt about that; it is on the record. He is a member of the party in government that has set that record. If Moody's had a look at the Queensland Government its credit rating would be -ZZZ, as it deserves to be. Therefore, the matter for discussion as presented by Senator Stone can be rejected as a cynical piece of lightweight politics. We know that Senator Stone probably will not even win the seat of Fairfax. Senator Parer's party may have the opportunity to take that seat off him at the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The concluding remarks made by the Government senator who has just resumed his seat demonstrate the lack of concern the Government has about the issues in this debate. This kind of personal nonsense across the chamber is taking place during a debate on a matter of immense significance. The matter presented for discussion by the Opposition deals with the further blow to Australia's standing in the world arising from the further downgrading of our international credit rating by Moody's Investors Service Inc.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There can be very few more serious matters before this chamber at this time, because it is this matter which hangs over this nation. It is destroying the fabric of our society. It threatens our economic future and the standard of living of all Australians. For this debate to be taken as lightly as this Government has taken it says an immense amount about this Government's failure to address the problems behind this crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) went so far as to describe this matter as absurd, based on a ridiculous assumption, of hardly any relevance and said that the Moody's survey was inconsequential. That is not what all the other critics of this Government think about the issues raised by Moody's. It is certainly not what the Reserve Bank of Australia thinks. It is not what a leading economic advisory group, under Professor Hughes, apparently thinks, judging by the report that came out earlier this week. It is not what the major newspaper commentators think, judging by the editorials and the other comments in the major Australian newspapers that have come out since the disastrous news this week not only that Moody's has downgraded Australia yet again, but also that our foreign debt has risen yet again under this Government and will continue to rise, and our debt burden will continue to get worse, directly because-and this is the important point-of the policies and incompetence of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no point looking around, as the Government used to do in previous years, and saying, `It is not really our fault that we are having such a disastrous balance of payments figure. It is not really our fault that interest rates have gone up to the extent that people are being priced out of their homes. It is not really our fault that all these terrible things are happening to Australians and the standard of living is falling. It is not our fault because there were terrible terms of trade. We were not getting as much on the overseas markets for our exports and were having to pay more for our imports'. That has simply not been so in the last year. Our terms of trade have massively improved and our economy has gone down. Our balance of payments has worsened. All the key forecasts the Government made in its last Budget have been proved wrong. Now, of course, Moody's is being abused by this arrogant Treasurer (Mr Keating) and his equally arrogant partner the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) for being the messenger-only the latest messenger-bringing the story of reality. That is the reality that Australia's economic policies are leading this nation more and more into economic disaster and more and more down the Argentinean road. </PARA>
<PARA> Today's debate was not helped much by the usual enormously intellectually curious approach of the Australian Democrats. Senator Janine Haines said that the trouble with our debt is that this stupid Government and previous stupid governments are allowing an enormous tax benefit so that greedy capitalists can keep borrowing from overseas. Let us put that nonsense to rest. The fact is that the great bulk of Australia's increasing debt is due to one thing only and that is the need to pay for our annual continuing and increasing deficit, because we keep having to pay overseas far more than we earn. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, not necessarily. There are things like currency variations and other things. I thank the honourable senator for acknowledging the point. The fact is that the total current account deficits under the Hawke Government-they are the current account deficits that we have had to find the money to pay for-have totalled $75 billion. Our net external debt has risen by $85 billion. How, possibly, can Senator Haines find the intellectual capacity to argue that that is simply not so; that we have gone into debt not because we have had to pay our bills and we did not have the money to do it; we have gone into debt because some greedy Australian businessman has taken advantage of a tax deduction in order to borrow from overseas? What Senator Haines confuses is the make-up of the debt, not the reality of the debt itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have politicians in this country, particularly from the Australian Democrats and the Government side, pretending that the facts do not exist, pretending that everything is fine, it is going on track, there is no need to worry and it does not matter if we have a massive overseas debt which is worsening. I must say that Senator Walsh does not share that view; he apparently regards any discussion of it, such as today's, as a matter of no consequence. When we have politicians in positions of power deceiving the Australian people into believing that this is not a matter of major moment, that this is not a matter which is of immense concern and which will affect and is affecting the living standards of all Australians, then we have, I believe, politicians who, for short term political gain, are seeking to mislead the Australian people. I believe that is totally dishonourable. The reality of what has happened-this is pointed out by Moody's and, as I said, Moody's is simply being supported by the very same thing being said by the Reserve Bank and by Professor Hughes-is the enormous increase in our indebtedness and the failure of this Government to do anything to bring an end to it. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget has done nothing-and Moody's points it out-to correct the worsening trend. It has done nothing to stop us going more and more broke. It has done nothing to stop the enormous interest rates that we will continue to need simply to borrow the money to pay our bills overseas. We can see this very simply. The balance of payments figures that came out earlier this week showed that from the time this Government came in, back in 1983, our income debits-that is the amount we have to pay overseas-have jumped dreadfully from making up only 14 per cent of exports to 30 per cent of exports. In other words, we have to export twice as much now, simply to pay our interest bill, as we did before this Government came in. We have to run twice as hard simply to stand still and we are not achieving it. We are going further and further into debt with no real indication of when we are going to stop. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget says we will go further into debt this year. There will be another major current account deficit. We are looking into the mid-1990s before we see any prospect of any kind of improvement. Yet this Government, in this Budget, has done nothing to resolve those problems. The Reserve Bank says inflation is the key. Under this Budget inflation does not improve at all. The Reserve Bank says micro-economic reform is essential. The Reserve Bank says nothing is being done about that. The Reserve Bank report clearly demonstrates, as does Moody's, what this Government should be doing and it is not doing it. The quotes are quite clear. Moody's says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Australia's relative external debt position will probably worsen before it stabilizes in the mid-1990s. </PARA>
<PARA>Who will pay for that? The Australian people will pay for that in lower standards of living and massively high interest rates as we have to borrow the money to meet our bill. Moody's continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The Budget fails to decisively address the issues of external imbalance and productivity. </PARA>
<PARA>It says it considers that the matters that are crucial to its rating action include the following:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) the government's inability to control excessive domestic demand growth . . . </PARA>
<PARA>(2) insufficient progress in generating additional export-earning capacity and in restructuring industry to achieve productivity gains . . . and</PARA>
<PARA>(3) the continued slow pace of structural adjustment, which makes Australia ill-positioned to weather the next downturn in the global business cycle without further large increases in foreign-currency debt. </PARA>
<PARA>The rating agency also pointed out that the downgrading reflects several other considerations such as the persistence of structural weaknesses embedded in Australia's domestic and international positions, such as intransigent rigidities in the local labour and transport markets, and stated that these constrain international competitiveness. That is almost word for word what the Reserve Bank said here last week. It is certainly what the media are saying, and it is no wonder then that Moody's has reduced our position to the bottom of the pile. Who are we with? We are now equal with Spain as a credit risk, according to Moody's. New Zealand is a little bit behind us-just a fraction behind us-and yet New Zealand at the moment has a far better set of basic economic statistics available than we have. All the current figures which are pointing so badly for us, so downhill for us, are in fact on the improve in New Zealand because they have bitten the bullet far more seriously than Australia has. Underneath us, all we have is Portugal, Hong Kong, India, South Korea, China, Malaysia, Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina. What a great collection of people we are now heading! And above us, of course, are all the really developed nations of the world. </PARA>

This Government should be saying to the unions, `Look, Moody's has told us what a serious situation must be countered, and how it must be countered by serious measures'. The Australian Council of Trade Unions must abandon some of its more absurd objectives.

<PARA> Senator Stone tried tremendously hard in his speech to reinterpret Reuters very significant comment about the Moody's report. Reuters, in its comment on the screen going to the finance market this morning, said that Moody's downgrading was a big yawn. Of course it was, and of course it is. The Opposition-apart from, I must say to his credit, Senator Michael Baume, although I do not think he actually understood what he quoted-has ignored the fact that Moody's said some other things that are significantly worthy of comment. Senator Michael Baume quoted some of them and I appreciate that. The gentleman from Moody's said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Labor Government's approach to reform has been responsible for some major change which would not otherwise have been possible in Australia . . . continued cooperation between government, business and labour would be a crucial element in making domestic industry more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA>I had not heard that bit of the report emphasised. It does not fit in with the categorisation which the Opposition wants to make. The report then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Australia should be able to stabilise its external debt in the 1990s . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Everybody wishes the world was different and that the debt would disappear. It is a significant problem but the processes are in train for it to stabilise, albeit not as quickly as we would all wish. I suspect that everbody knows that the situation with regard to the balance of payments-and Senator Michael Baume's correct assessment of its significance on the accumulation of debt which was ignored by Senator Haines in her economically illiterate contribution-will improve substantially in the second half of this year, not altogether for positive reasons. Demand will slow down; therefore the demand for imports will slow and the balance of payments situation will improve. </PARA>

Opposition senators also ignore-I will not duplicate the substantial comments made by Senator Schacht-the comments of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The Opposition only picks up the comments about Australia that are negative. Anything positive it tries to sweep it under the carpet in the hope that nobody will notice. The senior OECD official today praised the Hawke Government for its economic management and said that the country's record debt was not a matter for great concern. Debt is a problem but let us get it in perspective. The OECD official went on to say that there were key issues that were not being debated publicly. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The key issues concern the direction which economic policy has been taking in Australia in recent years, and there I think, there's reason for the Australian people to think that things have been going rather well. </PARA>

<PARA>If the ultimate risk in Australian Government or government-guaranteed debt is zero-and we believe this to be true-the country's credit rating should be AAA.</PARA>
<PARA>Now let us talk about Salomon Bros Inc. Salomon Bros has issued an article entitled `Moody's downgrading unjustified' which states that in the 1989-90 Federal Budget we have a large surplus and there is a retirement of public debt, Government debt is declining, the economy is in a stronger position than it was in 1986. It states that this downgrading was not justified. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a substantial body of alternative opinion. But it is ignored because it does not suit the conclusions that particular people want to draw. We have a problem with the debt which Australia faces. The Government does not deny it. All sorts of hyperbole were used, particularly when we debated this question two weeks ago with Senator Stone, about the Government's action to reduce the debt. The Prime Minister has said quite correctly that winding back Australia's current account deficit and our foreign debt is a fundamental Government objective. It has been made quite clear that this is a fundamental objective of the Government's economic strategy. It ought to be, and it would be of any responsible government's economic strategy. But there is no point in just wringing our hands. The situation with which we are confronted, difficult as it is, is not all bad. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a significant body of opinion-it is not a view which I share but it is a new body of economic opinion-that says that the Australian foreign debt problem is not a problem. I do not accept that private-public distinction as categorically as those people make it. They are not totally wrong. There is some point in what they are saying-I will refer back to it-but I am not in that school. Those who hold that opinion differentiate-I debated this last time with Senator Stone and I do not really want to do so again-between productive and unproductive debt. Debt is not all equal. Some countries have very big debt burdens arising from government borrowing. But the significance is not that it is government debt, but that the money is borrowed for recurrent expenditure. In other words, it is borrowing for consumption instead of borrowing for investment. That makes a very significant difference. It does not worry me whether it is Government which borrows for consumption or investment, or whether the private sector borrows for consumption or investment. The significance is the difference between productive and unproductive debt. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret to say that this is an issue that is not faced up to. There is just shock and horror that there should be a debt. Many of Australia's most successful, most profitable, most stable companies have very big debt. The fact is that they have simply borrowed money to build productive enterprise which can repay the debt. The debt in itself is not a problem, if we are borrowing to invest to generate returns to pay back that debt and to make a profit, irrespective of whether it is the Government or the private sector. That is the distinction that has not been mentioned at all in the Opposition's analysis of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> We are having in Australia an investment phase which is transforming Australia and boosting our productive potential. Business investment growth has averaged 10.8 per cent per annum for the last five years. Regrettably that growth might not be sustainable. But it is a very positive contribution to our export effort. We all wish that lead times in economics were shorter, that when we pressed an investment decision the output would come immediately. Life would be a lot easier for investors and for economic managers. We would not have to deal with the vagaries of long lead times. Our debt is too high and while our current account deficit is too high, our debt is rising. However, it is important that most of our debt is private, not because there is something inherently irrelevant about private debt but because it is private debt borrowed for productive investment. It is earning a return. In the end, it is our ability to fund our debt on a sustainable basis that should be the issue. That tends to be ignored because we get mesmerised by the big numbers. We have to borrow to build a productive economy, to pay back that debt. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that substantially it is productive debt, but there is a concern that some of the money is borrowed for non-productive purposes. The distinction I am trying to make is that it should not be a private/public distinction; it should be a distinction between productive and unproductive. That is a very important point. It is where I have some sympathy with some of the academic economists. Private business investment has been increasing at a great rate-10.8 per cent on average over the last five years. Provided that the rate of return on these investments is enough to cover the interest costs, there is no reason why the fact that it is borrowed from overseas should be important. That point is made by Professor Harper and Dr Lim. I do not agree with their entire thesis-I do not agree with those who are saying that the foreign debt is not a problem-but they are making an important point, a point that has been ignored to date in this discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a mixed blessing that the desired objective of monetary policy-the necessary outcome that will lead to the slowing down in the increase in our rate of debt that will fix the balance of payments problem-is a slowing of the economy, a slowing in demand which will reduce demand for imports. We have had, I believe, almost unequivocal evidence to this effect. The National Australia Bank review said in its summary:</PARA>
<PARA> Overall, the Survey suggests that a slowing in the economy's growth is in prospect, but that this slowdown should be limited. </PARA>
<PARA>Westpac has said:</PARA>
<PARA> Signs of an easing in the strong levels of demand which have driven the current account deficit and the debt build-up also came yesterday with the Westpac Melbourne Institute leading index of the economy falling by one per cent to 128.6. </PARA>
<PARA>Since the Reserve Bank's report we have seen a significant change in the June quarter national accounts. Gross national expenditure grew by only 0.6 per cent in the June quarter. After three-quarters of import volume growth in excess of 8 per cent, imports grew by only 1.2 per cent in the June quarter. Those new elements in the equation do not settle the question finally, but they tilt the balance in favour of saying that we are getting the slowing down that is required at the rate for which we were hoping; we are heading towards the soft landing we need. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not say all this to minimise the problem. I am simply saying: Let us get a sober and competent economic analysis. Let us not be startled by the figures. Debt in itself needs to be broken down, to be analysed, to be considered in relation to its potential productive contribution as well as being a proper cause for concern because of the interest repayment that it imposes on our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Walsh correctly said, in Australia we have an excessively high rate of debt. We have a significant problem with the current account deficit, substantially caused by excessive demand and by the great investment boom we have had. For a number of years we have had a very tight fiscal policy to deal with that. We have had monetary policy to deal with it. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the responsibility of the Senate in dealing with this sort of question is not to seize on every negative statement that can be found and highlight it to Australia's detriment, but to make a sober economic analysis of the problem and to realise that Government policy is addressing the issue. We must all focus our attention on continuing to address the issue and, hopefully, contribute something to a proper economic analysis of the problem which Australia faces. That is our responsibility. The matter of public importance, as expressed by Senator Stone, does not contribute to that, but I hope that some part of the debate from this side of the House has. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade is a blatant ruse. It attempts to give an illusion of protection from nuclear warship accidents to the Australian public but, in reality, it allows for increased nuclear hazards and the violation of the spirit of Australia's international legal obligations. The Committee made 39 recommendations-which sounds commendable- but 36 relate to visits by nuclear-powered warships. Some recommendations are for stricter safety measures to deal with reactor accidents, yet there have been no visits by nuclear-powered vessels to Australia since 30 December 1987, when the USS Long Beach left Hobart. This reflects a steady downward trend in nuclear-powered warship visits in the five years. There were 10 visits in 1985, five in 1986, two in 1987 and none since then. By contrast, there were 33 port calls by nuclear-armed vessels during the 1988 Bicentennial Naval Salute alone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee has created the impression that its recommendations will improve public safety, but they are virtually irrelevant to the present situation. We are getting more and more visits of nuclear-armed warships, yet the Committee did not recognise those dangers at all. In any case, if nuclear-powered warship visits were to recommence, the recommended changes would still be inadequate in the face of a major nuclear reactor accident. The fact remains that the only nuclear warship accident which could have endangered the Australian public in the last 20 months is one involving nuclear weapons. Yet, the Committee has given the green light for nuclear-armed ships to continue visiting our ports. It has denied the possibility of a nuclear weapons accident. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation No. 37 leaves open the possibility of dry docking ships with nuclear weapons on board. Not only does this recommendation violate the spirit of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty because we would have nuclear weapons on our soil if it took effect, but also it would violate the safety standards which we impose on our own ships. We do not dry dock our own conventionally armed naval vessels with their armaments on board, but the Committee says--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps in the past that was the case but I think the honourable senator will find that at present this technique is not used. When an Australian warship goes into dry dock all weapons are normally removed from that ship. This is to avoid an accidental detonation by a welder's spark. This comes out of recent literature and I do not think it can be refuted by former military officers. When an Australian warship goes into dry dock, the weapons are removed but we do not require the same removal of nuclear weapons from a nuclear-armed ship. This is entirely illogical. The consequences of a nuclear weapon accident would be much worse than the consequences of accidents involving a conventional weapon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee has produced a political document, one which panders to the interests of the United States, while disregarding the interests of the Australian public. The Committee's report, along with current Government planning, assumes that nuclear weapon accidents are not possible. Yet the United States has specific emergency procedures for dealing with nuclear weapons accidents in Australia. So, while we say that such accidents are not possible, the United States actually has emergency procedures in this country.</PARA>
<PARA> Using the United States Freedom of Information Act, New Zealand researcher Peter Wills has obtained an instruction from the Commander-In-Chief of United States (US) Pacific Forces to personnel under his command. It details the nuclear weapons safety rules, nuclear safety programs, nuclear weapon accident responses and the public affairs policy for such accidents. The United States CINCPAC-Commander-In-Chief Pacific-instruction, which is S8110.4C of 8 May 1984, notes:</PARA>
<PARA>`the tremendous destructive power of nuclear weapons and the disastrous consequences which would attend an accidental or unauthorised nuclear detonation';</PARA>
<PARA>It envisages lesser nuclear accidents involving:</PARA>
<PARA>`the scattering of nuclear material (plutonium or uranium) in the form of finely divided dust . . . near the accident site and downwind'. </PARA>
<PARA>The possible causes of the accidents are given as `fire or conventional high-explosive detonation of the (nuclear) weapon'. The CINCPAC document designates an area co- ordinator in Australia to coordinate nuclear weapon accident-significant incident efforts on behalf of CINCPAC. The other area coordinators are in Korea, Japan, Guam, the Philippines, Thailand, the Indian Ocean and Fiji. The Australian area coordinator is the Defence Attache at the US Embassy in Canberra, Colonel R. Dean Stickell. The report makes the ship's commander responsible for recovering as much of the damaged or dispersed nuclear material as possible. He can call on assistance from the Joint Nuclear Accident Coordinating Centre of the Defense Nuclear Agency in the United States, and the Pentagon and the US Department of Energy are authorised to attend the scene. </PARA>
<PARA> The CINCPAC document requires public statements to treat a nuclear weapons accident as `an incident involving high explosives'. The United States Navy is informing its personnel through this document to lie about the accident and call it `an incident involving high explosives' unless officials deem it necessary to reveal the presence of nuclear weapons to increase public safety or reduce public alarm. This demonstrates the official United States view that nuclear accidents, ranging to a full nuclear detonation, could happen in Australia, and that emergency preparations are required and, in fact, that the United States has made such emergency preparations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government, by contrast, has made no special arrangements whatsoever, despite the unique monitoring and evacuation procedures which would be needed and the onerous and costly task of decontaminating the affected areas. Yet the Government admitted only last year that it has received a unilateral declaration from the United States that the United States would meet claims arising from an accident involving a nuclear weapon on board a visiting warship. This is a clear acknowledgment that nuclear weapons accidents can happen here. </PARA>
<PARA> How could it happen in Australia? During a port visit by a nuclear-armed warship, a nuclear weapon accident could occur in a number of ways. Firstly, nuclear weapons could be incinerated by fire, leading to a cracking of the casing of the warhead and the release of breathable, wind-borne plutonium into the atmosphere. A widespread fire could result from a conventional ammunition explosion and/or the ignition of spilt fuel. Were this to happen in a major port, hundreds, even thousands, of Australians could contract lung cancer in later years from inhaled air-borne plutonium. One-millionth of a gram in the lungs can cause cancer. I think we can all remember the recent tragedy on the USS Iowa when a gun turret blew up. So even in peacetime these accidents can take place. </PARA>
<PARA> According to a study by Greenpeace and the Institute for Policy Studies, the United States Navy had 49 ordnance detonation accidents and hundreds of ordnance malfunctions on its surface vessels between 1985 and 1988. Statistics show that from 1973 to 1983 there were an average of 148 fires per year on United States ships or at shore bases. These fires are commonplace. As noted previously, a fire could have disastrous consequences. The fire on the USS Iowa killed 47 crewmen. It was an explosion of 300 kilograms of gunpowder. If the Tomahawk weapons on the USS Iowa-eight of which carry nuclear warheads-had been affected there would have been a major nuclear accident. The Tomahawk launcher on the Iowa was only 45 metres from the location of the fire. The Iowa is identical to the USS New Jersey and the USS Missouri, which are both battleships and which have both visited Australia in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> Nuclear weapons could be lost with the sinking of a vessel during a collision in transit to or from port. There have been many documented sinkings of military ships, including documented loss of nuclear weapons from aircraft. The weapons would have had to be recovered to prevent their casings from corroding and leaking plutonium into the marine ecosystem. If this happened in a closed environment such as Sydney Harbour, in Hobart, or in any of the other Australian ports, it could cause great damage to the ecosystems. </PARA>
<PARA> Another potentially damaging effect of nuclear weapons on ships is the fact that nuclear weapons could be stolen or detonated by unbalanced naval personnel. The fire on the USS Iowa is said to have been started by a naval person who was mentally disturbed. There is nothing to stop such a person from stealing a nuclear weapon and using it for personal use or for terrorism. Having these weapons in our ports is adding to the hazard. What would Australian authorities do if in fact there was a nuclear--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no views whatsoever in common with Senator Sanders, who preceded me. He was not a member of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which reported on visits to Australia by nuclear powered or armed vessels. He touched only vaguely upon the findings of this important Senate report. His diatribe was a fiction, a tissue of irrelevancies. I am not impressed by his contribution in the Senate today. As to this important Senate report, after some hundreds of pages of transcript and a 4 1/2-year inquiry which involved 15 senators, the Committee brought down the most thorough study of safety plans for the visits to any ports in the world of nuclear powered or nuclear weapon carrying ships.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me make it clear from the beginning that the 39 recommendations in the report, which were supported by both Government and Opposition members alike, led to the enhancement of the safety plans that are in place in the designated ports for such ship visits. The recommendations led to improvements so as to bring those safety plans into line assuredly with what the plans for those ports were intended to be. All of the recommendations that we have brought down, except one with regard to Hobart, can be achieved in a matter of months. The port that is most visited by nuclear powered ships is the harbour and anchorages off Perth in Western Australia. We found that they do not require any adjustment, that they are safe, that they do meet the requirements, and that these requirements are the most stringent of any in the world. So the Committee has given a clean bill of health to the anchorage off Perth. With regard to other ports, there are adjustments and checks to be made which can all be practically achieved in a short time, with the exception only of Hobart. </PARA>
<PARA> The report says on page 132 that in all of the years of nuclear ship visits-that is, since 1960-in a period of 29 years and 103 visits by nuclear powered ships there has been no radiation ever detected or in any way associated with the nuclear ship visits. The report states on page 132:</PARA>
<PARA>The radiation monitoring in place during nuclear powered warship visits to Australian ports since 1976 has never detected any release of radioactive mat- erial from the vessels. Nor was there any incident involving the release of radioactivity during the visits prior to 1976. </PARA>
<PARA>With regard to the wider remarks that some people might make about nuclear powered warships in other countries, let me cite the statements in the report on page 133. The report quoted a 1988 statement that said:</PARA>
<PARA>149 nuclear powered warships continue to have a remarkable record of safety and operational effectiveness. The safety record has been validated in over 75 million miles-3,200 years of reactor operation-without a reactor accident or any radioactivity release having a significant environmental effect. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a summary of the entire United States experience of nuclear powered warships. With regard to the safeguards that are in place in Australia, chapter 6 of the Senate report states on page 172:</PARA>
<PARA>Australian contingency plans are more stringent than the arrangements for warships thought necessary by the United Kingdom and the United States. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the finding of the Senate Committee that Australia has in place safety arrangements that are more exacting than any that we know of anywhere in the world. So not only have we got a clean bill of health with regard to the most visited port-a clean bill of health with regard to any testing of radiation in the entire experience of 29 years of nuclear ship visits-but also we have concluded that we have the most stringent and exacting safety requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> There were 14 visits of nuclear powered ships in the period 1960-71. Then there was a period of some six years of no visits. In the second period 1976 to 1988 there were 89 visits. So in all there have been 103 visits. With regard to my own State of South Australia, Port Adelaide is a designated port to receive a nuclear powered ship. But no such ship has ever visited my State of South Australia. Moreover, on pages 20 and 27 of the report it is stated that not one visit is planned for South Australia. It is a designated port, nevertheless, in the event that it should become necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 250 we concluded that Port Adelaide-and by the way Townsville as well-should be checked with regard to recent land use changes in the vicinity of the port so that the intended safety measures in the plans for those two ports can be guaranteed to be up to date. The only permanent restriction that we have recommended relates to Hobart and it is on these grounds: there is an area around the ship that is berthed called `zone two' which envisages the need for safety requirements in the event of the wind blowing a particular way. In the case of Hobart, the distance involved is 1,200 metres. The 1,200 metres in zone two is a radius defined when the ship needs to be moved from its docked position within 3 1/2 hours. Because there is a hospital 900 metres away from the berth at the Hobart port, we have found it impractical to be sure that that hospital could be evacuated. Yet that may be the advised action if the wind is blowing from an accident involving a nuclear powered ship that is berthed at Hobart. </PARA>
<PARA> However, let me foreshadow that if that 3 1/2-hour removal time was reduced to, say, two hours and it could be guaranteed that the ship could be removed within two hours, then that 900 metres may be an acceptable radius for zone two designation. It is up to the government of the day to determine whether that is a fair reaction to the one restrictive recommendation that we have made. With regard to Darwin, Brisbane and Jervis Bay we needed to ensure that the evacuation proposals in the safety plan were operable. As soon as they are shown to be operable, then those ports would be cleared to have entirely acceptable safety plans. </PARA>
<PARA> All the recommendations, with the exception possibly of the one with regard to Hobart, are achievable, are practical and can be put in place within a matter of months. What the Senate Committee has found is that some adjustments need to be made to ensure that the safety plans are operable in the designated ports. We believe that these can be achieved so that all of the designated ports for such ship visits are operable and ready to receive ships in a matter of months. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also nothing to hide in this area of visiting nuclear powered warships or, indeed, any warships which may have weapons. We have unanimously urged that the safety plans be made public in all the ports. The plans are already public in Western Australia and we have expectations that the safety plans will be made public in the other designated ports. So I conclude by noting that this has been a sound inquiry of the Senate. It has given endorsement to the safety plans that are in place around Australia and I thank all of those associated with the inquiry such as our secretaries, research assistants, technical advisers and all those who have made submissions that have contributed to this successful inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One would think that after three years-that is what I thought it was, but Senator Teague has just said it is 4 1/2 years: a long time, anyway, in the making, 500 pages and 39 recommendations-the people of Australia could have expected a comprehensive and sensible report from this inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. However, this is not the case. A huge body of evidence which was presented to the Committee has been ignored, some of which Senator Sanders repeated when he referred to the plans which the United States Navy has in place to deal with nuclear weapons accidents. The Committee found that such accidents were unlikely to occur and that no contingency plan was necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I find it almost incredible that the members of the Committee could come to such a conclusion after the evidence that was presented. The report refers mostly to nuclear powered warships, as Senator Sanders said, and holds up the Western Australian port safety plan as the best one around the country and, as far as they knew, the first one that was made public. If that is the best there is around the country, heaven help the rest of the country in the unlikely event of a nuclear accident, either with a nuclear powered ship or a nuclear armed ship. By their own admission, information was denied to the committee by nuclear navies. Therefore, many assumptions are made. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, it is assumed that the United States (US) Navy would immediately notify Australian authorities if a nuclear accident occurred on board one of its ships either in a port or tied up in a safe anchorage outside a port. The US Government information which I submitted to the inquiry clearly suggests otherwise. The last thing that the US Navy would want to do is to admit that there had been an accident involving nuclear weapons, and in fact I want to table a document, with the permission of the Senate, entitled `Naval nuclear reactors' and read from that just a short piece about the Belknap disaster in November 1975. During night exercises the aircraft-carrier USS John F. Kennedy collided with the cruiser USS Belknap in rough seas 70 miles east of Sicily. It is stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The collision caused major damage to both ships, with the Belknap's superstructure wedged underneath the overhanging flight deck of the carrier. The carrier's fuel lines were ruptured, raining gasoline over the deck of the Belknap. A raging fire punctuated with explosions lasted for more than two hours. </PARA>
<PARA> The collision is one of the best-known naval accidents ever, but in all the documentation, no mention has ever been made of the nuclear weapons present aboard both ships, or the grave danger the Navy believed the nuclear warheads aboard the Belknap faced as a result of the fires. </PARA>
<PARA> Minutes after the incident occurred the commander of Carrier Striking Forces for the Sixth Fleet sent a secret nuclear weapons accident message ``a broken arrow'' to the Pentagon warning of the ``high probability that nuclear weapons aboard the Belknap were involved in fire and explosions''. He had good reason for concern. Much of the fire-fighting equipment aboard the Belknap was destroyed by the collision and aluminium superstructure of the ship actually caught fire, melting and running like ``hot butter'' in the words of one US Navy Journalist. Fortunately for a large area of Italy in the Mediterranean the fire was brought under control a scant 30 feet from the missile magazine. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the kind of information which that Committee has ignored and I am going to--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Another grossly misleading assumption in the report is that the reference accident would not result in a containment breach should a nuclear reactor accident occur. It is a very optimistic scenario which fatally flaws the entire document. Nowhere does the Committee explain where the reference accident came from. I asked the Committee for information about that and I never got a reply from it after I presented my testimony. It is a very optimistic scenario which does not take into account what might happen in the real world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report is also contradictory. Chapter 12 repeatedly states that there is no need for contingency plans dealing with nuclear weapons accidents, but recommendation 38 advises the Department of Defence to continue work on its current unofficial draft plan to deal with such accidents. So what are we to believe? Is there a risk or is there not a risk from nuclear weapons accidents in Australian reports? The report is contradictory. </PARA>
<PARA> The Western Australian plan, as I have said, is considered by the Committee to be the best plan available, which is absolutely ridiculous, dealing as it does only with nuclear powered ships and in a totally inadequate manner. It does not deal with the possibility of nuclear weapons accidents at all. The section in the Western Australian plan about removal of a stricken vessel would be laughable if it were not so serious. How to remove a vessel with a damaged reactor is a huge problem. What constitutes a remote anchorage is quite insulting. The Committee members, with the exception of Senator Dunn, who submitted a substantial dissenting report, have made fools of themselves by expecting Western Australians to believe that the designated remote anchorages are safe. The plan recommends that a submarine or cruiser berthed at Garden Island should, after suffering a nuclear reactor accident, be moved three kilometres further north, closer to Perth. What on earth is the point of that? That is how ridiculous the Western Australian plan is. The so-called safe anchorages are closer to the heavily populated areas than the original berths. </PARA>
<PARA> Action on the long list of recommendations is entrusted by the Committee to the Visiting Ships Panel (Nuclear). This group failed miserably to oversee the job given to it in 1976 by the then Minister for Defence, Mr Sinclair, which was to ensure that port safety plans were drawn up for all the approved berths. It took 10 years for the Western Australian plan to be completed, and it was dragged out of a reluctant State government by community pressure, not due to any effort by the Visiting Ships Panel (Nuclear). Yet it is that Panel which is entrusted by the Committee to do all this nice paperwork that Senator Teague has referred to. Of course, most of the recommendations can be put in place, because they mostly amount to making public plans which need to be completed and upgraded to the level of the Western Australian plan, which is totally inadequate. The only real recommendation of any significance in the report is that Macquarie Wharf in Hobart will not receive nuclear powered warship visits any longer. But I have been told by the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) in a personal conversation that there is no need for Hobart people to think that they are going to be relieved of the burden of nuclear powered warship visits. They will merely find another berth out in the Derwent so that visits from such ships can continue. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of exercises is raised in recommendation 31, but there are no specifications for the type of exercise listed. For example, I have been told that the Fremantle fire station would be totally unprepared to deal with an accident involving either nuclear weapons or nuclear reactors. It has no contingency plans. It has not even discussed what to do in the event of a nuclear accident, let alone practised any procedures. In South Australia, Senator Teague's own State, fire fighters requested exercises so that they would be a little better prepared than their Western Australian counterparts. The exercises took place some time last year or the end of the year before and were a total fiasco. The Committee ought to have known about that, too. It was a massive exercise in people trying to contact other people and who would do what, but what was actually done in the end resulted in very little indeed. It was acknowledged by the fire fighters who had requested the exercise because their union was concerned about the risks to which fire fighters would be put without adequate training, without adequate safety material and so on, that the exercise itself was an absolute disaster. So one would wonder what nature these exercises would take. I bet they would not take the form of actually having people in place and working out a scenario. The exercises would probably involve phoning up all the people on the list to make sure the telephone numbers were still in the right order. </PARA>
<PARA> This report gives further justification to those who call on the Government to ban visits of all nuclear armed and nuclear powered warships. It gives no assurances of safety. Indeed, no report of this kind could be expected to do so. What is abundantly clear is that the Government it taking unnecessary risks, jeopardising the safety of Australian people and the Australian environment, to suit the flag-waving and rest and recreation requirements of foreign nuclear navies. Nuclear ship visits contribute nothing to Australia's defence. They pose risks which we do not have to take. It is about time that the people who defended the continuation of these nuclear warship visits acknowledged that this is an unnecessary risk being imposed on the people and the environment of Australia by a government whose job is being done by foreign nuclear navies having made available to them nice port calls which do not have anything to do with the defence of Australia. Of course, when these ships visit Australian ports, we are nuclear targets and are put at risk, in addition to the risk of accident, which is quite considerable. </PARA>
<PARA> How can Senator Teague say that the United States Navy has a perfect safety record? The record of the Soviet Navy is no better, of course. At the moment there are 50 nuclear warheads and nine nuclear reactors lying on the ocean floor. It could be said that the world's sixth largest nuclear power after the United States, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, France, the United Kingdom and China is the deep blue sea. How can nuclear navies proclaim a perfect safety record before the world community when these reactors are on the ocean floor? The nuclear reactor casings are bound to corrode in time. So we already have an enormous environmental problem on our hands. I do not know how people can continue to defend the safety records of navies in the light of the evidence. It is almost beyond comprehension. It does not do this Senate Committee any credit whatsoever to ignore the quality of evidence before it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment very briefly, because I think only a brief comment is warranted, on the contributions of Senator Sanders and Senator Vallentine, neither of whom, I hasten to say, was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which has produced the report entitled Visits to Australia by nuclear powered or armed vessels. I am fairly sure that Senator Sanders, for one, has not read the report. I thought his submission, where it was not irrelevant, was flagrant rubbish. I found it to be a very unsatisfactory and very unsavoury contribution, and totally irresponsible. Senator Vallentine, at least, was more responsible in her submission, but again I think her contribution was made up of misunderstandings, misrepresentations and internal contradictions. I think the kindest thing that I could say about it is that it self-destructed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will come in a moment to some of the type of evidence that Senator Vallentine presented to the Committee to show what techniques are used in this sort of presentation of unrealistic risks and unwarranted assumptions about these risks. First of all, I should make it quite clear that the way in which this report was presented in the media here and overseas misunderstood and misrepresented the nature of the report. The Committee looked at two things: whether nuclear reactor powered ships visiting Australian ports were a risk and, if so, whether the precautions we were taking were adequate; and, secondly, whether possibly nuclear armed ships in Australian ports were a potential risk to those ports. For instance, Senator Sanders kept on talking about events on the high seas, firing 16-inch guns. One does not do that in harbour. Senator Vallentine was talking about deep sea reactor accidents in submarines. One does not do that in harbour. When the remarks are not misunderstood, they are almost totally irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee found that the reference accident of a reactor, which is a contained meltdown, was a reasonable basis for a worst case scenario on which planning should be based. We also found that we could discern no risk from the presence of nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are, in fact, in their stowed harbour state the only totally safe explosive ever produced. They are much safer than TNT. The remarks about accidents at sea are quite irrelevant in considering the safety of weapons stowed in harbour. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee did make a number of recommendations where we did not think that the Nuclear Visiting Ships Panel (Nuclear) had seen through the detail of some of the consequences of its reference accident. Some of the things that should have been done were not done. The report listed these, with one exception which has been mentioned by my colleague Senator Teague-the position of Hobart hospital. All of them can be remedied by fairly simple action by the authorities. With that done, all the ports which are presently listed as nuclear berths, with the exception of the berth alongside Hobart, are suitable. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to come to something which worried me: the quality of the evidence presented to the Committee by vehement opponents of the visits by nuclear powered or possibly nuclear armed ships. Senator Vallentine has presented some evidence today, as she did to the Committee, and I will read out a section of the report that deals with this evidence. It is from page 196 of the Committee report. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vallentine told the Committee that, according to a 1973 United States Navy reactor disaster control plan, the `Navy found the melt-down'-</PARA>
<PARA>this is the nuclear reactor-</PARA>
<PARA>`go right down through the ship spilling hot radioactive materials to the bottom of the harbour . . .' When the Committee tried to obtain a copy of the plan, it became clear that Senator Vallentine had not seen the plan that she purported to quote from. She was in fact quoting from a booklet authored by a New York peace activist. It would seem that this author had not seen the plan either but was relying on an account in a Honolulu newspaper. The journalist who wrote this account did not purport to have seen the plan . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So it goes on. People quoting each other and building up a totally spurious case is, in my view, one of the more disturbing aspects of dealing with matters which are highly emotional. We like to rely more on facts than prejudices. One other witness worried me very much. He came out as an expert witness to the Committee but he gave the most sweeping statements which, on probing, he had no basis for at all. For instance, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Any United States warship in an Australian port would be targeted by Soviet strategic missile forces. </PARA>
<PARA>I can well believe that any ship capable of strategic strike itself might be targeted, but the idea that any ship would be targeted is an idea that I have seen no responsible strategic analyst suggest and the particular witness who made that sweeping statement gave no evidence for it all, he just said he knew it. Before he gave his evidence to the Committee-he did not have the courtesy to come before the Committee first-he gave an account to Sydney newspapers showing the devastating affects of a nuclear reactor accident in Sydney. For one thing, his assessment was wrong, but quite apart from that he was unaware that there are no berths for nuclear-powered ships in Sydney Harbour. Yet he was giving this lurid account of what the consequences would be. Then he purported to examine the consequences of a nuclear weapons accident. The accident he examined involved five kilograms of plutonium burning uncontained on the upper deck of a ship for three hours. He did not have the slightest idea of how this could possibly come about or why it would be allowed to continue, but that was the basis on which he gave his evidence. It was highly unsatisfactory and I thought brought great discredit to a man who purported to come before the Committee as an expert witness. </PARA>
<PARA> I have dissented from or elaborated on the Committee report in one important area, that is, with regards to the arrangements for the dry-docking of ships that might or might not be nuclear-armed. Contrary to the opinions of Senator Sanders, whose ignorance is almost limitless, ships needing minor external repairs to such things as the rudder or the propellers berth without de-ammunitioning. If no work is to go on anywhere near the magazines, they are docked for minor repairs without de-ammunitioning. But I am worried, not that there is a risk from the point of view of safety, because a ship in dock has all the firefighting arrangements and a ship in dry-dock is exactly as safe as a similar ship alongside, but about the industrial action that might be taken to prevent a ship either being docked, if it is potentially nuclear-armed or, if it is docked, being undocked, which is what upset the possible arrangements for HMS Invincible when she was out here some years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> You will remember, Mr Acting Deputy President, that not too long ago the berthing of a British ship was prevented by striking tug crews. I think we have got to have a system whereby our dry docks are under proper naval control. They are an essential part of the operational availability of a fleet and it is just not acceptable that operational ships, either our own or visiting foreign warships, should be held to ransom by industrial action by unions whose interests are not those of the defence of the country. Now this would not be easy, but the number of people involved is not great and I think the Navy should take over, with uniformed, disciplined people, the operation of its dry docks. We have recently established, both on the west coast and in Sydney, berthing facilities for the operational fleet quite clear of the dockyard area, so uniformed people handle it, so operational ships are not affected by industrial disputes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is it not interesting that we are now talking about the report entitled Who pays the piper calls the tune? The coalition strongly rejects the base recommendations of this report, which are made for no better reason than for the electoral advantage of the Australian Labor Party. I say that it is interesting because a string of decisions are being made for the electoral advantage of the Labor Party, not the least being the decision leading to the debate we have had in recent times about the stamp allocation. The changes that are recommended for the funding of election campaigns will attack basic freedoms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third recommendation, in paragraph 7.16, requires that all donations to political parties for campaign and non-campaign purposes alike be disclosed. People might suspect that, on the surface, that is very reasonable, but one needs to know the reasoning behind the Government's decision in this matter. In effect, this is a calculated move to deter business and private individuals from making donations to the non-Labor parties. We have seen example after example of people who are known supporters of non-Labor parties being jeopardised in their business procedures by Labor governments. It is cogently pointed out in the dissenting report that, whereas such full disclosure will create a pressure for business to donate equally to both the major parties, the same constraints will not and have never applied to the unions, which will remain the most reliable paymasters and dictators of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> Who would be surprised to find out which union is donating to the Labor Party? No-one. But would people not be interested to know what private enterprise is donating and to what party?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or, as Senator Puplick says, which union may donate to the Liberal Party. The Government members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, who are avidly pursuing the self-interest of the Labor Party, do not provide any argument to refute the contention made by Sir John Carrick in a report of 1983 that disclosure inevitably is intimidatory. It is certainly worth noting that President Nixon's enemies list, as revealed by Watergate, shows how a vengeful government can misuse the knowledge of private and corporate donations. And let us not forget that the recommendation will affect not merely the large corporations but also smaller businesses, far more vulnerable to intimidation from the trade unions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Labor Party has clearly decided to strike at the basic grassroots financial support of its opponents without regard to the violation of liberty and choice that this will clearly involve. Not content with attacking its opponents, who do not rely on the donations of a few massive unions, this Labor Government is intent upon forcing the broadcast media to carry the cost of its political advertising. We are not asking the community or the taxpayer to pay the cost of our advertising; we are saying that we will do it. We are saying that what we do should be private. Why should corporations be maligned by the Labor Party?</PARA>
<PARA> The majority on the Committee, and the Government, cannot claim that these recommendations result from extensive public input. What, in effect, the majority is endorsing is nothing more than a thinly argued submission from the Labor Party itself. The Committee has not taken on board the recommendations from other parties, particularly coalition parties; it has simply stuck to its own agenda and that is what we are left with in this report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has the gall not only to recommend in paragraph 6.8 that free time be given to the political parties at the expense of the commercial media, but also to say that such free time would constitute a community service announcement. How much more outrageous is this going to get? It is nothing short of an Orwellian concept for members of parliament solemnly to proclaim that election propaganda is some vast exercise in public benefit-a social good like our health services, I suppose. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not recommended in this self-serving report-whose authors are determined that the Hawke Labor Government will call the tune as to electoral manipulation-that the amounts of taxpayers' funds already given over to paying for electoral campaigns are to be reduced in proportion to the massive donation of free time that is to be extorted from the commercial media. No such luck! Both the public dollar and the reliable union donations will be diverted into other areas of campaigning where it is evident that Labor strategists see greater benefit in allowing a continuation of an unrestricted free market in campaign advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> Whenever a very substantial change to the electoral ground rules is proposed, honourable senators have not only the right but also the duty to ask for evidence of the necessity for change. The majority report of the Committee has failed in this regard. If paid political advertising on the broadcast media is to be banned, where is the concrete evidence of corrupt practices that flourish at present-corrupt practices that obviously do not affect the print media? All we get is the admission in paragraph 8.9 that `there is no firm evidence of corrupt practice in Australian political fundraising'. I also strongly support the contention expressed in the minority report that if we are at risk from corruption, we must look to the massive discretionary powers recommended for the bureaucracy to exercise over political parties and so-called third parties that may engage in public comment, for whatever reason, at election time. </PARA>
<PARA> No real evidence is presented in the superficial international comparisons that trot out the hackneyed term `laissez faire' to criticise Australian electoral practice and gloss over the fact that paid political advertising is permitted in those nations whose political culture is closest to that of Australia-for example, the United States of America, Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Neither is there acknowledgment of the fact that in Britain, where there are no paid political advertisements on broadcast media, the media is far more tightly regulated than in Australia. Nor must we forget that in remote and rural districts the broadcast media is the only effective means of communication for many Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority report again glosses over evidence submitted by the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations that compulsory free advertising as proposed by the Labor Party would affect the ability of the licensees to recover costs, when licence fees already amount to 6.1 per cent of the gross revenue of commercial television. Paragraph 6.59 sets out the plain truth that the Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters rejected the notion that simply because the airwaves are public property, broadcasters should have further burdens placed upon them. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very proud that the Opposition had the courage and public spirit to advocate to this shonky inquiry that public funding itself should be replaced with tax deductability for political donations, to a ceiling. The Liberal Party has not forgotten that political parties are voluntary organisations that have no special claim on public money. As a Liberal, I totally reject the `snouts in the trough' mentality that inspires the Labor Party and finds expression in the recommendations of this report. </PARA>
<PARA> The apportioning of the free broadcast time is evaded in the majority report which calls for a committee to make this decision. Allocation of time on the basis of support at a previous election, or the number of seats held, would tend to act in favour of incumbent parties-in this case, the Labor Party. The Labor forces would be well served by a ban on broadcast advertising, paid and free, prior to by-elections. An incumbent government has every motive for diminishing political awareness in such unwelcome circumstances. The implementation of these ill-argued, dishonest recommendations would reduce political parties to bureaucratically supervised parasitic organisations, actively discouraging individuals and businesses from involvement with a political process that in the deepest sense would be morally corrupt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable senators would be aware, on 3 May 1989 the Senate referred the tax file numbers system, with particular reference to the mass mail-out, to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, of which Senator Coates is the Chairman. During the hearing, persons who appeared before the Committee and gave evidence included Australian Taxation Office representatives and the Privacy Commissioner. Quite a number of persons and organisations made submissions, including the Australian Taxation Office, the Australian People's Representative Council and the Australian Taxpayers Association which are involved in or concerned about tax file numbers going astray in the mail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee believes that the Taxation Office's decision to mass-mail the unsolicited tax file numbers was reasonable. The Tax Office told the Committee that it had given due regard to privacy considerations. In view of the evidence presented to us both verbally and in writing, I would not doubt that. I was rather overawed by sitting face to face with and eyeballing the Commissioner of Taxation. It was the first time I had done so; I hope it will be the last. I was impressed with the evidence he gave. The Tax Office, in the case it put to us, indicated that it had given due regard to this matter. One of my colleagues in the other place, Donald Cameron, would take a different view. But I believe, given the circumstances, that the Tax Office did the best it could. We must remember that the mass-mailing was done in a hurry. Any faults that came out of the exercise were caused in the main by the pressure the Government applied to the Office to complete the mass-mailings. In my State of Tasmania, because of breakdowns in the system, it was not possible to mass-mail any of the tax file numbers. Consequently, there was a deal of confusion in Tasmania and a lot of people were inconvenienced. It was interesting to note that the Australian Taxpayers Association and the Taxation Institute of Australia were strongly supportive of the Australian Tax Office's decision to mass-mail tax file numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> Evidence given at the public hearings and the submissions indicated that the main concern of the public was the computer error that occurred in respect of mass-mailing, particularly in Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Even the Taxation Office agreed that the number of incorrect mailings was unacceptably high. The Committee believes that the programming error that occurred in the Australian Taxation Office was most unfortunate and should have been avoided. Even the Commissioner of Taxation himself, Mr Boucher, told the Committee, `The error was indicative of the state of our systems in many respects and why the Government has approved the redesign of our systems'. So as the result of that exercise and the faults that were shown by it it is interesting to note that we have received information from the Commissioner of Taxation that he gave instructions on 15 May to implement a further level of checking on program or system changes before they go into production. I suppose we could say that out of something bad something good always comes and in this case, because of the errors and mistakes that were made and the pressure that was put upon the Taxation Office, at least the Government has realised that the computer based system at the Taxation Office needs upgrading. As a result of this exercise that is exactly what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very impressed with the evidence given by the Privacy Commissioner. He showed concerns, particularly about the inadvertent disclosure of confidential tax information relating to 34 Adelaide taxpayers. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) himself replied to that matter on 9 May in the other place. The Privacy Commissioner, as I said, had one or two concerns. He believed that the actual mail itself could have been sent in a different form. Given all the facts and the time constraints that were evidenced at the time, our Committee believes that the Australian Taxation Office did the best it could under the circumstances but I would hope personally that on any future occasion when something like this happens the pressure that the Government puts on the Australian Taxation Office is not as strong so that it can get its act right first up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not take the time of the Senate for too long on this, and I obviously will not have the opportunity to do so, but I felt it was important that somebody from the Australian Democrats spoke on this report. In fact, I was quite staggered when the Opposition took up the question of the operation of the tax file number when, in fact, it was the Australian Democrats in the debate upon passage of that legislation who pointed out the pitfalls into which that system fell. There were inadequate controls-we pointed that out-and more problems will continue to arise under legislation which is intended to allow tax file number disclosure to the private sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the legislation was passed we pointed this out and already the Government has had to move on credit reference agencies. The Democrats will continue to say that eventually the Government will have to move to cover the whole private sector for tax file number and other purposes with regard to privacy. This Parliament should have got it right in the first instance and we certainly did not. Had we done so we would not have had to have this inquiry and this report. Even worse, we have a system through which the tax file number of individuals can fall into too many hands and the investigations of this Committee have shown that. What has happened out there in the public has shown that and the Democrats simply want to say that although we have had this report the problem is not answered and we will have to move further to protect the privacy of individuals, in terms of the tax file number and in all other areas, in particular in the private sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the conclusion of my remarks earlier in the day I was moved to observe that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill offers no benefits to the Aboriginal community. It offers no benefits to the wider community. In fact, it is a piece of legislation which will plunge us all again into a political imbroglio which will do irreparable damage to the cause of the Aboriginal people and will stunt their growth in terms of development in the whole range of areas which are crying out for improvement. It is a political statement by Mr Hand. It is not a piece of legislation that has the support of the majority of the Aboriginal community. In fact, it is a piece of legislation that has very modest support from any group in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not question Mr Hand's motive. I believe that his motive was altruistic. But there is none so dangerous as he who knows he is right. This Bill does not come into the Parliament, it does not come into this chamber, as the result of the maturation of consultation, cooperation or goodwill, or the manifestation of the aspirations of the Aboriginal community; rather it comes to us as the manifestation of the preconceived obsession of Minister Hand who, well prior to becoming Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, harboured, first of all, uniform land rights, which he was unable to achieve through his own Party, notwithstanding cruel and broken promises made to the Aboriginal community. So he replaced that aspiration, first of all, with the preamble that is in the Bill which tells us that members of the Aboriginal community were the prior owners of Australia in a legal sense. He is saying that Aborigines are entitled to repossession and compensation, but he is unable to achieve that for them, so he is simply stating it as a fact and putting it in the Bill as if to cleanse himself of some of his eastern seaboard middle class guilt. We ultimately have this piece of legislation before us which is a substitute for something he would rather have had. It is the creation of a new political system. It is superimposing on our present social, economic and political structure a new political system which embraces, in the mind of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand), economic, political and social reforms. It is a token piece of legislation fraught with enormous dangers in respect of development-the development of the Aboriginal community and Aboriginal people individually. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not come to us as the result of consultation. Mr Hand exhorts us to believe that it is the result of consultation. He tells us in his exhortations that no piece of legislation has ever come to the Parliament as the result of more consultation. The difficulty is that Mr Hand does not know the difference between talking to Aboriginal people and talking at them. I have been overwhelmed by Aboriginal groups who have complained about Mr Hand flying into their community, climbing out of his aeroplane, haranguing them about what he believes is good for them, getting back into his aeroplane and flying out again-leaving them confused, frustrated and with an enormous sense of anxiety because they have not been party to discussions. They have been privy only to the aspirations of this Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to be the ongoing sin of this Government that it feels compelled to continue to make political statements rather than arrive at effective achievements for the Aboriginal community. What has it done in respect of health? What does this Bill do in respect of Aboriginal health, Aboriginal education, Aboriginal housing, or the enormous problems confronting a wide section of the Aboriginal community in respect of the abuse of alcohol? What does it do about their frustrations because of their inadequacies in terms of their integration into the communities and towns in which they live and their integration with the towns upon whose outskirts they live in abominable circumstances? Absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> One only has to go to the Kimberley in Western Australia to see graphically, first hand, how this Government has failed to address the fundamental problems affecting the Aboriginal community. The poor, the sick, the suffering, the alcoholics, the kids who sleep in the street and the children suffering from malnutrition-they are not interested in a political statement which gives them ATSIC. They are not interested in a new political structure. They are not interested in a new voting system. They are not interested in a phoney, pretend self-determination. They are interested in immediate needs. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of an example, the Kimberley represents 2 per cent of the population of Western Australia. It also represents 50 per cent of recorded incidents of venereal disease in Western Australia. What has this Federal Government done about it? What has it done in respect of funding? One can pick any one of a number of towns, and they are all precise, pristine examples. I turn to Fitzroy Crossing as a good example. It has a school with 386 children. It has not even got a school nurse, yet it has in the classrooms in the junior school kids with venereal disease and hearing and sight problems. The Government can spend millions of dollars launching ATSIC upon them, but cannot address those fundamental problems. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a test carried out in the  1987-88 period of 34 contacts who had venereal disease-in fact, they had syphilis. It was found that 75 per cent of them had contracted the end stage, in other words, the stage where the disease affects the brain. That is a modest number to test, but it is symptomatic of the problem that confronts the people in the north-west of Western Australia. The community health sisters are absolutely run off their feet. In the Kimberley region they each have roughly 400 clients. So, of course, there is no environmental health. There is no preventive medicine. There is no counselling. There is no family planning. There is no assistance for pregnant women. There is no counselling support or help for mothers with young babies. But there is lots of money to spend on ideals. </PARA>
<PARA> One only has to look at the problems in respect of alcohol. The Kimberley, the Pilbara, the Gascoyne, the Murchison and the Goldfields of Western Australia are not unique. This is a problem across Australia, manifest, I suspect, as a result of the frustrations of the Aboriginal community because of the perception that Aboriginals are offered little hope for the future. How many institutions across Australia are provided to offer assistance for this enormous problem, which is beginning, in many respects, to engulf whole communities? None. This is a problem that spreads throughout the communities. There are children suffering from malnutrition because of a lack of food, never mind nutrition. Young men are dying in their late teens and early twenties simply because of alcoholism, with kidney failure, liver problems and heart attacks. If they were white and living in the metropolitan area they would have the Salvation Army, the Jesus People or the other wonderful voluntary organisations that look after these people, but because they are in isolated areas they receive none of those benefits. This Government, which purports to be caring, compassionate and concerned and gives us this legislation as a manifestation of that, does nothing for them. </PARA>
<PARA> What does it do for them in respect of education? Nothing. To demonstrate that we have equality in this country, little Aboriginal children who can barely speak the language are put in grade 1 with white children, whose prerequisite for going to school is to be able to speak English as a first language. They are asked to compete on a daily basis. And we wonder why Aboriginal children spell `emu' as `hemeru'; it is because that is how they say it. They cannot speak the language but each year, in the cause of equality, they are pushed through to grade 2 to grade 3 to grade 4 and leave school at the age of 15 or 16 with absolutely no education because their fundamental problems are not addressed. If they did get an education, where would they find a job? What skills are there for them? What training is there for them? What jobs are they offered? Nothing. One may wonder why one finds all these young men and women hanging around towns and receiving social welfare benefits of some sort, the men permanently drunk and the women permanently pregnant, without any assistance, without any help, without any guidance and, least of all, any support from government agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> One may go to almost any hospital in an area which has a large Aboriginal population and one will find the majority of the patients admitted are suffering from causes which are the result of a lack of proper attention. The number of children in these hospitals because they failed to thrive is staggering. They are admitted to hospital, given nourishment and support, sent back out again, and they come back later on. The level of infant mortality is staggering. But is it addressed? Of course, it is not addressed. They are some of the fundamental problems that I would have thought this Government ought to be addressing. </PARA>
<PARA> One can go to almost any town in Australia where there is a high Aboriginal population and look at the housing conditions, and without exception one will find that they are absolutely deplorable. There would not be a member of this Government that would live in any of those homes, but they are good enough for other people. Suddenly, to make themselves feel good and comfortable and warm inside, they will build homes, intermingled in the community in these country towns, and put in them Aboriginal people who, but perhaps two or three decades ago, lived in their primitive tribal circumstances and expect them to suddenly flourish and to live side by side and to be accepted as part of the social fabric of the community. When they are rejected and they turn to alcohol and violence and all those sorts of things as a manifestation of their deprived circumstances, we wonder why, we set up committees, we have reports and we have government findings. But never do we address the fundamental problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, in the few moments I have got left, let me simply say this about this Bill: it purports to replace the Department of Aboriginal Affairs-as I say, it is simply a political statement-but it bears no relationship to the geographic or the demographic distribution of the Aboriginal people. As Senator Peter Baume observed to me this morning, when the various boundaries for the regions and the zones were drawn, kin and skin were divided: there seems to be just no common feature, except that the draftsman has purported to find lines that for some reason have a commonality. I do not know what it is, because it is not skin, it is not kin, it is not language, it is not culture, it is not clan, and it is not groupings. The people who are put into these regions-put in, I might say, by the arbitrary lines of the Minister-bear no common relationship with each other. As the zones are drawn and the commissions are appointed, they will represent everybody but really represent nobody because of the arbitrary way that the Government and the Minister have drafted the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation really does not in any way give self-determination. It ought to be called the Aboriginal protection legislation, because the Minister can do anything from appointing commissioners to deciding whether or not a ballot has been effective. He is the one that decides these things. I have to say that the legislation is a fraud; it is a failure; it is a blight on this Government. In my view, it will only cause chaos, turmoil, disillusionment, disappointment, and ultimately absolute frustration for the Aboriginal community who are having it foisted upon them as a result of the ideological bigotry of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, who in his ambition might be altruistic but who in his manifestation is totally incompetent. </PARA>

It is likely to lead to worse outcomes than those produced by the bodies it is to replace; to worse services for Aboriginal and Islander people; to less accountability of the Commission and its servants to the Aboriginal and Islander people; and to less accountability to all Australians. There is not a clearer or more accurate description of the legislation that we have before us today than those remarks, which were written in the dissenting report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs by Senators Peter Baume and Ron Boswell. I am happy to see that Senator Peter Baume is in the chamber with us here this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last year we celebrated Australia's Bicentenary. There was much noise and hype from the Government that we were all Australians working together. With the beautiful and rich diversity of nationalities that make up our nation, we were all celebrating together. And I am sure we can all recall very many instances during last year when we had this opportunity of celebrating the bicentenary of our nation. We were all to work together and celebrate together-and `together', I believe, is the crucial word-not as blacks opposed to whites, as opposed to Asians and other nationalities. </PARA>
<PARA> Now we see that what the Government is in reality proposing to do with this legislation that we are debating here this evening is to honour that togetherness by setting one people against another in Australia. That, I feel, is what this legislation is all about. It is about two Australias-one white and one black. I suppose that, in the light of recent reports that our Asian population will be substantially increased by early next century, there could also be the possibility of looking at creating another commission-one indeed for all the Asian Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation officially sets the Aborigines apart from other Australians. The Government already encourages such action when it allows the Department of Aboriginal Affairs here in Canberra to fly the Aboriginal land rights flag instead of the Australian flag. The Aboriginal flag was designed to become the flag of a foreign state, an Aboriginal state to be carved out of Australia. It did it again when it allowed its Minister, Hon. Gerry Hand, to boycott Australian bicentennial celebrations last year. I consider that the effect of such actions is indeed divisive. As a nation, we say that we are repulsed by the apartheid system in South Africa. Yet if this legislation passes, we are about to let slip through what I believe to be quite simply the establishment of a similar system in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> We are at the crucial turning point in our history. Either we can adopt this legislation, with its focus on separate development for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders apart from the wide Australian community, or we can concentrate on ensuring that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are encouraged to take their place as equal, responsible and independent Australians alongside-not separate from-the rest of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Blacks and whites have much to offer each other. We have to realise that we belong to each other and collectively to Australia. `Aboriginal people have the power to help unite this nation and give it a real reason for being'-these are the words of a former Aboriginal Affairs Department Secretary, Charles Perkins. Yet I suppose that these words have fallen on deaf ears in the Government. This Government is trying to achieve the impossible, to rectify what it sees as past wrongs, and in the process is creating even further wrongs and injustices. It is an extremely worrying tendency which is happening more frequently in bureaucratic circles throughout this country. I believe it is attempting to single out the Aborigines for reasons of race and deny them their fundamental rights as equal, responsible Australian citizens. I want to quote from one of Australia's leading Aboriginals on the subject, Bob Liddle-a well-known and successful Northern Territory Aboriginal businessman. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>When it comes to policy, regret is pointless and atonement gives satisfaction only to the atoner-not to the one who would have been offended. </PARA>
<PARA>Again let me quote from one of the leading spokesmen for Aborigines in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. I listened with very great interest to Senator Crichton-Browne as he was telling us about some of the problems of the Aboriginal people in that area. A spokesman for the Aboriginals there said:</PARA>
<PARA>The real aborigines of Australia have forgiven the white men of yesteryear for their cruelty towards Aboriginal tribal ancestors. The present day Aboriginal majority does not hold today's white population responsible for past massacres. In the outback, Aborigines and whites work together, play sport together, live side by side in towns and respect each other . . . White Australians must be careful not to don yokes of guilt, concerning events that happened in a bygone era, which the land rights activists are so determined to place upon them. The past is forgiven. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to point out during this debate that, in Queensland, the Government of which my husband was Premier at the time adopted the system of a deed of grant in trust for the Aboriginal and Islander people in Queensland. I believe that that was very good for the people in our State. </PARA>

I had the opportunity of helping to make sure that my husband was on Darnley Island when this deed of grant in trust was handed to the people, when George Mye was present. We had a most marvellous evening. This action gave the Islander people a feeling of belonging to the State of Queensland and to Australia. These people were allowed to make their own decisions. I think this is very important.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is unfortunate. I believe it will be a sad and sorry day for our Aboriginal and Islander people in Queensland. I look at Aboriginal settlements in our State that have been given deeds of grant in trust. Indeed, I have visited Cherbourg, which is just outside Murgon, a town about 28 or 30 miles away from my home, on many occasions. There is an Aboriginal council in Cherbourg. All the Aboriginal settlements in Queensland have their own Aboriginal councils run by the the Aboriginals themselves. Those councils are in many cases-certainly it is the case at Cherbourg-part of the local community. The children attending high school go to the Murgon High School. The Aboriginal and white people are working together; they are living together. I think that is something that is very important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the early days, before I was married and went to live at Kingaroy, Aboriginals were employed by my husband and his family to work on their farm property. They were treated as part of the family. In fact, Joh told a story about one of the Aboriginals who went into the house, looked at the kerosene refrigerator and could not quite understand why a light and the heat underneath the refrigerator made it cold. I suppose we have gone past those days now and many of the Aboriginals have their own refrigerators. I feel very sad to think that it is quite possible that this deed of grant in trust that has helped the Aboriginal and Islander people in Queensland is to be replaced by the ATSIC legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ron Boswell informed me only today that there are about 15 communities in northern Queensland that are not in any of the zones that have been created. Perhaps those communities will comprise some of the fortunate people who will be able to live without being subject to this legislation. I have a funny feeling that in the meantime the Government might do something to remedy that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill aims to set up what Senator Boswell called `a white man's bureaucracy', thrust it on the black communities of Australia and then call itself self-determination. The Bill establishes an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission that incorporates under the one banner the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the Aboriginal Development Corporation and Aboriginal Hostels Ltd. This will be done by establishing 60 regional councils electing 1,200 councillors. In turn, these councils will elect 17 zonal commissioners who in Canberra will make virtually every decision concerning Aboriginals. They will be joined by another three commissioners appointed by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel very sad at the arbitrary way in which the Minister has planned the zones. The elected representatives will control the 230,000 Aboriginals and the 25,000 or 30,000 Islanders. In essence this means that the Government's answer to solving the Aboriginals' many problems in Australia is setting up a black parliament with 1,200 elected members, dividing Australia into black and white, setting up apartheid in Australia and developing Australia along split racial lines. It is a very sad situation as I see it. </PARA>
<PARA> But I believe that the Government has a trick in these proposals. The Minister asserts that a new structure is necessary to enable better outcomes to be achieved for Aboriginal people. There is nothing in these arrangements that logically or necessarily gives promise of any better outcomes. The Minister then asserts that self-determination by Aboriginals is essential for the outcomes of Aboriginal people to improve. That is his version of self-determination. That is his concept of what it means. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has promised the Aboriginal people power over decisions affecting them. Yet the regional councils will have little or no power. All power will rest with the zonal commissioners-the 17 people sitting in Canberra who get their instructions from the ministerially appointed chairman of ATSIC and his two appointed offsiders. The Minister has promised the commissioners money to put the decisions into effect. He has promised the commissioners support for the decisions that they take. In fact and in law they will not receive those things. I believe it is a cruel and cynical trick. </PARA>

<PARA> Funding will remain subject to the normal processes and constraints of the Government and the Budget. That is right and proper. But the Minister has deliberately failed to make that clear to the people. Instead, he has attempted to perpetuate the illusion that total self-control is being granted to Aborigines. This extraordinary state of affairs has been described by my colleague Senator Peter Baume as like putting to the Australian public and to veterans organisations a proposition that all decisions on veterans' affairs and all public funds for veterans' affairs are to be placed under the veterans' control, independent of the general community or of the normal mechanisms of accountability to the Parliament and to the public which provides the cash. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Such a proposal . . . would be seen as a fraud; it would be seen as being inconsistent with constitutional proprieties; it would be seen as being inconsistent with the administrative or financial realities and imperatives. </PARA>
<PARA>What surprises me most about this legislation is that there are many members of the Government who claim that they have a special affinity with the Aboriginal communities, that they know what the Aborigines truly want. I ask honourable senators opposite-there are not too many of them here tonight, listening to the debate on this very important subject-whether they agree that most Aborigines in 1989 share the same aspirations of their children, for jobs and a higher standard of living in line with other Australian parents. </PARA>
<PARA> They want effective and productive education, greater Aboriginal longevity, more people housed, better housing, better employment opportunities and fewer drug and alcohol problems. We heard about some of those problems earlier this evening from Senator Crichton-Browne. These are the aspirations of many parents across this country, whether they be black, white or Asian. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some Aborigines who have already achieved prominence, as Australians first, and surely there must be others to follow. I mention former Senator Neville Bonner, who was still serving as a senator when I first came to this place; Eric Deeral, the National Party State member in my own State of Queensland; Bob Liddle from the Northern Territory and Ernie Bridge from Western Australia, who became a Minister in a Western Australian Labor government. They all made the effort to work in our one Australia, to strive for their achievements equal with and alongside other nationalities. All we do by such legislation is take away from these people, and others, the worth of their achievements. </PARA>
<PARA> This proposal is more likely to remove Aboriginal Australians from the mainstream of Australian life, to emphasise Aboriginal separateness, to require Aboriginal people to operate in a system differently from other Australians and to make them into welfare recipients forever. If this legislation proceeds we are sending Aborigines back into the dark ages of colonialism. </PARA>
<PARA> The peak body of Aboriginal councils in Queensland, the Aboriginal Coordinating Council, said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is the same old Government policy that was used during colonisation. Black people against black people . . . It is painfully obvious that at the end of the day it is party politics and Government priorities that are the real issues and not Aboriginal development. </PARA>
<PARA>Just over 20 years ago Australians voted on an historic referendum which overwhelmingly welcomed Aborigines as fully-fledged Australians. The majority of Australians supported that referendum when more than 90 per cent elected to change the Constitution to enable Aborigines to be counted in the census and to give the Federal Government power to legislate regarding them. That was a hallmark in our history. It is vital that we recognise that fact 22 years later and do not undo what strides we have already made, that we recognise that Aborigines played a part in developing Australia. Aboriginal troopers and soldiers defended it. They want to share in Australia's future. That is something we should remember. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge honourable senators to reject this Bill because it is unjust, unnecessary and culturally inappropriate and serves to further sectionalise the Australian community. The Bill must not be allowed to proceed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to add my contribution to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill 1989. The first Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill, the 1988 Bill, was tabled on 24 August 1988 and was subsequently referred to the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. In February 1989, the report of the Senate Select Committee was tabled, advocating several amendments to the Bill, and the new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on 4 May 1989. On 24 May the Bill was passed by the House of Representatives and it was introduced into the Senate on 27 May. This means that we have now had some 2 1/2 months to examine the reviewed legislation before entering the debate at this stage. A great number of amendments to the legislation have been put forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It appears that the Government has acceded to the majority of the amendments advocated by the Senate Select Committee. All too often legislation goes through the parliamentary process far too fast. In the case of this Bill there has been some time for further consultation. On a personal basis, I would have appreciated more time to consult with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on these matters. On the other hand, there certainly are a number of very serious issues, as far as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are concerned, which need addressing right now. Some of those issues were enunciated earlier by honourable senators, including Senator Crichton-Browne. </PARA>
<PARA> A year ago, on 5 August 1988, there emerged a United Nations report by Professor Erica Daes, chairperson of the United Nations working group. The report was on the indigenous population of Australia. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Aborigines are living in poverty, misery and extreme frustration and do not have the self-determination and social status enjoyed by other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>On 24 August 1988, a report by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission entitled `Report on the Problems and Needs of Aboriginals Living on the New South Wales-Queensland Border', the Toomelah report, also emerged. Some issues were brought forward in those reports which certainly need to be addressed urgently. The explanatory memorandum to the legislation states:</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to ensure maximum participation of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders in the formulation and implementation of government policies which affect them. </PARA>
<PARA> The central proposal that would be implemented by the Bill is the establishment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission . . . The twenty Commissioners comprising the Commission would all be Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, of whom 17 would be the elected representatives of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. Special provision would be made to protect the position of the Torres Strait Islander people. The Commission would supersede the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal Development Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the basic problems with this legislation is that it is a contradiction in terms. The Bill aims at self-management and self-determination for the Aboriginal people, yet the very act of the Australian Parliament in passing the Government's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission legislation involves determination and management by the Parliament. That is the system that we have at present and is, therefore, the kernel of the whole problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The Aboriginal people of Australia-that is the original people of this land and I guess after some 40,000 years of habitation they may be defined as such-have had in past years various pieces of legislation, systems and plans heaped upon them, almost always with the best of intentions. `It seemed like a good idea at the time' would be an appropriate motto. The paternalistic approach was tried. This involved some children being removed from their families to be brought up on mission stations and reserves. They were sometimes found jobs with Europeans far from the tribal lands of their families. Tied with this were strict apartheid-type rules which banned Aboriginal people from urban areas at certain times unless they had a special pass or certificate. A referendum of the non-Aboriginal population of Australia set this to right just over 20 years ago when those of Aboriginal descent were accorded Aboriginal right of citizenship. Unfortunately, that right in itself has not been a magic wand. The inequities, the injustices and some terrible statistics remain. There have been more recent advances. We have had the National Aboriginal Council, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA), the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC), Aboriginal Hostels Ltd, the Institute of Aboriginal Studies, the Aboriginal Legal Service and the Aboriginal Medical Service. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite some improvements, the inequities, the injustices and the terrible statistics are still with us today. The average life expectancy is some 15 to 20 years less for people of Aboriginal descent. Aboriginal infant mortality is three times the rate of non-Aboriginal Australians. Aboriginal people have poorer health in general than the rest of the community. In fact, Aboriginal health is not improving overall at present. We see a high incidence of diseases such as diabetes and hepatitis. There are other health problems such as heart attacks. The unemployment rate among Aboriginal people is six times that of the national average. On average, Aboriginal people earn half the income of other Australians. Their imprisonment rate is some 14 times higher. In Western Australia, for example, the Aboriginal population is 2.5 per cent of the population as a whole, yet the prison population runs about level-pegging-50 per cent Aboriginal and 50 per cent non-Aboriginal. Since 1981 deaths in custody in Western Australia have also been on that scale-approximately 50 per cent Aboriginal and 50 per cent non-Aboriginal. Those deaths reflect the gaol population rather than the population at large. In a juvenile detention centre in Perth which I visited earlier this year the proportion of young Aboriginal offenders was 84 per cent. So the present system is not working. When we add to the statistics the sub-standard housing figures and the poor retention rates in high schools, it is easy to understand that there is an urgent need for vast improvement. What is to be done? Do we carry on business as usual? Do we have more of the same and just try to make it better? Unfortunately, the `we' I am talking about comprises all of us here in this chamber and our colleagues in the other place. As far as I know, not one of us is of acknowledged Aboriginal descent. Is this legislation a good idea at this time? If it is not, what is a better idea?</PARA>
<PARA> The principles in this Bill, as I have said, are exemplary. The objects are: to ensure the maximum participation of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders in the formulation and implementation of Government policies; to promote the development of self-management and self-sufficiency among Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders; to further the economic, social and cultural development of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders; and to ensure coordination in the formulation and implementation of policies affecting Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders of the Commonwealth, State, Territory and local governments without detracting from the responsibilities of State, Territory and local governments to provide services to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander residents. Will the legislation deliver these particular goods? Like a lot of legislation it has its strengths and weaknesses. As far as I am concerned and as far as the Australian Democrats are concerned the strengths are contained in those clauses in the legislation which allow all people of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent to elect their own councillors to represent them throughout 60 regions in Australia. Those regions will be responsible for local affairs and will also be able to advise the Commission on matters affecting local affairs. In Western Australia we are looking at some 15 regions. The functions of those regional councils include to formulate and revise from time to time a regional plan for improving the economic, social and cultural status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander residents of its region; to receive and to pass on to the Commission the views of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders about the activities in the region of the Commission and other Commonwealth bodies under State, Territory and local government bodies-at long last there is some liaison between these various bodies-and to represent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander residents of the region and to act as an advocate of their interests. </PARA>
<PARA> Other aspects of the legislation are commended by the Australian Democrats. For example, the Aboriginal people themselves will be involved in the decision-making process to the extent that this process will affect their daily lives and their destinies. With the new amendments, Aboriginal people will be able to make changes to legislation. In other words, they will not be bound by councils, by councillors, or by a particular electoral system. There are other aspects too. At least on this occasion it will be the elected representatives of the Aboriginal people who will be making those decisions. In other words, the legislation will allow Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to change the legislation if it is not what they want, or if it does not work in the way intended. Those are the fundamental strengths of the legislation as viewed by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the weaknesses in the legislation? These include a preamble which has no force in law and is misleading, and which has in fact already misled a lot of people. The Australian Democrats have sought to change this and not to have the preamble at the start of the legislation in the present format. Also, the Australian Democrats object very strongly-and I quote Senator John Coulter when he spoke earlier in this debate-to the:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . payment of dividends and taxes on the capital fund of what is now the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) but which will become a capital fund within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Development Corporation . . . That capital fund was established when the Opposition established the ADC as a compensatory fund. It was established in recognition of Aboriginal dispossession and all that flowed from that. For that reason, it is quite wrong that the Government should seek to levy dividends and tax on earnings from that capital fund. </PARA>
<PARA>Another unsatisfactory aspect will be the appointment initially of five commissioners for 12 months before elections can be held. It is quite correct that the coalition Opposition should object to that. However, I would remind the Senate that the present ADC's 12 councillors are all at present appointed by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Another flaw as seen by the Australian Democrats is the fact that there will be no electoral rolls when elections are held. I think that this is something that will have to be addressed as time passes. The crucial questions are: Do the Aboriginal people understand the legislation? Have they been sufficiently consulted? Do they want the legislation? Is it acceptable to non-Aboriginal people? And what are the alternatives?</PARA>
<PARA> I have tried to judge this issue from a Western Australian perspective. In Western Australia the population currently is close to 1 1/2 million. The Aboriginal population is estimated at nearly 38,000, that is, some 2.5 per cent of the population. There is also a Torres Strait Islander population in Western Australia of close to 700 people, located for the most part in the Broome area. In the past year I have talked about the proposed legislation with as many people as possible, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal. Since the present Bill was tabled in the Senate, I have put out a mailing of close to 400 to Aboriginal individuals, Aboriginal communities and Aboriginal groups, and to non-Aboriginal communities and groups who expressed interest. </PARA>
<PARA> I have an analysis of that mailing here. In no way can I say this is a conclusive piece of research. I have not had a response from all those to whom I wrote, although I have had quite a number of responses by mail, by fax machine and also by telephone. I asked how many people the various community leaders and organisers of groups reckoned they represented, and the figure came to some 21,000 in favour of the legislation. I got responses from Broome, Derby, Kununurra, Halls Creek, Port Hedland, Wyndham and Kalgoorlie. One of the responses from Kalgoorlie was a representation from 24 communities which actually had had a meeting about the subject. I also got responses from Albany, the Bunbury area, Geraldton, Carnarvon, the wheat belt area, and the Perth metropolitan area. The organisations represented there were Aboriginal communities, Aboriginal land councils, the Aboriginal Legal Service, the Aboriginal Medical Service, the Aboriginal Outpost Radio, the Aboriginal Media Association, an Aboriginal progress association, some Aboriginal corporations, the Catholic Aboriginal Ministry, and the Quaker Race Relations Committee in Western Australia, who stated that on balance the legislation is better than the present situation. As I said before, that cannot be regarded as comprehensive. I regard it as indicative only. </PARA>
<PARA> The replies against the legislation came from Broome, again. Quite a few came from the metropolitan area, representing, as well as individuals, the Aboriginal Women's Congress and Professional Women's Association, and the One Australia Movement. From Kalgoorlie and Eyre they came from the Citizens Electoral Council and from some Aboriginal communities in the metropolitan area and in the country. The leader of one of these Aboriginal communities stated, `We like the horse, but we are not confident about the jockey', meaning, I suppose, the Minister. Some wanted the legislation further delayed-just a few, I might add. This came from the Citizens Initiative Referendum Group, from the community of Torres Strait Islanders in Western Australia, and from a Catholic institution which has a high percentage of Aboriginal students. A few also wanted a referendum. I must say that I think it would have been a good idea to have had some kind of referendum on this issue earlier. Those who wanted the referendum were the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Women's Association, some individuals, and an Aboriginal childminding and resource centre. In fact, I would like to quote what was said on the front of the submission from that particular centre:</PARA>
<PARA>Due to the past historical factors of Aboriginal/European relationships, ATSIC isn't the solution as it doesn't change the scene to that extent for Aboriginal advancement and development. </PARA>
<PARA> The administrative area on Aboriginal affairs hasn't functioned to the advantage of a people who have survived within their own societal system for 40,000 years or more, who are now self destructive, because they remain a non entity in a land which they recognise as their own, who are willing to share, but are being disregarded, ignored and forgotten to survive in an environment in which they are not wanted. </PARA>
<PARA> The ATSIC project with all good intentions, can't function until acceptance of Aboriginal people in their own identity, is fulfilled and they are acknowledged as such, as a basic human right, and therefore entitled to be treated according to the code of ethics as stated by the human rights covenant. </PARA>
<PARA>That was from the group that advocated a referendum. I had some other responses. A couple said they were happy to trust my judgment. One was most derogatory about anything the Parliament could achieve for Aboriginal people, whether the ATSIC legislation was passed or not. I had two offensive telephone calls. I say `offensive' because they had very strong racist overtones. I also had a very interesting response from the Country Shire Councils Association, which advocated a greater role for local government as far as Aboriginal affairs are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been very encouraged by the tone of the responses, both for and against. The views were put rationally. In fact, I would like it on record that this has been the tone of the discussion and the debates which I have been having for over a year now. There have been differing views, and that cannot be denied. But what has come through very strongly to me, especially since the tabling of the report by the Senate Select Committee, is that, if the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legislation is to pass, people want it monitored very carefully. I believe that, having had this taste of consultation and having already seen changes through the acceptance of amendments recommended by the Senate Select Committee, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people will take a keen interest not only in this legislation but also in its implementation at all stages, especially now that everybody is aware that changes can be made. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation is an imposition, but at least it genuinely provides access to self-management and self-determination. It is not perfect legislation as it stands, although, of course, we do not know at this stage exactly how it will stand and will not know until we have proceeded with the committee stage and know what further amendments will go through. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the present situation is untenable and there must be change. No other alternatives have been put forward. Despite its shortcomings, the Australian Democrats are prepared to support this piece of government legislation. I am in full support of the Democrats stance. Most of the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people who have asked me either to support or not to support this legislation have also asked that the Democrats fight on and continue to monitor the progress of the setting up of the Commission and the councils and all that that entails. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears that the Aboriginal people will have the chance to have some control over their own destiny and some control over decision making instead of the present situation. With the best of intentions, the DAA and ADC get on with their work but, nonetheless, there is that feeling that matters are imposed upon the Aboriginal people and not through their own elected representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> It is inevitable, of course, that some mistakes will be made. When that happens, these matters will need to be addressed. A solution has not been found so far to correct inequities and to solve the health problems and so on by imposition. Therefore, we must be sensitive to mistakes that may be made in the initial stages. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been made very clear to me in talking to Aboriginal people on visits that I have been able to make to the more remote areas in Western Australia that although there are systems which have been set up which should, in theory, improve the health and housing of Aboriginal people, they do not, because the Aboriginal people themselves have not been involved at the basic decision making stage. I commend this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA> Having said that, I wish to refer to something the previous speaker, Senator Jenkins, has just said about the deficiencies in this legislation. I have no doubt at all that they are numerous. I am sure that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) would also concede that the Bill has deficiencies, in that there are problems with the legislation of which no-one at this point in time, with the best will in the world, is aware. As I have said before in relation to this legislation, if there are not changes made to how ATSIC operates after it begins its operations, ATSIC will probably be judged to be a failure. I have no doubt at all that the organisation itself will determine, after it has been in operation for some time, that changes will be required into how it should operate. I have no doubt that the organisation will make representations to the Government on the subject. I have no doubt that the Government, after it considers the changes that ATSIC wants to make to its own operations, will respond positively or negatively as it sees fit at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> No body which has been created up to this point in time by this Parliament has been faultless in its operations in respect of Aboriginal affairs. I cannot see any particular reason why ATSIC should be dramatically different in that respect. As I have said in this Parliament on a previous occasion in debating this matter, it is the latest attempt by a Commonwealth government, and hopefully the most successful attempt, at providing a real role for Aboriginal people in making decisions about the administration of their own affairs. There is no need to canvass the history of the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee and the National Aboriginal Conference again. I confess that at the moment I am talked out on the subject. I also confess that at the moment I am probably not psychologically tuned in to ATSIC anyway when what I overwhelmingly want to do is go out and kick a few airline pilots to death, like a lot of other people in this country do. That is much on my mind, having spent most of today trying to assist people in the Northern Territory who are being profoundly affected by the strike and, I regret to say, failing to assist them. </PARA>
<PARA> I have just had to tell a bunch of 22 schoolchildren from the poor end of town who have been planning since the beginning of this school year to come to Canberra and who were supposed to arrive here next week that they will not be able to come. I was also in the unfortunate position of having to cope with the problem that half of the $25,000 that they have raised for the trip is going to have to be expended anyway on the non-travel costs because the tourist operators are not prepared to waive the money. Not only have they spent an entire year fund-raising for this bunch of kids from the poor end of town to come down here, and they will now not get their trip, but they will also have to pay for the privilege as well. So I confess that the airline dispute is very much on my mind at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Having diverted to that extent, I also have no doubt that I will probably have to speak for about 10 hours during the committee stage of this debate; so there is simply no need to go over the same ground that I have gone over before. But I do want to say that this legislation is a genuine and honest attempt by the Government, as flawed as it may be in operation. I think it has got a real chance of being successful, provided the Government is prepared to listen to the changes the organisation itself wants to make in the fullness of time and respond positively to them. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the major difficulty that ATSIC will have in its first year of operations will not be copping flak from Senator Tambling or copping flak from the non-Aboriginal community at large but, based on my previous experience of the two organisations that preceded it, copping the criticism it will undoubtedly receive from the Aboriginal community in Australia. Indeed, in terms of the public relations of ATSIC, one of its most important tasks will be its internal public relations rather than its external public relations. It will be necessary for ATSIC to take professional steps to ensure that the far-flung and remote Aboriginal communities are aware of what the organisation is doing around Australia, so that when their tractor does not arrive, their house does not get built or their local community store does not get refurbished they will know that it is because ATSIC is busily occupied doing positive and productive things somewhere else. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty is that, by the very creation of ATSIC, the expectations of the Aboriginal community that I serve-and it is the only one on which I can speak with any authority at all-have undoubtedly been raised. They have not been raised because of any false promises being held out by the Government. They have been raised by the new and exciting concept in the creation of an Aboriginal body which will not only be a politically representative body for Aboriginal people-it will certainly have that role and I imagine it will pursue that role aggressively-but it will actually administer the Department, as it now is, of Aboriginal Affairs. It is not surprising that people's expectations are going to be raised by the very creation of the body. So I believe that a very difficult task for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission commissioners in the initial stages of the operations of this organisation will be to explain to the Aboriginal community why everything is not instantly fixed. There is no question at all that the people at the receiving end of the services delivered by ATSIC are likely to be far more critical about the organisation than people who are standing on the sidelines like ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> I have my own personal views about funding for Aboriginal affairs which I have also expressed many times on the public record. My own view about funding for Aboriginal affairs is that the lion's share of that funding should, in fact, be non-discretionary. Bodies such as ATSIC or, indeed, any other bodies that are created should have no discretion to determine how it is spent at all because, in my view, the lion's share of funding for Aboriginal affairs has to be spent directly on improving the desperate living conditions of many of these people who, without doubt, are the most deprived group of people still existing in the Australian community. In my view when we are providing houses for people who do not have them and health services for people who do not have them and schools for people who do not have them the only way to do that is to do it on a fair and equitable basis which allows no discretion whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, there should be a discretionary area of funding provided for Aboriginal affairs-that is where ATSIC will play its most important role-in determining how the cream on the cake, if such an analogy is a proper one and I do not think it is, should be spent. Also, there will undoubtedly be many benchmarks established to judge the success or failure of ATSIC. Every one will be an outstanding success, a dismal failure or some point in between. I have no hesitation in saying-and I do not believe this would be the view of all Aboriginal people in Australia or perhaps even most Aboriginal people in Australia-that the benchmark that will be used to judge the success or failure of ATSIC by the Aboriginal people whom I represent in this Parliament will be whether their standard of living improves. It will be whether the delivery of services on the ground from government gets better as a result of the establishment of ATSIC and if ATSIC does not tangibly deliver a better degree and a more efficient degree of essential services which, after all, is the role of government, it will be judged by the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory as a failure. </PARA>
<PARA> I will expand on that a little. The proper people in my view to be involved-and the only people to be involved directly-in the preservation and enrichment of Aboriginal culture are Aboriginal people themselves. Government does have a role to play through the funding of organisations such as the Aboriginal Cultural Foundation which does an excellent job of running dance festivals. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Institute of Aboriginal Affairs has, in fact, retained its autonomy. As the honourable senator knows, that was a matter of considerable debate on the Committee. But, as I said before, the right people to be involved in the role of safeguarding and preserving Aboriginal culture and ensuring that it remains as viable as it currently is in many parts of Australia are the Aboriginal people themselves and that is how they see it. The role for Government, so far as Aboriginal people see it, is in providing essential services. It will be on the more efficient delivery of those services that the organisation itself will be judged by the Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hope, along with every member of the Government who is supporting this legislation, that that will be the end result. If it is not, I have no doubt that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will say, as he has said already on numerous occasions in the Parliament, that ATSIC was established in order to benefit Aboriginal people and improve their services and if it turns out to have flaws and failings they will be corrected. I think Gerry Hand himself has been the last person to put the view in this Parliament that ATSIC would be an instant and guaranteed success in solving all the problems of the Aboriginal community in Australia. In fact he has said quite the opposite on a number of occasions. It is a good and honest attempt by this Government to provide real teeth to Aboriginal administration in Australia that it has never had before. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, as Senator Baume knows full well, the major failings of the National Aboriginal Conference (NAC) and the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee (NACC) were that those bodies had no teeth at all and their recommendations were largely ignored by governments of both political persuasions. They were seen in the Aboriginal community as being impotent and useless bodies and that is why there was the profound disinterest in them and their operations and elections that took place in the Northern Territory. I believe that the very feature of the enhanced role of ATSIC in providing hands-on involvement of Aboriginal people in determining how the money is spent will assist ATSIC to be a success. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I acknowledge again that it is a feature of democratic life in this country that whatever we do in the area of Aboriginal affairs is seen by someone as being wrong and misguided and it would be foolish indeed to think that this organisation, with the best will in the world, will escape that sort of criticism. Whatever it does will be seen by some people, not only in this country but inevitably in this Parliament, as being wrong and misguided. What I hope, therefore, is that people will allow ATSIC to operate for at least a year before they start conducting any witchhunts. They should give it a reasonable go. They should not start jumping on its back in this Parliament five minutes after it leaves the starting gate. In the fullness of time, if that is justified, no doubt the opportunities will present themselves, as they always do in Aboriginal affairs, to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> I must explain to the Senate that I have done the very best I can, as someone who got to his feet this evening not intending to say very much, to oblige Senator Tambling in providing the opportunity for Senator Chaney to speak in this debate. With that huge hint, Mr Acting Deputy President, to ensure that you adjourn the Senate at the due time, I say in conclusion that I look forward to the detailed examination of the Bill itself-which is why I did not see fit to canvass it now-that will occur in what will be very prolonged sessions of the committee stage of this debate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As of 30 June 1984, there were 2590 enterprises wholly owned by direct foreign investors and 4264 enterprises in which 25 per cent or more of the equity was held by direct foreign investors. A direct foreign investor is defined to be a foreign resident, individual or enterprise or a group of related foreign enterprises whose shareholding is 25 per cent or more of the enterprise in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Details on the annual turnover of Australian enterprises wholly or partially owned by direct foreign investors are not available.</PARA>
<PARA> Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data on direct foreign equity in enterprises in Australia were discontinued after 30 June 1984 since it was found that little demand existed for this data compared with other demands being made on the Bureau's resources for information on foreign investment.</PARA>
<PARA> It appears that the purpose of the honourable senator's question is to seek information about the extent of participation by foreign companies in the Australian economy. During the 1980s, the ABS has undertaken a series of studies of ownership and control in selected industries and economic activities in Australia. A summary of the results of these surveys is included in the Foreign Investment Review Board Annual Report for 1987-88 and a copy is attached. Further details are contained in the relevant ABS publications.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Both I and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) have received representations from a range of agencies and organisations in Tasmania and mainland Australia expressing concern at the situation.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) A program of ballast sediment sampling by Quarantine staff from overseas vessels entering a number of ports around the mainland of Australia has been introduced. This supplements the sediment sampling from woodchip carriers entering Triabunna in Tasmania which has underpinned work by the CSIRO Marine Laboratories into possible introduction of exotic species into south-east Tasmania waters.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Quarantine Act 1908 sets penalties of $50,000 or imprisonment for 10 years or both for a natural person, or $200,000 for a body corporate for the knowing introduction of harmful organisms. The challenge involved in developing effective controls on ballast water under the Quarantine Act is a substantial one given the estimated 60 million tonnes of discharge annually in Australia and the need to minimise disruption to industries which rely on shipping for bulk commodity exports. A range of control approaches is under development, in consultation with concerned authorities and industry to limit the introduction and spread of organisms toxic to humans. It is intended that these controls be introduced as soon as practicable arrangements are finalised. Additionally, a program of research into the broader problems posed by ballast water discharge, including possible control approaches, is being developed. The Government's concerns in this area and its commitment to action were highlighted in the Prime Minister's Environment Statements in July.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The possible use of the RAAF Base Richmond as Sydney's second airport was examined in the Second Sydney Airport (SSA) Site Selection Program (1983-85).</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Several impediments to the development of Richmond as a major civil aviation facility were identified.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Members of the ADF do not have any general exemption from the provisions of State and Territory liquor licensing laws. Such laws apply according to their terms to members of the ADF in their private capacity or when they are away from ADF establishments.</PARA>
<PARA> However, section 123a of the Defence Act 1903 does exclude the application of State and Territory liquor licensing laws to the possession, sale or consumption of alcohol by members of the ADF at ADF establishments, camps, units, messes and canteens. The main effect of this provision is that ADF messes, clubs etc do not require licences under State and Territory laws and are not regulated by such laws in their operation.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Pursuant to section 123a of the Defence Act 1903 determinations made by both the Chief of Naval Staff and the Chief of Air Staff expressly forbid the sale or provision of intoxicating liquor to a person who has not attained the age of 18 years. Current Army policy is that members who have attained the age of 17 years are permitted to consume alcohol in the appropriate messes or canteens on Defence Force properties. However, this policy is to be reviewed in light of the Army's drug and alcohol policy and is likely to be removed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 31 May 1989 (Hansard page 3114), Senator Watson asked me a question, without notice, concerning the Tasmanian parliamentary accord and its implications for the future of mining in that State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The following is the answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not appropriate for me to speculate on what effect, if any, the Accord will have on the mining industry. With the exception of a number of specific areas identified in the Accord, such as Denison Spires, Hartz Mountains National Park and Little Fisher Valley, the boundaries of any additional areas for gazettal as national park or nomination for World Heritage listing are not defined and are matters which have yet to be considered by the Tasmanian Government.</PARA>
<PARA> It is certainly true that as the currently producing mines are depleted, the mining industry will increasingly depend on new mineral discoveries to remain viable. It is evident from discussions I have had with the Tasmanian Premier, Mr Field, that he is well aware of this. I would expect that in addressing this issue, the Tasmanian Government will strike an appropriate balance between conservation of Tasmania's unique natural heritage and the identification and development of its undoubted mineral resource potential.</PARA>

<PARA> Can the Minister inform the Senate whether it is the intention of the Australian Bureau of Statistics to include questions on the nature and hours of unpaid work in the home and in the community in the 1991 Census? If it is not intended to include this work, which economists estimate to be worth half as much as officially measured gross domestic product, can the Minister explain why?</PARA>
<PARA>The Acting Treasurer has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not intended to include questions on the nature and hours of unpaid work in the home and in the community in the 1991 Census. The collection of reliable information on this topic would be a complex exercise involving a series of inter-related questions to which satisfactory answers could be obtained only through the medium of a specially designed sample survey using trained interviewers. The topic would not be suitable for inclusion in a collection such as the population census which uses self-enumeration methods. Apart from this consideration, it has been necessary to limit the number of questions to be asked in the 1991 Census both for reason of cost and respondent load.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Bureau of Statistics conducted a pilot time use survey in Sydney in 1987 which produced some data relevant to this topic. The results were published in Time Use Pilot Survey, Sydney, May-June 1987 (Catalogue No. 4111.1).</PARA>
