<TITLE>Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</TITLE>
<PARA>This humble petition of certain citizens of Australia respectfully draws the attention of the Senate to the Government's attack on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which has severely affected the viability of our community pharmacies and their ability to provide the quality and quantity of services to which we, as Australians, have a right.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners respectfully request the Senate to urge the Government to guarantee an adequately funded Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, so as to ensure the continued viability of neighbourhood pharmaceutical services through our local community pharmacies.</PARA>

<TITLE>Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled, we the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's attack upon the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has cast grave doubts over the future viability of our community pharmacies and their ability to provide much-needed service to the community, including particularly those in rural areas;</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will further jeopardise the viability of pharmacists;</PARA>
<PARA> The latest decision to slash PBS payments to pharmacists by an average of $1.05 per script is simply unacceptable and will force the closure of many pharmacies.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners respectfully request that the Senate urge the Government to ensure adequate remuneration levels for pharmacists, so that they may be able to provide a high quality health care service which is the right of every citizen of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA> We the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that,</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's population is ageing and most people require more health services as they grow older.</PARA>
<PARA> if open not-for-profit health Funds are to be able to meet the costs of providing benefits to their older members at affordable rates, they need to share these costs equitably.</PARA>
<PARA> some health insurance organisations are being allowed to avoid meeting the health costs of sick and elderly people.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The members of the Australian Armed Forces who served in Vietnam from 1962 to 1973 did so with distinction, valour and professionalism, upholding the traditions of the Armed Forces.</PARA>
<PARA> After World War 2 and the Korean War the Australian Government approved an End of War List of Gallantry Medals for individual acts of bravery that were not rewarded during wartime.</PARA>
<PARA> The Whitlam Government refused to approve such an End of War List at the end of the Vietnam War.</PARA>
<PARA> Your humble petitioners pray that</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government reverse the decision of the Whitlam Government and thus approve an End of War List for the Australian Armed Forces personnel that served in Vietnam.</PARA>

<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>The Honourable President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA> Medicare cannot pretend to be a Universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access to items 6469, 274 and 275 on the medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners humbly pray and request that the Senate will vote against any attempt to restrict access to abortion or any abortion-related items on the Medicare schedule.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>THERAPEUTIC GOODS BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to provide, so far as the Constitution permits, for the establishment and maintenance of a national system of controls relating to the quality, safety and efficacy of therapeutic goods that are supplied in Australia, whether those goods are produced in Australia or elsewhere, or are exported from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will bring together and strengthen various pieces of Commonwealth legislation to provide protection to consumers of therapeutic goods and to assist Australian industry both locally and internationally. </PARA>
<PARA> Therapeutic goods are those goods for use for the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of diseases and other bodily conditions or which can be taken to be for such a use through advertising and other means. These goods cover a vast array of products ranging from those that have become essential to maintain the standards of health and well being which we have come to expect to those that are merely for our convenience. </PARA>
<PARA> The range includes substances extracted from biological sources such as vaccines and antibiotics, the large range of chemically made pharmaceutical products which we see in pharmacies, test kits for the diagnosis of diseases such as dip sticks to monitor urinary sugar, and a diversity of other therapeutic devices ranging from cyclotrons to contact lenses to bedpans. </PARA>
<PARA> At the present time it is estimated that on the Australian market there are over 14,000 medicinal drug products and perhaps 25,000 therapeutic devices. This is an estimate because currently many products can enter our marketplace without prior recording or scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> Several factors have influenced the average life expectancy at birth of the Australian population, which has increased by 15 years over the past 65 years. Improved sanitation, improved education about health issues leading to changes in personal habits and improved nutrition have all contributed to this increase. What is clear, however, is that the availability of modern therapeutic goods has played a major beneficial role in modifying the impacts and outcomes of illnesses and contributed greatly to the quality of the life which individuals now enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA> Many therapeutic goods are, in effect, man made supplements to the body's own mechanics to maintain its health status. However this manipulation of the still poorly understood and immensely complex checks and balances that occur in the body involves a substantial risk factor. One has only to consider the personal catastrophies caused by thalidomide, when it was given to pregnant women, to realise that there is a narrow margin for many therapeutic goods between benefit and risk or, put another way, for a drug to be either a medicine or a poison. In the same way a poorly made or designed device may be a hazard rather than a help. The potential damage is compounded by the huge international scale of mass production and distribution of therapeutic goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Three parameters are used to define the acceptability of a product for therapeutic use. </PARA>
<PARA> The first is its quality which refers to aspects such as its proper manufacture, the trueness of the contents to the label and its compliance with any relevant product standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The second parameter is its safety, that is its lack of toxicity or hazard or at least that the product has an acceptable level of risk compared to the expected benefits when it is used as directed. This aspect is often demonstrated from animal experiments and the information must be assessed in relation to how and why the product will be used. Surveillance for unwanted effects must also continue after a product has been marketed. </PARA>
<PARA> The third parameter is the product's efficacy, or its effectiveness in fulfilling its intended purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course other social and economic considerations follow from these product specific aspects, considerations such as the need for the product and its cost. These are not covered in this legislation but for drug products are matters dealt with by the Department of Community Services and Health primarily through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the National Health Act. Together, consideration of these factors make the major contribution toward the rational use of therapeutic goods. </PARA>
<PARA> While Therapeutic Goods are used in both humans and animals, the Bill deals primarily with those Therapeutic Goods for human use. It complements the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act that deals with products for veterinary use and which comes within the jurisdiction of my colleague, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. </PARA>
<PARA> Many Therapeutic Goods are used on or in humans, with the individual patient often having little choice about whether or not to use the product, or being able, by themselves, to assess the benefits of its use against the risks. The complexity of Therapeutic Goods, the diversity and size of the industry and the real risks represented by many products are such that self regulation by the industry is not sufficient. </PARA>
<PARA> In recognition of these circumstances Therapeutic Goods are, worldwide, subject to a relatively high level of control. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides a standard of regulation that is recognised internationally as being necessary to control Therapeutic Goods and which will bring Australia into line with the levels of product assurances exercised and required by its major trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill includes the three major elements recommended by the World Health Organisation as being necessary for effective regulation and which are utilized by several European Countries, Britain, USA, Japan and Canada. </PARA>
<PARA> First is premarket assessment of products for human use, this being an independent assessment of the manufacturer's data on the product. The Bill permits the assessment of new products prior to inclusion of the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly is the assurance that good manufacturing practices are followed in the manufacture of the Therapeutic products for human use. Although a product may be judged to be of an acceptable standard and would appear safe and efficacious on the basis of the premarket evaluation, the standard of manufacture may be so inadequate that there can be no assurance of its quality or consistency on a batch to batch basis once it has entered the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill requires that most Australian manufacturers are regularly inspected by authorised inspectors for compliance with codes of good manufacturing practice as a prerequisite for holding a licence to manufacture Therapeutic Goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly is compliance with set standards for Therapeutic Goods for human and animal use. The Bill contains provisions for setting standards and provide for regulations for the independent sampling and analysis of goods on the market. </PARA>
<PARA> All parties (Government, Industry, Professional Organisations and Consumer Groups), agree on the validity of these means of protecting the public from unacceptable products. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is designed to replace the current potpourri of State, Territory and Commonwealth Legislation which has evolved in a largely unco-ordinated manner over the years, resulting in both disturbing overlaps in controls and unacceptable gaps. The current situation neither adequately protects the public nor benefits the industry. The Bill does not in general greatly increase the current levels of Legislation but will remedy identified unacceptable gaps. </PARA>
<PARA> An example of the gaps is the lack of comprehensive licensing of manufacturers. In the 1960's it was agreed that the Commonwealth would provide a pool of expert factory inspectors and that the States would licence manufacturers of Therapeutic Goods on the basis of the inspections. </PARA>
<PARA> To date only one State has a comprehensive licensing system and recent evidence that the Department of Community Services and Health gave to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts revealed that many manufacturers do not have an acceptable standard of manufacture. The fragmented licensing controls have meant that Australia has been refused membership of international inspection agreements through which we could gain information on the standard of manufacture of imported products and which would assist reputable Australian exporters to enter overseas markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Another example of the current inadequate situation, is the lack of scrutiny of locally made products. This is because the Commonwealth powers to carry out comprehensive premarket evaluations of products currently rely on the provisions of the Customs Act 1901 which apply only to imported products. </PARA>
<PARA> The Therapeutic Goods Bill 1989 will rectify these deficiencies. It utilises the Commonwealth heads of power over corporations, interstate trade, and imports and exports. It will change the focus of control from the point of import to the point of supply and will provide a substantially uniform, national system of controls. </PARA>
<PARA> Industry and consumers alike will benefit from the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> For the industry the controls will protect the good reputation of reputable Australian manufacturers by weeding out unacceptable manufacturers and products. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will apply similar requirements to locally manufactured and imported goods and many of the costly and frustrating differences in requirements that currently exist within Australia should disappear. The standing of, and confidence in, Australian exports will, I am sure, increase and we will be able to enter cooperative arrangements with other governments and regulatory authorities. This is essential, so that we can compete in overseas markets, for instance, in the environment of the 1992 proposed European Community's trade agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> Consumers will have the protection and peace of mind of knowing that new therapeutic goods, both locally made and imported, can be subject to scrutiny before approval for supply and that the products will have been manufactured to acceptable standards. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now give more detail on the major aspects of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains provisions to establish standards for quality for therapeutic goods and it will provide for the uniform application of those standards to imported, exported and locally produced products both for human and animal use. </PARA>
<PARA> The British Pharmacopoeia and the British Pharmacopoeia (Veterinary) will automatically be adopted as the primary sources of standards. These represent sets of standards, mainly for medicinal drugs, which are recognised internationally. Uniformity of standards between countries is desirable to facilitate international trade and assists the Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also has provision for establishing national standards by ministerial determinations which are called therapeutic goods orders. Therapeutic goods orders are developed by a committee established by the regulations, the Therapeutic Goods Committee, which has industry and consumer representation. The Committee must advise the Minister on any proposed standard or changes to standards. </PARA>
<PARA> National standards are required where there is an identified and proven need and where a suitable international standard does not exist. These can be created by adopting standards from other sources such as other pharmacopoeias or, in the case of therapeutic devices, standards developed by the Standards Association of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains provision to establish the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. Inclusion in the Register will represent approval for supply. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be an offence to supply therapeutic goods in Australia or to export therapeutic goods from Australia unless the goods are included on the register or have been specifically exempted from this requirement by the regulations to the bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The register will be divided into two parts, one part for registered goods and the other part for listed goods. Registered goods will require evaluation by my department prior to approval for supply, the degree of evaluation being related to the perceived risks of that class of goods. This will include products such as prescription drugs, new medicinal chemicals and those therapeutic devices regarded as presenting significant risks to the patient. </PARA>
<PARA> Where possible existing expertise in the states will be utilised in the national system. For example, negotiations are well advanced to contract the Victorian Proprietary Medicines Advisory Committee to carry out evaluations of many non-prescription drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> The other part of the register will be for listed goods. Listed goods will be those which by their nature and history of use represent a low risk, and which will be included in the register subject to compliance with standards and some other requirements relating to quality and batch related safety, rather than a full evaluation. </PARA>
<PARA> Included in this group will be most of the herbal products, the more concentrated homoeopathic products, vitamin and mineral products and most therapeutic devices. </PARA>
<PARA> The regulations will exempt certain products from the requirement for prior approval for supply. These products include simple pharmaceutical formulations for external application and therapeutic devices which are seen as presenting no greater risk than consumer goods in every day use. Also exempted are personal imports, that is, products for a person's own use or use by the immediate family, which are produced overseas and not available in Australia, provided the products are not injections or are not specifically prohibited. However, the current conditions for a personal import will be tightened to include a limit on the quantity imported of three months supply at the maximum dose of a medicinal drug recommended by the manufacturer. If it becomes evident that this exemption is being abused it may be necessary at a later stage to amend this exemption. </PARA>
<PARA> Special provisions will also apply to goods not on the register which are for use in treatment of specific individuals where other treatments have failed and to products for use in clinical trials. </PARA>
<PARA> Although these goods will be exempt from inclusion in the register, the bill contains specific requirements for their supply. </PARA>
<PARA> Products legally on the market at the time of commencement of the legislation will be entitled to immediate entry into the register following application by the sponsor. Many of those will not have been evaluated and it is proposed to evaluate relevant products in this ``grandfathered'' category if the need arises, or selectively as resources in my department permit. </PARA>
<PARA> It is possible that some products which have previously been rejected by the Victorian Proprietary Medicines Advisory Committee yet which are legally sold on the Australian market will be grandfathered. It is intended that these products will be reviewed as quickly as possible to decide whether each should remain on the register. </PARA>
<PARA> The regulations will continue the existing expert committees which will advise the Secretary and the Minister on matters primarily dealing with the premarket evaluation of products. </PARA>
<PARA> These committees are the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee and the Therapeutic Device Evaluation Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The other major part of the bill is the provision to license Australian manufacturers. The issue of a licence will depend upon compliance with the Australian codes of good manufacturing practice which are of an equivalent standard to the codes of other major countries. A manufacturer's licence will be issued to cover a range of products which the manufacturer has sufficient expertise to produce. </PARA>
<PARA> Manufacturers of certain imported goods will be required to provide evidence of their compliance with acceptable codes of GMP in the country of origin. </PARA>
<PARA> The appeal provisions within the legislation allow for internal review of decisions with ultimate appeal to the administrative appeals tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The details of the bill have been the subject of wide consultation with industry, industry associations, consumer groups, professional and practitioner groups and State and Territory governments. The original proposal for the legislation has been substantially modified to take into account the comments my department has received. </PARA>
<PARA> With the passage of the Bill, many of those provisions in the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations which are currently used to control the import and distribution of therapeutic goods will be revoked. Similarly the act and its regulations will replace the current Therapeutic Goods Act 1966 and its regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> It is expected that the States and Territories will implement complementary legislation to cover products and the few manufacturers which are not encompassed by the Commonwealth controls, for example, unincorporated manufacturers who do not trade interstate. Model legislation will be presented to the States and Territories which would effect this. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Community Services and Health has the expertise and infrastructure to implement the provisions of the bill. In fact Australia has gained international respect for its performance in this area. The department employs product evaluators, factory inspectors for good manufacturing practice, and incorporates laboratories which carry out post marketing testing of therapeutic goods. Some increases in staff resources will be required and these have been agreed to by Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> Cabinet has approved a fee structure that will recover from the industry half of the costs of the therapeutics program. The cost of the program was about $30 million in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The most substantial fees will be for the evaluation of products for registration and for the inspection and licensing of manufacturers. Fees will be associated with defined standards of service and the utilisation of the revenue from fees will be reviewed by a joint industry-government committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation will not only provide the means to protect the Australian public from substandard, unsafe and ineffective products but will assist the Australian industry in maintaining a local and international reputation for quality products. </PARA>
<PARA> For the first time, this legislation will provide Australia with uniform, national and comprehensive controls for therapeutic goods. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts in its recent investigation of the Therapeutic Goods Program expressed particular concern about the present lack of such controls. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this legislation to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>THERAPEUTIC GOODS (CHARGES) BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill forms part of the package dealing with therapeutic goods and the background is set out in the second reading speech to the Therapeutic Goods Bill 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the bill is to impose annual charges on the registration and listing of therapeutic goods and on the licensing of manufacturers in Australia of therapeutic goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Details of the scale of charges will be finalised and established in regulations after further consultation with the therapeutic goods industry through a joint industry-government committee that has been approved by Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> The scale of fees and charges under both bills will be such as to recover half of the costs of the therapeutic goods program from the industry. The program cost about $30 million in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this legislation to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1989-90 and cognate Bills which gives us an opportunity to discuss a wide range of issues. Last night I was discussing the plight of Australia's pharmacists. Today it is very appropriate for me to reintroduce this matter in debate in the Senate. Today, 1 November 1989, is a day that I believe the Government will live to regret. As Senator Macklin pointed out, the pharmacy decision is economically irresponsible and socially inappropriate. There is absolutely no point to any agreement that was used to determine the Government's decision on pharmacists. This decision will not have any benefit at all in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has conducted a continued and sustained attack upon the pharmacists since 1988. Today that continued attack has reached a conclusion that could result in one-third of Australia's chemists going out of business. A number of notices of motion condemning the Government's actions were given today in the Senate by the Liberal and National parties and the Australian Democrats. The Government's draconian decision has been universally condemned for the hardship that it will inflict on Australian pharmacists. The decision to introduce a 23 per cent cut in pharmacists' income is beyond belief. It is acknowledged that every other industry and every other professional in Australia has received minimum fee rises of 6 per cent. Yet today, 1 November 1989, the Government is reducing pharmacists' incomes across Australia by 23 per cent. This is the most irrational decision that this Government has ever brought before the Parliament. It is irrational because it tells the pharmacists of Australia that they must maintain their businesses but receive no mark-up. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one on the Labor side has ever produced any evidence on how a business can be run successfully with absolutely no profit margin. Today we have come the final track, after months of fighting by the chemists, where the decision has been taken. I say to those chemists who are listening that in two or three or four months this Government will be swept out of office. The writing is on the wall. The polls are indicating that the Government is on the nose. The headlines in the press are stating that the Government is in disarray. There are conflicting statements between various Ministers commenting on tax cuts and other issues. Ministers are making statements across their portfolios which is a sign of a government in disarray. </PARA>
<PARA> Many chemists today will be thinking of what they will do to sustain their business, what business decision they will have to make: whether they will have to improve the merchandising section of their shops; whether that will be sufficient to maintain their profitability; whether they will have to put staff off; whether they will have to reduce overheads or whether they just simply will have to close down. These are decisions that today will be running through the minds of the chemists of Australia: How will they cope? The message I can give to those people is: not to abandon hope because when-I say `when', not `if'-this Government goes out of office in the next two, three or four months or whenever it is, the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia will introduce a pharmaceutical benefits scheme that will be fair and equitable and that will allow a reasonable profit margin. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is certainly more than the Government is offering which is exactly zero; not even a 1c mark-up. It is interesting to note that not only is this Government in disarray but also its State colleagues are coming out heavily against it in the press on this decision. When we have State parties in opposition to the Federal party, it is a sign that a government has very little time to exist. Mr Comben, who is the Labor Party health spokesman in Queensland, has put out a press statement dissociating himself from the Federal Government's decision. He says that it is unfair and inequitable and that a Queensland Labor Government will have nothing whatsoever to do with the Federal Government's decision on reducing pharmacists' benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But that is the Queensland Labor Party. Labor parties are all tarred with the one brush in their absolute non-recognition of the part that small business plays in Australia. One of the things that I mentioned last night-it bears repeating-that has been of significance in this campaign is the Government's continued attacks on the pharmacists of Australia to denigrate their high standing in the community. It has not been a fair attack. It has been an attack by misinformation funded out of Consolidated Revenue by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have seen a number of issues come forward daily in an attempt to denigrate the high standing that pharmacists have in the community of Australia. The first attack was an article entitled `Is your local chemist leading you down the garden path?' which appeared three or four weeks ago. Then a brochure was put out entitled `The truth and nothing but the truth about the cost and supply of prescription medicines'. In my opinion the brochure had some anomalies in it. One of those anomalies was that it said that this year the pharmaceutical benefits scheme will cost Australia more than $1,500m and that more than $600m will go straight to chemists. The Budget Papers show a deficiency in this area of something like $260m. So, the Government has overestimated in the Budget Papers what the pharmaceutical benefits allowances are by something like $260m. </PARA>
<PARA> The conclusion one can draw from that is that either the Government is misleading the public or, alternatively, it is administering the pharmaceutical benefits scheme abysmally. I suspect that the former is the case. A disgraceful letter went out to all members of the Labor Party, telling them that chemists are greedy and stupid and that they are no better than the pilots. That is a shocking indictment of any Minister. Any Minister who is prepared to make an attack like that on the pharmacists of Australia should be removed from office. It was a disgraceful attack and I am sure that privately every member of the Government wishes that the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) had not made such a boo-boo in putting that in writing. He might have felt it, but his approach was very ham-fisted, to say the least, in putting that type of proposition in writing, and it is a disgrace to this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Only the other day we were told that the findings of a Morgan research poll had shown chemists were overcharging, but when we asked for details of that research program we were told we could not have them. We were told that it was a private research program. We do not know what questions were asked. I have made inquiries of the chemists and they have informed me that there is no agreed price structure, that the agreement has lapsed. They have told the Government that, and they are entitled to charge any price that they wish, as long as the product is not on the pensioner benefits or unemployment benefits list. Over the past month we have continually seen this Government putting the boot into the chemists. The chemists are outraged, and rightfully so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Madam Acting Deputy President. I will pick up another point that Senator Boswell made in his speech yesterday. He referred to the dropping and disappearing fortunes of Senator Maguire who seems to have started high on the speaking list but progressively has dropped down the list. He will probably slip off the list. I see that his name appears as the fourth speaker after me. I would not be surprised if Senator Maguire slipped off the list. He is a South Australian and South Australia is preparing for an election. It has now entered the stage of damage control. The best damage control that that State could implement would be to keep Senator Maguire from talking. He is a walking mistake. He is a walking problem. I hope he has the courage to defend his Government's economic policies in here and not slip off the list altogether. We are discussing the Appropriation Bills. The coalition proposes to move an extensive amendment in relation to the legislation. I will read the full text of that proposed amendment. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of motion, add: ``, but the Senate notes that:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) the level of Australia's net foreign debt has risen from $23.4 billion to $108 billion during the life of the Hawke/Keating Government;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) during the same period Australia has suffered two significant downgradings of its international credit rating by both major international credit rating agencies;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) because of the failed Accord with the ACTU, Australia's inflation rate is now at 8.3 per cent and rising;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw. I make an unqualified withdrawal. I use the words `misrepresentations by the Prime Minister'. Now I will settle down to the substance of my speech. In making the misrepresentation, the Prime Minister had great difficulty in the other House convincing one of his own colleagues, his Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, Mr Holding, that there was no dispute any more. Mr Holding mentioned the pilots dispute on four occasions in answer to another question. Quite evidently, the Prime Minister cannot convince his own Ministers, let alone any Australian, that there is not a pilots dispute. But this has always been the Government of great misrepresentations. We do not have to go too far back to recall the other misrepresentations of the Government. The Prime Minister's election promise to eliminate child poverty in this country by 1990 was a gross misrepresentation, as was his promise to plant one billion trees in the next decade.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that in both election years he would have said there would be no capital gains tax. Of course, that promise was followed with the introduction of that tax. The greatest misrepresentation of this Government has been its assertion that it is a sound economic manager. The truth about the Government is that its members are the most professional and talented snake oil salesmen since Federation. While the Labor parliamentarians have slithered around in the past seven years, this country has been taken to the brink of economic crisis and collapse unequalled at any time in Australia's history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The single most important challenge facing Australia in the next decade is our foreign debt. It must seem incredible to the rest of the world that this lucky country that has such great potential and such great wealth is now placed in such a vulnerable position. Unless Australia can stabilise its foreign debt, we will continue to be a country in permanent decline. It is said by many that the foreign debt problem does not affect them as they have taken out no foreign loans. However, it has to be understood that when looking at the foreign debt we are not singling out the single debt taker or any one of a thousand transactions; rather, we are taking Australia as one and calculating the state of the whole nation's debt. The state of the nation in the medium to long term affects the individual. </PARA>
<PARA> The most potent indicator of the effect of foreign debt upon the individual is interest rates. Any borrower whose debt increases will find that the risk of repayment is built into the interest rate factor by the lender. No-one should doubt, therefore, that the world financial markets view Australia as an economy in decline, a country that is badly managed and which is a high risk. It is precisely because of the speed, size and growth of that foreign debt, coupled with the growing balance of payments problem, that the international credit rating agencies such as Moody's Investors Service and Standard and Poor's have downgraded our rating. </PARA>
<PARA> Moody's first downgraded Australia's credit rating in 1986 from AAA to AA1. The response of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to that downgrading was simply to say that he did not believe that the second rating agency, Standard and Poor's, would follow. On 3 December 1986, it did follow Moody's and downgraded our rating from AAA to AA+. The second downgrading by both these agencies occurred recently. Although the Treasurer refused to give the Moody's credit agency access to Reserve Bank officials and other government officials during the course of its review, it was still able to judge that Australia's credit rating was at risk. The Treasurer declared again that he did not believe that the Standard and Poor's credit rating agency would follow Moody's second downgrading. He believed it was a far more professional organisation and a far more knowledgeable one. On 25 October, that professional and knowledgeable organisation downgraded Australia's rating from AA+ to AA. This embarrassing saga of a very desperate Treasurer signals not only to the world markets but to the Australian people that the big misrepresentation is no longer working. The truth of Australia's economic situation is apparent to all except the Treasurer. After all, he is practising the great misrepresentation. </PARA>
<PARA> When Labor came to office in 1983, Australia's net foreign debt totalled $23.3 billion or 13 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP). Yet, by the end of June 1989, that figure had exploded to $108 billion or 32 per cent of GDP. Nearly 20 per cent of our export income is required to meet that debt. Yet, 10 years ago only 5 per cent of our export income was required. </PARA>
<PARA> Another significant factor about foreign debt is that the maturity rate of the debt has been decreasing. Seventy-five per cent of new debt has a maturity rate of less than three months. Thirty per cent of the total debt has a maturity rate of less than 12 months. Australia has the third highest external debt to overseas private banks behind only Brazil and Mexico. However, in aligning Australia with those Third World countries it should be said that Australia is a far different country from Brazil, Mexico, Argentina or any other South American country. Australia has a far greater wealth base and a far more stable political system. In many respects Australia cannot be compared with those unstable Third World countries and their disastrous economic state. Unless we lift ourselves from the debt trap into which we have locked ourselves, unquestionably we will drift towards their particular state. Sadly, one of the most prominent features of those Third World countries is their great extremes of wealth-the ghetto living. To this point in Australia to a great degree we have been able to avoid those extremes. </PARA>
<PARA> Because Australia has a strong political system and a firm foundation of wealth, it is possible very quickly to turn around the economic malaise in which we find ourselves. That is why Australia is the lucky country. We are able to turn things around very quickly before they get too bad. But time is running out. We need a government that will face up to the truth of our economic problems. This Government is incapable of doing so. In contrast, the coalition parties have learned from the past. They have the will, the courage and the dynamic policies to take on Australia's daunting economic problems. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most immediate causes of our foreign debt problem has been the escalation of the current account deficit, which is now running at an annual rate of $23 billion. The Budget forecast was $18 billion. Four major factors have contributed to our current account crisis: low productivity; a shortage of domestic savings in relation to investment; high inflation; and excessive interest rates. I wish to address the subject of productivity as it links with micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> If Australia is to trade its way out of its current account crisis it is essential to ensure a much closer link with wages and productivity. If Australia is to compete successfully with its trading partners on the world markets, we have no choice other than to improve the productivity of our work places, ports, transport, and commodity handling facilities. The first place that we should start is the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> Tackling the waterfront is not a new problem. Since World War II, as many as 12 inquiries have been conducted into the waterfront practices. The latest inquiry by the Industries Assistance Commission estimates that a 20 per cent improvement in labour productivity in the water transport industry as a whole, combined with a faster turnaround of ships in port, would produce an initial cost saving of $860m. This would lead to an increase of over $1 billion in gross domestic product in the long run. Even armed with those statistics, the Government has failed to address this area of badly needed micro-economic reform. Its solution on the one hand just happens to be to accept the dictates of the waterside workers boss, Tas Bull, and undertake more negotiations and more waffle while, on the other hand, it is to pay out $150m to waterside workers. The Government's program of reform in the waterside industry is nothing but a farce. Quite frankly, and quite simply, we need to smash the monopoly union power that the waterside workers hold over Australian docks. </PARA>
<PARA> The deal with the waterside workers is part of the Government's new policy in tackling our current account deficit. That policy simply is, `Let's make a deal until the next election and hang the costs to taxpayers'. The Government has made a deal with the banks at a cost to taxpayers of $200m; the Government has made a deal with Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd which will cost taxpayers a now trimmed amount of $36m; the Government has made a deal with the airlines at a cost to taxpayers which we estimate to be $100m-but who knows as the dispute goes on, and I am willing to call it a dispute-and the Government has made a deal with the green movement, costing this country $600m, not to go ahead with the mining of Coronation Hill. Under any economic analysis every one of those deals is wrong in principle and economically unsound. Under any economic analysis they are nothing but short-term political measures that do no more than plug the holes in the Government's leaking policy agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also failed to tackle another form of micro-economic reform; that is, privatisation. The privatisation of public enterprises is a very important area of economic reform. The Government has no policy on privatisation; there is a split Cabinet and a split party. This contrasts with the coalition parties which have a very extensive policy on the privatisation of public enterprises. We believe that the privatisation program is well overdue, a decade overdue, in this country. The rate of return on capital investment in many public trading enterprises is significantly lower than what could be achieved in private enterprise. The coalition has targeted several bodies for privatisation: Australian Airlines, Qantas Airways Ltd, Aussat Pty Ltd, Australian National Line and Medibank Private, to name a few. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important area that the Government must get down to tackling in any sort of program for micro-economic reform is Australia's road transport system. A high standard road system is important for the efficient transporting of our export commodities as well as the maintaining of safety standards for the general public. The Government has failed to meet both of these criteria. Federal funding to the States for roads has been cut in real terms since 1984-85 by 27 per cent; yet incredibly, on the revenue side, the Government has increased its revenue take by 156 per cent by indexing the fuel excise. The fuel excise has risen from 6c per litre in March 1983 to 23c per litre in August 1989. In dollar terms, that is an increase of $970m in 1983 to a staggering take of $5.6 billion in 1989. Yet in real terms the Government is returning only 5c per litre to road funding. That is the lowest level since the Second World War. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, we will. We will spend a great deal more than that. We have a policy which will be released in the near future, something that we in the coalition are very proud of and something that the National Party has worked hard and strong on. We know that road funding is an issue, particularly in country Australia. We have a policy which, at the next election, we will be able to flag around to shame the Government, particularly in country Australia. The amount will be substantially more than the existing 5c per litre.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Apart from contributing to serious accidents, death and injury, bad roads do have an indirect cost impact. They add to food and community bills by increasing road freight costs. They contribute to vehicle maintenance costs. Anyone in country Australia will identify with that. They contribute to increased delays and traffic jams, and many a holiday-maker will identify with that. While Labor cuts road funding in real terms, the pressure on the road system continues to increase. Seventy per cent of domestic trade is carried by road. Between 1982 and 1985 road cargo haulage increased by 25 per cent, and is expected to double by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the situation is best summed up by the General Manager of the National Roads and Motorists Association, Richard Cox, in a press statement on 17 April 1989. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Roads are in an appalling condition, and getting worse. Everyone can see that except, for some strange reason, members of the Federal Government; they refuse even to acknowledge there is a problem. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government does not have a micro-economic reform policy. It has dismissed micro-economic reform as a lever of policy. It is just simply too hard for it. Yesterday we saw the collapse to the Government's macro-economic policy lever when the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) was reported as announcing a $5.8 billion wages-tax trade-off with the Australian Council of Trade Unions before the next election. It has previously been confirmed by Mr Kelty himself that there is a wage-tax deal in the air-but it is an unfunded deal. That is the difference between this Government's policies and our policies. </PARA>
<PARA> It is evident that the Government has decided to eat away into its Budget surplus in a vain attempt to match the coalition's funded Economic Action Plan. The $5.8 billion unfunded wages-tax deal completely throws out the Government's monetary policy, which was once the centre of its economic policy. The Government is completely drained white now of any policies except that of making deals-sectional industrial deals, union deals, party factional deals and ministerial deals-and each month the current account deficit is exploding to the tune of billions. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is disintegrating; we are witnessing the last term of the Hawke Labor Government. The Minister knows it. It is almost as pitiful a sight as the fall of Saigon. I can imagine the ministerial front bench scrambling for the helicopter to get out of here. But unquestionably the Treasurer will be found in Paris before any of them can get out, and those senators left behind will witness a very determined and dynamic coalition government which has learnt from the past. What we have learnt is that never again will we allow the opportunities to be lost in implementing our policies, our beliefs and our ideologies. </PARA>

The great tragedy is that this strike need not be where it is and ought not be where it is. The tragedy is that from the very outset the Government took a proprietary interest in it, became one of the players, one of the actors, and took on a role so as to make it one of the parties to the dispute. If it was not for the fact, rightly or wrongly, that the Government is using taxpayers' money for the benefit of the shareholders of Ansett Airlines and Australian Airlines, the strike would not be where it is now.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not what the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding) says. Yesterday, he said several times that there was a dispute. To my knowledge, this is the first time in history that one of the parties to industrial disputation has been funded by the Government for the purpose of ensuring not only that it succeeds but also that the dispute continues until such time as the terms and conditions set down by that party prevail-and not through proper and sensible negotiations, or even within the dubious framework of the Government's accord.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One might ask: Who is the first beneficiary of the compensation that is being paid? We hear these crude, dishonest attacks on the Federal President of the Liberal Party, John Elliott, and these unsubstantiated claims, by Mr Keating, which are now the subject of debate in the other place. But one need not look past disputation to see who one of the beneficiaries is. It is Sir Peter Abeles, the Prime Minister's best mate, somebody who owns something like five million shares in Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd. As a result of the largess of this Government, as a result of an agreement directly entered into by Sir Peter Abeles with the Prime Minister, he is receiving a direct benefit. That has guaranteed that this strike continues. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth of the matter is that, from the airlines' point of view, this dispute is not simply about a pay claim; it is allowing the airlines to restructure for a deregulated environment in which they are able to drop off, as they have already, the less profitable routes which, until now, have been too politically difficult to jettison. It is being done to provide the airlines with a capacity to be more competitive within a deregulated market and to compete on an equal footing with the new airlines that are likely to come on stream. The parties to the dispute are in the trenches as much as anything because of the conduct of the Prime Minister, who thought he was going to have a quick, precise and clean victory. That is why we heard originally his inflammatory words which stimulated and escalated the dispute through his intemperate language and his own personal involvement when he said about the pilots:</PARA>
<PARA>We are not going to allow a situation where a small, greedy, powerful group of already privileged people are going to smash the (wages) system. </PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am not going to allow the economy of this country to be destroyed by the avaricious demands of a federation which says they are different from everyone else. </PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting how the same person can have different thoughts in different situations. In the 1970s Mr Hawke stoutly defended the pilots when claims were made against them that they were greedy, avaricious and selfish, only thinking of their own good and nobody else's. The present Prime Minister, then the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), stoutly defended the pilots in all their claims. In 1974 the same Prime Minister led the push for Qantas Airways Ltd pilots to receive a salary increase of 29 per cent. The same Prime Minister as President of the ACTU sought an 18 per cent increase in the total national wage. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1974 Trans Australia Airlines (TAA), as it was then called, agreed to give its 600 pilots a 24 per cent pay increase to bring them in line with the Ansett pilots, who had already received that increase. The increase given by TAA followed the Australian Council of Trade Unions threat to ground both TAA and Ansett. Mr Hawke threatened to ground both airlines if the 24 per cent increase was not granted. When the Government of the time had the audacity to interfere-when Charlie Jones stood up and said `Hey, this is not on'-the ACTU President, Mr Hawke, phoned the then Prime Minister and warned him about interfering. He said it was not the role of the Government. Things have been very different, have they not?</PARA>
<PARA> When the then Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Cameron, interceded and said that he was totally opposed to the excess demands of the Qantas pilots, Mr Hawke, the present Prime Minister, said he:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . found it difficult to understand how a Minister on $30,000 a year could be so strongly opposed to wage increases for pilots. </PARA>
<PARA>A Boeing 707 pilot then was receiving $28,000 a year. The newspaper report continues:</PARA>

But here we had the present Prime Minister saying in 1974 that pilots on $28,000 a year were worth a great deal more than a Minister of the Crown who was earning $2,000 extra. At that stage the pilots were seeking a 27 per cent increase. Mr Hawke thought that was a jolly good idea.

<PARA>What a change we have seen. Profitability does not matter now for Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd, Ansett or any other corporation. That is not the measure of sharing in productivity and wealth. It is quite different now. In 1975, because Utah was a wealthy company with profits going overseas, there was justification for the employees to receive the indulgence of the increased wages I have referred to. </PARA>
<PARA> When Don Chipp interviewed his long lost mate, the present Prime Minister, on his radio program on 3AK he said by way of a rhetorical question that the 30 per cent demand was outside the guidelines, that it would be the end of the accord and that there would be a wage breakout the like of which has not been seen since 1974. He was audacious enough to say 1974. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>That's right, although 1981 . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He was interrupted by Chipp who said:</PARA>
<PARA>That was the last one, but the '74 breakout was caused by a pilot . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The present Prime Minister, stuttering and stammering and falling over his microphone, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Well it was '74, . . . but you had the breakout in '81. </PARA>
<PARA>And away he went. He did not want to remember 1974 because he was the architect, the engineer, the powerhouse, the designer who was responsible for the 1974 wage breakout because he supported a 29.4 per cent increase by the pilots. He wanted to forget all that and remember 1981, when Malcolm Fraser was the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we see? We see gross hypocrisy. It depends what constituency he is playing to. When talking to John Jost the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>All of us John are the product of our history. </PARA>
<PARA>We certainly are; the pilots certainly are. They have got used to the idea of getting 29 per cent, ringing up a President of the ACTU and saying, `This looks like a pretty good deal to me; I think we are worth 29.4 per cent', and the President of the ACTU saying, `You are absolutely right; it is disgraceful that people should call you avaricious, greedy, self-serving and single minded. You are absolutely right'. Of course, they are creatures of their own history. Who was the genius that led the fight that guaranteed in the arbitration court that the pilots got the 29.4 per cent? It was the knight in shining armour-Robert Hawke. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Now these people are the product of a history where in the past where they've gone in and had a fight, pretty soon either Ansett or TAA . . . have caved in. Now that's their history and that's the sort of fight they think they will go into if they go on with this. Well let me tell them it's a different fight they're going into. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the reason that Hawke intervened in the last disputation with the pilots was that his mate at Ansett, Abeles, who could just ring up the Government and say, `Stick up the air fares, will you, I have just given an increase in salaries', caved in. TAA did not want to cave in. The Government Minister, Charlie Jones, did not want to cave in. The Prime Minister did not want to cave in. Hawke said that it was wrong for the Government to interfere in an agreement and a negotiation that had been entered into, told the Government to butt out and said that the pilots were entitled to the same flow-on award that had been given by his mate Peter Abeles, who is now receiving in his own pocket the benefit of tens of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA> He is the single largest shareholder on the board of directors of TNT, which owns 50 per cent of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. Bob Hawke's mate is getting taxes from the Treasury courtesy of the Prime Minister as a result of an agreement negotiated and entered into between the two in the Prime Minister's office: `Now, listen, Bob, I will stick with you, your politics, your agreement and your arrangements, provided you allow me to reorganise, restructure and re-arrange my organisation and operation to make myself more efficient in preparation for deregulation and provided you just slip me a few million of taxpayers' money--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course I will. I was referring to the authorised biography written in collusion and collaboration with the Prime Minister. I am certainly not suggesting that he is capable now of having alcoholic remorse; certainly not. The truth is that, at a time when there has to be wage restraint, when we are told that the pilots are demanding a salary increase greater than the wage of the ordinary average John Citizen Australian, as if that is some sin, Sir Peter Abeles, the largest single individual beneficial recipient on the board of directors of TNT, pulls down a salary of $4.74m. That buys a lot of groceries, does it not? We have the Prime Minister saying how audacious and outrageous it is that a pilot ought to be claiming the amount that he is-and, quite frankly, I agree with him. I think it is outrageous to suggest that they should be getting a 30 per cent salary increase without increased productivity. But lined up against a salary of $4.74m, part of which Sir Peter Abeles is being paid to look after his own shareholding, his own stake, the pilots' claim pales into insignificance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So we have seen the strike go on day after day after day. What contributions were made by the great conciliator? Because the Prime Minister thought he was going to get cheap political points, because he thought the strike was going to be over earlier, and because he wanted his options left open for an early election, he lashed into the pilots with his vitriol, his abuse, his crude attacks and his unrestrained indulgence in bad language and bad taste when he described the pilots as being able to learn to fly in seven hours. I have to tell the Senate that nine weeks later we have not got enough pilots to fly 20 per cent of Western Australians from Melbourne and Sydney across to Perth and back. If one can learn to fly in seven hours, the sky should be black with aircraft by now. Where are they if one can learn to fly in seven hours? The Prime Minister might have had a bit of a frolic with life and limb up in the air somewhere in the cockpit of a Chipmunk, but I would like to see him after seven hours of training at the controls of a 747, a 767, a 757 or a 737. One would not sell a lot of tickets. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister compared that training with that of a bus driver. I can see no comparison. I would jump in a bus driven by an airline pilot who had spent seven hours learning to drive a bus, but I would certainly not get in the back, front or middle of an aircraft that had up front a bus driver who had had seven hours practice. Yet the Prime Minister used that sort of colourful language to try to draw an analogy between a bus driver's skills, his learning curve and the demands upon him in terms of his responsibility, and the skills of a pilot. I think it is absolutely absurd. </PARA>
<PARA> To add insult to injury, for those who do not know these little pieces of trivia tucked away in the backwaters of the machinations of politics, let me tell honourable senators that for the first two or three weeks of this strike the Prime Minister used to go down to the non-members' bar every Thursday night-drinking soda water, of course; I am not seeking to imply anything else-which is unheard of in recent times, to chat up all the press in an attempt to sell his story. One of the Prime Minister's favourite stories was that the hardest thing to get out of the pilots when they resigned was their uniforms because they loved the glory of the peak caps, the braiding, the embroidery and the smart uniforms. What poor taste language! What a pretty rotten sort of warped sense of humour does one have to have to suggest that that is the most important thing in the life of a pilot?</PARA>

<PARA> When that all failed, of course, he attacked the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. We have seen the result of that.

I say that without qualification. Certainly, that is so in this case. And so the strike continues. As I say, it is not about to be resolved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have no doubt that the strike could have been resolved. The Prime Minister could have swallowed his pride and been prepared to step back and accept that he had made a hell of a botch of the matter from the beginning. He should have said to Australian Airlines, `Talk to the pilots and see what their best and worst offer is. See whether you can find something in the agreement which is tied to productivity that does not in any way undermine the basic level of awards being granted in Australia at present'. The Government could actually have found, not a wages breakout, but a productivity breakout. But that is not what has occurred. We have had a propaganda war, a series of disinformation campaigns. We have been told that the number of pilots being signed up was 10, then 20, then 30, then 40, and then it was 50. According to the press, so far 1,280 pilots should have been signed up. I do not know where they are, but they are certainly not in the cockpits of the aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> We were told that the pilots would break next week, and then it was the week after. We were told that the airlines had 20 per cent capacity, then 40 per cent capacity and then 60 per cent capacity. We were told that by Christmas they would have 80 per cent capacity. Yet when I rang up the other day to try to book a seat for my daughter, I found that so far there are no aeroplanes flying in December. So much for their capacity!</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has indulged himself, in collusion with big Pete, in a disinformation program. As a result, we are living with the worst industrial disputation that this nation has seen. One party has been given compensation, but what about the little old ladies who clean out the units on the Gold Coast, in Coolangatta, north of Sydney or in one of the Perth suburbs, who have been retrenched? What about the single mothers who rely on that salary in order to live? What benefit, what reparation, have they received? What financial support have they received to keep themselves in jobs? None. What about the kiosk owners, the T-shirt shop proprietors, the taxi drivers? Thousands of those people are going broke. They have received no help from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> One cannot imagine those people being able to pick up the phone, as Pete did, and say, `Hey, Bob, it's Pete here. Can you increase the compensation by a couple of million more because I am hurting a bit?' One cannot imagine Bob saying, `You're dead right, Johnny, sorry to hear that you're in trouble in Coolangatta. I will hold a Cabinet meeting tonight and that will be fixed'. The little people in Australia are not known by the Labor Party. Labor has a corporate mentality-big unions, big corporations, big government. The ordinary, average citizens in this country who want a fair go get trodden on by the jackboots of this socialist Government which cares nothing for little people. It has no regard for the small person, no care, no respect, no understanding. It is about political expediency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I will address the continued high level of government spending on defence, which currently represents 9.6 per cent of Budget expenditure. The Budget figures indicate that defence spending is being increased by 7 per cent this year, or $547m, of which 41 per cent will be spent on personnel and retirement benefits and 35 per cent on equipment and stores. As the Defence Manufacturers Council newsletter for September 1989 noted with satisfaction:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Defence outlays for 1989-90 will be maintained in real terms at the level of 1988-89. In money terms Defence outlays will increase by 6.5 per cent from $7,782 million to $8,327 million in 1989-90. Expenditure under the Defence function will actually increase in real terms by $54 million which Defence will retain from the proceeds of property sales in 1989-90. This sum, equivalent to 0.5 per cent real growth in the Defence budget overall, will be included in the base for determining next year's outlays. In the general circumstances of Government expenditure restraint, this is seen as a satisfactory outcome. Defence continues to account for about 9.6 per cent of Commonwealth budget outlays but will consume only 2.3 per cent of GDP in the coming year. </PARA>
<PARA>In citing the current Budget figures and referring to the satisfaction of the Defence Manufacturers Council, I am acutely aware of the fact that the one policy that the Opposition has not yet produced for public inspection concerns defence, although I believe it will be released tomorrow, and I look forward to it with great interest. It is apparently the source of some dispute within the Liberal Party, so I do not hold out hope that it will offer a better alternative than the present Government policy. Indeed, if the resolution passed by the Liberal Party's Federal Council in Sydney in June this year is anything to go by, the Opposition will have to cut back on government expenditure by far more than Mr Peacock's $2.7 billion, because somehow it will have to come up with the money to increase defence spending to a level of no less than 3.5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), or an increase of about 50 per cent on current defence expenditure. The Opposition never says how it will pay for these increases. Maybe tomorrow all will be revealed. </PARA>
<PARA> According to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald of 23 June, the increases amount to a sum of $11.2 billion, compared to the $8 billion which is the current level of expenditure. I gather that this is the amount of money necessary to restore the Navy's air wing and to acquire two aircraft carriers. As Senator Newman spoke to this resolution in place of Mr Jim Carlton, perhaps she could explain how a coalition government will pay for this. When she was asked at the Council meeting how the coalition could justify increasing defence spending when the Government's Budget was so tight, she apparently said that the Opposition would need to be courageous in government and seek to show leadership. This would be done by pointing out that the most important thing a government could do was to keep the country free. It will be interesting to see what is contained in the Opposition's defence policy when it is released tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime I want to address the continued high level of defence expenditure in light of this remark by the Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, to an American journalist in 1985, `I've got $6.3 billion in search of a threat'. He has been looking for a threat ever since. The Minister has countered critics of Australia's new militarism on a number of occasions in the last few weeks by saying that 2.3 per cent of GDP spent on defence is hardly evidence of a threat or a big build-up in defence expenditure, and that since he has been in office this figure has actually dropped as a percentage of GDP from 2.9 per cent in 1984 to 2.3 per cent today. What he does not point out is that, on the one hand, real defence expenditure has increased by 9.3 per cent since 1983, while at the same time tertiary education funding has increased by only 6.9 per cent and housing and community amenities by only 7.4 per cent. On the other hand, industry assistance has been cut by 16.2 per cent, overseas aid by 14.3 per cent, and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has had its research grants cut by a massive 29.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is also worth pointing out that these figures were quoted by a Labor member in the House of Representatives on 17 August this year. It is further worth adding that defence funding, as a proportion of total outlays, rose from 8.8 per cent in 1978-79 to 9.4 per cent in 1987-88 and is now 9.6 per cent. Just referring to GDP figures is deliberately misleading if not placed in this overall context of the cuts that have been suffered by other Government departments. What then is the justification for this increasingly high level of expenditure on the military? I gather that the military does not feel that it is getting enough funding because in a joint letter to the Minister for Defence published in this year's annual report of the Department of Defence, the Chief of the Defence Force and the head of the Department warned the Government that the defence organisation cannot sustain further Budget cuts indefinitely. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this is typical of the misreading of the situation. Many government departments have suffered cuts. Defence has not suffered cuts. In real terms the defence outlay has been maintained and in dollar and percentage terms it has been increased. Defence cuts are seemingly sacrosanct when compared with the cuts that have been made in other ministerial portfolios. It is worth pointing out that even in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and in the United States there are now moves to reduce military expenditure as it has such a crippling effect on the economies and on the debt problems of those two massively militarised countries. In the United States the defence budget almost doubled under the Reagan Administration. The rest of the world is still feeling the impact of United States borrowing to raise the extra $1 trillion that this involved. Likewise, President Gorbachev also has realised what military expenditure has done to the Soviet economy and he is now trying to cut back drastically on the military budget. </PARA>
<PARA> To bring this matter back home, Paul Malone had an excellent feature article under the title `It's time to pare military spending' which appeared in the Canberra Times on 2 June this year before he was unfortunately edged out of his role as political correspondent by the paper's management. I commend his article to the Senate. Obviously, if substantial cuts are to be made, we must question the whole direction of Australia's military expenditure. I am glad not to be alone in raising these questions. Some of the basic issues are to be covered in a new book to be published early next year entitled Australia's New Militarism: undermining our future security which is a project of the Secure Australia Project. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence may claim, as he did in the 1989 T. J. Ryan memorial lecture this month, that we actually spend less on defence as a proportion of GDP than comparable nations in Europe such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Norway. But this ignores the fact that in terms of per capita defence expenditure we come eighteenth in the world, or did according to the latest figures from Ruth Leger Sivard's publication World Military and Social Expenditures for 1987-88. All of the countries which came ahead of us in the table were in Europe or in the Middle East, areas with a history of tension, where immediate threats are perceived by the military. Contrast this with Australia where, as Mr Beazley has admitted, there is no perceivable threat and, furthermore, where we actually had to invent a threat for the Kangaroo 89 exercise: that is Kamaria. As both the 1981 Katter report on Threats to Australia's Security: Their Nature and Probability and the 1986 Dibb report on the Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities conceded, there is no threat to Australia and only the US could logistically mount one. Any other country would take five to 10 years to develop a logistic capability to attack Australia. It would be fairly obvious what was going on. </PARA>
<PARA> I also point out that, if the threat must come from the north as we are told, virtually all those countries to the north are being armed by countries which form part of the Western alliance or are friendly to it. Indeed, they are the very countries that we are targeting in our own export sales drive of military equipment in order to offset the high cost of importing so much military equipment for the Australian Defence Force (ADF). How the import of very expensive defence items adds to our balance of payments problems is something that is very rarely mentioned. The first military export sales mission went to South-East Asia last December. Now the Department of Defence is to use HMAS Tobruk as a floating arms bazaar after the Gallipoli trip next year in order to promote our military exports in south and south-west Asia. I consider that a great insult to the memories of those diggers who died so tragically at Gallipoli. The ship that is to go to the place where they died to commemorate their sacrifice will, on the way back to Australia, turn into a sales bazaar for the weapons of death. </PARA>
<PARA> This arms export push is what I have described on other occasions as dual rhetoric. Australia, instead of Europe and North America, is commendably promoting non-military exports in the Asia-Pacific area and is talking about increasing our regional interdependence. This is a growing world characteristic. As we were reminded after the Black Friday crash on Wall Street earlier this month, the world is indeed becoming a much smaller place. Yet, we are constantly being told that a threat will materialise from the north and that we must be ready for it. The scenario is one of low level attacks on our far north but we are never told who might mount such an attack or why they would do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the 130 or so wars fought since 1945 only 15 per cent have involved one country invading or attacking its neighbour. These wars are mostly conflicts with a long history, many being a legacy from the colonial period. Fortunately, Australia is not in the position of having any longstanding enemies. It is hard to envisage why any country should pick a fight with Australia that would actually involve attacks on our territory. All the scenarios drawn up recently by the more gung ho press in the Northern Territory and Western Australia seem to focus on Indonesia. These warriors forget that Indonesia depends on countries such as Britain and the United States for its more sophisticated military supplies. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's primary exports-oil, gas and timber-go to countries such as Japan. If Indonesia decided to pick a fight with Australia it would face the most horrendous economic and political consequences. It is worth recalling that, the last time Indonesia engaged its neighbours to the north, the Government was overthrown. We would be far better off trying to promote a greater understanding of Indonesia, encouraging the learning of their language and understanding Islamic culture, than having to read silly scenarios about Indonesian commandos riding around the Northern Territory on trail bikes with shoulder launched missiles, which is what we had to put up with from the West Australian on 29 April this year. </PARA>
<PARA> I gather that the Territorians are subject to similar lurid scenarios which I suspect are more likely geared to encouraging the militarisation of the north as a way of saving and boosting the local economy. As Hugh Smith, Director of the Australian Defence Studies Centre at the Australian Defence Force Academy, said in a paper last year:</PARA>
<PARA> But who is going to invade or seek a lodgment in country that is difficult for Australia's own forces to operate in?</PARA>
<PARA>His paper on the decline of the military profession, presented to a conference organised by the Australian Defence Studies Centre and the Australian Study Group on Armed Forces and Society, raises some interesting questions which this chamber might do well to consider. His paper focused on the problem faced by a number of countries other than Australia of what to do with the military in a period of extended peacetime which is likely to continue. He observed at one point, `Everyone is a `chocolate soldier' now'. He went on to make the interesting observation that the present high rate of attrition from the ADF serves as a functional equivalent of war although he has yet to hear of any politician openly arguing along these lines. He also points to the value of engaging the military in what Morris Janowitz refers to as constabulary tasks. I was pleased to read that Senator Gareth Evans suggested, when he spoke at the United Nations General Assembly this month, that United Nations members should establish emergency peacekeeping teams that could be summoned at short notice. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that we contribute towards his suggestion of an international training centre for peacekeeping troops rather than building the six submarines or eight frigates, or playing war games such as the next Kangaroo exercise. I gather that this proposal is already under consideration. At a personal level I would much rather develop the idea of non-violent peacekeeping initiatives along the lines of the Peace Brigades International in Central America. In the meantime I feel that the ADF could usefully participate in more places such as Namibia when the need arises, provided that we train personnel for peacekeeping rather than for interventionism. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the cost of current military items such as the FA18s, the submarines and the Anzac class frigates, it would seem far more sensible to invest in these and other preventative mechanisms rather than purchasing military hardware. We could strengthen regional and international forums for conflict resolution such as the International Court of Justice or could follow up Senator Evans's suggestion to the United Nations General Assembly about creating an international training centre for peacekeeping troops. I notice from the estimates that we contributed $7,000 to the Bureau of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, $125,000 to the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, $3m to the UN Interim Force in Lebanon, $2.5m to the UN Iran-Iraq military observer group and $213,000 to the UN Angola Verification of Cuban Troop Withdrawal. If we add those amounts, the total is a fraction of what we spend on the military, but I suggest it is money that is far better spent. </PARA>
<PARA> At the national level it would also be cheaper to train our diplomats more effectively in negotiating and language skills than to train FA18 pilots who then join Qantas Airways Ltd or get stuck behind a desk on Russell Hill. We spent a great deal of money on the Australian Defence Force Academy not far from here. Again, I note from the Estimates that we are planning to allocate only $535 to the Peace Research Centre at the Australian National University-a tiny fraction of what we spend on war games and planning for the military. I firmly believe that we should be funding peace and conflict research centres in every State in Australia, just as we have finally recognised the value of conflict resolution at the community level. Even then it would cost a mere fraction of what we allocate to military hardware or to some of the 118 major capital equipment projects under way-`major capital equipment projects' being a term used to refer to a project costing in excess of $10m. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence proudly proclaims that Australia is spending $25 billion on capital military equipment over 15 years, in the biggest peacetime capital equipment program that Australia has ever known. Yet, the Minister also argues that there has been a reduction in defence expenditure-if he is talking to a more critical audience. He boasts about the high figures when he is amongst his supporters and complains about cuts when he is addressing his critics. His rhetoric changes quite remarkably depending on who he is talking to. I do not think he can have it both ways. This $25 billion figure will probably increase as the costs of the submarines and the frigates blow out, as defence contracts are wont to do. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike our neighbours across the Tasman, we have never really asked what the FA18s are for, what the new submarines are for, what the frigates are for, or what the Seahawk and Black Hawk helicopters are for. We can assume that bigger and more sophisticated toys are more fun than the old ones. Certainly, these items are of little relevance to the kind of scenario that we dealt with in the Kangaroo 89 exercise. They are not much use in dealing with threats to our immediate north, as my constituents in Western Australia have often reminded me. There, in the north, people are concerned about illegal fishing and attendant quarantine dangers, illegal immigration and, perhaps above all at the moment, drug smuggling. They are the real threats to Australia's security at the moment and they are not being adequately addressed by the defence expenditure that we see coming from this present Government. Three submarines at Garden Island may make some Western Australians feel more secure against the unidentifiable threat from the north, but they are not much use for detecting or apprehending drug runners. </PARA>
<PARA> David Jenkins in the Sydney Morning Herald of 28 August this year referred to the current projected level of armaments on the Anzac class frigates as `a frigate with knobs on'. We are told by the Minister for Defence that these eight frigates are to guard maritime choke points `1,000 miles from our shores'. But even when the Royal Australian Air Force gets an aerial refuelling capability it will not be able to be on station at all times in all places. Captain R. A. Christie, director of surface warfare, command and control, is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>There are areas within Australia's zone of military interest over which you can't have continual air support so any ship must have good air defences. </PARA>
<PARA>The Anzac frigates do not have that capability, nor do the three destroyers in the Royal Australian Navy Fleet. According to David Jenkins, it would cost about $4m to $6m to equip each Anzac frigate with an adequate anti-missile system-which, I might add, would also mean a further drain on our balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is not even the lack of a threat that is at stake. It is the question of why we are getting eight frigates and what they are for, particularly with their apparent inadequate level of armament. The frigates we are getting are well over 50 per cent bigger than those originally recommended in the report of the Dibb Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities and include a far greater emphasis on anti-submarine warfare than Paul Dibb considered necessary. The Minister for Defence states, quite correctly, that other countries in our region are acquiring submarines, but I would submit that they are far more for naval prestige than to combat any external threat. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, those European countries which were interested in winning the submarine contract in Australia were primarily interested in getting a foothold in a part of the world where they could sell even more submarines. South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia were all referred to as potential markets for submarine sales in an article by the editor of the Pacific Defence Reporter this month, while the Australia Submarine Corporation has been chatting with Thailand about the idea of an Australian deal, and regards India and Canada as other possibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Beazley himself referred to this potential for submarine sales in the region in a speech to the Premier's Business Forum in Adelaide on 27 October this year when he spoke of the interest that other countries were showing in the Type 471 submarine, stating:</PARA>
<PARA>There may also be good prospects for exporting our submarine technology and expertise to navies in our own region. </PARA>
<PARA>Given that all these countries are on our side, so to speak, and that we are hoping actually to build some of their submarines, the question remains: Where does the submarine threat to Australia come from? I would submit that we are involved in creating the very threat itself, that the emphasis on anti-submarine warfare is to detect submarines that we are seeking to build for our neighbours. Furthermore, even with six or 12 submarines, how can we possibly patrol all the choke points in the area of the world that Mr Beazley refers to as our area of interest? On top of that, the volume of Australian shipping is too large to be safely escorted through those choke points by the eight expensive new frigates or our other surface combatants. </PARA>
<PARA> Another angle that seems to have been overlooked is the easy access that many countries, including Australia, now have to cheap sea-skimming missiles such as the Harpoon and the Exocet. These can be launched from very small craft and make the frigates extremely vulnerable. That is why I have argued that Australia would be better off served by smaller ships, with the emphasis on non-offensive defence rather than coming up with the Anzac class frigates which do not seem to fit anywhere. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there is the $700m being spent on the Seahawk helicopters. Paul Dibb favoured only a light observation helicopter for the frigates rather than these expensive anti-submarine aircraft which are costing us $40m apiece. The Seahawk, like the FA18, comes from the United States. It is worth pointing out that, with our annual balance of payments deficit running at $16 billion, over $1 billion each year is directly attributable to the purchase of military hardware. Why do we never hear about that when we are apportioning blame for this country's excess import bill? The Opposition, too, seems to be very silent on this topic, though quick to allocate blame everywhere else. </PARA>
<PARA> This leads me to the Government's reprehensible decision to offset this huge import bill by trying to double our military exports, in line with the recommendations of the 1986 Cooksey report which was never tabled or debated in this Parliament. I remind the Senate of the words of the former Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Bill Hayden, when he was addressing the United Nations Special Session on Disarmament in New York in June 1988. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is also clear that the arms exports should not be turned to as a way of solving domestic economic problems. Arms transfers must not become a new cash crop. </PARA>
<PARA>Then there are the words of the Director of the World Bank, who said on 26 September this year that developing countries should now try to reduce military expenditure, one of the main contributing factors to their enormous debt burden-as well as to ours and that of the United States. Yet this Government chooses to ignore both those statements and instead reinforces the latest Arms Control and Disarmament Agency report from the United States, which tells us that in 1987 the world's national military expenditure surpassed $US1 trillion and that world arms international transfers topped $US56 billion, an increase of about 6.5 per cent over the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Middle East remains the world's principal arms market, accounting for 38 per cent of global imports, while the most promising market is East and South Asia where the size and importance of the markets are increasing. At the United Nations we deplore world arms transfers while at the same time we are urged to get into South East Asia quickly and sell before the British tie up the region for many years to come. This is why the Department of Defence wants to use HMAS Tobruk to peddle our wares in South Asia on the way home from Gallipoli-a reprehensible intention. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is a member of the World Bank and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is a governor of the World Bank. It is significant that the Director of the World Bank, Barber Conable, stated in a speech to the Board of Governors of the World Bank Group in Washington on 26 September this year:</PARA>
<PARA> As we think about the tasks of development in the coming years, we can no longer neglect a sensitive component of the fiscal problem: military spending. All countries have the sovereign right and responsibility to defend themselves. But let us hope that, in the changing political climate of the 1990s, resources are increasingly allocated to more productive purposes, in industrial countries as well as developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> While there is much variation among developing countries, as a group low-income countries currently allocate around 20 per cent of central government budgets to defence. In the mid-1980s military spending in developing countries exceeded spending on health and education combined. While many components of national budgets have been cut, the $200 billion which the developed world spends annually on the military has largely been protected. And arms are often a prime source of external debt: military debts account for a third or more of total debt service in several large developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Developing countries on one side, and their arms suppliers and creditors on the other, must adapt to a world where budgets are tight. It is important to place military spending decisions on the same footing as other fiscal decisions, to examine possible trade-offs more systematically, and to explore ways to bring military spending into better balance with development priorities. In evaluating their military expenditures, Governments should be realistic, but they should also remember the human consequences of these choices. </PARA>
<PARA>So there we have it from the Governor of the World Bank. Yet Australia chooses to slash its overseas aid budget even further and then seeks to double the military exports instead. It is an amazing sense of priorities. Next month we have the spectacle of our national capital hosting the biggest arms bazaar ever held in the Southern Hemisphere-AIDEX 89-as the merchants of death from 15 countries come to the National Exhibition Centre to peddle their wares. To remind us of our wider responsibilities, Community Aid Abroad and Canberra Christians for Peace will be holding a `Swords into Ploughshares Exhibition' at the same time, and I invite those members of parliament who intend to visit AIDEX 89 to make sure that they visit the Community Aid Abroad's exhibition as well. </PARA>
<PARA> That leads me to my final point, the reduction in the Budget allocation for overseas aid, while defence continues to hold its own. As I pointed out on World Food Day, 770 million people in the world do not get enough food for an active working life while 14 million children die of hunger-related causes every year. To get it into perspective, Australia is choosing to spend $2.2 billion a year on new military equipment and capabilities, and half that sum on overseas aid. If we were to aim for the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GDP, that would be roughly the same amount as the military is getting for its new military equipment. On 16 October, aid groups presented petitions bearing more than 35,000 signatures to Federal parliamentarians calling for an increase in aid to 0.5 per cent of GDP by 1992. This call echoes the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in its review of Australian International Development Assistance Bureau and Australia's overseas aid program which was delivered in February this year. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Australian Council for Overseas Aid reminded us last year, our overseas aid is now at the lowest point for more than 25 years, and after this year's Budget it is lower still. Aid now stands at 0.33 per cent of GDP compared to 0.51 per cent when the Hawke Government came to power and our highest level of 0.59 per cent in 1968. Again I must make the point that under a coalition government it would be even worse as its recently released tax policy indicated that overseas aid would be reduced by another $100m, putting us down among the really mean nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development group like the United States and Switzerland. I would commend to the Opposition the suggestion that it could have saved more than $2.7 billion by simply scrapping the eight Anzac class frigates or the six new submarines, a proposal which at least puts into perspective the enormous cost of military equipment and which other programs have to suffer to make way for new military capital equipment programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Behind my criticism of Budget expenditure on the military lies the question of where our real security lies. Does security mean being armed with the latest sophisticated military technology and allocating research funds for even more sophisticated projects or does it mean adequate housing, jobs, health care, care for the poor and less well-off in our society, justice for Aboriginal people, access to education for all, and preservation of the environment? When these problems in our society are so self-evident and crying out for research and support, why do we persist in allocating 9.6 per cent of Budget expenditure on looking for a non-existent threat? I believe that our external security could be better guaranteed in other ways than by building up the military, for example, through working for common security in the region rather than participating in a new arms race; by putting more emphasis on conflict resolution through non-military means; and by spending defence dollars on non-offensive defence rather than continuing to participate in an offensive nuclear alliance with a country on the other side of the world, and trying to act as a regional policeman. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1989-90, the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1989-90, and the Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1989-90. These Bills constitute the Government's Budget for the 1989-90 financial year. They, in fact, constitute the Hawke Government's seventh Budget in office. As a Government member I support these Bills. The Budget is a responsible and gimmick-free document. It is a document designed to advance Labor's long term vision of a more prosperous yet fairer Australia. In that way it is unlike the past Budgets of Liberal governments and the Opposition's so-called Economic Action Plan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Hawke Budget tackles Australia's problems with vision, consistency and compassion. It concentrates on getting the economic fundamentals right in the Australian economy, but it offers to the needy at the same time ongoing support and relief. It is in direct contrast to the desperation, division and despair offered by the Opposition and its so-called economic policies. This Budget will, as a result of the economic policies in it, slow down total spending in the economy and bring the economy to a soft landing and not a crash landing. Importantly, the Budget will develop economic conditions to bring about lower interest rates and not fuel even higher rates. Most importantly, the Budget will implement important social justice measures to assist all Australians without ignoring those most in need in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year was characterised by exceptionally strong economic growth in the economy and exceptionally strong growth in the private sector. In fact, it was the strongest growth in private sector spending in two decades, the strongest growth since the 1960s. For example, Australia's gross national spending grew by 7.7 per cent. That is a measure of the total demand in the economy. At the same time, owing to supply constraints, our economy could only produce 3.3 per cent more. So with production growing at only 3.3 per cent we had a spillover of that higher demand in the Australian economy into imports and as a result an overseas deficit which grew in size directly as a result of that rapid growth in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has taken the course of calling upon interest rates to slow down the economy but, of course, that has not been done in isolation. The Government itself has accepted unprecedented fiscal restraint in Australia. We have taken the step of restraining government spending to reduce demand, to reduce total spending in the community and, therefore, to tackle Australia's external imbalances by cutting import growth. It is worth noting that for the fourth year in succession real government outlays have been cut. They have been cut by the Hawke Labor Government. Four years in a row we have had real cuts in government spending. In fact, the ratio of government spending in real terms to Australia's gross domestic product-that is a broad measure of our national income-is now, under the Hawke Labor Government, at its lowest level in 16 years. </PARA>
<PARA> So much for the rhetoric from the other side that we have had to endure over the last five years in this place about high spending Labor governments. That rhetoric has totally been exposed by the fact that government spending, as a proportion of Australia's gross domestic product, is now at its lowest level in 16 years. It is expected that this financial year government spending will total some 23.7 per cent of gross domestic product compared with a much higher figure of around 30 per cent in 1984-85. So over five financial years we have seen a reduction of around 6 to 7 percentage points. In other words, it is a dramatic reduction in the share of government spending in gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA> As shown in this Government's Forward Estimates, we will maintain social security spending at compassionate levels: I am pleased to note that the existing fiscal policy, without any further changes and without any further cuts in programs, will ensure that total government spending as a proportion of gross domestic product will fall further and within three years should fall to around 22 per cent of gross domestic product. That means that the figures will be back to those of around the 1950s. Again, it exposes the rhetoric from the other side for what it is. Liberal and National Party senators time and time again, day after day, month after month, claimed in this place that the Labor Government was the highest spending government. That claim has been exposed as pure rhetoric. This year we are expecting a Budget surplus of $9.1 billion-that is, $9,100m-more in government receipts than government expenditure through the Commonwealth Budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Tate, my economic adviser, points out, more workers are now paying tax in the Australian economy than ever before. The reason is that more people have jobs. It is a great contrast to the early 1980s when 186,000 Australians were thrown on the scrap heap in one year while the policies of Senator Stone and Mr Howard were in place. In addition, tax receipts in that period were very dismal because of the number of people thrown out of work who were not earning any incomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The surplus of $9,100m this year is a very large figure. It compares with a surplus last financial year of $5,900m. This year's Commonwealth Budget surplus is only the third in 37 years, a remarkable achievement. That is a massive turnaround of the position we inherited on coming to government in March 1983 when the prospective deficit for 1983-84 under the Liberals was to have been $9,600m. The $9,100m surplus for the current financial year has to be compared with a prospective deficit, not a surplus, of $9,600m under the Liberals. Under the Hawke Government, the Budget surpluses have funded the largest single package of income tax cuts and family assistance ever provided by an Australian government. That is the reality. The Hawke Government has provided for a significant boost to family income, especially for low to middle income earners. The Government has also used its last three Budget surpluses to pay off government debt. Using just the last two Budget surpluses to pay off debt has already saved Australia $2,000m in interest payments, a remarkable figure. As a result of these measures, the Federal Government will now owe no overseas debt on a net basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Sixty-one per cent of Australia's overseas debt is private sector debt and we have witnessed the unscrambling of some of the takeovers in recent times which have been funded by that debt. Thirty-nine per cent of the debt belongs to State governments and instrumentalities in government hands. In six years, the Hawke Labor Government has turned around the Commonwealth Budget from borrowing around 6.2 per cent of gross domestic product in 1983-84-that is, our borrowings were equivalent to around 6.2 per cent of GDP-to a net repayment this financial year of 2.5 per cent of GDP, a very big improvement in the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The accord with the Australian Council of Trade Unions on incomes policy has played a vital role in the Government's overall Budget strategy. In the past, whenever the economy was overheated with excess demand, wage breakouts broke the back of the economy and led to massive unemployment. Despite the overheating of the economy in the last year or so, wage increases have been contained, a remarkable achievement. It is a remarkable commitment by the working people of Australia that, despite the fact that the circumstances for very large wage rises were there, wages growth has been contained despite a very rapidly growing economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Our record is that 1.6 million new jobs have been created under the Hawke Government. I well remember that in 1983 when Mr Hawke promised 500,000 new jobs over the first three years of his Government, Opposition members scoffed. They said it was not possible to create half a million new jobs over three years. They scoffed repeatedly; they tried to ridicule the claim; but they had to eat their words because not only were the 500,000 new jobs created in the first three years of office, they were also created way ahead of the appointed time. It is a reality now that the annual rate of employment growth under the Government is six times what the Liberals were able to achieve in office. One of the reasons we have had rapid employment growth is that we have had an investment boom in Australia. For example, private sector spending on investment last year grew by 16 per cent; in other words, the total amount of investment went up by one-sixth in one financial year under a Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA> These are tangible achievements and clearly they are not gimmicks. They are in stark contrast to the Liberal Party's economic document which was published recently. That document fails to address the long term issues facing the Australian economy. It looks only at the next election and it is very clearly a blatant and naked grab for votes. The Opposition's so-called economic plan offers no alternative policy to the economic problems facing Australia. In their document, the Liberals boast about tightening fiscal policy, but when one analyses the policy document one sees that it proposes nothing that would reduce total net spending. I would like Opposition members to come forward and show me how it does. Certainly it then proposes to obtain additional revenue by dumping the people in our community most in need, the poor. The poorest members of our community would be dumped by the policies of the Liberal Party if ever it got into power. There is a very self-seeking assumption behind all that and that is that the poor and the needy in our community do not vote for the Liberal Party. I think that is the assumption behind the policy document at that point. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberals boast that they will lower interest rates. That is the claim they are making on the hustings around Australia, but their so-called economic plan offers no scope to ease monetary policy. I again challenge members of the Opposition to come forward and show me and other members of the Government how their policy would reduce interest rates by easing monetary policy. Most interestingly in the policy document, the Liberals promise to give back the proceeds of what they call bracket creep. I suppose that is defined as the effect of inflation on tax brackets, the fact that due to price rises employees are pushed into higher tax brackets and that there are therefore some artificial elements in the tax that they pay due to an inflationary process. Therefore, the Liberals have promised in their policy document to give back the proceeds of bracket creep. However, the July tax cuts given by the Hawke Government this year, funded by the Budget, more than offset the effect of bracket creep since 1983 when the Government was elected. The tax cuts that have already been given this year and are in the pay packets of Australian wage and salary earners have already more than offset any effect of inflation on tax brackets since 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> As a candidate for the House of Representatives in the 1975 Federal election, I well remember Liberal Party spokespersons going around Australia promising to remove bracket creep. They gave a very categorical undertaking during the 1975 election campaign to index tax brackets for inflation and to remove bracket creep. In fact, Mr Fraser in his 1975 policy speech promised to end taxation by stealth due to inflation. It is an interesting history and it is worth examining what the Liberal Party did in government because it is now going to the Australian people saying that it will end bracket creep, the inflationary effect on tax brackets. It is always a good test of conservative politicians to see what they do in government, because so often the reality is at odds with the rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fascinating to see what the Liberal Party did in government in the 1970s in regard to tax indexation. It brought it in for the 1976-77 financial year and maintained it for the 1977-78 financial year. But the story basically ends there because Mr Howard, who became the Treasurer in 1978, halved the indexation factor in the 1978-79 financial year. He said that indexation of tax brackets was too expensive. The Liberal Government would not protect people against bracket creep. He therefore halved the indexation factor. He had only half indexation again in 1980-81 and eventually the Liberal Party threw out the window the whole idea of adjusting for bracket creep, of indexing tax brackets to inflation. The line taken by the then Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, and the then Treasurer, Mr Howard-and no doubt by Senator Stone in his previous incarnation as Secretary to the Treasury jealously protecting the nation's revenues-was that it was a crazy idea and that if they really wanted a political effect with tax cuts it was better to have discretionary tax cuts. During the late 1970s and early 1980s senior Liberals were on the public record as saying that tax indexation does not win votes. They said that it was better to have discretionary tax cuts from time to time. The Liberals believe that votes can be bought more effectively in that way. Again they are talking about tax cuts. However, the reality is that, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, they had the chance to do something about tax brackets; but they squibbed that idea, they scrapped it and they returned to the previous system.</PARA>
<PARA> To fulfil the claim that senior Liberals make, namely, that they would index the tax brackets, would require an additional $2,000m of government revenue in the first year and another $4,000m by 1992, which would make it a very expensive measure indeed. One can only speculate about where the money would come from to replace the revenue that would be lost because of the removal of bracket creep-if ever the Liberals honoured that promise. One can only conclude, and rest assured, that the Liberals would soon be introducing a consumption tax to find the revenue needed to cover the loss caused by that change in income tax brackets. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past decade, Mr Peacock has been on record calling for a consumption tax on more occasions than he has said that he does not want one. I invite honourable senators to consult the parliamentary database that is available to all of them. If they key in the words `tax indexation' and `consumption tax' and consider Mr Peacock's role, they will find that time and time again Mr Peacock has called for the introduction of a consumption tax. On very few occasions has he called for no consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA> By going down that path the Liberals are pursuing Thatcherite policies. I believe that that is the best way of describing the Liberal Party's policies. It is Thatcherism at its worst. The Liberals model much of what they say they would do on the Thatcher model in Britain. The Liberals worship Mrs Thatcher and her policies. That is clear from the repeated pilgrimages that have been made by conservative politicians from Canberra to No. 10 Downing Street to worship at the feet of Mrs Thatcher. Clearly, the Liberals are Thatcherite politicians. Like us, they believe in redistribution but, unlike us, they believe in the redistribution of resources from low and middle income people to the well off in the community. That is the way that the Liberals would behave in government. They would also carry out bargain basement sales of Australia's vital public assets. In doing so, they would somehow claim in a Thatcherite way that that would boost the economy and economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Thatcher has created two Britains-a divided country: an affluent south and a depressed north. I am sure that, in government, the Liberals would create two Australias. They would give to the already privileged and would take away from the needy and the deserving. It is very interesting to note that, this year, despite the so-called Thatcher economic miracle in Britain, Italy's gross domestic product has overtaken that of Britain. It is an interesting sign of the times that one of the relatively poorer members of the European Community around the Mediterranean region has overtaken Britain's gross domestic product at the same time as Mrs Thatcher is proclaiming an economic miracle in her country. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time that is available to me I wish to speak briefly about the effect of the policies of the Hawke Government on the State of South Australia. At the regional level, it is very interesting to note how the budgetary policies of the Hawke Government have impacted and how, at the same time as there has been a national expansion of the economy, important benefits have been enjoyed at the local level. The reality is that the economic recovery that has occurred in South Australia under the Hawke and Bannon Labor governments has been remarkable. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1982, the South Australian economy under the Liberals was in tatters. During the three years of Liberal government from 1979 to 1982, the unemployment rate in South Australia soared to become the highest in mainland Australia. Business confidence and employment slumped. It is interesting to note that, since 1983, under the joint policies of the Hawke Federal Labor Government and the Bannon South Australian Labor Government, 120,000 extra jobs have been created in South Australia and 11,000 persons have been removed from the unemployment tally in that State. It is a tremendous achievement that, because of the expansion of the economy, 11,000 fewer people are unemployed. Cost of living increases have been cut enormously and, in particular, industry has returned to South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to discuss how a region is affected by sensible and sound economic policies at the national level. In the three months to March 1983, that is, in the period spilling over from the Liberal Government in South Australia and the Fraser, Howard and Stone Federal Government in Canberra, the average unemployment rate in South Australia had reached double digits. In fact, under those misguided policies the unemployment rate had reached 10.6 per cent. Indeed, in one month at the beginning of 1983, the South Australian jobless rate rose to over 11 per cent. In other words, one person in nine who was seeking work in that State was unable to obtain employment because of the misguided policies of Liberal State and Federal governments. That shameful legacy could be compared very starkly with the reality in 1989. While there was 10.6 per cent unemployment in 1983, in the three months to March 1989 the unemployment rate had been reduced to 7.7 per cent. Although that is a major improvement, the figure is still too high and more has to be done. However, it shows what can be achieved when Federal and State Labor governments work together. </PARA>
<PARA> The position in regard to unemployment among teenagers is demonstrated even more clearly. For example, in the three months to March 1983, South Australia's unemployment rate among teenagers was absolutely horrendous. Under Liberal governments in Canberra and in Adelaide, very few employment opportunities existed for teenagers in South Australia. Because of Liberal Party policies, 27 per cent of young people in South Australia were unemployed. This year, that figure has been cut by 10 percentage points to 17 per cent, which is still far too high although it is certainly well down on the reality under Liberal governments in 1983. Clearly, under Labor governments, more opportunities exist for teenagers in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the acid tests used by economists to examine the position in the labour market is to relate the number of unemployed persons to each job vacancy. That gives them an idea of how tight the labour market is and how conditions are generally in the labour market at a particular time. It is interesting to note that, in May 1983, just after the election of the Federal Labor Government and, therefore, basically still under the economic conditions that were laid down by the Liberals, 69 persons were unemployed for every job vacancy in South Australia. In May 1989, under a Federal Labor government and a State Labor government, that figure was reduced from 69 to 16, which was a tremendous reduction in the unemployed to job vacancy ratio. That demonstrates what can be achieved when consistent economic policies are adopted by the Federal Government and the State Government working in cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to inflation and price rises. Once again the Liberals are making a lot of noise about inflation and about how they would somehow decrease the rate of growth of price rises in the Australian community. Let me cite some figures. In the 12 months to March 1983-again as a result of Liberal Party policies being in operation at the Federal level and at the State level-the consumer price index for Adelaide showed an increase of 12.1 per cent. In the 12 months to March 1983, which was the very month when the Fraser Government was thrown out, consumer prices in Adelaide increased by almost one-eighth. That was the reality under the Liberals; despite their rhetoric, there was a massive increase in consumer prices. By contrast, in the 12 months to March 1989, consumer prices in Adelaide did not increase by 12 per cent, 11 per cent, 10 per cent, 9 per cent or even 8 per cent; they rose by only 7.5 per cent. I personally regard that figure as being too high, but surely even members of the Liberal Party can see a remarkable transformation in the inflation index. The reality is that there was double-digit inflation, in South Australia and nationally, under the Liberals just as there was double-digit unemployment under their policies. They had the great double-double-digit unemployment and double-digit inflation. We have slashed the inflation rate, to a March figure of 7.5 per cent in my capital city. So clearly Labor does better in managing the inflation rate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Brownhill is carping over there, but let us look at the housing industry. We have heard rhetoric and crocodile tears for the last six months from members of the Opposition about interest rates. Time and time again members of the Opposition make claims about how they will get interest rates down, but let us have a look at the reality. Let us look at how interest rates really influence the economy. Let us look at their impact on new dwelling commencements, because that clearly shows the difference between Liberal Party claims and Labor Party achievements. In the 12 months to March 1983, under a Liberal Government in Canberra and a Liberal Government in Adelaide, 7,600 dwellings were commenced in South Australia. That is the reality. I did not make the figures up; they come from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. But to March this year, under a Labor government in Canberra and a Labor government in Adelaide, and despite high interest rates, the real bricks and mortar figures show that 9,800 dwellings were commenced in South Australia. So there is the Liberal record-7,600 new dwellings started, compared to 9,800 new dwellings started in South Australia this year despite high interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This really exposes the hollowness of the Liberal Party analysis of the economy. The Liberals think everything is affected by interest rates. They think everything political is affected by interest rates. But they have forgotten-and I hope they learn this lesson-that more people have the ability to service a loan because under Labor at least they have jobs. That is the reality-there have been 1.6 million new jobs under this Labor Government. So the Liberals are focusing on one part of the equation, interest rates, but the reality is that despite the level of interest rates 2,200 more dwellings were commenced in South Australia in the year up to March than in the whole of the 12 months to March 1983 under the Liberals. </PARA>
<PARA> So the Federal Budget this year consolidates progress since 1983. It is a sensible, economic and rational Budget. It recognises that if we are to develop Australia and improve our living standards, we have to stabilise our debt, we have to solve our balance of payments difficulties, and continue to restructure. This Budget does more than that. A Labor government will continue to create jobs, give greater hope to our young and to our elderly, and provide real benefits to those who depend on a sense of fairness and justice for support. We have come a long way over the past six years. This Budget and future Budgets under Labor governments will continue to secure Australia's future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -In the debate today on the Appropriation Bills, I wish to direct my remarks to the higher education sector in Australia and to the budgetary decisions made with regard to that sector. The Australian Democrats believe that the main influence on the balancing of higher education should be student demand. We believe that our community has a responsibility to give all those qualified and motivated to study the opportunity to study what they wish, and the necessary corollary of that is that students need to be taught what experts within various discipline areas believe the various subjects demand. It should be noted that neither of these fundamental propositions includes what bureaucrats or politicians in Canberra think. We believe that the current attempt to base present educational plans on what bureaucrats or politicians perceive future needs to be is very risky indeed, given a dynamic society, a rapidly changing knowledge base in most discipline areas, and different perceptions of vocational needs based on societal change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The concept of manpower needs embraced by this Government in a fervour to do at last some long-range planning is an extremely tenuous one and susceptible to enormous shifts, often, unfortunately, recognised only in hindsight-which of course by definition is too late for forward planning. While we may think tentative forecasts can be made-for example in the public sector professions which are under the control of planned policies, such as teaching and nursing-the experience in this country has shown that even these predictions are dodgy in the extreme and are in fact a poor substitute for the sum of half a million individual decisions made each year about courses taken in our higher education institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of the day, if people do not want to do the courses that politicians want them to do there is not much that can be done about it. In any event, decisions about course preference at universities are made well prior to entrance to such universities. It follows that in order to develop an interest in science or engineering, or whatever discipline area the Government is currently attempting to promote, strong support must be given in the pre-university education system. We are not talking about university policy when we talk about first-year choice of careers at universities. We are talking about schools which of course are already under impossible pressures to fix up all the other ills in society. Of course in considering career choice we should not neglect the other area of obvious pressure, and that is career incentives. Encouraging students to take up maths teaching, for example, is likely to fall mainly on deaf ears if the present remuneration and conditions of employment offered by our State governments continue as they are at present. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the vexed problem of funding and the use to date of funds expended. A reasonable starting point for discussion could be 1975, since that was the year that expenditure on higher education as a proportion of gross domestic product peaked, at 1.36 per cent. Between 1975 and now general recurrent grants for higher education as a whole increased by 20 per cent. However, in the same period higher education enrolments increased by 42 per cent-double the increase in the general recurrent grant. It is obvious from this that the only reason that university doors are still open, although universities are bursting at the seams, is that the university sector has shown the strongest growth in productivity of any sector in the Australian economy. The universities have done more with less and at the same time have achieved a significant quality increment as well. Oh that other sectors of our economy could have done likewise!</PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, this efficiency increase has been submerged under political rhetoric from the Government and a concerted attempt has been made to convince the general population that universities had been asleep until the current Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) decided to wake them up. The obvious silliness of that campaign is evident every time one goes into a doctor's surgery or a lawyer's office, or drives on freeways designed by our Australian engineers or seeks the services of any of the large number of professionals educated in our own higher education institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent development that has been greatly accentuated by government criticisms is that the job satisfaction for academics is rapidly deteriorating. Falling salaries in comparative terms, dramatic increases in student loads, the loss of tenure and the heavy decrease in study leave have meant that academic positions have lost a lot of their attractiveness. Many disciplines are now finding that the availability of top quality lecturers and professors cannot be guaranteed on the current conditions. The cavalier attacks for political gain have been at enormous cost to scholarship, and at even greater cost to the ongoing health of many of our professions. Ill-informed comments have had their effects in the real world. Ill-judged removal of academic support such as tenure can only be rectified at great expense. </PARA>
<PARA> The benefits of a university education and research accrue to the whole of the society and thus support from public sources is eminently justifiable. However, the society needs to be careful that higher education institutions do not have their independence eroded by that reliance on public funding. Although Professor Veliz's comment that we now have `a single Australian university with 20 campuses following policies emanating from the bureaucratic heart of the country' is a slight overstatement, the new educational profiles that institutions have to submit have the potential to achieve such a result. As other commentators have noted, it may not be so much a unified national system as a uniform national system lacking the diversity and character that our higher education sector both desires and needs. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the present Federal Government has gone much further than any previous government in seeing universities as a tool with which to reshape the economy. Universities are international institutions, and to impose a tight national direction on them will, of necessity, negate their very purpose. A university must consider and present many points of view, not just those of the party in power. Unfortunately, although universities have always been receptive to external trends and needs, they have been slow to pick up on the game of populace politics and have let the community know that its needs were being responded to by higher education institutions. Unfortunately, until recently most universities were seen as being detached from the society, whereas the reality was quite different. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to turn now to the current fad of amalgamations. Educational benefits said to result from the amalgamation of institutions include a greater choice of subject, better library resources, better computer services and better research facilities. Indeed, the list of benefits attributed to amalgamation is only exceeded by those proposed for other snake oil remedies from earlier this century. The truth of the matter is that most of these claimed advantages will only be available to students where the amalgamating institutions are on adjoining campuses, and even in such circumstances there is absolutely no evidence to show that such advantages could not be gained through different managerial practices. Indeed, if one looks around the world, the size of institutions seems to be an independent variable not linked to any predictable outcome-educational or otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the problems associated with amalgamations are clear. For a number of years, the operation of the amalgamated institution will be impaired owing to the differing natures and government profile of the partners involved. The difficulty in forming an educational profile and administration which are acceptable to all partners is plain. The extremely large costs involved in combining institutions are already becoming evident. For example, the cost of merging the University of Western Australia with Murdoch University looks like reaching about $50m. This is $50m which will not be available for teaching, research and scholarship. </PARA>
<PARA> It is odd that our management schools throughout Australia are going to be teaching their students the organisational advantages in accountability and flexibility that small, autonomous units have compared to large hierarchies while this teaching is to take place in institutions which have just got lumbered with more levels of management and less transparent channels of communication. Unfortunately, I believe many of the amalgamations currently under way are motivated more by the fear of funding cuts to small institutions than by a belief that such amalgamations will be of direct benefit to students. One can only wonder at how the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) arrived at his magical figure of 8,000 students to ensure full funding. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to recall some well known and highly regarded institutions which, in the Australian context, would be required to amalgamate. They include Princeton University, which has a little over 6,000 students; Brown University, with a little over 7,000; Dartmouth College, Radcliffe College and Tufts University, all in the United States and all with international reputations. In Great Britain, the University of St Andrews has 3,800 students; the University of Bath has 3,600 and the University of Aberdeen has 7,200. All of those universities would get the chop. To become a member of the Government's unified national system institutions will be submitting both an educational profile and an estimate of funds required-with the Government funding only the approved activities. The profile process allows the Minister to negotiate directly with institutions, in the absence of any detailed guidelines, on the most basic things which universities do-yet to date not one shred of evidence has been produced by the Government to show that previous measures of public accountability were deficient. Indeed, I have already demonstrated that the university sector has been the most productive sector in our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Membership of the unified national system will entail commitment to `more managerial modes of operation', greater delegation of policy implementation to chief executive officers so that vice-chancellors will be able to negotiate agreements with the Minister or his Department without delay, commitment to the Government's equity policy and plans for credit transfers, acceptance of the need for more staff incentives and arrangements for further training and to a common academic year. Although it remains to be seen how the educational profiles will finally be administered, there is no doubt that the new policy gives the Minister enormous powers if he chooses to use them. </PARA>
<PARA> As government control of higher education increases, there is the risk of uniformity across institutions if a government stays in power for a long enough time, or for an unstable situation to develop if governments at this level are changed rapidly. Further, any dissent from the institutions will easily be able to be stifled under threat of funding cuts. In the past the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission provided a valuable buffer between government and the institutions having the statutory powers to both monitor and publicly report on interactions between the two bodies. Unfortunately, the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission's successor, the new National Board of Employment, Education and Training, is not as well equipped to carry out this task. While the power of the new Board was significantly increased by the 35 amendments which I successfully introduced to the Bill, the Minister has severely limited its ability to conduct independent analysis and reporting by providing it with only a minimal staff. </PARA>
<PARA> The White Paper claims that university administrations should look to private industry as a guide to appropriate administrative structures. At the same time, however, the paper suggests a composition of governing bodies which is vastly different to that of the private sector. In the large conglomerate universities the greater spread of course levels and of staff and student abilities and the additional spatial problems are likely to make them more bureaucratic organisations unless they are able to give their constituent bodies independence of a kind, at least, ironically, on a campus basis as a geographical starting point. </PARA>
<PARA> The notion of deregulating the system and turning it over to market forces, while attractive to a government which is under massive economic pressures, nevertheless fails to account for the role of tertiary education in preserving or modifying socioeconomic inequalities. One cannot expect private universities to undertake non-profit community development. They are not in the business of helping to right wrongs. That is not a criticism of them; it is merely a statement of fact. As has been discovered at the secondary level, the state cannot opt out completely since some coordination is necessary to prevent increases in inequality because of accidents, history or location. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has not had all its own way in the wider debate. Oddly enough, a best seller in the United States of America has attacked the very parts of the American system which this Government aspires to implement in this country. Alan Bloom's best seller, The Closing of the American Mind, argues strongly that universities should stand for the highest and the best, should pose an alternative to whatever is popular or trendy, and should nourish imagination and creativity and a love for knowledge. He says that universities should not succumb to the idea that more is better and, above all, should oppose market measures of success, including cost-benefit analysis modelled on the banks. I think that at least these parts of Bloom's book should find a great deal of resonance in the breasts of many Australians seeking to preserve what is good in our own historical tradition of higher education. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, one senses a certain anti-intellectual strand creeping into the Government, coupled with an irritation that universities do not embrace wholeheartedly the entrepreneurial and materialistic culture, and a distrust of institutions whose job it is to question policies and ideas. The Government's debate has taken methods of financing and overall control and defined them as the dominant concerns of a university. This is a university defined in its balance sheet, not in its mission statement. I am indebted to Professor Manderson for her inaugural address at the University of Queensland in September this year when she reminded me of that marvellous play by Brecht, The Life of Galileo. I cite passages she referred to in her inaugural address. At this particular part of the play the curator or registrar of the University of Padua responds to Galileo's requests for more funds thus:</PARA>
<PARA>I cannot recommend this to the University. You know that at the present time the mathematical faculty is no attraction at a university. Mathematics is a profitless art, so to speak. Not that the Republic does not esteem it most highly. It is not as necessary as philosophy, nor as useful as theology, but it affords its devotees endless pleasures. </PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting how times change. One can hear Mr Dawkins acknowledging the relevance of all disciplines as he has done time and again at various universities: it is just that some are more relevant than others and in times of economic restraint we must all tighten our belts and put the shoulder to the wheel. We have heard that ad nauseam from the people who write his speeches. I want to quote directly from Professor Manderson's lecture because I think she got it exactly right when she said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the agenda that determines `relevance' is plastic, malleable and deeply political. There is no assurance that today's priorities will be those of tomorrow, that the ground might not shift so dramatically as to render current programs inconsequential. We have few skills to anticipate the intellectual and technical demands of, say the year 2020. To meet these unforseen future needs we have a basic responsibility to maintain our intellectual as well as our natural resources. Some of these resources are as elusive or as intangible as the value of an untouched rainforest or the beauty of a sunset. If the purpose of the university is to provide a home to these intellectual resources, its role is to sustain and to nurture them. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, it was a reform from the regulated market that obtained under Senator Stone's period of government, and one that we inherited. As I say, we did move to partially deregulate that market earlier in the year. Prior to that, the maximum wholesale price for LPG in Australia was set by a formula applied by the Government every six months. Earlier this year, we asked the Prices Surveillance Authority to set the maximum wholesale rate and maintained our export control powers in order not to interfere in the market but to ensure that the supply of gas to the local market rather than overseas was maintained. Those steps followed a long period of consultation with the industry, based on a discussion paper that we had issued for an orderly discussion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is fair to say that in that discussion period producers of LPG, Santos being one of them, argued for an immediate and total deregulation of the market and smaller consumers and a number of regional and local government authorities asked for the retention of full regulation. In asking for the retention of full regulation, members of the House of Representatives-Peter McGauran, Ian Sinclair, Charles Blunt, Noel Hicks, John Sharp, Ian Robinson, Tim Fischer and Wal Fife-supported regulation by regional local government authorities. In this chamber Senator Brownhill supported a claim for regulation by some of the local government authorities as well.</PARA>
<PARA> Weighing all the factors, the Government moved to partial deregulation on the basis that it wanted to provide a period to phase in change and to enable a number of infrastructural alterations to occur. I think our steps have been found to be justified. Major infrastructure improvement has occurred. There has been an upgrading of the LPG pipeline to the Dandenong truck loading facility, and a new truck loading facility is now being built at Hastings, Victoria, which will be completed in June. They will overcome supply blockages for LPG around Australia or, at least, in that area of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> This year has been a difficult year for the local LPG market, but we have not exercised our export control powers to prevent the export of LPG either. So Mr Adler's complaint of further regulation or more difficulty is, at least according to the record, not a justified complaint because we have not held up or stopped any exports overseas. Rather, we have preferred that the situation be one of phasing to fuller deregulation.</PARA>
<PARA> The Prices Surveillance Authority has considered the question of the wholesale price and has awarded wholesale price increases in LPG which are above the formula that the old government regulation approach would have provided. So the producers have in fact got a better return than would have been provided for under the old formula. Despite the National Party of Australia in the House and one of its representatives in this chamber being against the putting aside of much of this regulation, the Government intends to move to full deregulation, but in a phased way so that the market can accommodate the changes as we go.</PARA>

Has the Minister noted the report in today's Australian that air traffic control records show that landings and departures are currently running at about one-third of the normal level? Even allowing for the fact that some of the imported planes have slightly larger capacity than the normal domestic aircraft, does the Minister not agree that the claimed capacity in excess of 50 or 60 per cent-the figures that the Government has been using-significantly overstate the true position? Is it a fact that neither the Civil Aviation Authority nor the Department of Transport and Communications is making an independent assessment and that the figures that the Government keeps quoting are supplied by the airlines?

They also fail, as Senator Newman in effect acknowledged in passing in her question, to measure seating capacity; rather, they relate just to the numbers of aircraft.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Aulich has added a few embellishments to the question that I had in mind in this respect. The only connection between the two developments to which he referred is the Australian Government's clear-cut policy of recognition of Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor-a policy that was first adopted by the then Government in 1979 and which was reaffirmed by the present Government by prime ministerial statement on 22 August 1985. The Prime Minister, in making the point in 1985, made it clear that recognition of Indonesian sovereignty had permitted us to pursue human rights and aid issues in the province and that negotiations over the Timor Gap sea bed could in reality only take place with Indonesia. Certainly, successive Australian governments-not just ourselves but our predecessors-have taken the view that the only practical way to assist the people of East Timor is to work through the Indonesian authorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of bilateral aid, I took the initiative during the visit of Foreign Minister Ali Alatas in March to ask him about the Indonesian Government's opening of East Timor-the adoption of moves by the Government to open East Timor by putting it on the same civilian administration footing as other provinces, and the permitting of significantly freer movement to and from the province from elsewhere in Indonesia, while at the same time more readily granting access to foreigners, including Australian journalists. Against the background of that very significant policy development during the year, I asked my counterpart whether we might extend our bilateral aid effort in Indonesia to this province in addition to the quite substantial financial contributions Australia has been making for many years to the aid programs of international agencies operating in East Timor.</PARA>
<PARA> Subsequent consultations with the Indonesian planning authorities identified the agricultural sector as a top priority for Australian bilateral aid in East Timor. Our Ambassador in Jakarta, Mr Phil Flood, took the opportunity during his first visit to the province last week to announce a grant of $100,000 under the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau's small activities scheme to assist farmers there through the demonstration of improved but simple technologies relevant to their needs. I hope that in future we will be able to upgrade the amount of direct bilateral aid to that province.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the second part of the question, concerning the Portuguese reaction to the announced conclusion of the Timor Gap negotiations, the Portuguese Ambassador did call on me yesterday on instructions from his Government to reiterate earlier Portuguese statements that Australia's signature to and ratification, in due course, of the Timor Gap Zone of Cooperation Treaty would, in the view of the Portuguese, constitute a breach of international law. The Ambassador also stated again that Portugal would take due action after the signing of the Treaty in what he described as appropriate international forums and organisations. Similar representations were made a day earlier to our Ambassador in Lisbon.</PARA>
<PARA> I made it clear, in reply to the Portuguese Ambassador, that should Portugal seek to initiate any action in any forum, Australia would defend its position with vigour and determination. We are quite confident of our legal position on this matter. I have already indicated this in the Senate in more detail than it is necessary to go into now-in the adjournment debate of 20 March 1986 and in Question Time on 18 October last year. I should add, though, that we have taken the view since 1979 that whatever the unhappy circumstances and indeed, possible illegality, surrounding Indonesia's acquisition of East Timor in the mid-1970s, Indonesian sovereignty over that territory should be accepted not only on a de facto basis but on a de jure basis. There is no binding legal obligation not to recognise the acquisition of territory that was acquired by force. Such a recognition does not, of course, imply approval of the circumstances of the acquisition. In international law the legality of the original acquisition of territory by a state has to be distinguished in subsequent dealings between the state acquiring that new territory and other states-in this instance, Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The last point I want to make is that Australia has consistently supported discussions between Portugal and Indonesia under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General to resolve the lingering East Timor issue as it exists between those two countries. That is a matter that relates to the dispute between Portugal and Indonesia, to which Australia is not a party, and is quite separate from the Timor Gap negotiations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen a statement made by Mr Blunt on the 25th of last month. The statement raises two major points. The first is the conceptual ignorance which Mr Blunt displays on the principle of rent taxation. I will suggest later in my answer that he should take tutorials from Senator Stone in that regard. The second point is that, in typical old Country Party style, he has gone to an industry group and promised to give it a hand-out-a hand-out for which no allowance is made in the economic statement issued by the Opposition a couple of weeks ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In another part of the question I am asked whether this matter was discussed when I was doing the initial planning of the Government's policy, which was ultimately completed when Senator Evans was the responsible Minister, the framework for which was established when I was the responsible Minister. It was certainly discussed. Indeed, an offer was made to the industry for a wider base for deductability or a base from which the resource rent tax would be triggered in return for a higher taxation rate. The industry said very strongly at that stage-and I preferred a wider base and a higher rate-that it preferred the alternative, and that is what the Government agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear from Mr Blunt's statement that he is conceptually unaware of the fact that a rent tax, as distinct from any royalty, imposes no charge and has no detrimental impact on mining or marginal ore bodies or on producing oil from marginal oil fields.</PARA>

It is nice to see Senator Boswell in good spirits again. Mr Blunt did not make it clear whether he was advocating the abolition of the Government's petroleum rent tax. Just in case he is, I draw his attention to the evidence given by Senator Stone-or Mr Stone as he was then-to the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources on 6 March 1981. In response to a question by Senator Tate-I am quite happy to table this whole page of evidence but I intend to quote only a couple of sentences-Senator Stone said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I suppose that is what he had in mind. The answer to that suggestion is yes in some cases. In other words, Senator Stone as the then Secretary to the Treasury, as a responsible public servant in public evidence appearing before a Senate committee, said that there is a case for a resources rent tax. I suggest that Senator Stone take in hand his junior inexperienced and semi-economically literate National Party Leader in the House of Representatives and give him a tutorial about the meaning and nature of rent taxation.</PARA>

I think there is much greater evidence of credibility in terms of the Investment Monitor forecast. It says that investment is going into a broad range of industries. That is correct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Business investment increased by 15.5 per cent in 1988-89 and expectations for investment in this financial year remain high. I must make the point that it is taking place over a wide range of industries, including tourism and a wide spread of the manufacturing sector such as transport equipment, paper and printing, food processing and ferrous metals. In that sense it is in sharp contrast to the so-called investment boom of the early 1980s which was peddled around the country by the Opposition when it was in government. The earlier boom was dominated by mining and mineral processing, particularly aluminium. Some critics have said that this current investment phase merely involves modernising current productive capacity rather than greenfield projects. That is not necessarily true. It is inevitable that the nature of industry and investment patterns change.</PARA>
<PARA> If the Opposition cared to speak to the industry I think it would find out a great deal about new capacity being installed. For example, I took out a list today which showed investment already under way in basic metals in excess of $2 billion, in chemicals $420m, in pulp and paper $200m and in food processing $270m. I think the criticism also misses the point that modernising existing outmoded capacity also contributes to our export and import competing performance. The Government is justified in being pleased with this new investment surge which followed many years of poor investment performance in Australia, particularly through the 1970s. Substantial improvement in profits over recent years as a result of a variety of factors has been the major influence behind the strength in business investment. This influence has been reinforced by reductions in the size of the public sector in its borrowing requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> Dr Ed Shann, the author of the Investment Monitor, described this investment phase as a recipe for an export boom. The publication identifies six major investment projects close to completion that will generate nearly $5 billion extra export revenue per year. Other projects identified also have the potential for earning an additional $5 billion from exports within a few years. The essential point is that investment will certainly be a large and welcome boost to the supply side capacity of the Australian economy for many years to come. Although any projections, such as those contained in the Investment Monitor, must be treated with some caution, there is a lot of evidence in the pipeline already that many of the projections will be fulfilled.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some recent evidence suggests that the answer to the last part of the question is yes. Some people might argue that this is not a recent problem but a long standing problem. I recall that some friends of mine from Western Australia who knew quite a bit about the economics department of the University of Western Australia used to say that most of the graduates from that department did not understand the fundamental principles of the subject. I suspect that that is the case in relation to economics departments in most universities. Some would argue that it is especially the case in relation to the economics department of the University of Sydney, from which Mr Blunt holds a degree. There is some recent evidence suggesting that there are some deficiencies either in the training of economics graduates or perhaps in the innate intellectual capacity of some of those graduates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer in particular to documents that were issued in the past day or two by Mr Blunt, an economics graduate of the University of Sydney, and by Mr Shack, who I think is a Bachelor of Arts graduate from the University of Western Australia. I am not sure whether he did any economics units. What is displayed in these documents is an ignorance not just of economics but of the plain meaning of words. I shall quote two extracts from the documents. In relation to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and chemists' remuneration, both documents say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is incumbent upon the Government to provide pharmacists with a fair and reasonable level of remuneration.</PARA>
<PARA>They also say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . any rationalisation of the distribution of pharmacy outlets should be determined by market forces rather than government intervention.</PARA>
<PARA>Apparently, on the one hand it is the responsibility of government to underwrite pharmacists' income, while on the other hand it is the responsibility of the market to sort out the industry. Members opposite cannot have it both ways. Either it should be left to market forces or if governments are going to be involved they have a right to be involved across the whole spectrum. What is even more alarming about this document is that it shows us yet again that, despite the faces at the top having changed, the old Country Party is still alive and well. It deals in doublespeak. It gladhands various pressure groups, in the way that Mr Blunt did in relation to the Petroleum Exploration Association, promising that the coalition will partly abolish the resources rent tax, or, more accurately I suppose, take action to ensure that the amount of revenue collected would be massively reduced.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, this was not costed in the economic statement that the Opposition just put out.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I preface my question by saying that it is no longer of any concern in the community as to who was to blame for starting the air travel fiasco, or whether it was an error of judgment or a carefully planned ambush. What does matter is that I ask the Government-which, after all, is finally and ultimately responsible for ensuring the availability of air services and which has been intervening in this matter at all stages-the following questions: when will the Government be doing something-in fact, anything-to restore a proper service, free of charters and free of conscripts or servicemen, to Australia's travelling public? What provisions is the Government making for the thousands upon thousands of businesses, mainly small ones, suffering enormous losses but still confronted with periodic tax payments and the like when their income has in many cases already disappeared?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator gave a very deft opening to his question: `No longer will we be concerned about who is to blame for this situation which currently exists with the airlines', an extraordinary change of tactic from the Opposition benches, as there has been throughout the whole history of this situation with the airlines. Those opposite try one thing one week and another thing another week. They say, `Let us see how we get on. Let us see whether we can squeeze a little juice out of this unfortunate situation. Let us see whether we can get a little political mileage here and there'-not concerned about who is to blame. I know why they are not concerned about who is to blame: because they have been in cahoots with the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. That is why they do not want to consider who is to blame.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The new vocational register arrangements are designed to raise the standard in general practice and provide for better patient care. The changes come into effect from 1 December, when general practitioners who are vocationally registered will be entitled to an 8 per cent increase in Medicare fees and rebates. An 8 per cent increase for vocationally registered GPs is over and above the 5 per cent fee and rebate increase introduced for all GPs from 1 September. As well, GPs who enrol on the register will attract a further 3.9 per cent fee and rebate increase due to the fact that the items in the new Medicare benefit schedule do not correspond exactly with items in the existing schedule. In total, this provides a substantial financial incentive to encourage general practitioners to join the register and to strive to improve the quality of patient care. For patients, higher rebates should encourage increased direct billing and greater observance of schedule fees. Requirements should also lead to a better quality of patient care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am pleased to announce that, although it is only three weeks since letters were sent to all GPs inviting them to register, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners has already received more than two and a half thousand applications. It is receiving new applications at an average rate of 250 a day. I point out that for those GPs who do not qualify or do not choose to enrol, the current items will remain in the Medicare benefits schedule so that no-one will be disadvantaged or worse off. However, I urge general practitioners to apply as soon as possible, so that they and their patients do not miss out on the advantages of the vocational register. The number of applications that are beginning to come in shows the strong level of support for the new arrangements among the medical profession, a level of support which is sure to grow as general practitioners experience the new arrangements. Opposition to the changes would have denied a majority of doctors and their patients the benefits that these important changes bring in and an enhancement of the Medicare service itself. Fortunately, we are a reforming government. We were not deterred by the level of opposition and we now have an opportunity to improve substantially the medical service delivered through Medicare in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> In politics, it is often the case that we are criticised and never praised for things that we do. I compliment Senator Crowley, the Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Care, and honourable senators on both sides of the chamber who served on that Committee, reviewed the issue and supported what the Government is doing. It is indeed to their credit that we are now on the threshold of a major and significant initiative which will improve health care for all Australians and for medical practitioners into the future.</PARA>

Secondly, therefore, is it not true that those planning to retire prior to 1 July 1990 in order to avoid the changes in the administration to the reasonable benefit limits and to take their superannuation payout on the basis of the conditions that existed when they made decisions relevant to superannuation and retirement cannot do so?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The inquiry by the JCPA into the reform of the Australian Audit Office is one of the most significant inquiries undertaken by the Committee. The Government welcomes the Committee's report on the reform of the Australian Audit Office-the first major external review of the AAO since Federation-and the debate which has ensued as a result of the inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Audit Office has a special place in our institutional structures: it is rightly regarded as one of the major instruments that can contribute to efficient and accountable public administration. The Office was established by the Audit Act 1901-the fourth Act of the Australian Parliament following Federation. Similarly it was no accident that that Act, and subsequent amendments to it, have provided for the independence of the Auditor-General from both the Executive and the Parliament. It is common ground in this chamber that the independence of the Auditor-General is fundamental to his or her role and it cannot be compromised. </PARA>
<PARA> Since this Government came to power in 1983 we have introduced significant and wide-ranging reforms in the Commonwealth public sector. They include major budgetary and financial management initiatives and fundamental changes to the machinery of government. We are also in the process of reshaping Government business enterprises. All these reforms have been directed to improving the performance of the public sector in recognition of the fact that, not only will we get a better public sector, but also improvements in efficiency and effectiveness will translate into lower costs to the private sector. The performance orientation of the reforms has added a new dimension to the traditional notion of accountability-and that is accountability for results. It is through a greater focus on results that the most significant gains in efficiency and effectiveness will be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in this climate of reform that the Auditor-General has a key role. The Auditor-General is uniquely placed to facilitate improvements in public sector administration through the specialist skills of his Office, his broad powers of examination and the authority he has to report directly to Ministers and to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clearly in the interests of the Parliament and the Executive for the Australian Audit Office to be a viable and effective organisation keeping pace with changes that affect its operations and those of its auditees. The terms of reference of the inquiry were to investigate:</PARA>
<PARA> whether the Australian Audit Office had kept pace with developments in regard to the public audit function in the States and Territories and in comparable countries;</PARA>
<PARA> the Committee answered this question with a conditional `no'; and</PARA>
<PARA> whether current arrangements guaranteed the independence and resources necessary of the Australian Audit Office to fulfil its role as determined by the Audit Act 1901. </PARA>
<PARA> the Committee concluded that the answer to this question was `no'. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee pointed out that it sees the reasons for those negative answers as largely outside the control of the Auditor-General and the Audit Office. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee made some 78 recommendations arising from its inquiry. The Government agrees with the majority of the recommendations which require government decision, including those concerning:</PARA>
<PARA> the replacement of the existing Audit Act by a Financial Administration Act and an Audit Act;</PARA>
<PARA> revised arrangements concerning the appointment and term of the Auditor-General with a fixed seven year non-extendable term and the provision of an advisory input by Parliament; and</PARA>
<PARA> revised arrangements to provide Parliamentary input into the appointment of the Independent Auditor of the AAO. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government does not agree, however, with some of the Committee's recommendations dealing with the issues of independence, the resources for the AAO, and the Auditor-General's mandate. I will comment further on these more contentious issues. More detailed responses are set out in the document which I have tabled. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has made a number of recommendations directed to providing the Auditor-General with what is perceived to be greater independence from the Executive. They include making the Auditor-General an officer of the Parliament, establishing the AAO as a statutory authority, having the AAO's funding requirements reviewed by a new Parliamentary Audit Committee and including the AAO's appropriations in the Appropriations (Parliamentary Departments) Bill. As I have indicated, the Government fully accepts the fundamental principle that the Auditor-General should be functionally independent from the Executive. Just as importantly, however, the Auditor-General should also be functionally independent from the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the Executive and the Parliament have a legitimate interest in the maintenance of strong and effective audit machinery to review both the financial as well as efficiency aspects of departments' and agencies' activities. They both have a legitimate interest in the outcome of the Auditor-General's audits and recommendations for improvement and in the information on the operations of government agencies which is provided by the Auditor-General's reports. After all, good government demands good administration. Moreover, both the Parliament-and its committees-and Ministers have a legitimate role to request the Auditor-General to undertake particular audits. But in each case it is for the Auditor-General alone to decide at the end of the day, whether he will accede to such requests. </PARA>
<PARA> The current provisions of the Audit Act provide for the statutory independence of the Auditor-General. Nothing put forward by the Committee has in any way suggested that these statutory provisions have been ineffective. Further, with the independence of the Auditor-General not at issue, the Government sees no particular advantage to the Parliament, the Executive, or the Auditor-General in establishing the Auditor-General as an officer of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether the Parliament wishes to establish an Audit Committee to advise the Auditor-General on Parliament's audit priorities and to consider the AAO's finances is really a question for the Parliament. I would point out, however, that care would need to be exercised so that such a committee was not seen to put pressure on the Auditor-General to pursue particular topics, thus compromising his ability to determine priorities. As for any committee role in reviewing the Audit Office's finances, the Government would be prepared to consider any comments the committee might make but would reserve the right to accept or reject any such comments. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this background the Government has not accepted the Committee's recommendation that the Audit Office's appropriations be included in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill. There appears to be no real advantage to the AAO in taking that course of action. In analysing AAO resource needs, the Government will continue to apply the same rigorous methodology, criteria, tests of value for money, et cetera as it applies for other agencies-taxpayers expect and deserve no more and no less. Indeed, consistent with that, let me reiterate a point I have made on other occasions-it is an established principle of our system of government, reflected by provisions in the Constitution, that every publicly funded agency, including the AAO and the Parliament, must have its appropriations set by the Executive Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to give further consideration to the recommendation that the AAO be established as a statutory authority when it receives the report of an independent review which is to be conducted of the AAO's capacity to make better use of resources, to which I will refer shortly.</PARA>
<PARA>Resourcing Levels</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The issue of whether the current arrangements ensure sufficient resources for the AAO to fulfil its charter was central to the Committee's inquiry. As I indicated earlier, the Committee concluded the answer to this question was no. The Committee has proposed that an additional $15.7m per annum-be provided to the AAO with the increase to be phased in over five years to allow the AAO to adopt regular cycles of efficiency audits of Government bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say that the Committee's analysis of the resource issues presented in the report leaves something to be desired. It has merely made a very simplistic comparison between the number of Government bodies audited by the Auditor-General and the level of AAO staffing. The Government is disappointed that the Committee did not examine the resource question in the context of:</PARA>
<PARA> the steps already taken by the Auditor-General to improve the effectiveness of the AAO;</PARA>
<PARA> the significant investment in computing facilities for the Audit Office agreed by the Government in the 1987-88 Budget;</PARA>
<PARA> the more risk based approach to auditing being promoted by the Auditor-General which could be expected to generate internal efficiencies within the Audit Office thus freeing up resources which could be directed to efficiency auditing; and</PARA>
<PARA> the flexibility the Office has to vary the existing allocation of its total resources in favour of efficiency auditing by reassessing priorities. </PARA>
<PARA>It is also noteworthy that evidence given to the Committee by the then Auditor-General of Victoria and the Auditor-General for South Australia indicated they had increased their activity in efficiency auditing without increased resources, in the South Australian case in a situation where total resources employed by the Auditor-General had actually decreased. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent report of the independent auditor on an efficiency audit of the AAO indicates that there are opportunities for efficiencies arising from a reduction in testing transactions during the year, through computerisation of audit programs, a reduction in documentation and the selection of more cost-effective audit techniques such as risk based audit sampling and analytical reviews. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this background, the Government is not convinced that a sufficient case has been made to warrant the increase proposed by the Committee which is equivalent to an almost 60 per cent increase in resources for the AAO. It has however decided that additional funding be provided for efficiency audits of $2m per annum on an ongoing basis with $1.33m to be provided on pro rata basis for the balance of this financial year in the Additional Estimates pending a more systematic review of the resourcing question than the Committee undertook. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, with the agreement of the Auditor-General, has decided to commission an independent review by the Auditor-General of South Australia, Mr T. A. Sheridan, to work with the AAO to advise the Auditor-General and the Government on the AAO's capacity to improve further the use of existing resources. This review will build on the initiatives taken by the Auditor-General to date in improving the effectiveness of the AAO and will also take account of recommendations in the efficiency audit report on the AAO by the AAO's independent auditor and of changes which may be recommended to the Auditor-General as a consequence of this review. The formal terms of reference for this review are included in the document which I have tabled. There is no suggestion that the resources of the Audit Office will be reduced as a result of this review. Any proposals for further resources for the AAO will be considered in the 1990 Budget context. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Sheridan's background and standing will ensure that this review is both independent and professional. I should like to acknowledge the South Australian Government's assistance in making this arrangement. Mr Sheridan has been asked to report to the Auditor-General and to the Government by 31 March 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>Auditor-General's Mandate</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has recommended the Auditor-General be reinstated as the external auditor of statutory marketing authorities (SMAs) and government business enterprises (GBEs). The Government has carefully considered this issue and, while disposed to accept the Committee's recommendations, has decided to give further consideration to the matter when it receives the report of the independent review of the AAO that I have announced, which is due to report in March 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also recommended that the Auditor-General's mandate to conduct efficiency audits at his discretion be increased to allow the Auditor-General to undertake efficiency audits of companies. The Government has reviewed this recommendation in conjunction with a review of the efficiency audit provisions pertaining to GBEs. The Government considers that in the ordinary course of events there is little to be gained by subjecting GBEs, whether they are companies or statutory authorities, to efficiency audits as they are now being made subject to commercial disciplines through the focus of the reforms on targets and related performance measurement. The Government proposes, however, that a Minister of the Parliament may request the Auditor-General to carry out an efficiency audit of a GBE or GBE subsidiary. </PARA>
<PARA> GBEs and their subsidiaries aside, the Government agrees the Auditor-General should have the discretion to undertake efficiency audits of other Government controlled companies which are not subject to the discipline of the marketplace to be efficient. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Chairman of the Committee, Mr Robert Tickner, MP, and the Committee members are to be commended for undertaking this inquiry. The Committee's report has been a catalyst for debate, and for change. Where the Government has agreed to the Committee's recommendations it will seek to implement the changes as soon as practicable. Where legislative changes are required these will be taken up in the drafting of the new legislation to replace the existing Audit Act. </PARA>
<PARA> As a final comment I want to stress that there can be no question but that this Government will defend and preserve the Auditor-General's functional independence. The Government takes good public administration and effective accountability to taxpayers very seriously and it is precisely for these reasons that, even while recognising the special place of the AAO in our institutional structures, this Government considers that the Office should be subject to the same financial disciplines and resources scrutiny that apply to other budget funded agencies. I do not believe the Auditor-General would disagree. </PARA>
<PARA> I am confident that as a result of the Committee's report and the efforts of the current Auditor-General, we will have a stronger and more effective Audit Office as we move into the next decade. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>The office of Auditor-General was one of the first posts created after Federation. I think, as the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) said, the Act establishing that office was the fourth Act of the Federal Parliament. The position was established under the Audit Act 1901, and that Act created a legislative basis for the financial management of Commonwealth moneys and for the audit of related accounts. In 1911 the Auditor-General's Office was included under the Prime Minister's portfolio for administrative and budgetary purposes, and that arrangement continued for 75 years until 1985-86 when the Office came under the control of the Finance portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> The report of the Joint Committee on Public Accounts-report No. 296-is a very important one. I mention in passing that two of my colleagues, Senator John Watson, who is the Deputy Chairman of the Committee, and Senator Bronwyn Bishop, who is a member, will be seeking to supplement my remarks on this very important statement that the Minister has just put down. That report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts presented the first comprehensive inquiry into the Audit Office since its establishment. That in itself is a rather remarkable tribute to the quality of the work performed by the Office, but it perhaps raises a question as to whether we may have been a little too complacent about the work of the Office over time. After all, 88 years is quite a long time to go unreported upon. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister has said, there were a great number of recommendations-78 in all, I think-in the report. But, in responding to the Minister's statement, I want to focus on two areas-firstly, the question of independence of the Auditor's office and, secondly, the much lesser but nevertheless significant question of the role of the Auditor's office in auditing accounts of public corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1901, the role and responsibilities of the Australian Audit Office have expanded very greatly. In report No. 296, the Committee reported that the Office is straining under the pressure. For example, only 10 years ago, in 1979, the Audit Act was amended to permit the Auditor-General to undertake efficiency audits which, I may say, go well beyond mere bookkeeping and involve review of the dynamics of the management and financial practice of the body being audited. However, owing to lack of resources, it is estimated, as the Committee reported, that large programs with income and expenditure greater than $10m can be expected to be subject to an efficiency audit, given the present resources of the Auditor-General's Office, only once every 40 years. That clearly raises some questions about the adequacy of the resources available to the Auditor-General. Report No. 296 argued, I think quite properly, that this scenario was not consistent with a maximum effort to improve the public sector's efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> The report criticised the tendency in recent years towards allowing certain kinds of instrumentalities the right to appoint their own auditors. It found that the effect of that tendency was to reduce the flow of financial information on government owned companies available to Ministers and the Parliament. In turn, it suggested that this development led, and is continuing to lead, to a lessening in Parliament's ability to make and oversee sound laws, and to a weakening of the accountability of executive government to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> A particular weakness highlighted by report No. 296 was that the Department of Finance was now the principal adviser of executive government on the resources that should be allocated to the Australian Audit Office. Not to put too fine a point on it, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts has suggested that in this situation there is the potential for a significant conflict of interest. </PARA>
<PARA> On the principal issue of independence, the Committee came to the view that the major inadequacies identified in the report would be best overcome by promoting a closer relationship between the Auditor-General and the Parliament as distinct from the Executive. A specific recommendation in that respect was that the Auditor-General should in fact formally become an officer of the Parliament, and that an audit committee of Parliament be established to become Parliament's principal source of advice on the resources of the Audit Office, the objective of this being to reduce the influence of executive government over the audit of public accounts and thereby to improve the accountability of the public sector to the Parliament as distinct from the Executive. </PARA>
<PARA> Almost all submissions to the Public Accounts Committee's inquiry acknowledged that the question of independence or, more specifically, the acknowledgment of the independence of the Auditor-General for executive government interference, was a paramount matter for consideration. The Joint Committee report revealed some alarm that the Executive Government's control of the budgetary resources being made available to the Auditor-General through the Department of Finance had raised questions about the actual independence of his Office. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate of the particularly significant parting words of the immediate past Auditor-General, Mr John Monaghan, with whom I am personally acquainted. He worked for me at one stage, and I have a very high regard for him. I am sure he did not utter these words lightly, although I have not discussed his opinion with him. When he retired in 1987, he fired what I think can only be termed a broadside at the constraining role of the Department of Finance and raised the question whether no Audit Office at all would be better than the existing system. They were strong words coming from a retiring-and, indeed, Mr Monaghan is a retiring person in a different sense of that word-Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast to the present system in Australia, the Committee considered an alternative model from Canada which, without going into detail, it declined to follow, and considered in particular the model now obtaining in the United Kingdom. I want to say a little about that before concluding these remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1983, the present Government of the United Kingdom moved positively away from an audit model which was in fact broadly similar to that which we have at present. Since that time, the Comptroller and Auditor-General, as he is called in the United Kingdom, has been wholly independent of the Executive. He is now appointed by the Queen on an address from the House of Commons which is moved by the Prime Minister after agreement with the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. He can be removed from office only by the Queen on an address by both Houses of Parliament, rather like our procedures for the removal of a High Court judge. His salary is paid directly from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, without requiring annual approval of the Executive or the Parliament once appointed. He appoints his own staff and determines their numbers, grades, salaries and conditions of service within, of course, the totality of funds allocated to the running of his office. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very important to note that the Comptroller and Auditor-General is an officer of the House of Commons. His main duties are carried out on behalf of the Parliament, in which context he works in very close association with the all-party Public Accounts Committee, the equivalent of our Joint Committee of Public Accounts. Each year he-it is `he' at the moment, at any rate-submits proposed Budget estimates to a different committee of the Westminster Parliament, the Public Accounts Commission, which considers the proposal and submits it, with any modifications it thinks fit, to the House of Commons. That commission, which determines, as I say, the budget of what we would call the Audit Office, consists of the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, the Leader of the House of Commons and seven other members appointed by the House, none of whom shall be a Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Report No. 296 from our Joint Committee recommends for Australia a similar model to that of the United Kingdom. It recommends setting up an audit committee of Parliament similar to the Public Accounts Commission to which I was referring a moment ago. The membership as proposed by our Committee would be an all-party one but would in this case also include the Minister for Finance, thereby taking account at least of the strong views expressed by or on behalf of the Minister about the need for the Executive to continue to be involved-the Minister puts it much more strongly than that-in the determination of the resources available to the Audit Office. Report No. 296 notes that, since the Minister would be a member, the funding bids from the Audit Office would be subject to the same level of analysis and evaluation as normal departmental appropriations. Finally, the Joint Committee proposed that the estimates for the AAO would be included in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> In his response today the Minister said that he does not accept those views. Without labouring the point at this time, I have to say that the Minister has given a rather slender justification for that view. He has simply indicated that basically the Government does not agree. Apart from that, the only argument, if one could call it that, that the Minister has put forward is that the Committee analysis of this matter was-in what I think were the words he used-simplistic or over-simplistic. I do not think very much of that form of reasoning. The Minister is proposing that we should leave the status quo. I remind the Senate that the United Kingdom Public Accounts Committee in its 1981 report, which led up to the 1983 changes which I have just described, said of their then system, which was virtually identical with our present system:</PARA>
<PARA>The best that can be said for the present administrative arrangements is that they work. But there might well be dangers for parliamentary accountability-</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the words `parliamentary accountability'-</PARA>
<PARA>in the present very close relationship between the Exchequer-</PARA>
<PARA>in our case, read `Department of Finance'-</PARA>
<PARA>and Audit Department. </PARA>
<PARA>In his statement today the Minister has also stressed the need for the Australian Audit Office to be subject to the same requirements of budgetary control and the same resource review as what one might call normal departments of state. There is a proper distinction to be drawn; nevertheless, as report No. 296 of the Joint Public Accounts Committee stated, the principle that the Executive takes expenditure proposals to Parliament-which I think was the principle that Senator Walsh was seeking to insist upon-would not be infringed by the Committee's proposal because the estimates for the Australian Audit Office would be included in Appropriation Bills just as they are now. They would be in a different area of those Bills, but they would still be subject to review and scrutiny by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The important difference would be that the process by which estimates, including forward estimates, for the Audit Office would be arrived at would be very different indeed. The procedure would no longer be solely under the control of the Minister for Finance and his Department and would be consistent with the principle that the entire Parliament has a special interest in maintaining an independent and able Audit Office. I express considerable disappointment with the position which has just been stated by the Minister on behalf of the Government. It is not necessarily a position which the Opposition will want to adopt in due course when we have the power to do so-which I think will not be far distant. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to say something very briefly about the second matter I mentioned-namely, the role of private sector auditors in this area. Recommendations 19 to 24 of report No. 296 stated, inter alia, that the Auditor-General should be reinstated as the external auditor of all Commonwealth government business enterprises and statutory marketing authorities and their subsidiaries. However, it qualified this to some degree by stating that the Auditor-General should maintain the power and ability to contract out to private sector auditors the undertaking of audits on his behalf and, importantly, subject to his control. </PARA>
<PARA> Those recommendations were prompted, I think, by the recent trend in the Federal government arena to allow various Commonwealth authorities to choose their own auditors. I suppose one could say that that trend has been rationalised by the Government on the grounds that it is consistent with encouraging the further commercialisation of these bodies. Under some circumstances that argument would appeal to me. However, in line with the coalition's view on privatisation, authorities of this kind cannot become truly commercial while they still retain government ownership. Obviously if they were to be privatised they would have the same right as any other body to choose their own auditors. But it seems to us that they cannot have it both ways. They cannot remain within the public sector and seek to behave in that sense just as though they were in the private sector-to choose those parts of privatisation which they prefer, if I can put it that way. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that taxpayers' money is involved, we believe that a higher degree of accountability is required and, indeed, demanded by the public than is the case for privately owned commercial ventures. The Australian Audit Office is cognisant of this extra duty, the extra level of auditing concern, in its audit tasks. We have found recommendations 19 to 24 of the report-namely, that the Auditor-General remain in control of all external audits-appealing. I conclude my remarks by noting that my colleagues Senator Watson and Senator Bishop will be supplementing them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Joint Committee of Public Accounts report No. 296 is the result of the first comprehensive parliamentary-in fact, governmental-inquiry into the Australian Audit Office since the establishment of the Audit Office in 1901. In those 88 years the roles of governments and evaluations by parliaments have changed quite dramatically, as have the responsibilities of the Australian Audit Office. The Committee examined the role of the Australian Audit Office and the Auditor-General in the light of those many complex changes. As Vice-Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts I wish to take this opportunity to thank the Government for its commendation for the Committee undertaking this inquiry and the Government's acknowledgment that the Committee's report has been a catalyst for debate and change. I also welcome the fact that in those areas where the Government has agreed to the Committee's recommendations it will seek to implement the changes as soon as practicable and that legislative changes that are required will be taken up in the drafting of the new legislation to replace the existing Audit Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We welcome these responses but a number of us find it very difficult to follow some negative responses and conclusions, particularly the rationale behind the Government's conclusions. A disappointing feature of the Government's response is that a number of statements, issues and conclusions within it are patently wrong. Perhaps I would be a little unkind if I suggested that this document had essentially been written by some officers of the Department of Finance who saw in some of the Committee's wide-ranging recommendations-which not only involve changes to the Australian Audit Office but also directly and indirectly affect the overview functions of the Department of Finance-a lessening of the role of the Department of Finance and that, perhaps, there was not a small element of professional jealousy at the loss of their rights and responsibilities in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> If I may be permitted to provide a precis or overview of the Government's response, I suggest that it is not entirely surprising, given the very strong views of the Government on independence and resource allocation not being transferred to the Parliament but being retained by the Executive. This raises the whole question of parliamentary supremacy and the concern that a lot of parliamentarians have about the increasing control of the Executive, particularly over the Parliament and parliamentary officers. I find the Government's reaction not surprising, given that the Government and the Minister for Finance have strident views about financial control through the executive arm of Government. I do not find it surprising therefore that, while lip service is provided in the response to the report over such issues as the independence of the Auditor-General and his office, the Government has rejected the practical means for achieving the meaningful independence that is required under the Act by a democratic parliament. In other words, the Government has failed, while providing lip service acknowledgment to that independence, to provide a meaningful way of achieving that independence; and I believe that is to be regretted. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very happy with the Government's acceptance of the replacement of the existing Audit Act by a financial administration Act and an audit Act. Two Acts to replace this single outmoded Act are certainly overdue. I welcome the Government's decision to put into place two new Acts at an early opportunity. I also welcome the revised arrangements concerning the appointment and the term of the Auditor-General, with a fixed seven-year, non-extendable term and the provision of an advisory input by Parliament. But having regard to the way that the Government has emasculated that advisory input by Parliament, one tends to wonder how effective that can be in future. We note the revised arrangements to provide for parliamentary input into the appointment of the independent auditor of the Australian Audit Office. </PARA>
<PARA> What surprises me, and I am deeply disappointed, is that on page 4 of the report, when talking about resourcing levels-and these are issues that were frequently canvassed in recent reports of the Auditor-General in his submissions to Parliament-the Government comes to an earnest conclusion that it is disappointed that the Committee did not examine the resource question in that context, because we did precisely that. How it can come to that conclusion certainly baffles me as Deputy Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The Committee deliberately examined in detail the steps that had already been taken by the Auditor-General to improve the effectiveness of the Australian Audit Office. To that end, we employed the Auditor-General of Canada to make such an evaluation as part of our other evaluations. We also brought over a high official in this area from the New Zealand Audit Office. We did address the fact that significant investment in computing facilities for the Australian Audit Office has been agreed. We did acknowledge the more risk based approach to auditing which has been adopted in recent years by Auditors-General. We did acknowledge that this approach generated greater internal efficiencies within the Audit Office.They are to be applauded. </PARA>
<PARA> The flexibility that the Australian Audit Office has to vary existing allocation of its total resources in favour of efficiency auditing by reassessing priorities was one of the most disappointing aspects of the Government's response, apart from this question of independence. I will not canvass that matter again, because I believe it was adequately covered by my colleague Senator Stone. But I do believe that there was a continual blinkered approach by the Government in its failure to acknowledge and provide adequate resourcing levels-despite all those things that the Auditor-General has done and the fact that he has not been able to devote resources to an adequate level of efficiency auditing as a result of the severe constraints that have tended to push his resources more into the fiscal and compliance area-for the minimum obligations that he must perform in order to discharge his statutory duties to the Parliament. So the Government's failure to accept that aspect is very much a disappointing feature of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> Another inconsistency in the Government's response is that, while the Government has decided to appoint Mr Sheridan to advise the Australian Auditor-General, it has effectively pre-empted some of his conclusions when the Government itself, on page 5 of its response, acknowledges that there is a need for increased resources. Although the Government does not agree to a 60 per cent increase in resources, it is prepared to allocate $2m per annum on an ongoing basis with $1.33m to be provided for the balance of this financial year in the additional estimates pending a more systematic review of the resourcing question for efficiency audits. While the Government is appointing Mr Sheridan to look at this question of resourcing, workload and efficiency of the Office, to some extent the Government's response is overriding or pre-empting some of his outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA> I would not like to end on a pessimistic note. We have certainly turned the first stone. The Government has reacted in a predictable way. In those areas in which it has responded positively, I thank the Government. I look forward to early legislation so that some changes can be made in those areas where it has responded so positively, although it is generally a very positive response by the Government to the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In joining my colleagues Senator Stone and Senator Watson in commenting on the response of the Government to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts report No. 296, I think it is important to draw the attention of the Senate to the title of that report-The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament. Embodied in that title is exactly why the Committee made recommendations in an attempt to have a proper scrutiny of the expenditure of public moneys by the executive arm of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Quite clearly, the expenditure of public moneys has to be accountable and the only body to whom that accountability can be made is the Parliament. Inherent in that process has to be the role of the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General is, if you like, the link between the Executive that makes policy and the public sector which then carries out that policy and expends money for and on behalf of the Parliament-money that is appropriated by the Parliament, although the amounts are set by the executive arm of government, but it is the Parliament which appropriates the funds. The Auditor-General is the fundamental link in reporting back to the Parliament to ensure that proper scrutiny can take place. This process is carried out through the Public Accounts Committee and the Estimates committees-and I was interested to read a report by the Ombudsman, who puts forward a very good case as to why he, too, is part of the process of scrutiny-which are tools that the Parliament has at its disposal to ensure that proper accountability is made for the expenditure of public moneys. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very interested to read the statement that accompanied the Government response, presented by Senator Walsh. It is interesting to note that on page 2 of the original typescript of his ministerial statement he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not agree, however, with some of the Committee's recommendations dealing with the issues of independence, the resources for the AAO, and the Auditor-General's mandate. </PARA>
<PARA>These issues go right to the heart of the substance of the report-The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament. The question of independence, which Senator Stone dealt with, is of crucial importance to the role of democracy as we know it. On page 3 of his statement Senator Walsh said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government . . . accepts the fundamental principle that the Auditor-General should be functionally independent from the Executive. Just as importantly, however, the Auditor-General should also be functionally independent from the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>In making that statement Senator Walsh is dealing with the recommendations that were made by the Public Accounts Committee which were designed to make the Australian Audit Office and the Auditor-General independent of the executive arm of government and accountable to the Parliament. It is not a question of the Auditor-General being functionally independent from the Parliament; it is a question of the Auditor-General being responsible in the accounting process to the Parliament which, in turn, represents the people. That is the only way that accountability can take place. Senator Walsh further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Both the Executive and the Parliament have a legitimate interest in the maintenance of strong and effective audit machinery . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We have more than a legitimate interest; we have a fundamental responsibility to the people to carry out that scrutiny. Senator Walsh went on to say, `After all, good government demands good administration'. But he does not add the further point that it also demands good accountability. He further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The current provisions of the Audit Act provide for the statutory independence of the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA>So they do, but as we have seen only too often, if one limits the resources of the Auditor-General, one can limit his performance. If we say `We won't give you the resources to properly carry out your task', in fact the Auditor-General is prohibited from carrying out that task. Senator Walsh further stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing put forward by the Committee has in any way suggested that these statutory provisions have been ineffective. </PARA>
<PARA>That comment puts a slightly different light on what the Committee had to say. The Committee said that it had seen no evidence that the Auditor-General had been prevented from carrying out essential parts of his work. However, the Auditor-General did say that he was precluded from carrying out the efficiency audits which have become such an integral and important part of that accountability process. Overseas experience has shown that independence-and that means a truly financial independence from the executive arm of government-in systems which are similar to ours has become a very important point. Senator Stone dealt very well with the example of the British experience. </PARA>
<PARA> When one reads the report and the response of the Government, one sees that the report is a document of some considerable substance, and that the response is perhaps a much lighter document. It certainly does not attempt to deal with many of the issues that were raised in the Committee's report. On page 4 of the response from the Government, and in response to the recommendation of the Committee dealing with the Australian Audit Office's requirement that its appropriations be included in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill, the Government says that somehow it would be wrong to treat the Audit Office in a way which is different from the way that it treats other parts of government. It says that to do so would place the Australian Audit Office in a unique and perhaps favoured position. The whole contention of the report that was brought down by the Public Accounts Committee is that the Australian Audit Office is in a unique position. It is the link between government expenditure and the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In other parts of the Government's response and in Senator Walsh's statement we see reference to the Committee's recommendations concerning the Auditor-General's mandate. Recommendations Nos 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24 deal with the mandate of the Auditor-General. The Government, in its response, says:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is disposed to accept the Committee's recommendations. However, it has decided to give further consideration to this issue after it receives the report of the independent review of the AAO's use of resources, due in March 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>This report is to be entitled the Sheridan inquiry. Yet, on page 11, in responses numbered 37 and 38, the Government refers to the new arrangements that it has put in place concerning government business enterprises (GBEs). Although the recommendations dealt with in response No. 35 in fact refer to government business enterprises, responses Nos 37 and 38 tend to contradict response No. 35. Response No. 37 states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . focus of GBE accountability in future is to be on results rather than on processes involved in managerial decision making. </PARA>
<PARA>Again we see this artificial distinction which the Executive Government has chosen to make in several of its statements. It has attempted to make a distinction between process and outcome. In my view this is a totally artificial distinction because it is possible to have an outcome which is adjudged to be both successful and improper at the same time. If the process is improper and corrupted, so is the outcome, so it is necessary to look at both matters. If one needs to be reminded of the sorts of things that can occur, one should look at the evidence which is currently being given before the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales dealing with Mr Ross, who has been an employee of the Department of Administrative Services. One will realise that the opportunity for improper behaviour lies well and truly within the Commonwealth public sector. Response No. 38 states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Government considers there is little to be gained by subjecting GBEs, whether they are companies or statutory authorities . . . to efficiency audits as the discipline to be efficient is imposed through the focus on targets and related performance measurement. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the Government proposes that a Minister may request that the Auditor-General carry out an efficiency audit. There is a contention flowing through both the arrangements applying to GBEs and in some of the responses made to the recommendations in the report that somehow GBEs are now responsive to commercial demands of the marketplace. Until such time as GBEs are totally free of the public sector and become privatised, I think the standards of accountability that apply to the public sector and the private sector remain totally separate. After all, in the private sector an individual chooses to invest his or her money in a company and if that person judges that the company is not well run he or she can then sell those shares but the choice has been that person's in the first place. Government enterprises are run with taxpayers' money and the taxpayer does not have an option as to whether or not he wants his money to go into a particular government enterprise. So the accountability process and the effect of the market on that process are totally different aspects. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Watson said that we are pleased that the Government has responded in a positive way to many of the recommendations that were made by the Committee. I join with him in saying that we are pleased that that has occurred. I think that to say that the Auditor-General remains sufficiently independent while his resources are set entirely by the executive arm of government is really to miss a fundamental point addressed by report No. 296. I can only express my great disappointment that the Auditor-General is not to gain his resources in an independent way so that he may truly be an ally of the people and of the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The report gives a good coverage of the problems faced by the Corporate Affairs Commission, particularly the constraints as a result of a substantial reduction in staff. It also incorporates detailed information regarding the Commission's activities during the year. Obviously, the financial constraints placed upon the Commission have had an impact on its performance during the year. However, I find it disappointing to note the lack of a corporate plan and, indeed, a lack of the Commission's objectives for the future. It is also disappointing that the report fails to address a number of issues which have been thrown up as a result of the work of its activities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the report adequately details aspects of its enforcements and meeting the requirements of the Companies Act and outlining the prosecutions that have taken place and the penalties that have been imposed. Quite clearly, there are a number of concerns covering the administration of corporate law in Australia. These concerns arise particularly as a result of some recent corporate failures and the activities of some overzealous entrepreneurial corporate executives. Perhaps in the future, might I suggest, the Commission might like to address areas such as the need for identifying needed changes to legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me detail some areas that I think should be addressed. Firstly, there is considerable doubt in the legal fraternity as to whether unpaid premium could be claimable in the event of a liquidation. Clearly, this is quite unsatisfactory and runs contrary to the whole intent and thrust of corporate law. Yet nothing has been done about it. Papers have been written. It has been before a number of commissions. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, and this was highlighted by the Herscu-Hooker fiasco, there appears to be some doubt in some legal practitioners' minds as to whether in some circumstances uncalled or unpaid capital can be made available to creditors in the event of liquidation. Just as the Reserve Bank of Australia insists on certain prudential standards for banks to follow, I think it is also appropriate that corporate law should install some prudential standards not only to protect creditors and shareholders and the like but also to protect the national indebtedness from overflowing to unacceptable levels. </PARA>
<PARA> Had we a simple corporate law requirement, for example, that required that prior to any major acquisition there be a 1 : 1 debt to equity ratio, or 100 per cent depending on how we like to put it, there would certainly have been very much less reliance by the highly geared companies that have embarked on this binge of takeovers by borrowing money overseas or generally. There would have been a limitation, a clamp. This would have certainly benefited the national economy. A single and logical amendment is all that is required. But governments do not appear to be interested. Whether they be Territory, State or even at the national level, they refuse to take adequate measures to apply these practices, practices that tend to limit our exposure to foreign debt problems. Clearly, some of these arrangements have to be looked at by the National Companies and Securities Commission. I do not believe that the State and Territory corporate affairs commissions can entirely wash their hands of such occurrences and leave it to the National Companies and Securities Commission or to the Henry Bosches of this world. There is a need for reform. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to make a few short comments on the Health Insurance Commission annual report 1988-89. I have had some concern in previous years that the Health Insurance Commission does not detail the amount of the actual reserve of Medibank Private in each State and Territory in dollar terms and for each month as at the year ending 30 June 1989. I would dearly like to know why that information is not detailed in the annual report. More importantly, I would like to know how it is that the money is actually rolled up in the annual report when each State by law is a separate fund. I think there is some concern in the community that there is some manipulation of funds, some reserve that may well be going to other States that are less profitable. I ask whether Medibank Private is looking to increase the contributions in each State and, if so, when. All of these questions are not answered in the annual report. It would also be interesting to know from the report what would happen to any surplus funds if any State had an excess. Once again, this is difficult to ascertain from the annual report. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing I am quite concerned about in terms of the lack of detail provided in this report is that the real costs of Medicare are not detailed. In referring to the real cost I, of course, mean the levy and the cost to general revenue as well. Details of this may well be in the report somewhere, but it is neatly disguised. I think the people of Australia deserve to know what is happening to the money. They should know where the necessary money is coming from. We all know full well that the levy of 1 1/4 per cent is not covering anywhere near the total cost of Medicare, and the Medicare blow-out is becoming more and more excessive. </PARA>
<PARA> The Medibank Private side of things is a great concern as well. Medibank Private does have an unfair advantage over the other private health insurance funds, fundamentally because it is subsidised by the taxpayer and has all the benefits that are accorded to it as that type of organisation. If it were forced to run along the same profit and loss lines as the private health insurance companies I am sure that it would not be in the state that it is in, particularly in New South Wales, where it is absolutely flush with funds. Yet other States are less well off. At this stage I simply raise those issues. I hope that at some stage, probably during the committee stage of the Appropriation Bills, I will be able to find out the answers to some of the questions that I have raised in relation to the report. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 25 of the report of the 107th session of the National Health and Medical Research Council there is a list of some of the designated NHMRC priorities. One of these, of course, is dental health and the impact of change in oral health status on dental education and work force practices and services in Australia, and this includes fluoridation of the water supply. Recently, the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Assembly voted to remove the fluoride from the water supply. This was a progressive step, a commonsense move which, unfortunately, has since been rescinded. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats have consistently opposed the use of the chemical fluoride in Australia. The ACT Assembly seemed to be agreeing with the Democrats' stand and, indeed, with the opinion of over half the residents of Canberra, when it voted to remove the fluoride. However, the troglodytes, the flat earthers, have prevailed and the fluoride is back in the water. This is unfortunate because fluoride is a poison. It is actually a rat poison when used in high concentrations. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people who oppose the use of fluoride are called cranks. If so, these cranks include the National Research Council of Canada, the Ministry of the Environment in Quebec, the Danish Agency for International Protection and the Swedish Fluoride Commission. All these agencies questioned the present addition of fluoride to the drinking water. If these be cranks, I suppose we are cranks, too. The fact is that we are now being bombarded with fluoride compounds, from aluminium smelting and other industrial processes, which enter the food and beverage chain. In addition, it is almost impossible to purchase dental health products which do not contain fluoride. Even if one argues that in 1945 or so, when fluoride was first put into the water in the United States, it might have been beneficial, certainly now the situation has changed. We have so much fluoride in our environment. </PARA>
<PARA> A scientist at the Australian National University here in Canberra, Dr Mark Diesendorf, has demonstrated that the rate of tooth decay in fluoridation areas does not differ from areas where no fluoride at all is used-and this might be because of the amount of fluoride in our environment. In fact, Brisbane does not use fluoride in its water-and Senator Macklin is agreeing with me on that. Yet the rate of tooth decay in Brisbane is no greater than the rate of tooth decay in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> It has not been demonstrated that fluoridation increases the health of people. In fact, it can be demonstrated that quite the opposite is the case. Fluoride has a number of known health effects. The symptoms most commonly reported are: headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, sight sensitivity, forgetfulness, belching, wind, stomach pain, lassitude, oppression of chest, lameness of hips and knees, arthritic aches and pains, sleeplesness, itching skin, and sore mouth and gums. These symptoms afflict about one per cent of the population. In Australia that would be about 150,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Who benefits from fluoride? First, there is the aluminium industry, because it is able to get rid of a by-product which would be very difficult to dispose of otherwise. The junk food industry benefits. It can advertise that it is all right for people to drink lots of coca-cola and eat lots of sugar because there is fluoride in the water which will prevent cavities. </PARA>
<PARA> The obvious conclusion is that fluoride should be placed in drinking water only if it is proven beyond all doubt to be both beneficial and safe. To date this proof has not been forthcoming. The hysterical reaction to this prudent position is puzzling. I can only surmise that it is similar to the situation which arises when a confidence man is apprehended by the police. The crook's victims simply refuse to believe that they have been conned and defend the con man to the bitter end. Is fluoridation in the same category? I wonder. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that remark by my colleague Senator Sanders as regards the sheep husbandry report that was brought down by the Select Committee on Animal Welfare. Senator Sanders, of course, has been part of the Committee for the past four and a bit years, during which time I have been on the Committee. I must admit that we have not always seen eye to eye on all issues, but the sheep husbandry report by the Select Committee on Animal Welfare is a unanimous report. Senator Sanders has already spoken on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is possibly the first detailed publication on the welfare of extensive sheep management in Australia, and follows earlier reports on such issues as the live sheep trade. Evidence taken over four years has been compiled into a comprehensive document, including 15 recommendations for the industry and Federal and State governments. Evidence was taken from a wide cross-section of the community, including wool industry representatives, farmers, scientists, animal welfare agencies, animal activist groups, veterinarians and public servants. </PARA>
<PARA> The report acknowledges the significance of the sheep and wool industry to Australia, both in terms of the production of an export commodity and as a vital source of meat and fibre domestically. The Committee examined the costs and benefits of various husbandry practices and whether economic consideration ought to outweigh the comfort of the sheep. Issues such as tail docking, marking, mulesing, time of shearing and teeth grinding were all examined as to whether they were essential on economic or welfare grounds. Two issues which raised considerable debate among witnesses before the Committee were mulesing and teeth grinding. </PARA>
<PARA> Mulesing is an operation which involves the surgical removal of strips of loose wool-bearing skin from the breach and tail of sheep, mostly merinos. It is done to reduce the incidence of flystrike and as such is in some areas quite widely practised either by the farmer or, more commonly, by contractors experienced in the practice. Much evidence was given of both the effects of flystrike on sheep and the pain suffered in the mulesing operation. It is undoubtedly a sensitive issue and one about which a largely ignorant public could become quite emotional. However, having examined all the evidence both in support of and opposed to the practice of mulesing, the Committee remarked:</PARA>
<PARA>Mulesing is an unpleasant practice, one which is generally performed with distaste and one which certainly causes sheep and lambs pain . . . </PARA>
<PARA>However, the Committee concluded that, in the absence of effective alternatives, the practice should continue, the argument being that flystrike is infinitely more painful than the mulesing operation, notwithstanding that not every sheep that is mulesed would necessarily have been affected at some time by flystrike. </PARA>
<PARA> Alternatives to mulesing, such as a closer monitoring of flocks and selective breeding to reduce loose-skinned breeds, were supported but acknowledged to be limited in their likely application. On the other hand, teeth grinding is not a routine practice in Australia. It involves the mechanical grinding of an older sheep's teeth to increase the productive life of that animal. While the practice of teeth grinding is not supported by either the Australian Veterinary Association or the Farm Animal Welfare Council of the United Kingdom, the Committee did not regard it as either sufficiently widespread or sufficiently appealing to become widespread. It argued that if an otherwise productive sheep can be kept longer by trimming its teeth, the practice is justified, provided it does not cause undue pain to the animal. Other areas covered by the report include chemical shearing or biological defleecing. Those are two areas on which the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) has been doing a great deal of work. Research funding in these areas has been cut back quite dramatically by this Government. We have all talked about the cutbacks to the CSIRO. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has recommended the continuation of research into all alternative methods of conventional shearing on the basis that conventional shearing necessarily involves a certain amount of stress to the sheep. The Committee took evidence on such issues as the effects of climate, yard design and handling techniques. It was acknowledged that geography and weather had a significant impact on welfare. Drought, floods and fire create enormously varying conditions for sheep, and much evidence was taken about the response of sheep to extreme conditions. Recommendations were given for the transport, sale and slaughter of sheep affected by floods, fire and drought. However, the Committee noted that the most significant and vital factor in sheep welfare was the quality of stockmanship. Sheep that were handled roughly and in poorly designed yards and facilities suffered significantly higher stress levels. The Committee supported calls for more training in behaviour based skills in animal handling for the benefit of both the animal and the operator. It also noted the benefit of appropriately designed yards and facilities which reduced stress. </PARA>
<PARA> The report has been well received by the industry, which regards it as a balanced and responsible comment on the present state of the industry. The Federal Government is yet to respond to the findings. However, given the Labor Government's insensitive attitude towards research funding generally-which I have already alluded to-and to the CSIRO in particular, cutbacks which have already affected CSIRO sheep research projects are unlikely to be redressed, despite the Committee's call for increased and continuing funding for such projects as the study of flystrike and shearing alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Through all the deliberations of the Committee into sheep husbandry, we met many people whom I would like to publicly thank for the courtesy they showed us-the people in the robotic shearing area in Adelaide and Western Australia, the persons whose properties we visited, the people who are associated with the industry and the people who gave evidence on behalf of animal welfare groups. I thank all the people from the Secretariat who wrote up the report very much for their efforts on behalf of the Committee. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the luncheon break, I was discussing in this debate on the Appropriation Bills the situation with regard to higher education in Australia and had just quoted from the inaugural lecture given by Professor Manderson in September of this year at the University of Queensland. As I pointed out, in her lecture she quoted from the Brecht play, The Life of Galileo. I cannot resist quoting another passage of that Brecht play which seems highly pertinent to the situation that universities are in today. The curator in the play says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>If you want money, you must produce something else. For the knowledge which you sell, you can only demand as much as it profits whoever buys it from you . . . Men applaud you in Paris and Prague. But the gentlemen who applaud do not, unfortunately, pay the University of Padua what you cost it. </PARA>
<PARA>Brecht went on in that play to posit two options: either oppressive government direction of universities or oppressive market direction. There are other options. Indeed, we are rapidly moving away from Australia's own version of a reasonably balanced stance between public funding from government and public accountability from universities. Part of the present destructive criticism from government comes directly from politicians who have become obsessed with economic growth, performance measurement and value for money and have ignored what was actually happening in teaching, research and service to the community by our higher education institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's proposal to base its research policy on a centrally defined system of earmarked grants and specific contracts is cause for great concern. Under these policies, the lone philosophers who at the turn of the century worked on symbolic logic would not have qualified under the Government's definition of `approved activities'. It was their work, however, that gave rise to the most significant invention of the 1900s, that of the modern computer. As the leader of the newly formed Tuesday Group Professor David Penington has said, `It is impossible to dictate creativity'. Clearly, the concept of limiting research to areas of perceived national need to improve national well-being finds no support in the history of science. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) has been quick to criticise universities for their apparent failure to contribute to the development of business. It is my belief, however, that the business world has been slow both to invest in and capitalise on university research. It has been cogently argued that the indirect contribution universities make to business through research findings and the graduating of competent students will continue to be vastly more important than the contribution they may make toward process and product innovations in the business sector. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me illogical to force universities out of the basic and applied research which has been their great strength into types of applied research and development for which they are not equipped-even if one could be sanguine about the ability of the Minister, advised by the Australian Research Council, to `pick winners' from the multitude of research proposals. The gist of the matter for the majority of academics is that they will be expected to provide scholarly teaching but this will be assumed to require neither research nor time. All this is based on the extremely fatuous distinction between `scholarship' and `research'. Recently when a report from the Australian Science and Technology Council entitled Profile of Australian Science was brought into the Senate, I quoted from it. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>It is impractical to allow unrestrained growth in the number of academics who are allowed to conduct research. Unless there is a loosening of the link between teaching and research in universities, any new academic staff (and hence research staff) will be concentrated in areas of growing student demand.</PARA>
<PARA>I take great exception to the extraordinary statement that it is the politicians who will set about allowing or not allowing academics to do research. The report then goes on to make the absolutely earth-shattering statement that, since student load had increased by over 14 per cent between 1975 and 1985 and staff had increased by only 4 per cent, more time would be spent on teaching. However, the report then states:</PARA>
<PARA>The likely outcome will only be changed if universities learn to teach more efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA>No explanation is given about how universities can teach more efficiently. Presumably, they will be asked to stuff more bodies into lecture theatres or have more and more students in tutorials until those tutorials look as much like the lectures as the lectures themselves. After this rather splendid excursion into teaching and learning theory, we come to a discussion of research which asserts that the tradition of teaching and research currently in our universities has a short history. On the contrary, the notion of research linked to teaching has a long and honourable history. An academic is expected to push back the frontiers of his or her speciality. University teaching staffs are expected to write papers for publication in learned journals. Indeed, the report says quite clearly that advancement is dependent on writing papers. Now if this activity is in any way meaningful, then the published papers are the result of something more than simply looking at what everybody else has said. The academic is contributing to the ongoing development of the discipline and to the understanding of the discipline areas by the work published. The academic in publishing papers is engaged in research. However, I point out that the distinction between research and scholarship currently being touted is a politically useful distinction. The former costs money, the latter does not. The former is getting on and doing something, whereas the latter is considered to be merely thinking about one's discipline and, surprise, surprise, that can all be done in one's own time. </PARA>
<PARA> As Hugh Stretton has so clearly argued, this teaching/research dichotomy will discourage the basic supply of raw talent by degrading its undergraduate teaching and discouraging its academic recruitment. The end result for the Government will be to replace original and valuable research with more of the second rate ritual publications that the Government itself professes to want to discourage. Surely the goals of higher education in Australia should be to examine the wonder and mystery of the universe in all its facets. When the Government finally gives up trivialising education, it will then have the opportunity to take seriously the proposition that education can make us free and wise and not just rich and smart. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with profound regret that I once again find myself in the position of having to use the opportunity afforded me in debate on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill and cognate Bills to bring to the attention of the Senate the absolutely deplorable conditions of Australia's roads network. I note that during the debate on the appropriations, many other of my colleagues, including Senator Brownhill and Senator McGauran, have also spoken of their concern about this matter on behalf of their constituents. It has been a matter of ongoing concern to me since I first entered the Senate and I find it at best irresponsible of the Government to choose to ignore the repeated calls by motorists and motoring organisations which have been unanimous in their condemnation of the manner in which road funding continues to be ignored.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Not one member of the Senate would be unaware of the recent horror smash that occurred near Grafton in New South Wales, which caused a tragic loss of 22 lives. Some of those people were so very young. There has been considerable conjecture about the cause of that tragedy and, indeed, about the chances of similar accidents occurring at other places around Australia. Much of that discussion has centred on the shoddy conditions of Australian roads and the Russian roulette that is played by the transport drivers and passenger buses that travel along those routes on a regular basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me look at the recent record. On 20 October 1989, the tragic bus and heavy vehicle accident at Cowper near Grafton resulted in 22 deaths and three injuries. On 25 October, a semi-trailer sideswiped cars near Bathurst, leaving three dead. On the same day, two semi-trailers collided head-on 30 kilometres south of Goulburn, leaving one dead and two injured. Every evening on television news broadcasts we are subject to the continual reporting of road deaths. Only yesterday I read the road toll report of Australian Associated Press wherein it was stated that the official road toll in the Australian Capital Territory at present stands at 31. At the same time last year it stood at 24. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988, 2,755 fatalities and 30,137 injuries occurred on Australian roads. In the same year, 250 fatal crashes involving heavy vehicles occurred. The Government should take no pride in the fact that road accidents now claim more lives of Australians under 45 years of age than does any other cause of death, including heart disease and cancer. </PARA>
<PARA> Several days ago in Tasmania, the Acting Secretary of the Municipal Association of Tasmania, Mr Colin Balmer, claimed that the accident at Cowper highlighted the poor state of many major roads both in Tasmania and nationally. Mr Balmer was moved to compare the road at Grafton with many Tasmanian roads which, he quite correctly pointed out, are unreasonably narrow and do not have adequate shoulders. Because of the negligence of the Federal Government, many Tasmanian roads are now too narrow, unsafe and covered with dangerous potholes. </PARA>
<PARA> Local councils in Tasmania and throughout Australia do not have the necessary resources to keep roads under control. Mr Balmer points out that, whilst the Commonwealth has been spending money on the Hume Highway and one or two other national highways-in what I suspect has been purely a vote buying exercise-very little has been spent elsewhere. Comments by municipal associations throughout Australia in support of that claim serve only to mirror Mr Balmer's comments. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently-in fact, only this week-I had the opportunity of meeting with members of the Municipal Association of Victoria, who pointed out to me their great concerns about the level of road funding, particularly to local government. Earlier this year, Senator Messner and I had discussions with the President of the Local Government Association of Queensland, Mr Purnell. The No. 1 problem that Mr Purnell cited to us was road funding. When I travel around Australia and talk to local government bodies and motoring organisations in other States, people raise with me concerns about what they regard as the problems that are facing motorists, namely, inadequate funding to maintain the quality of roads in order to reduce accidents. This week, the State Secretary of the Royal Automobile Club of Victoria estimated that 30 per cent of road accidents are attributed to poor roads. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me look at the Government's record. During Labor's term of office over seven years, road funding has been cut by 30 per cent in real terms. That has occurred during a time when, through the greed of the Federal Treasurer (Mr Keating), the amount of money that is collected through fuel excise has increased dramatically by 532 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the 1989-90 Budget, the amount of money spent on roads will be increased from an actual expenditure of $1,217.2m in 1988-89 to an allocation of $1,333m, which represents an increase of only 2 per cent in real terms-if the Government's projected inflation figure of 7.5 per cent can be believed. When one considers the disastrous record of the Government in holding down inflation, one realises that the increase of 2 per cent in real terms will soon be eroded. </PARA>
<PARA> Since formulating the 1983 Budget, Labor not only has increased fuel excise but also has chosen to index it. As a result, fuel excise has risen from 6.155c per litre in March 1983 to 23.15c per litre by August 1989. Disgracefully, the total fuel excise revenue has risen from $970m to $5,645m. Despite that massive fuel excise grab at the expense of the Australian motorist, the Government still returns only 5.5c per litre to road funding. In 1989-90, the users of Australia's roads, including heavy transport vehicles, will contribute $5,645m in fuel excises, compared with $1,333.2m which Labor has decided to allocate for road funding. The situation is even more unacceptable for local government. </PARA>
<PARA> In my State of Tasmania local government is responsible for 80 per cent of the roads, yet it receives only 1c of each dollar that is collected in fuel excise. Because I am a former member of local government, I understand the concern of local government. Many local roads are becoming collector roads because of the sprawl and expansion of urban areas and the increase of heavy transport vehicle traffic on those roads. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been a matter of public record for some time-nevertheless it warrants repeating-that the amount of funding that is allocated to roads by the present Federal Government in proportion to road usage has never been at such a low level since World War II. It is clear that the cost of our dilapidated road system is borne by all Australians-rich or poor, sick or healthy, young or old. Bad roads are responsible for deaths, injuries and massive property damage. The costs of road crashes are borne not only by the persons who are involved in them but also by the general community. Considerable costs must be borne in assisting the return of those people to good health and assisting them to cope with the after-effects. There is also the substantial cost-either to insurance companies or to individuals-for repairs to damaged property. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1980, approximately 25,000 Australians have died on our roads. That is equivalent to wiping off the face of Australia forever towns such as Devonport, Shepparton, Goulburn or Bathurst. Since 1980, 247,898 Australians have been injured on our roads. Each road fatality has an average cost to the community of approximately $454,000. Each major road injury bears a cost of $92,000. Even a minor injury costs $10,000. That leaves a total overall cost of $5,700m or $350 for every man, woman and child. When that figure is coupled with the total estimated revenue of $5,645m that is to be raised from fuel excise, it is obvious just how much poor roads are impacting on the general Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bureau of Transport Economics has estimated that each road fatality costs our economy $454,000. For some time, the National Roads and Motorists Association (NRMA) has been urging the immediate upgrading of our roads to more acceptable standards, which would reduce the number of road accidents by up to 85 per cent. It should be remembered also that poor roads impact across supermarket costs and general commodity bills by increasing the freight component. Increased vehicle maintenance costs and unnecessary delays as well as transit and delivery costs are just some of the other consequences of road accidents. </PARA>
<PARA> This poor record of road funding ignores the importance which roads play in Australia's overall transport system. Some 70 per cent of domestic trade is carried on our roads. Between 1982 and 1985 road cargo increased by 25 per cent, and it is likely to double by the year 2000. The number of vehicles on Australia's roads is likely to increase by over 60 per cent by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it is important for motorists to compare the sorry attitude of the Federal Government with that of the coalition, which has continually stressed the need for road upgrading and road safety to be given a higher priority. We do so because we accept that it is unfair to expect State and local governments to absorb the responsibility, and it is similarly unacceptable to force motorists to place their lives at risk by driving on roads which simply are not safe. We have given an unequivocal commitment to increase the level of road funding and to support this commitment by introducing a new category of economically important roads for Federal funding purposes. I am proud to be part of a coalition which has already given a further undertaking to set aside a specific amount of fuel tax which would be used for road construction and maintenance. We will not be participating in the road funding fiddle occurring at the moment. We will set the amount and stick by it regardless of other commitments. This will allow local and State governments for the first time in May year the luxury of being able to plan for the future knowing full well what road funding will be. Until such time as the Government is prepared to acknowledge the need for increased road funding, it will be seen as just another attack on the small businesses which are dependent upon road transport and rely on it for their lifeblood. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently the Federal Government announced a range of new road safety measures which it claimed would help stem the rising tide of road deaths. I believe that these measures have been prompted by the Government's desire to shift the responsibility from where it should lie, and I was interested therefore to read comments of the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations (AFCO) whose Director, Robin Brown, claimed that the fitting of speed limiters to all trucks from 1991 and to those caught speeding from January 1990 would be of no assistance in curtailing speeding in built up areas. AFCO has called for the immediate installation of tachographs which register speed travelled and time on the road, and its call has been strongly supported by the NRMA. </PARA>
<PARA> Naturally in a broad sense the coalition welcomes any moves, however belated, to decrease road carnage. The community is justified in being angry at the Government because of its complacency. The new measures, however welcome, will be cold comfort for the many thousands of Australian families who are mourning the loss of a loved one killed in a road accident. It is unfortunate that it has taken a tragedy such as that which occurred at Grafton to prompt some action by the Government on roads, and although I cannot claim that any action could have guaranteed that that accident would not have occurred it is, however, abundantly clear that unless road funding receives a higher priority from the Federal Government the likelihood of further tragedies such as the one at Grafton increases. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian motorists have received a shoddy deal from the Federal Government for years and the allocation in this Budget does nothing to correct that anomaly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In considering the Appropriation Bills which will provide the funding for the Government's activities for the next year, we are of course looking at the bare economics of our society. But we are also looking at a lot more than that because in these Bills we can also look at the direction which our society will take because it is in deciding where the priority areas of funding lie that the Government influences the direction that our society will take and even the kind of society that we have. Compassion costs money. A dollar given in one direction must be taken from another, and a government always needs to be aware of short term false economies-that is, short term penny-pinching which can cost more in the long run.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other fundamental question that needs to be asked is: do we want a society in which the people serve the economic structures or a society in which the economic structures serve the people? In my remarks on these Appropriation Bills I will address this question in relation to a few issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, as far as interest rates are concerned, the best interests of ordinary Australians do not appear to be being met. Deregulation of the banks has not resulted in healthy competition with greater choice for the consumer; in fact, quite the reverse. Home loan interest rates continue to rise. There are those fortunate enough to have loans pegged at 13.5 per cent, which is the level interest rates were at when the banks were deregulated. Those with loans from the big four banks have their loans pegged, after the recent Government initiative, to 17 per cent, which one might call a Clayton's deregulation. Some are in the position of having the opportunity to take out loans at a fixed rate for a limited period. But the rest are caught in a spiral over which they have no control. </PARA>
<PARA> A taxi driver here in Canberra told me just the other day that his home loan repayments have risen by more than $250 a month in less than a year. Yet the Australian banks are recording massive profits. They appear to be the most profitable banks in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, with all her current problems after the recent resignation of her Chancellor of the Exchequer, was heard to boast that at least home loan interest rates in the United Kingdom are below those currently in Australia. Small business people and farmers are paying interest rates somewhere around 22 to 25 per cent, and many of these people are going to the wall. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition Opposition supported the Government when it deregulated the banks but both should now consider re-regulating as this appears to be the only way that interest rates can descend to sensible and affordable levels. It is to be regretted that the Government and Opposition have not supported the Australian Democrats initiative to inquire into banks in Australia. It is a scandalous situation that fees on a small bank account should be subsidising the lack of fees or lower fees on very large accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> One fiscal measure that will soon attain a level of social justice, as well as economic justice, is a tax on the goldmining industry. Remarkably there is now tripartite support for a tax on the profits on gold. During the Budget debate a year ago, members of the Opposition were vehement in their opposition to taxing the profits of gold. They have changed their mind and I applaud them for that. My one regret is that the present Budget does not advise that that tax should be introduced earlier than January 1991. The two-year plus delay between the announcement of the imposition of the tax on the profits of gold, which was brought in to allow companies time to adjust and make new arrangements, seemed reasonable at the time but since then there has been a flurry of activity and an almost indecent haste to carve out huge open-cut mining pits in order to rip out as much high grade earth as possible before the tax comes in. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to add that the Western Australian Government yesterday released an environmental charter for Western Australia with 10 guiding principles to help maintain life processes and optimise the quality of life. The tenth principle in that charter is that the polluter pays for environmental harm. I look forward, indeed, to reading the legislation to be introduced in the Western Australian Parliament which will enforce in law the polluter pays principle which the Australian Democrats believe should be enforced in law right across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Another topic which is uppermost in people's minds and certainly in the news media at present is the airline pilots dispute. Indeed, as has been stated in this chamber a number of times, we do seem to have a shambles of a situation. I should not say `dispute' because the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has assured us that the dispute is over. However, there do seem to be a lot of other associated topics and unanswered questions with regard to that situation. For example, why is there so much discrepancy between the percentages of places that the Government and the airlines say are available on the current flights and the actual situation which is being experienced by people who have to put up with flights not being available, being cancelled at the last moment or not being able to be booked in advance?</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, another question I would like to ask is: How much is it costing us in increased trade deficit to lease foreign aeroplanes and pilots? What will be the waste in resources to Australia if hundreds of pilots, each of whom has cost in the region of $1m to train, take themselves and their experience overseas? I believe that in some cases we may be paying a foreign airline to have those same pilots fly foreign aeroplanes in Australia. Why is the subsidy going straight to the airlines while those employed in tourism and other downstream industries lose their jobs, their livelihood and their hope for the future? To what extent will this increase our overseas debt? It is to be hoped that the Senate Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Airline Pilots' Dispute will answer these and other questions. They are certainly not addressed in the Appropriation Bills before us now. </PARA>
<PARA> There also is a lack of coherent debate about the economics of immigration, despite the fact that there have been two recent major economic studies on immigration. Of course, the Australian Democrats take a different view on immigration from that taken by both the Government and the Opposition. We believe that the main thrust of immigration should now be on family reunion and other humanitarian and compassionate grounds such as our intake of refugees. People who have been accepted as permanent residents or citizens are not mere economic units. They have the right to be joined by members of their closer extended families should circumstances warrant that. Through their added stability and family life, the stability of society is strengthened. Indeed, our present day life is full of various stresses, and a stressed community and stressed individuals can result in anti-social behaviour such as petty crime, even serious crime or drug-related activities, or these people may need assistance from mental or physical health professionals. That, of course, costs society money. </PARA>
<PARA> Such activities may also make it difficult or even impossible for the person concerned to be a productive member of society. Therefore, I suggest that our migrant population, no less, of course, than our Australian-born population, must first and foremost be regarded as human beings. Likewise, of course, we have our obligations under covenants to which we are a signatory to accept our fair quota of refugees on a compassionate and humanitarian basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The two reports to which I referred previously and which contain critical economic assessments of immigration, have been misunderstood by both the Government and the Opposition. The first of these, The Economic Effects of Immigration, came out in April 1985 and was prepared by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia, which is a private business group. The other was a consultancy report prepared by the Centre for International Economics for the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies, that is, CAAIP, which also produced a report recently. </PARA>
<PARA> Continuing faith in the economic benefits of immigration has recently been affirmed by both the Government and the Opposition. But at least we are past the stage of importing migrants as mine and factory fodder. I believe that the worst example of this was the Wittenoom story. If we look at the economics of that now, we will see that they are quite horrendous. I refer to the hospital stays, the drugs, the compensation by CSR Ltd and the State Government Insurance Commission in Western Australia. Altogether, there were 6,502 male and 410 female workers in Wittenoom. There were also the families of those workers. In 1986 a report was brought out containing prognostic figures. Up to the end of 1986, there were 94 cases of mesothelioma, 141 cases of lung cancer and 356 successful compensation claims for asbestosis. A prognosis was then made up to the year 2020, and the numbers are quite horrifying. I have mentioned them before in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Funding is required for research into the prevention and treatment of these diseases which in the end will save the country money. It appears that adequate funding for this research is simply not forthcoming. This is an extreme example, but it demonstrates well the dangers of regarding people, migrants-any sort of people-as mere economic units. The Western Australian Cabinet documents at the time of the heyday of Wittenoom show very clearly that despite warnings given to them they chose to ignore those warnings and were very concerned with the profits of the time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats query the continuing of immigration schemes based strongly on skills and business migration. If it is skills that we need, then surely we have an obligation to upgrade our teaching and training methods and to skill our present population, particularly our out of work population. If it is people that we need, then family reunion and compassionate and humanitarian grounds are surely more advisable. If we are worried about people not being able to settle properly in Australia, then we should be all the more concerned for people to come out to an already existing family structure. Australia as such has no policy as yet on population. That was stated quite recently by Senator Richardson, the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs in this chamber. I believe that we have a lot of work to do in this area and we are only at the beginning of a sensible analysis of our immigration policies. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to refer very briefly to two communities which do not seem to be gaining much benefit from the present Budget. The Australian Democrats believe that funding provided by government to its agencies should seek to act in the best interests of the Australians serviced by those agencies. This has not been the case for the Kandiwal community, that is, the 600 or so Torres Strait Island people who reside in the northern parts of Western Australia, particularly in the Mitchell Plateau region. The Kandiwal community considers that it has been given the run-around by the Aboriginal Development Corporation (ADC) with regard to its move to the Mitchell Plateau and with regard to its proposed joint venture with Western Australian Torres Strait Fishing and Trading Inc. </PARA>
<PARA> An agreement was signed between the joint venturers this year to fish for trochus and tropang. In order to get the venture off the ground and in order therefore to provide jobs for the Torres Strait Island people in the northern parts of Western Australia, who are currently receiving funds from the community development employment projects (CDEP) scheme and social security, they were advised by the ADC to apply for funding from it. The community did everything they were asked to do. They applied for a fishing licence. They did their sums on the estimates for the cost of a boat and equipment. They arranged a market. The ADC gave them an undertaking that funding would be available as soon as possible. But I am afraid that the whole story has been a woeful one, because each time they have returned to the ADC they have been told that something else is needed. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, and only now, have they been told that they need to do a feasibility study. So they have obtained a written promise of funds for the feasibility study but they are still waiting to know when they will receive the funds and how much they will receive. The mass of paperwork is incredible. There is correspondence with regard to the shareholders. Correspondence has been exchanged with their solicitor. There are handwritten comments by the ADC saying yet again that the criteria are not being met. There are various submissions which they have put in, and also there are letters to the State Minister for Fisheries and the Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand). These matters must be conducted with propriety but applicants for funding commercial ventures such as this should be given all the information at once and not piecemeal, as appears to have happened on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> Communities like the Kandiwal community deserve proper and professional incentives and encouragement to become productive Australians. This is an instance, I believe, of a small business venture which could and should get off the ground. In saying this, I refer to remarks made by Senator Crichton-Browne earlier when he was talking about another venture. He said that if it had been headed by Sir Peter Abeles or Rupert Murdoch perhaps it would not have been pushed around in the same way. </PARA>
<PARA> Another community I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate is the Baryulgil community in New South Wales, an Aboriginal community, which is still waiting for the recommendations of the 1984 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs as it concerned that community to be implemented. The people's main concern is with regard to the asbestos contamination in the Baryulgil square. They made submissions to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs on 29 May and 31 July. To date, these have been rejected. In particular, they require a medical service to help the former Baryulgil miners and their dependants with the management and diagnosis of their asbestos caused diseases. They require assistance with a number of functions that they need to carry out in noting the extent to which the ex-miners are diseased and with regard to the health and welfare of the community which remains at Baryulgil. These matters will continue to be raised in this chamber, as they have been already, until they are settled properly. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I refer to environmental matters which I raised during the recent Estimates committee hearings. The special problems faced by the marine and estuaries section of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service are very complex. We are dealing here with the conservation of remote islands such as Ashmore and Cartier reefs and the Ningaloo Reef Marine Park off the north-western coast of Western Australia. There is a concern that the resources available to the National Parks and Wildlife Service do not allow it to respond adequately to the escalating deterioration of the marine and estuarine areas. In Western Australian newspapers recently we have had tales of dolphin deaths and disappearances, the bad situation in Albany's harbour and the threat to abalone fishing off the coast of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to controlling illegal fishing and the killing of seabirds and turtles by Indonesian fishermen, we also need to draw up management plans and carry out other routine tasks. There is a need for the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service to take the lead in research into major problems that affect the marine environment of Australia. We have had many recent reports of dolphins, turtles and sea lions dying in the nets of shark fishing boats in the Geraldton area; damage to coral and fishing in the Abrolhos; concern at the death and disappearance of dolphins at Shark Bay; and concern at the impact of hovercraft on the dugong population just north of Shark Bay. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to the Government that there is a need for the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service to receive adequate funding in order to research these marine problems properly. The Department of Conservation and Land Management in Western Australia relies on Commonwealth funds to carry out work on the drupella, the snail that is causing the death of coral in the Ningaloo Reef Marine Park. The extent of the problem is vast, as was admitted during the Estimates committee hearings. It is more than one State can cope with alone. Unless we learn more about the marine environment, the end result is likely to be marine degradation on a scale similar to that which we face on some areas of our land. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently the Western Australian Government estimated the cost of cleaning up the pollution at Albany's Princess Royal Harbour and Oyster Harbour at $200m. The cost of cleaning up the Peel Harvey estuarine system is estimated at several million dollars. There is no doubt that a well resourced, expanded marine section of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service could save marine fauna and flora, save State governments many millions of dollars and safeguard important fisheries. We must look ahead in these matters. We are looking at a costly procedure; nonetheless it is not appropriate that we penny-pinch and leave for the generations to come a huge expensive mess to clear up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During this debate on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill and cognate Bills a number of Opposition speakers have canvassed at some length the benefits to Australia of implementing the recently released Peacock economic strategy. It is perfectly appropriate for them to have done so in what has been a very wide ranging debate, but the picture of a rosy nirvana painted by the Opposition speakers is based on very shaky ground indeed and deserves a response. I have read from cover to cover the economic strategy for Australia that has been released by the Opposition. I read it with a great sense of deja vu. It is not a new strategy and it is not full of new ideas. It is certainly not a plan that gives any hope to Australia for better times ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), has told us that a recession is inevitable. There is no doubt that that will be a self-fulfilling prophecy if the Opposition's plan is ever implemented. The Peacock action plan is not a plan for tough times but a plan that will guarantee tough times for Australia. It is a strategy that is built around a fight-inflation-first approach to economic management via high interest rates and a dramatic downturn in economic activity. It is a recipe for simultaneous high unemployment, low investment and widespread social hardship in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> My analysis of the Peacock plan is certainly correct because this recipe has been tried before. The Opposition has simply relaunched the economic strategy implemented by Margaret Thatcher in Britain in the early 1980s. Even the rhetoric is the same. Mr Peacock says that his key objective is to bring down inflation. Mrs Thatcher gave absolute priority to controlling inflation. Mr Peacock says that the labour market must be deregulated. Mrs Thatcher said that the labour market must be freed from the distortions of official regulation. Mr Peacock and Dr Hewson have simply adopted the Thatcher approach to economic management. </PARA>
<PARA> Life under the Thatcher Government has been pretty ordinary for all but the rich. The Thatcher Government's performance as an economic manager, especially in the early 1980s, has been a disaster. That disaster is now being realised. The social consequences of Thatcherism have been nothing short of tragic. Full scale riots in London, Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham stand as evidence of the social breakdown of British society under the pressure of high levels of unemployment, especially among the young, and associated poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> What of Mrs Thatcher's key aim of cutting inflation? When she won office, inflation in Britain was running at 10.3 per cent, lower than that of the United States of America, France and Italy, and just above the 9.7 per cent Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average. Ten years on, it is over 8 per cent-higher than in any other major industrial national and more than twice the OECD average. The cost of this unsuccessful fight-inflation-first strategy was and is massive unemployment. More than one million people lost their jobs in Great Britain in 1981 under the policies that we are now seeing produced in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> By 1983 the number of unemployed rose to over three million, with most of the jobs being lost in the industrial cities of the north of England. The north of England, where 58 per cent of the population live, was forced to carry 94 per cent of the unemployment. For example, the Thatcher approach saw one-third of all manufacturing establishments in Liverpool close down. Under Thatcherism the working class became the unemployed class or, as the President of the Liberal Party, John Elliott, recently put it, millions of workers became bludgers. There are still one million more people without work now than when she took office in 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only did Mrs Thatcher slow economic growth, but output per worker in the 1980s has also been very low-the much vaunted productivity that is going to result, according to the Opposition, from the implementation of these policies that have been canvassed so widely during this debate. In fact, productivity in Great Britain during the 1980s has been lower than in the 1960s and 1970s. The shock of Thatcherist monetarism is illustrated by the fact that manufacturing suffered an absolute fall of 17 per cent in the level of production from the second quarter of 1979 to the first quarter of 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> But what about wages-that area in which this policy promoted by the Opposition during this debate is so vulnerable? The Thatcher strategy was to deliberately lift the level of unemployment and, at the same time, launch a full-on assault against the trade union movement to put a brake on wage growth. That is precisely the policy now being promoted by the Opposition. She certainly achieved her objectives of lifting unemployment and embarking on a vicious union bashing campaign. But with what result? Despite three million workers being forced onto unemployment queues and open warfare with the unions, average annual earnings were still running at 7.5 per cent in 1983. Not only did nominal wages continue to grow, but real wages have surged ahead.</PARA>
<PARA> Between 1979 and 1988, real wages in the United Kingdom rose by 28 per cent, which is more than double the increase in Japan, West Germany or France. There was a fall in real wages in the United States over the same period. Wage growth is currently running at over 10 per cent. In the light of such evidence, it is difficult to understand how the Opposition can continue to claim that it will achieve a wages outcome in line with productivity increases in a deregulated labour market-especially given that the Opposition is nowhere near as tough as Mrs Thatcher. </PARA>
<PARA> What about investment under Thatcherist economics? In the manufacturing sector, net investment was negative for the period 1981-83. The recent recovery in investment levels has only just recovered the ground lost in the early 1980s. In fact, I heard the Treasurer (Mr Keating) quite accurately saying in the other place today that industrial growth in Great Britain has only just returned to where it was 10 years ago when Mrs Thatcher took office.</PARA>
<PARA> What of Great Britain's external position? This lack of investment has seen no improvement in the competitiveness of the British economy generally and the manufacturing sector in particular. Imports of manufactured goods have averaged about 6 per cent of gross domestic product over the last decade while manufactured exports have remained steady at about 2 per cent of GDP. The result is a growing trade imbalance for Great Britain. This deterioration has become apparent only in recent times because of the declining influence of the income from North Sea oil. In her first years in office, the British Prime Minister enjoyed a free ride on the back of North Sea oil. That free ride is now coming to an end. It appears that she has happily spent the money with no thought for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> So the Peacock-Hewson Economic Action Plan has been well and truly market tested by Margaret Thatcher, with the following results: high interest rates; a massive lift in unemployment; high nominal and real wages; continuing high levels of inflation; flat investment growth; little growth in productivity; a deteriorating trade position; and massive social dislocation and hardship. So much for the British economic miracle-all the pain with no gain!</PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult to understand why anyone would seek to emulate such a dismal display of economic management and force it on Australians. But that is what the Oppposition is presenting to the Australian people. The Opposition says that it will bring inflation and labour costs down to a level equal with that of our major trading partners. Mrs Thatcher did not. The Opposition says that it will achieve this through freeing up the wages system-that has been said in this debate-but, at the same time, limiting wage increases to productivity increases, through a tight fiscal policy, through micro reform and through a steady monetary policy. These are all the Opposition's words. Mrs Thatcher tried to do this and failed. </PARA>
<PARA> The dispute between the domestic airlines and their pilots gives us further insight into how the Opposition's enterprise bargaining wages system would operate. I concede that, under the Opposition, the airlines dispute would have lasted one day. Without the support of an effective industrial relations system, the airlines would have had little option, as they have had no option in the last 30 years, but to have given in immediately to the pilots' demands. The Opposition's industrial relations policy would be a disaster for this country. If I am not believed, look at the response to the policy from the Metal Trades Industry Association Inc. (MTIA). It does not want the Opposition's industrial relations policy; neither does anyone else in business or in the trade union movement. The President of that important industry body told the MTIA annual general meeting in Canberra last month:</PARA>
<PARA>As far as our industry is concerned, they have made it abundantly clear over the last year or two that they want both award restructuring and an end to confrontation. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the industrial relations system that has been put in place by this Government. The president of the MTIA said that the alternative over-award payments extracted factory by factory without anything in return-that is, the Opposition's policy-could not be seriously entertained as an alternative. In reality, that alternative rejected by this key industry group is the industrial relations policy presented by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Consider again the airline pilots dispute, in which the claim was a cost of living catch-up claim. Reference to possible productivity trade-offs came only as an afterthought: it was not injected in fact until a fortnight after the dispute had started, when the pilots realised that the industrial relations game had changed and they were not getting their own way. The fact remains that, under the Opposition, the pilots would have picked up 29.9 per cent quick as a flash and we would have faced an across the board wages break-out, followed closely by a recession and massive unemployment-indeed, the recession that the shadow Treasurer is predicting. </PARA>
<PARA> Employers do not want open warfare with the union movement. They want an effective wages system that provides for change over time, for the restructuring of work practices and for improved productivity. As with their fight-inflation-first strategy, there is no need to guess what would happen to wages under a coalition government. We already know: a wages break-out followed by a massive hike in unemployment. We all remember 1981, when the conservatives last tried the free bargaining approach. There was an 18 per cent blow-out in wages and unemployment went through the roof: 650,000 people were thrown out of work in this country. As a result, hundreds of thousands of families suffered. If one forgets the rhetoric and looks at the record of the conservatives when they were in office, when they had the chance to help Australian families-indeed, when they had the responsibility to help Australian families-one sees that they did nothing. They slashed family income by throwing hundreds of thousands of breadwinners out of work. </PARA>
<PARA> What of the tight fiscal policy we were promised by the Opposition for months before the release of its economic policy? I cannot find it in the document; it has not materialised yet. It simply is not there. It has been the Australian Labor Party in government that has done all the hard work in cutting back government spending year after year. Now we have the shadow Treasurer, based on his own figures, cutting spending by a further paltry $140m and claiming credit for the lot. Costings of the Opposition policy undertaken by the Department of Finance-not by the Government-show that the coalition numbers are out by at least $835m, which is a 31 per cent shortfall. I personally think that is a conservative figure, because I understand the real world of the unemployed. I understand the way in which the criteria in the Department of Social Security operate. </PARA>
<PARA> A real chill was sent down my spine when I heard Dr Hewson commenting on these estimates by the Department of Finance about the number of people who will in fact go on the special benefit after they are thrown on the scrap heap. It was chilling stuff indeed. What Dr Hewson said is burnt on my brain. He said that the discretion allowed to departmental officers in assessing which unemployed people are eligible for special benefit-that is, a group of Australians that currently number only about 25,000; it is the end of the road, the last piece of government assistance that can be offered to people in desperate circumstances-is a wide discretion and that his government will ensure that it is rigorously exercised. In other words, a coalition government will not assess unemployed people in desperate circumstances on those circumstances; it will simply assess them on whether the 50 per cent figure-people who will be transferred to special benefit-has been reached. Once that figure has been reached, everyone else will be cut off. It is a pretty chilling prospect. </PARA>
<PARA> The fiscal policy outlined by the Opposition would be weaker than the Government's by at least $700m. I predict that the Department of Finance estimate that 80 per cent of the unemployed would go on to special benefits is probably low. There are doubts about the Opposition figures in other areas, such as the contracting out of government services and the benefits to flow from the privatisation of government authorities. But what about the alternative approach-the one followed by this Government over roughly the same period? This Government, unlike Mrs Thatcher and this Opposition, with its Economic Action Plan, has successfully attacked both inflation and unemployment at the same time. Instead of destroying millions of jobs in pursuit of a lower inflation rate, we have created 1.6 million jobs, 90 per cent of them in the private sector, and over 50 per cent of them going to women. At the same time we have brought down inflation. We have combined wage restraint, through the accord with the trade union movement and the cooperation of Australian workers, with a more efficient economy to lift business profits and generate huge levels of investment-the lifeblood of any economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Thatcher drove private investment in Great Britain into the ground. Private investment in Australia has averaged over 10 per cent in every year that the Australian Labor Party has been in office. The investment boom currently being enjoyed by Australia has been documented by none other than the shadow Treasurer and Access Economics, the consultants hired by the Opposition to cost its so-called tax policies. They got their figures wrong on the tax policy but they were dead right on the level of investment growth in Australia. Access Economics has identified $90 billion worth of investment projects across most sectors of the Australian economy. Fifty-four per cent of these are already under construction or are committed. </PARA>
<PARA> We are already reaping the benefits of this investment boom in the manufacturing sector. According to the Federal Bureau of Industry Economics, the number of manufacturing establishments jumped by 10 per cent in the year to June 1988. The real value of construction work in factory building lifted by 13 per cent in 1987-88 and by a further 9 per cent in the last financial year. The corresponding growth over the previous decade was 2.6 per cent per year. Manufacturing employment was up by 92,000 or 8 per cent over the two years to May 1989, compared to a significant decline in manufacturing employment before 1983. Manufactured exports also continued to grow at an impressive rate. In the September quarter trade figures, the number of manufactured exports was 20 per cent higher than for the same period last year. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition's Economic Action Plan offers the following: a lift in interest rates to about 30 per cent; a massive jump in unemployment, a point confirmed by Senator Chaney in today's Australian; a recession, or, as Senator Chaney puts it, a situation of considerable economic stress; strong unions enjoying big wage increases-the pilots' claim for 30 per cent is a good benchmark; low income workers not in strategic industries getting nothing-those, of course, who do not end up unemployed; and a collapse in private sector investment as profits collapse. As I have already pointed out, 90 per cent of the 1.6 million jobs created by this Government in six years have been in the private sector. It is worthwhile looking at what Senator Chaney said as quoted in today's Australian. An article on page 11 of the Australian reads:</PARA>
<PARA> There would be no talk of a general pay rise, and Senator Chaney has made it clear that this industry-by-industry policy might mean some workers getting nothing. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>`There's a real risk that (the economy) would be in hideous shape and we would face massive unemployment growth,' says Senator Chaney. </PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, is confirmed by the shadow Treasurer, Dr Hewson, in a little bit of kindergarten economics that he indulged in not so long ago when he talked about Australia's overseas debt. Dr Hewson said, not once but 10 times-that is how many times I read his comment in the press-that he divided Australia's overseas debt into the number of jobs that he conceded this Government has created in the last six years, 1.6 million, which worked out at $70,000 per job. Apart from the absurdity of such a simplistic piece of mathematics being real economics, the reality contained in that statement cannot be ignored. The Opposition will use unemployment as a weapon to bring down inflation, just as the Thatcher Government did, with the same tragic results in Australia that we have seen previously, and which Great Britain has experienced in the last 10 years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to that interjection from Senator Stone about whether I believe in our economic policy, one can only return to the fantastic-and I use the word advisedly-statements about the basis of Dr Hewson's belief in his economic policies. In an interview that he gave on 26 October this year, he was asked this question by a journalist:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The facts of the 1980s are in countries like United Kingdom and the United States in order to get inflation there have been unemployment offsets, that's my point. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Hewson replied:</PARA>
<PARA>No, I don't think that it necessarily applies in Australia, and I think if you move decisively and quickly you can avoid any significant effect, over and above what is already in the pipeline, on unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>He then offered his reason for saying that. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Because we are moving across the board into my different sort of world and I'm asking you to accept the fact that there is a different world apart from the one you think about and live in all day. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the world that that journalist thought about and lived in all day is called the real world. Dr Hewson said that his policies are created in some kind of fantasy land of his own creation, in which inflation, wages and unemployment are all going to drop simultaneously while productivity and investment increase at the same time. It is a fantastic policy-fantastic in the true sense of the word-created in Dr Hewson's fantasy world and not related to the real world. It is not an economic plan which offers a recipe for any future hope for Australia. It is a fantasy land created by Dr Hewson, the result of which in the real world would be the complete destruction of both the economic and social fabric of this country. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the primary purpose of this Bill is to amend various Commonwealth Acts as a consequence of provisions of the Migration Legislation Amendment Act 1989 (the `Amendment Act') which amends the Migration Act 1958 (the `Principal Act'). These consequential amendments are in addition to those matters in Schedule 6 of the Amendment Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also makes a number of other minor amendments to the Amendment Act. These amendments are made to the Amendment Act rather than to the Principal Act so as to avoid any difficulty which might otherwise arise with the operation of the renumbering provisions of the Amendment Act. The amendments will commence immediately before the commencement of the Amendment Act itself.</PARA>
<PARA> The majority of the amendments either update terminology, make slight changes in wording or correct internal references within the Amendment Act. It is inevitable in the case of legislation as complex as the Amendment Act that some minor corrections will be necessary. Several amendments merit brief comment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that regulations may be made that will prescribe matters to be considered in the making of decisions concerning discretionary deportation orders, the revocation of those orders and the requirement that an illegal entrant depart Australia. In addition, regulations may be made which specify procedures to be followed in determining the liability of an illegal entrant to mandatory deportation. </PARA>
<PARA> During the passage of the Amendment Act concerns were expressed by the Opposition that it was possible under its provisions that a person recognised by Australia as a refugee could unintentionally be expelled by being deported or by being required to depart. </PARA>
<PARA>I gave assurances that this would not be allowed to occur. </PARA>
<PARA> To ensure that those legitimate concerns by the Opposition are put to rest and my assurances are kept, a provision is made for the procedures and the criteria for the exercise of the powers of expulsion to be prescribed in the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The regulations will also reaffirm the essential feature of the Amendment Act, namely the separation of processes of selection (that is, the grant of visas and entry permits) from the processes of expulsion (that is, the exercise of the powers of deportation and the requirement to depart). </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also reinserts provisions allowing for regulations imposing fees for English language tests as previously provided for in the Migration Act. These provisions were previously inadvertently omitted. </PARA>
<PARA> To further streamline passenger processing at airports it is necessary to establish a regime whereby visas can be endorsed to recognise a person as being a person who without the endorsement would become an illegal entrant upon entry. Such persons are typically those who have been deported from Australia or another country, who are suffering from a prescribed disease or physical or mental condition, or who have been imprisoned for more than one year as a result of criminal convictions. Without this regime valuable resources are wasted in confirming the endorsement of the overseas post, and in the issuing of a specially endorsed entry permit which merely duplicates the information contained on the visas. </PARA>
<PARA> Another amendment is necessary as a result of the regulation drafting necessary to complement the Amendment Act. To ensure the proper operation of the regulations relating to the points system, it is necessary to ensure the regulation making power is sufficiently broad. </PARA>
<PARA> An amendment is also necessary to ensure that non-migrant visas can be issued over the counter upon application, and not be delayed by the general requirement to be imposed on pooled applications for migrant entry to notify of any material changes of circumstances since the time of application. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, the Bill establishes that certain proof provisions apply in criminal deportation proceedings in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as well as in proceedings in a court of the Immigration Review Tribunal. </PARA>

<PARA> Mr President, the purpose of this Bill is to amend the Overseas Students Charge Act 1979 as a consequence of the provisions of the Migration Legislation Amendment Act 1989 which amends the Migration Act 1958. The amendments made in this Bill are of a purely technical nature. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Overseas Students Charge Act 1979 is a taxing Act, any amendments must be made by way of a separate Bill. Thus, this Bill is in addition to the Migration Legislation Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1989 and Schedule 6 of the Migration Legislation Amendment Act 1989. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The three Bills before the Senate are the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989, the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 and the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1989. All of these Bills effectively result from Budget announcements. The Income Tax Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 will formally impose tax payable for the 1989-90 year and, until the Parliament otherwise provides, the following financial year. The rates to be applied are those announced in the Government's economic statement in April this year. The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989 deals effectively with measures which will require major employers, that is, employers with a requirement to remit pay as you earn deductions of more than $5m per annum, to remit those PAYE tax deductions twice each month instead of monthly as at present. The Bill also changes the conditions under which the quarterly provisional tax payments are to be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1989 will amend the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to formally maintain the present basic rate of Medicare levy of 1.25 per cent for the  1989-90 year and, until Parliament otherwise provides, for the following financial year. The Bill also makes various changes to the exemption thresholds of the levy. In the main, the coalition does not oppose these Bills. On the contrary, the coalition supports the moves to relieve some of the provisional tax burden on low and middle income earners, in particular through the lifting of the threshold for the general exemption from the quarterly instalment system of paying provisional tax from $5,000 to $8,000. Also, importantly, there is a lowering of the so-called provisional tax uplift factor from last year's 12 per cent rate to 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The major provision contained in the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989 is the move now to require twice monthly-rather than once a month-instalments of tax deducted from employees' salaries and wages to be remitted to the Australian Taxation Office in those cases where the employers' total deduction of such PAYE instalments exceeds $5m per annum. While this proposal is not opposed in general, the coalition has reservations about some of the motivations of the Treasurer (Mr Keating), or the Government, in bringing the measure forward in the 1989-90 Budget and also as to one of its consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that this change, announced by the Treasurer in the Budget Speech, will result in bringing forward into the current financial year,  1989-90, in effect a fortnight's extra PAYE instalments, which otherwise would not have been payable until 1991. The result of that is to increase the revenues for the Government in this year alone by an estimated $550m. </PARA>
<PARA> Businesses are already suffering under the cripplingly high commercial interest rates of between 20 and 25 per cent. The fact that businesses will now have to remit their PAYE instalment deductions twice a month instead of monthly will simply mean that the level of their working capital and hence their interest payments will be increased somewhat as a consequence. Admittedly, this relates to fairly large businesses. As we all know, the really horrific burdens caused by the Government's high interest rate policy are not being borne particularly by big businesses but by the 750,000 small businesses in this country which are not paying interest of 20.5 per cent on their overdraft-that being the prime rate now being imposed by most of our major banks-but which are paying interest rates of 22 per cent, 23 per cent, and up to 25 per cent in some cases. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say that this sort of innovative accounting which we have seen from the Treasurer in this respect in this year's Budget is not singular; indeed, one might almost say that it is a hallmark of Mr Keating. As I have said here on previous occasions, in this year's Budget, through the use of this innovative accounting and some other similar devices, by shunting and pushing revenue payments out of last year and into this year, and out of next year and into this year, the Treasurer has produced a $9.1 billion surplus, when on what one might call normal timing bases the surplus would probably have been in the order of $6.5 billion. The difference is significant because it is on that $9.1 billion surplus that the Treasurer's reputation for tightening fiscal policy this financial year rests, whereas if one makes these appropriate adjustments one finds that actually, if anything, fiscal policy has been somewhat relaxed this year; at best it has been maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> On a more specific point, dealing with the new PAYE payment scheme, I foreshadow that my colleague Senator Watson will move a committee stage amendment to exempt public hospitals, public benevolent institutions and public universities from the requirements to make these PAYE remittances twice monthly in cases where such bodies have an instalment deduction total of more than $5m annually. We take the view-which Senator Watson will explain at more length-that in all probability the Government did not intend to bring these bodies within the ambit of this measure. However, because of sloppy drafting it seems that that will occur. However, my colleague will further explain that point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Another unintended consequence, as Senator Michael Baume quite rightly points out. Before turning to the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, I refer to the Opposition's amendment to the second reading motion in relation to the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989. I foreshadow this amendment now, for the information of honourable senators, and it is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of the motion, add: ``, but the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) notes that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the Government's record high tax burden has inflicted considerable pain on Australians, who face little incentive to work, to invest and to save,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) even after the tax cuts following the wage/tax deal announced in the April 1989 Economic Statement, the Hawke/Keating Government remains the highest taxing government in the post-War history of Australia, and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the wage/tax deal has proven to be a disaster for the economic management of Australia with the current account deficit blowing out in the first three months of the financial year and inflation increasing to 8.3 per cent in the 12 months ended September 1989; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) considers that the Government should urgently adopt the economic policies detailed in the Opposition's Economic Action Plan to stop Australia's ride down the Argentine road''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 reflects the taxation aspects of the Government's wage-tax trade-off deal. That deal has proved to be a disaster for the Australian economy. The fact that it has proved to be a disaster particularly goes to the question of the Treasurer's economic credibility. Honourable senators will recall that when the Treasurer originally raised in the Budget of 1988 the prospect of a wage-tax trade-off, he indicated at that time-and is on the public record as doing so-that he would be seeking a zero wages growth outcome as a trade-off for the tax cuts he was contemplating. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we actually have instead? Well, of course, we got the tax cuts on 1 July this year. They have had the effect of increasing to that degree the purchasing power of Australian consumers and no doubt of adding to the continuing long-running saga of what the Treasurer used to call-although I think he no longer uses the phrase quite so freely-our overheated economy. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of that we will be seeing in Australia in 1989-90 wages growth roughly twice that of the average-I repeat, the average-of our major trading partners. If one compares our situation with that of the more successful among our major trading partners, one finds that that comparison is even more adverse to Australia. Even the Budget forecast for average earnings growth this financial year is 7 per cent which, if I may say so, is a long way from zero. Current Australian Bureau of Statistics data suggest that earnings growth is running ahead of that figure, probably around 8 per cent which, again, is a long way from zero. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that our Treasurer today no longer has any credibility. That fact is nowhere more strikingly evidenced than by his behaviour in the House of Representatives yesterday when, in a desperate attempt to stave off the Opposition attack on the indiscreet-to use a kindly word-remarks of the Minister for Social Security, Mr Howe, he indulged in one of the most serious defamations under parliamentary privilege that it has ever been my sad lot to witness from a senior Minister of the Crown. In that debate, Mr Keating accused my colleague Dr Hewson, the shadow Treasurer, by name, of having conspired with Mr John Elliott to backdate the Opposition's proposal to remove the capital gains tax to 19 September 1985 in order that Mr Elliott should be able to make some capital gains on shares which he had acquired as a result of some transactions between a company called Harlin Holdings and Elders-IXL. I do not want to go into the detail of that matter as it is a subject with which the Senate is regularly bored by the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh. It would, therefore, be well known to all honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to concentrate on the behaviour of this senior Minister of the Crown yesterday in the House of Representatives. He made that accusation under parliamentary privilege. He claimed to know the particular circumstances in which this came about-claiming to know, for example, that there had been a telephone call from Mr Elliott to Dr Hewson-and made all sorts of other totally unsubstantiated and totally fabricated allegations. In fact, it is a matter of public record that the Opposition's proposal to repeal the capital gains tax and to do so from the date in question-from 19 September 1985-was first announced on 10 May 1988. At that time the then Leader and Deputy Leader of the Opposition made a joint statement in which the timing was outlined. That statement said:</PARA>
<PARA> These provisions will apply to assets acquired after 19 September 1985 and disposed of after the date of the election of the Liberal and National Party Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I particularly want to draw Senator Walsh's attention to that fact. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walsh" NAMEID="TJ4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What fact?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator STONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact that I just quoted. That statement was repeated, in identical words, in the document Future Directions, which was released as long ago as December last year. Again it was stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These provisions will apply to assets acquired after 19 September 1985 and disposed of after the date of election of the Liberal and National Government.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the key point which bears upon the respectability, or, alternatively, the disgracefulness, of the behaviour of the Treasurer yesterday in the House of Representatives when he alleged that the setting of the effective date of repeal of this measure, as announced by the Opposition in its Economic Action Plan on 12 October last, was due to the conspiracy which he alleged between Mr John Elliott and Dr Hewson. In fact, it is a matter of record that the share transactions from which the Treasurer was alleging Mr Elliott will benefit as a result of that backdating occurred only this year, in 1989, and were not even spoken of prior to that time. In other words, the Treasurer was saying yesterday that there was a conspiracy to put the date of 19 September 1985 on this proposal so that Mr John Elliott could benefit from a share transaction which had occurred this year, when the date and every other detail of the proposal had been made public as long ago as 10 May 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Acting Deputy President, I know you are a fair-minded person. I put this to you: What do you think would have been the appropriate behaviour of any member of this Parliament, whether in the Senate or in the House of Representatives, who made in either this chamber or the other place a statement that was not only clearly unsubstantiated but also obviously false, a statement that could not possibly be true? What do honourable senators think would be the appropriate form of action by a member or a senator when it was pointed out that such a defamatory and slanderous statement had been made? Does the Senate not agree with me that the only honourable course open to the Treasurer, Mr Keating, in these circumstances would have been to get up in the House of Representatives today to acknowledge that his statement yesterday was totally wrong, totally unsubstantiated? At best, he could probably have said that he had been told this and that he believed it at the time. He should make a full and appropriate apology. He should behave like a man, not like the coward that he has today proved himself to be by refusing to follow that honourable course. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me return to the economic aspects of this matter. A major failure of Mr Keating's economic policies has been in the area of inflation. In his 1988 Budget Speech he said that inflation would fall to 3 or 4 per cent this financial year. But, as we know, inflation is running at 8.3 per cent for the 12 months ended September with no prospect-not even the Minister for Finance will claim that there is any prospect-of a fall to 3 per cent by June next year, which was the Treasurer's claim only 15 months ago. After that record, one would have thought that the Government would give away the wage-tax trade-off idea as a bad joke. That is about the kindest description one can apply to it. Not a bit of it. In yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald the Social Security Minister, Mr Brian Howe, was reported by Margot Kingston as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>In April this year you got the largest tax cuts in history. Massive. $5.8 billion . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Howe is reported as having gone on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>And probably in a tax-wage trade-off next year you will get something of the same order. All paid for. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator STONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He may very well be right, except in respect of the last part of the claim. If there is such a tax-wage trade-off it will not all be paid for. I can guarantee that. This Government will not do what the Opposition has done-detail the spending cuts that will be required to pay for the tax cuts which Mr Howe was broaching the possibility of as reported in the Sydney Morning Herald yesterday. The fact is that the cat is out of the bag. Despite statements by the Treasurer yesterday that Mr Howe was `not correct', some more digging by the Sydney Morning Herald in the course of yesterday has produced a different perspective. The article on the front page of today's edition states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Keating was angered by Mr Howe's remarks. Staffers in both men's offices conferred yesterday morning on what stance to take, deciding on the line-</PARA>
<PARA>honourable senators should mark the word `line'; it is what the public gets told instead of the truth-</PARA>
<PARA>that the Government had not yet considered next year's trade-off. This form of words ruled out official discussions but not unofficial discussions between Mr Keating, Mr Howe, and the ACTU secretary, Mr Bill Kelty. </PARA>
<PARA>But let us not be guided by mere hearsay, retailed through even a reliable reporter. The article goes on to quote an Australian Council of Trade Unions official. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> One ACTU official said of Mr Howe's comments: `I think it's right but it's a bit premature.'</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, more than the one ACTU official can be quoted. The comment of no less an ACTU official than Mr Bill Kelty, Secretary of the ACTU, is also reported in the same Sydney Morning Herald article. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The ACTU secretary, Mr Bill Kelty, would not comment directly on Mr Howe's revelation but said it was already agreed that there would be a wage-tax agreement next year. </PARA>
<PARA>As we all know, what Mr Kelty says goes as far as the Government is concerned: that is it; there will be a wage-tax agreement next year. It only remains now for us to have the parameters put on it. No doubt the Government will get around to that in the period before Christmas Eve. Despite the Treasurer's remarks that Mr Howe was not correct yesterday, the Social Security Minister reaffirmed his story during Question Time in the House of Representatives yesterday. Again, I quote the newspaper report of what he said. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Under sustained Opposition questioning, Mr Howe said his statement was `essentially to the fact that the Government this year has delivered a very substantial package which was in fact paid for.'</PARA>
<PARA>That last claim is not, of course, quite true, but I pass that point by. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>`The Government has not as yet given consideration to any package for next year . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is true. I am prepared to believe that the Government has not yet formally given any consideration to it in the sense of a formal Cabinet submission from the Treasurer or whoever would be the responsible Minister or Ministers going to the Cabinet or the Cabinet committee. Mr Howe's quote from the article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . but the approach would not be dissimilar to what has already been delivered this year . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The question of where the money will come from remains. How will next year's tax cuts be funded? On its part, the Opposition on 12 October this year detailed the tax cuts it will propose immediately following its election at the next Federal election. It detailed also the spending cuts which will be made in order to pay for them so as not to reduce the Budget surplus and relax fiscal policy. Where will the Government's spending cuts fall? Let us assume that Mr Howe and Mr Kelty are correct and that a tax-wage trade-off deal will be done again some time over the Christmas-New Year period. If we set aside that part of any such tax cuts which merely involves returning to taxpayers the proceeds of bracket creep during the current financial year, how-I asked this of the Minister for Finance at Question Time yesterday-would the remaining roughly $3.5 billion of such tax cuts be financed, that is, assuming that it was of about the same order as Mr Howe nominated; that is, of $5.8 billion in total, roughly $2.25 billion represents the return from bracket creep. How would the other $3.5 billion be financed? What would the spending cuts be to finance that? I did not get a satisfactory answer from Senator Walsh yesterday; I do not expect to get a satisfactory answer today. Will the cuts come from the 200 programs that Senator Walsh had in mind a year or so ago and of which he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . can't be justified by social justice, equity, or economic efficiency grounds, and the reasons we haven't abandoned them is because we don't have the political courage to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has not abandoned those 200 programs because it does not have the political courage to do so. Alternatively, will the cuts come from the 13 high real growth programs identified again by Senator Walsh in one of his more disarmingly frank moments in a speech given in August 1987? Senator Walsh then identified age pensions: invalid pensions; repatriation hospitals; education allowances; children's services; including child-care programs; war widows' pensions; service pensions; secondary school funds; training programs; home and community care programs; pharmaceuticals-perhaps the Government is already well advanced in cutting that area-the Commonwealth superannuation scheme; and Commonwealth rental payments. Those were the 13 high real growth programs identified by the Minister for Finance at that time. Are they to be the areas where the Government's axe will fall when it comes to finance the tax part of the wage-tax trade-off deal which Mr Howe was blathering about on Monday of this week, as reported in yesterday morning's Sydney Morning Herald?</PARA>
<PARA> If the Government fails, as it basically failed to do for this year's wage-tax trade-off, to introduce spending cuts to offset its tax cuts, it will only worsen the economic mess it has already led Australia into, a mess which has presented Australia with at the last date, 30 June, net foreign debts of $108 billion compared with a figure of $23 billion when the Government took office. That is a rise of $85 billion during the course of only 6 1/4 years, to say nothing of the growing level of foreign ownership in this country which has raised Australia's total foreign investment liability position, what we might call the national balance sheet, to a debit position of $137 billion. That is the kind of legacy which this failed Government which no longer has any answers will leave to what is now the Opposition and, I regret to say, to our children when it finally summons the courage to go to the polls some time next year and lets the Australian people record a judgment about its performance. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The package of Bills which we are debating this evening comprises three Bills: the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989; the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989; and the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1989. It is to the third of those Bills that I will address most of my remarks. Before I do so, I would like to say a few things regarding the general taxation measures which are covered in the other two Bills, particularly because from time to time one hears a great deal spoken about the notion of shifting the taxation burden away from a tax on income toward a tax on consumption. The Government has looked at it and the Opposition from time to time has certainly suggested it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to put on the record some remarks in relation to consumption tax. First of all, I make the point that I believe that taxation should be seen not only as an instrument for the raising of government revenue but also quite clearly and explicitly as an instrument for the implementation of social policy. When one says this, very often hands are raised in dismay. Indeed, several years ago when I attempted to amend an income tax Bill in relation to the abolition of the claimability as a tax deduction of money spent on tobacco advertising, the Minister who was in the chamber at that time made that very point. I point out that we already do that. The sliding scale for income tax addresses very much the question of inequity in terms of wages. The system of tax on income is a social instrument which addresses the problem of inequity in terms of wages. Taxes are placed on things such as alcohol and tobacco. I believe that is a clear recognition that the consumption of those items is damaging to human health and that it is seen as desirable that, through a price adjustment mechanism, an increase in the price of those items be made by way of taxation. To some extent that is effective in reducing the consumption of those drugs that are damaging to society. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall that, in the 1960s, the conservation movement had a very active program for many years. It objected to the ability of land owners to claim as an income tax deduction the cost of clearing their land. No doubt that was adopted in the early days as a desirable practice to encourage the clearance of land. As the years went by and we saw the damage that was occurring to land as a consequence of its clearance, a great deal of effort was put into turning around that situation. Indeed, during 1972 to 1975, the Whitlam Government scaled down the ability of people to claim land clearance as a tax deduction. Incentives are now built into many systems to provide for the planting of trees and for the protection of uncleared land. It seems that, perhaps covertly and not explicitly, for a very long time we have accepted that the tax system should be used for the implementation of social policy as well as an instrument for the raising of revenue. This should be done far more explicitly and far more overtly. We should recognise it as a useful instrument to move in new directions. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the subject of consumption tax, which is usually qualified by the term `broad based'. When one consumes goods and services, one is consuming in those goods and services a moiety which relates to the resources component of those goods and services, as well as a moiety that relates to the labour input to those goods and services. If we were to consider a consumption tax intelligently, we would have to attempt to discriminate between a tax on the labour component and a tax on the resource component of those goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA> As we tax income, it is quite clear that the feedback mechanisms which naturally operate in all natural systems, including the economy, tend to increase the cost of wages. At school I learnt Le Chatelier's principle that if, to a system in equilibrium, a constraint is applied, the system will shift to modify the effect of the constraint. Therefore, if one finds that highly paid executives are being taxed very heavily, strong pressure is applied to push up their wages so that their net wage after tax remains the sort of wage that those executives wish to take home. If one finds that the Government then moves to raise the tax even further, there is a tendency to build into the wage structure a great number of fringe benefits, such as free cars, school fees for children, houses, travel and a great number of other things. As the Government then seeks to remove those options by way of taxation, the system shifts even further and claims are made for increased wages to make up for the loss of those benefits. To the extent that one taxes wages, the wage structure will shift in ways that are really counterproductive, bearing in mind the direction in which we would wish to move society, namely, a direction in which there is a high level of employment and a lower level of the consumption of resources, particularly non-renewable resources. </PARA>
<PARA> If one considers a consumption tax, one should be seeking to discriminate between the labour component and the resource component and should be seeking to place a tax on the resource component of goods and services, particularly the non-renewable resource component. If the Government or the Opposition choose to move in that direction, that would have considerable benefits to the extent that it would remove the tax component from wages. As a result, wages could be lowered by the same sorts of feedback mechanisms that I have indicated, which should lead to an increase in employment and to a conservation of those resources because we would be moving more to a situation in which the resource content of goods and services was more expensive to use and the labour content was less expensive to use. Therefore, one would tend to use resources more conservatively and one would tend to use labour more intensively because it was cheaper. That is precisely the situation into which we need to move, bearing in mind that we need to move towards a more sustainable and less resource intensive economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Another considerable advantage would be that the tax on the resource component could be a tax that is made at source. For instance, if Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd chose to take X-thousand tonnes of lead out of the ground at Broken Hill, there could be a tax on that at source, which would be easy to collect. The increased cost of that lead because of that tax would flow through to all the goods and services that used that lead. Honourable senators are aware that lead goes into making lead batteries and the alkyl leads that are used in fuel. It would feed through into transport costs and so on but not into the labour component of those goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA> If one chose to go down that road of introducing a consumption tax, one would need a review not only of the tax system but also a complementary and simultaneous review of the wage structure. Advantages would flow in terms of reduced tax on wages and, therefore, reduced wages, so that while the net wage might remain the same the wages which employers would have to pay would fall. </PARA>
<PARA> I make those remarks in order to get them onto the record in view of the way in which governments in the past-particularly the Liberal-National Party governments-have spoken about a resource tax. I make a plea that, if either of the major parties is considering introducing a consumption tax, it gives consideration to a selective consumption tax in which the tax is placed on the resource component and not on the labour component of goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the third Bill, the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1989, which really is a very brief Bill. It is similar in outline to Bills which have been passed ever since the Medicare levy was first instituted. It merely seeks to continue the application of the levy for a further period, and to continue it at the 1 1/4 per cent rate but at the same time to adjust upwards the minimum incomes on which the levy would be paid. The income thresholds will be adjusted so that there will be no levy paid by people on low incomes; that is, individuals whose taxable income does not exceed $10,330; married, including de facto, couples the sum of whose taxable income does not exceed $17,400; and sole parents where their taxable income does not exceed $17,400. For each dependent child or student maintained by a married couple, the threshold for the payment of the levy is to be increased by $2,100. The Australian Democrats have no objection to that. It seems to be a fairly straightforward machinery Bill which simply implements the sorts of adjustments which have been carried out in previous years. However, while we support the Medicare system and observe that it has brought considerable benefits to the Australian population, we are still greatly concerned that the Government is, this very day, implementing a process of considerable damage to health care in this country through its impact on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, and specifically through its altered program of remuneration for pharmacists. Accordingly, the Australian Democrats now move the following second reading motion:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) notes and condemns the Government's 23 per cent reduction in pharmacists' prescription fees from 1.11.89 because of the adverse effect this will have on the continued provision of high quality pharmaceutical services;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) refuses to accept the Government's claim that it cannot defeat the inequitable Remuneration Tribunal determination despite having rejected another Remuneration Tribunal determination in this session of Parliament; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) condemns the Government for attacking a most respected profession, so further weakening its important contribution to the supply of comprehensive health care''. </PARA>
<PARA>Just as the Medicare system is an integral part of the health care system in this country, so too are the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and the part played by pharmacists in the implementation of that scheme. Pharmacists are an integral part of health care in this country. We cannot stress too strongly our abhorrence at what the Government is doing to the pharmacists, damaging that very important part of the health care system. Accordingly, I commend to the Senate our second reading attachment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a package of three related Bills: the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989, the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 and the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1989. I wish to address my remarks principally to the Income Tax Assessment Bill, and I wish particularly to speak to the amendment that I will move in the Committee of the Whole. I wish to insert after proposed section 221ec (9) a new proposed subsection stating that the new section does not apply to a public hospital, a public benevolent institution or a public university. This not only provides revenue relief but also provides administrative savings to public hospitals, public benevolent institutions and public universities. While the Treasurer (Mr Keating) was concerned that corporations could be using Government pay as you earn (PAYE) group tax funds for companies or private purposes, the Opposition amendment acknowledges that there are some groups of employers which do not fall into this category.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The rationale for our amendment is that these groups-public hospitals, public benevolent institutions and public universities-actually utilise public funds for community purposes. That rationale cannot be disputed. It is a concept that the Government cannot refute. The Opposition might well be criticised for not extending the so-called exemptions to include non-profit organisations such as non-profitable hospitals. Clearly, to do so would be to defy the logic of the rationale behind the exclusions that we are seeking so that this section 221ec will not apply to public hospitals, public benevolent institutions or public universities. For that reason we have received the Australian Democrats' support, and we seek the Government's support. I think that if the Government thinks about this seriously it will support the amendment that I propose to move in the committee stage of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The essential feature is that these public hospitals, public benevolent institutions and public universities utilise public funds for community services. They operate on deficit financing, and they operate on overdraft type arrangements. Without this amendment, these public bodies would be incurring extra interest costs which would be detrimental to their welfare. After all, the rationale for the Treasurer's change is that public funds are involved. With the passage of this Bill, those groups of employers with an annual PAYE remittance which exceeds $5m, which includes companies that are members of a wholly-owned group with annual remittances exceeding $5m, will be required to remit twice monthly. Under the Opposition's amendment, they will revert to the old scheme of paying their remittances monthly. </PARA>
<PARA> The first flaw in the Government's legislation-and it is a very real flaw-is the inconsistency in the period in which the remittances must be made. Of course, we do not address that in our amendment. I am saying that the legislation is basically flawed because of its inconsistency in the period in which remittances must be made. However, a group employer which pays its employees on the 14th day of the month gets only seven days to make the remittance, as it must be paid by the 21st of the month according to the legislation before us today. However, a group employer which pays its employees on the 15th of the month-only one day later-has 22 days, as payment is not due on such payments until the 7th of the following month. </PARA>
<PARA> In its present form, which has not been properly thought out, this amendment Bill serves only to encourage businesses to pay their employees once a month, preferably on the 15th, with their PAYE remittances due on the 7th of the next month. Thus, for astute companies the revenue gain will be minimal. As a result, the projected savings will not be there, as the Treasurer has indicated. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me put to the Government a far more equitable arrangement if it wants to proceed down this track. The Government might like to subsequently put some amendments forward. A more equitable arrangement would be for payment to fall due either seven or 14 days after pay day for those group employers who will be affected by this legislation. That was the logical way to go. That is the way in which the Government would have picked up its money. But it is going to forfeit that right by the clumsy way in which it put its legislation before the Parliament today. It should not be for the Opposition to tell the Government how to collect more money or how to get its legislation right. </PARA>
<PARA> As stated earlier, the intention of the Government in introducing this twice-monthly remittance of PAYE tax was to prevent companies from utilising funds owed to the Government for company or for private purposes. They are the words of the Treasurer. The Government has estimated that this change to twice-monthly payments will result in a revenue gain of $550m. In addition, it predicts that the outlays on Commonwealth public debt interest will be reduced by $20m in 1989-90, and $70m in subsequent years. But what the Government has failed to consider in this amendment Bill is the negative cash flow implications for publicly funded bodies such as hospitals, universities and other public benevolent institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that at least 70 of Australia's public hospitals would qualify as group employers with annual PAYE tax remittances in excess of $5m and thus be required to make twice-monthly payments. Under our amendment, the payments would be made only once a month. Had it not been for the Opposition and the Democrats, 70 public hospitals are likely to be affected-typically those with a bed capacity of 500 or more patients and an operating budget in the vicinity of $60m. </PARA>
<PARA> From my point of view, the hospitals face two financial problems if the amending Bill is enacted without the Opposition amendments. Firstly, the majority of hospitals operate under deficit financing arrangements, that is, they are always in the red, with funding from State governments being in arrears rather than in advance. Therefore, most are faced with making interest payments on their overdraft, at interest rates which are currently running at between 20.25 per cent and 24.75 per cent. Should they now be expected to make twice-monthly remittances of PAYE tax, this will disrupt their planned cash flows and place them further into debt. The hospitals will be required to pay this increased debt. It is not a debt that they can transfer to the government funding body for payment by it. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, the enacting of the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill as proposed by the Government, without the Opposition amendments, would place an unnecessary and unjustified financial pressure on public hospitals. I would suggest that the hospitals do not need this added financial and administrative pressure when they are being constantly hounded to maintain high bed capacity, high staffing levels and the best medical technology and service which is available. </PARA>
<PARA> The second financial problem which this amendment Bill causes for hospitals is that, whilst funding is forthcoming from government sources to cover most of the hospitals' costs, public hospitals also rely on donations and bequests from individuals. In many instances the government funding covers only a quarter of the money required by hospitals for equipment replacement and does not supply funds for refurbishment. Thus, hospitals make up the shortfall by building up funds consisting of donations and bequests from individuals and utilising the interest that these funds earn to purchase vital items of equipment and also to refurbish hospital wards. </PARA>
<PARA> Should the amendment Bill be enacted without amendments and consequently hospitals are faced with higher interest Bills on their overdrafts, then the fear is that, instead of being able to utilise the interest earned from donations to replace and upgrade vital equipment, these hospitals would instead be forced to use the interest to pay off their debts. As an ex-nurse, Madam Acting Deputy President, you would appreciate the situation. In the event of this occurring, I would expect that people would be less willing to make donations to hospitals. Giving towards a piece of high-technology medical equipment is considered a far more worthy cause than giving money to cover an overdraft on an interest bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a situation need not arise if the Opposition's amendment is passed, which I am assured will happen because the Opposition has the support of the Australian Democrats. We only hope that your Government, Madam Acting Deputy President, will see the light and, in the other House, effect the necessary amendment that we are putting through here tonight. That situation need not arise if the Opposition's amendment is adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the second part of the legislation before the Senate, I believe that, while this reduction in the provisional tax uplift factor to 10 per cent is welcome, there really is no justification in there being an uplift factor with a percentage that is greater than the projected rate of inflation. May I further state that those clauses in this Bill which deal with provisional tax not only lack a degree of justice from the point of offsets, but also from the point of view of taxpayers are written in such a complicated way that tax reform for most people is still a long way off, because there cannot be tax reform without simplicity. It is an abrogation of taxpayers' rights if they cannot understand the meanings of the words in the Act. This Bill is a further illustration of the Government's convoluted attempt to patch up an unsatisfactory Act which is becoming less and less understood by people who have to comply with the tax rules. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are discussing today three Bills: the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989, the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 and the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1989. Two of these Bills set provisional tax rates, and the third Bill sets the Medicare levies for 1989-90. One is a complex Bill, raising the threshold for exemption from quarterly provision tax from $5,000 to $8,000 and requiring that from December 1989 instalments of pay as you earn tax deductions by companies with total instalment deductions of over $5m be deducted twice monthly. This will produce a one-off revenue increase of $50m in 1989-90 and reductions in public debt interest of $70m in subsequent years. Therefore, these are significant revenue incomes and savings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats see few problems with these specific measures. What we do find worrying, however, is the general attitude of both Government and Opposition in terms of taxation policy, misgivings which, of course, we raise on every possible occasion in discussing probably one of the most vital of social issues, namely, taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is the problem of burgeoning private sector debt, which we see as possibly one of the most significant problems to have confronted the Australian economy in the post-war period. It is-and has been for decades-the major component of our foreign debt, encouraged by a taxation system for companies which is amongst the most generous in the world and which has led as a consequence to a plethora of debt based rather than equity based financing systems in Australia. Taxation policy could be used to make it a less attractive prospect for Australian companies to borrow overseas to finance company takeovers. We have witnessed in this country in the past few years numerous incidents of companies going offshore to borrow and thereby increasing our foreign debt, bringing that debt acquired capital onshore and then using it for all sorts of purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The most extraordinary example was when Bond went offshore and borrowed $1,300m. The average taxpayer somehow or other has to feel guilty about this extraordinary overseas debt, of which on this particular occasion $1,300m was brought onshore by Mr Bond. He used it for the exotic purpose of purchasing Mr Packer's media empire at what is now realised to have been probably three or four times its real value. Mr Bond wrote that off against his tax through negative gearing. The two effects are that we as Australian taxpayers are expected to feel guilty about this enormous foreign debt and, of course, we have to pick up the financial burdens of trying to come to grips with these sorts of strategies. As I say, taxation policy could be used to make it a much less attractive prospect for Australian companies to borrow overseas for this sort of activity. In a recent article in the Age newspaper it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The influential Standard and Poor's credit rating agency . . . lowered Australia's long-term debt rating from AA-plus to AA. </PARA>
<PARA>It said that the downgrading, which affects $10.4 billion in direct and guaranteed debt, reflects Australia's sharply higher current account deficit, prospects for protracted external adjustment, and increasingly heavy foreign debt burden. Importantly, it went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's net external debt rose to 200 per cent of total exports in June. Standard and Poor's said lower Commonwealth external debt was more than offset by rapidly growing private-sector borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA>It continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the rating agency said Australia's growing foreign interest payments would slow the process of stabilising the external debt burden. </PARA>
<PARA>The article placed the responsibility for that very squarely on the shoulders of the private sector in this country. In other words, it said that the private sector had to come to grips with resolving the problems of this extraordinary level of external indebtedness. An analogy has been used often by the Australian Democrats in this place in discussing the strategic options that are open to us in resolving this issue. It is a simple analogy and one which can be understood by most Australians. As is the situation confronting any ordinary Australian family, when things get a bit tight economically three major options can be looked at to resolve the problem. The Australian family in tight economic circumstances has the option to earn more, spend less or go into increased debt. They are the three options which are open to ordinary Australian individuals, families, companies or, indeed, the Australian nation. They are the most obvious options. A short term option is available to them: they can sell off everything that they own, including those things that are making money for them, and hope, like Mr Micawber, that something will show up in due course to get us out of the deep hole that we are digging for ourselves by pursuing that strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia the government of the day has chosen the second option-namely, to cut expenditure. The business sector in Australia has chosen the third option-namely, to go into increasing debt-subsidised, I might add, by the taxpayer because tax concessions are available to them if they move towards debt and away from equity financing. In other words, of the three options available, the Government is pursuing the second, namely, to expand less, while the companies generally are pursuing the third-namely, to go into increased debt-and relatively few of us have been able to pursue the first option of earning more because of Australia's relative disadvantages in terms of overseas earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> Worse, however, than all of this is the fact that both the Government and the Opposition are currently leaning more and more towards what must be the most shortsighted of the options. They are adopting as a viable part of their strategy a fourth option-selling off whatever they can to raise short term funds. The recent current account figures are a clear indication that the Government's strategies are failing. Yet, in considering how similar the strategies of both Government and Opposition are in relation to these questions, it is a matter of pace rather than strategic choice. </PARA>
<PARA> No attention is paid to the problems facing mortgage holders. In this respect Australia remains significantly different from similar countries which place a high value on home ownership-namely, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. Australia still does not offer targeted tax relief to people who are paying off a mortgage in order to buy their own homes. In Australia we limit that benefit to only those people who are investing in the market. What is worse, we allow them not only a tax benefit but also a negatively geared tax benefit so that they can achieve double the benefit they would otherwise receive. As a consequence they are able to compete for borrowings at a beneficial rate because they know that, although they are borrowing at 18 per cent or 19 per cent, when that is written off against their tax liability they may be borrowing at a fairly attractive real borrowing rate of about 11 or 12 per cent. They could also afford to borrow more, thereby feeling able to bid more at auction or to pay more for homes and more for investments. Generally this is pushing the prices of these sorts of borrowings higher and higher. </PARA>
<PARA> We already have a government which sets its priorities in favour of those who are able to look after themselves. Nothing would change with the advent of a coalition government. It might be a little more in favour with those who can look after themselves. Certainly if the Opposition's tax policy can be believed it has no sympathy for the weakest in our society. The Australian Democrats are saying that we see fundamental flaws in tax policy as pursued by the Government or as would be pursued by the alternative Government. In 1988, for example, the Government, with the enthusiastic support of the Opposition, offered a $2 billion benefit to Australian companies, some of the biggest of which were already paying no tax. It offered this by cutting further company tax rates. A 20 per cent tax rate cut was given to Australia's companies by cutting the company tax rate from 49c in the dollar to 39c in the dollar at a time when some of the biggest companies in the country were working the system, to an extent that no ordinary family or small business could do, so that they were paying virtually no tax at all. </PARA>
<PARA> This means that in coming years these companies will be in a negative tax bracket and the government-that is, the taxpayers-will return to them large amounts of money. In this year's Budget all that the Government could offer to the pensioners, for instance, was a $2 a week increase. This goes only some small way to helping them catch up on some of the fairly disastrous 1986 budgetary decisions, which also went through with the support of the Liberal and National parties-namely, the delay in consumer price index increases for pensioners, the discounting of the ex-servicemen's pension increases, telling 45-year-old women on class B pensions that once their youngest child reached the age of 16 years they had to get a job or go on unemployment benefit, and cutting Austudy for 15-year-olds in their last two years of schooling. None of these decisions hurt those on high incomes; all of them significantly disadvantage the worst off in the country. </PARA>
<PARA> So what we are citing is that the advantaged are benefiting under the tax policies of this Government, and will continue to benefit should there be a change of government, whereas, on the other hand, this and recent Budgets have done little to redress some striking imbalances which resulted from the dramatic reductions in government expenditures, albeit to achieve the first balanced Budget in recent years. But those who suffered to achieve that were, of course, the disadvantaged in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that we in Australia spend less on social welfare as a percentage of gross domestic product than any other industrialised nation and have a lower tax than almost any of them. In addition, Australia's wage system and its system of other benefits to workers are less than those in most other Western countries. </PARA>
<PARA> In our haste to achieve a bigger surplus, we forget that a surplus is achieved at somebody's expense. Either somebody pays more in tax or somebody else gets less of a particular service so that the Government can cut expenditure. While everybody is always happy to point out who should be paying more tax or who does not deserve a particular service, nobody-or at least very few people-is prepared to make that sacrifice himself. So by urging a government to produce a bigger surplus, as many in the business community have, people are in effect leaving it up to the Government to decide where the money will come from. Of course, in the last few years it has come from cuts to social security, health and education-areas that impact most significantly on people in lower income areas. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the real problem is that Australian businesses are actually encouraged by the taxation system to borrow huge amounts of money from overseas. The Government is then forced to address the problem of huge overseas indebtedness by reducing expenditure at home. It does this in turn by attacking those who are least able to defend themselves, namely, the economically and socially disadvantaged in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> As Standard and Poor's has pointed out, this is a very significant factor in our increasing foreign debt and, hence, in our increasing current account deficit. To make matters worse, the interest paid on those foreign borrowings is tax deductable. Once again, therefore, the taxation system is weighted in favour of the advantaged or the corporate of the community rather than the disadvantaged and the individuals in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by simply commenting that the Australian Democrats see considerable disadvantage in the structure of the taxation system as it has been put in place by recent Budgets. We see no foreseeable positive change favouring the disadvantaged in the Australian community in the policies that have been forthcoming from the Opposition in recent weeks and months. We simply cite the fact that, even though we are not opposing these tax Bills, which are machinery Bills to implement budgetary measures, we do not inherently identify with the strategies and structures which are implied by them. Indeed, as has been cited by Senator Watson, it may be argued that some of the provisions are impacting to the great disadvantage of small business people. The Australian Democrats are firmly of the opinion that the small business sector has borne the brunt of government policy excessively in this country, not only in recent years but also in recent decades. </PARA>
<PARA> We identify with the amendment proposed by Senator Watson, which simply reverts to an exemption which had been granted under previous tax policies to hospitals, benevolent organisations and universities in not imposing upon them an unnecessary requirement to meet twice monthly group tax payments. We cite that exemption as having been appropriate in the past. We have not had a reasonable explanation from the Treasury as to why that exemption should be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> We cite the fact that many aspects of these machinery Bills are to enhance the cash flow of government and to disadvantage the cash flow of business. In that respect, we do not identify with the Bills in principle but, because we are opposed to the interference with budgetary Bills, at this stage the Democrats will support them. We will also support the amendment foreshadowed by Senator Watson. My colleague Senator Coulter has foreshadowed a second reading attachment which will be moved at the end of the second reading stage.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to reports in the industry journal Nuclear Fuel, 9 January 1989, p. 10 and 13 April 1989, p. 3, concerning the difficulties in which Canadian uranium mining giant CAMECO finds itself.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) These reports together with many others have been examined and the Department regularly provides me with analysis and advice on various uranium issues, including uranium prices.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) I am unable to comment on the basis for CAMECO's commercial decisions other than to say I have also seen the reports to which the honourable senator refers.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Australian uranium producers can be expected to gain a reasonable share of the uncommitted uranium market in the medium term. Forecasts suggest that from the early to mid-1990s there will be opportunities for Australian producers to secure additional contracts.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The change in the floor price policy, announced on 4 September 1989, will enable Australian producers to be competitive in the market place subject to satisfying the Government that prices are fair and reasonable. Future increases in Australian production will be in response to market demand.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Yes, I am aware of the reported sale of uranium by CAMECO to Chubu Electric Power Co. Chubu Electric Power Co is not a shareholder/customer of ERA.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) and (9) I am not able to provide any details as to price and contract conditions of the CAMECO/Chubu contract beyond those details reported in the `Nuclear Fuel' article of 20 February 1989. Japanese utilities' uranium requirements are, in general, fully covered through to the mid to late 1990s. There are, however, some Japanese utilities with uncovered demand from the early 1990s, and I understand that Australian producers are actively pursuing those opportunities. The longer term sales prospects in the Japanese market for all Australian producers are strong, given Australia's proven performance over a long period as a reliable, competitive supplier to Japan.</PARA>
