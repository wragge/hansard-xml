<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to have my second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purposes of this Bill are two:</PARA>
<PARA>1. To disallow the determination of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal so that it shall have no force or effect and</PARA>
<PARA>2. To provide that in future such determinations are disallowable instruments.</PARA>
<PARA> The present determination, if implemented, will be a severe penalty to pharmacists. It will cause 20 per cent plus real reduction in PBS income. This is in addition to the 12 per cent real reduction in income suffered by pharmacists over the last twelve months. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears the Government has cast about for areas of reduction in expenditure on health and has settled on the poor hapless pharmacists. This, at a time when pharmacists have already been squeezed as a result of Federal Government moves. </PARA>
<PARA> The result of this determination of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal is that many pharmacists will just close their doors. Unfortunately, many closing will be those providing the most needed services such as those in small towns or isolated suburban areas. Those that receive specific assistance in these circumstances will be and remain precariously dependent on this and may yet decide not to continue in a country pharmacy. </PARA>
<PARA> Those pharmacies which survive will do so by cutting costs. The only way they can do that is to reduce staff. That will result in a drastic cut in service to the public and the lowering of standards of pharmacy practice in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Pharmacists who have recently graduated are already finding difficulty obtaining employment. Some sackings have already occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> The tribunal acknowledged that pharmacies would be placed in jeopardy but did not consider the wider costs to the community of pharmacy closures. They did not consider the increase in transport costs to the consumer who would have to travel further to have his prescriptions dispensed. Thus the total cost to the community may rise even while Government expenditure falls. Unfortunately, this Government rarely does total social costing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of concern that the costs of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme are ``blowing out'' with an anticipated increase from $1000m to $1200m in just one year. But this piecemeal approach of taking $92m over two years from the pockets of pharmacists is not good enough. A complete review of the PBS is required, and I duly moved a motion to that effect last September in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is evident that the Tribunal's decisions have been based on flawed information. It is a matter of concern that no-one on the Tribunal had specific knowledge of the pharmaceutical profession. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill includes provisions such that further determinations will be subject to disallowance by Parliament. Had these determinations been in the form of regulations I could have simply moved for disallowance rather than introduce a private member's Bill. If the Government sets up a Tribunal and sets the terms of reference, it is only appropriate that Parliament be able to disallow the determinations. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have my second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Many continue to argue that `education' should be the principal instrument for social behaviour modification in the area of resource exploitation and conservation. As long ago as 1968, Garrett Hardin, an eminent American biologist, published in the journal, Science, a seminal essay titled `The Tragedy of the Commons'. Hardin convincingly argued that attempting to bring about such change through ``education'' was counterproductive. What is meant by education in this context is conscience development or conscience sensitisation. Those who have a conscience or whose conscience can be activated by `education' are stimulated to act `responsibly'. Others continue to behave in the same old way. What Hardin showed was that those who acted on conscience were put at a disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, in the use of recycled paper, those who presently use recycled paper believing, correctly, that to do so is environmentally more responsible, put themselves at a disadvantage. Paper made from recycled pulp is generally more expensive, it is not available from all suppliers. And so it is in so many areas of social or environmental responsibility. Relying on conscience or `education' to get the job done is counter productive because it puts those with a conscience at a disadvantage. Those with a conscience dwindle in numbers while those without proliferate and prosper. Hardin demonstrated that to change behaviour one must also change the milieu in which people operate to one in which conscience and good behaviour are rewarded, not penalised. If `conscience' works with, rather than against, the prevailing system of rewards and penalties, then behaviour will change and the new behaviour will spread through the community. </PARA>
<PARA> In a society whose structure and direction are predicated so heavily on economic considerations it is both appropriate and consistent to use price incentives and cost penalties to achieve desirable change. </PARA>
<PARA> There are already a small number in Australia who use recycled paper. The CSIRO report, Pulp Mills: Modern Technology and Environmental Protection looked at the relative price of bleached and less bleached paper and said, `The increasing orientation to lesser bleached products in some countries, will affect at most, only marginally these development opportunities'. Given the relative prices this conclusion may be justified. But price relativities can be changed and should be changed to reflect environmental as well as production costs. This is appropriately done by Government by way of tax as the unfettered market has no suitable alternative mechanism for translating environmental damage into a price penalty. The Government `corrects' the market so that the consumer pays the full cost of production including resource depletion and environmental pollution. </PARA>
<PARA> At present both new paper and recycled paper-paper made from recycled pulp-attract a 20 per cent sales tax. The price of new paper made from native forests does not adequately reflect the cost of destruction of this natural resource. The value of such forests extends well beyond their value as a source of either wood chips for paper or sawn timber. This value is not adequately reflected in the price paid for the timber and chips taken from such forests. If it were, the rate of regeneration of native forests would equal or exceed the rate of exploitation. This is not the case. If Government were to see sales tax, not merely as a way of raising revenue, but as a way of fully imposing on the market, `the user pays', then sales tax on new paper would be substantially increased. </PARA>
<PARA> This bill proposes an alternative, and hopefully more acceptable way of shifting the consumption of paper significantly toward paper made from recycled pulp. The removal of the 20 per cent sales tax from recycled paper will bring its price into line with or below that of new paper. Those who, out of concern for the impact of paper demand on the environment, choose to buy recycled paper will not suffer a price penalty but rather be rewarded with a cheaper product. Those, without an environmental conscience may continue to consume new paper and suffer a slight penalty or may choose to use recycled paper on price alone. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classification) Amendment Bill (No. 2) was being debated in June I attempted unsuccessfully to move an amendment to remove the 20 per cent sales tax from recycled paper. This amendment was defeated by the combined vote of Government and Opposition members. Within weeks the Opposition was promising to remove the 20 per cent sales tax from recycled paper and the Prime Minister promised the same in his environment statement of July 20. Many people now wrongly believe the sales tax has already been removed. </PARA>
<PARA> I have given consideration to legislating a sliding scale of sales tax depending on the content of new and recycled fibre. This has been rejected in favour of a more easily administered single content of 80 per cent by weight above which sales tax shall not be payable. The 80 per cent level will allow a range of papers to be made by suitable admixture of new fibre. Attention will need to be given to provision within the regulations for correct certification as to the fibre content of paper and for suitable penalties for incorrect or misleading certification. </PARA>
<PARA> At present some 30 to 40 per cent of paper is recycled in Australia but except for a very small amount this is used to manufacture cardboard and other packaging, then to be burnt or otherwise discarded. Thus, at best, 30 to 40 per cent of fibre is now used twice. By recycling fibre from paper into paper before turning it to cardboard and packaging, fibre will be used more times before eventually being discarded. In this way the demand on forests for new fibre can be substantially reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has claimed that Australia leads the world in environmental protection. This is not true. We took ten years longer than the US, Canada, Norway and Sweden to ban CFCs in pressure packs and the course of the Australian natural environment is still down hill. The Prime Minister's July 20 Environment Statement contained no initiative on greenhouse. The Government seems to assume that environmental leadership will necessarily involve economic penalty. The reverse is the case. As the world recognises the need for greater environmental care those countries which lead with the new technology and the accompanying and necessary new institutional and social arrangements will have an economic as well as a responsibility lead on other nations. </PARA>
<PARA> So far the Government has made no move to give effect to the Prime Minister's promise. This Bill gives both Government and Opposition a chance to redeem their promises. I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That General Business Order of the Day No. 17 (Flags Amendment Bill 1987) be discharged from the Notice Paper. </PARA>
<PARA>Earlier this week my colleague Mr Fife introduced a Bill in the House of Representatives which is similar to the Flags Amendment Bill currently before the Senate. Mr Fife's Bill goes further than my Bill and takes account of developments which have occurred since my Bill was introduced in 1987. The Opposition proposes to pursue vigorously all avenues to have Mr Fife's Bill debated and passed in the House of Representatives. If the Government frustrates that course of action, as it has so often in the past when the Opposition has attempted to take steps to strengthen the preservation of our national symbols, we will introduce that Bill into the Senate and pursue its passage here. To avoid any confusion we think it desirable to remove my Bill from the Senate Notice Paper at this stage, but in so doing I want to make it absolutely clear that the Opposition is determined to do all in its power to ensure that no government will ever again be in a position of being able to alter the Australian Flag in any way without reference to this Parliament or to the Australian people. </PARA>

Firstly, Senator Coulter said that since we have said that the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) is to be abolished should the Government succeed with its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) proposal and since what is proposed here is only an interim arrangement, why is the Opposition so concerned about the rules governing ministerial directions in relation to the corporate plan, which is what this amendment is about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The response to that is that we on this side of the chamber do not know when the ATSIC proposal will come into effect. Had we accepted what the Government said at the end of 1987 it would have come into effect shortly afterwards. We are now almost two years down the track and, as far as we are concerned, ATSIC still remains subject to the passage of its legislation through this place. Presumably, it will receive further consideration in another place and will then come back to this chamber. Presumably, it will then receive royal assent and be proclaimed. I suggest to my colleague that it is proper for us to assume that the process is somewhere in the future and that it is necessary that the Bill before us be put into as good a form as possible. While he may be correct, it does not follow that the Bill will not operate for some considerable time. On that argument we think that it is worthwhile getting the Bill right. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, Senator Coulter made what I thought was a proper criticism. He took up my words that we must look at the words of the Bill. He has looked at the words of the amendment. What I thought he was saying was that he would rather have seen our amendment couched to say, `The Commission is not required to comply with any general direction given by the Minister'. Had it been in that form his riposte to us would have been possible. If that is so I may seek leave to amend the amendment to add the word `general', because I think that his point warrants some response. </PARA>
<PARA> We wish to press the amendment because we cannot accept that it is not necessary. The Minister has read from section 11 of the Aboriginal Development Commission Act. But on that section 11, which concerns directions by the Minister in relation to the Aboriginal Development Commission, I repeat what I said last night. Subsection (1) says that the Minister can issue directions; sub- section (2) limits the Minister, but not in relation to the corporate plan. I know the Minister said last night that there was some question as to whether subsection (2) would apply to the corporate plan. I have to say to him that on our reading we do not think it does. We think the corporate plan is separate. </PARA>
<PARA> When we go to the only ministerial direction that has ever been issued, we see that it was a cause celebre which came before the Senate Select Committee of which Senator Coulter and I were members. It related to the Aboriginal Development Commission and was the immediate cause of the dismissal of eight commissioners in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> For those reasons I say again that we believe that it is necessary to add amendment No. 2, as circulated. That amendment would insert a new subclause (4) into proposed section 10a in the terms in which it has been circulated to make it quite clear that the Commission is required to prepare a corporate plan but that the Minister cannot determine what that corporate plan will be. That is what the amendment we have circulated moves. Having said all that and in light of Senator Coulter's quite correct point last night, I seek leave of the Committee to insert the word `general' into our proposed amendment, so that it would now read:</PARA>
<PARA> Page 2, clause 5, after proposed subsection 10a (3), add the following new subsection:</PARA>
<PARA>``(4) The Commission is not required to comply with any general direction given by the Minister about the contents of the corporate plan.''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal with the Opposition amendment as has now been put before the chamber, by leave. I simply indicate that the reason for the Government's resistance to the amendment has been the inference that lies behind it that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs would be minded to dictate to the Commission the contents of its corporate plan. Quite clearly, the whole structure of section 10a as proposed by clause 5 makes it clear that the Commission is to bear the full responsibility. It is mandatory that it prepare the corporate plan. The obligation falls squarely on the Commission, in consultation with the Minister. It is consultation rather than direction which is the hallmark of the preparation of the plan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw the attention of honourable senators to section 11 (2) of the principal Act. Last night I said that it may be arguable, but I did not press the argument, that a corporate plan could fall within the terms of subsection (2), but I finally said that by analogy and by looking at the directions actually contained in the general directions issued on 11 April 1989 one gets a clear indication of the way in which the Minister intends to operate so as to make the Commission aware of suggestions as to the corporate plan, but not making directions which are binding on the Commission. That combination of the ethos of section 11 (2), section 10a as proposed, and the actual evidence we have of the directions already issued by the Minister under section 11, led me to characterise the moving of this amendment by the Opposition as somewhat overwrought, somewhat overly nervous as to what might be done by the Minister. I say `the' Minister, because the argument has become somewhat personalised. </PARA>

<PARA>I move these amendments together in a spirit of trying to avoid prolonged debate on each individual amendment. The amendments are under the heading `General Manager'. We move them together because they all have a common purpose and single argument can cover what we are concerned about and what we are trying to achieve. The amendments all relate to clause 12, and in each instance we seek to leave out `by the Minister after consulting the Commission' and insert the words the other way around-`by the Commission after consulting the Minister'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has listened to and read the statements of Ministers over some years-including those of the present Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand), who has had the carriage of this legislation-about the desirability of Aboriginal self-management and, in the Minister's terms, the desirability of self-determination. We have said, `Let us look at the legislation which is promoted by the Government to see how those ideals are put into effect'. It seems to us that the clause as drafted is inconsistent with either the ideal of self-management or the ideal of self-determination. These are the words being used by the Government to describe its approach within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission package of Bills. What is in clauses 12 and 13 of this Bill is the very reverse. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision reflects a determination by Government to control the staffing of the Aboriginal Development Commission and it is manifested in this instance by a determination that the Minister should appoint the General Manager. Let us just look at that for a moment. If the Aboriginal Development Commission is operating as a statutory commission under its own statute with its own duties and functions and under its own corporate plan, are we really going to say, if we believe in self-management by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, that we will not even let it appoint its own General Manager? Of course it should appoint its General Manager. I understand that another statutory body might take a different approach. We might say in relation to a statutory authority like the Pipeline Authority that a different situation applies. But this legislation is Aboriginal legislation. It is not just a statute as written. This legislation is required to reflect an expression of ideology, an expression of values, an expression of priorities by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has told us day after day about the desire to see self-management promoted. The ADC has been, and remains at the moment, the flagship of Aboriginal self-management. Since 1980, when the Aboriginal Development Commission was first created, the Commission itself has appointed its General Manager. We are not asking for something new. We are asking that a situation which has always applied to the ADC continue to apply. The Government proposes in clause 12 that that situation should change; that the ADC which has appointed its own General Manager should no longer be able so to do. The Opposition says that it simply cannot understand this. The Government appoints the commissioners. We do not all agree with some of the choices the Government made last year. But it is proper that the Government appoint the commissioners. Surely the commissioners can then appoint their General Manager. Each of amendments 3 to 10 inclusive, that we have moved, as Senator Coulter said, serve to reverse what the Government proposes-to maintain the status quo ante but to maintain it in the name of Aboriginal self-management. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Peter Baume has eloquently expressed the philosophy which I believe should underlie these particular clauses. The Australian Democrats will accept those changes because they reverse the role and preserve an adequate input from the Minister. It is appropriate that several of the things mentioned should be after consultation with the Minister. But clearly the Commission is the body that should have the primary decision making function. We accept the primacy of that role and we accept also that it gives effect to what the Government has stated in its intention: namely, to give greater facility for Aboriginal self-management and self-determination.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very grateful that Senator Coulter, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, is agreeing to the Opposition's amendment. It is quite clear that the role of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) would be reduced only to a puppet role if it could not appoint its own General Manager. We have talked long an hard about self-determination and self-management. We have seen self-management evolve in some of the communities where the Aboriginal people are looking after their own interests. More and more white advisers are being removed from the communities or are voluntary removing themselves as the Aboriginal people are coming to the point where they are looking after their own communities. A lot of self-management and self-determination has evolved in the last five or six years at the grassroots level and at the coal face. For the Government to put forward this proposition that the ADC cannot appoint its own General Manager is a big march backwards in time. I am very happy to say that we will be able to go out into the Aboriginal communities and say we have won the right for the ADC to be self-sufficient and to have the right to appoint its own staff.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government cannot accept this amendment. Whilst it is true that self-management is a major principle underlying the reconstruction of Aboriginal affairs attendant upon the various events of the last couple of years, it is equally true that there is a need to ensure accountability, particularly to the Parliament. It is considered by the Government that the way in which the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs might be able to take responsibility for the appointment-and, of course, the termination of appointment-of the General Manager and the manner in which he discharges his duties allows the Parliament to ensure that the responsibility of the Minister for the running of the Aboriginal Development Commission is able to be enforced in terms of the responsibility of a Minister to the various chambers of the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is really the question of accountability to the Parliament which lies behind this proposition in a general policy sense. Attached to that, though, is the fact that the General Manager is vested with the powers of the Secretary of a department. In that respect I understand that it is extremely unusual for a person vested with such powers not to be appointed by the Government. That is one of the reasons why the appointment of the General Manager of the Commission by the Minister was thought to be appropriate. In fact, the General Manager will be exercising all those powers vested in him as equivalent to the Secretary of a major department of state. Clause 13, proposed section 33 (2) of the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill, reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The General Manager has all the powers of, or exercisable by, a secretary under the Public Service Act 1922, so far as those powers relate to the branch of the Australian Public Service comprising the staff referred to in subsection (1) . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That was one of the reasons which encouraged the Government to think it sensible that the Minister appoint the General Manager. The overall consideration was responsibility: to allow the Minister to take responsibility for the appointment of such a crucial person and for him to be held responsible by this Parliament in the ways we have become accustomed to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday during the second reading debate on the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill I was critical of a number of actions of the commissioners of the ADC in July 1988 when they chose to change the status of Mr Mick O'Brien. Mr O'Brien had been a long serving General Manager of the ADC. As many honourable senators will be aware from previous annual reports of the ADC to the Parliament, Mr O'Brien played a very significant role and discharged his functions as General Manager of the Commission properly. As a result of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, stacking the Board of the Commission in May 1988 with a group of commissioners that were obviously put in place to do only his bidding, a point of conflict was created concerning the General Manager's position. Honourable senators will be aware that last week Senator Teague incorporated in his speech a certain amount of evidence from the transcript of a discussion between the commissioners. Let me reflect, again, on a couple of those points. I will quote directly from the commissioners:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Stand Mick-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Mr O'Brien-</PARA>
<PARA>aside and say that the Chief officer of the ADC is now Mike Stewart and all staff answerable to him. That's it. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on the commissioners say:</PARA>
<PARA>We should knock this into a resolution. Mike Stewart is now the position of the General Manager. Put Mick O'Brien on special duties, and if he can't come at those, we can put him aside. Mike Stewart will hone in on them and Shirley is not to leave Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA>They go on:</PARA>
<PARA>The other thing is we want to cover the political scandal. We don't want Mike Stewart getting involved with all the administrative matters. We've got to be careful about that. If we give him all O'Brien's delegations, he's going to be tied into knots. They'll make it hard for him. They'll just try and knock him off. What we want is a politician. </PARA>
<PARA>It might appear that there is a double-edged sword in dealing with this amendment. We have what I would say are very openly criticisable actions of the commissioners, who were seeking to make changes. What I argued yesterday was that those actions were motivated by political reasons by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) using the Hand-picked, specially appointed commissioners to achieve a change. This was different to the satisfactory arrangements where the Commission had developed a proper, an appropriate and a professional system with regard to the General Manager's position. </PARA>
<PARA> I reinforce the points made by Senator Peter Baume that Aboriginal people themselves must be allowed to take the responsibility for what they are doing. If we are going to seek to have transferred to the Minister the political control of the appointment of the General Manager, we are not allowing the commissioners to accept their full part of this responsibility, which is Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that these people are Aboriginal administrators and are appointed to do a special task, we make a mockery of the whole thing if we say that, just because the Minister got himself into strife last year, because he made the wrong appointments to the Commission, who in turn engaged in this bastardry, we should transfer the responsibility straight back to the Minister. As Senate Tate pointed out last night, it is more to do with the fact that we are more fearful of some of the actions of Minister Hand than perhaps we were of any past Ministers, or will be of any future Minister. I believe that the Governments proposition does not recognise the proper development that should be allowed to happen for Aboriginal people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tambling has given an eloquent argument in favour of the Government's position on this matter. There is nothing in the Opposition's proposal which would prevent such bastardry-as Senator Tambling termed it-being exercised against the General Manager at some future date. In fact, what the Government proposes is-honourable senators may think it is somewhat paradoxical-a protection to a general manager against the sort of activity that went on in relation to the former general manager, Mr O'Brien, as characterised by Senator Tambling. In fact, by requiring the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) to take responsibility for the termination of an appointment, in terms of proposed new section 32g, one would not only have protection in terms of the statute but also, of course, ultimate responsibility to the Parliament. The Minister would have to take responsibility for and explain, when challenged in this chamber, his actions under section 32g. Therefore, there would be greater protection for a general manager facing the sorts of bastardry which Senator Tambling claims characterised the actions of the Commission in relation to Mr O'Brien. I think the inclusion of this clause by the Government provides some protection and, indeed, a barrier against that sort of malevolent action by the Commission, as part of the reconstruction of the Aboriginal Development Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) has just said, in rebuttal of Senator Tambling's argument, could be restated in the following way: `We can only protect the General Manager by doing away with the concept of self-management'. That is what the Minister is saying. By giving the non-Aboriginal Minister authority, a general manager can be protected against excesses of Aboriginal commissioners. While I found what the commissioners did to Mr O'Brien last year unfair and malevolent, it was nevertheless within their capacity to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make several points. The Aboriginal Development Commission has operated since 1980, with the Commission selecting its own General Manager. I know of no good reason for that to change. The Minister has said that he wants it to change and that in the Government's view it would assist accountability. I cannot see how it would assist accountability. I cannot see the connection. The Minister then said that the amendments might cause complications in relation to clause 13. If that is so, if these amendments are successful and the Minister then wished us to reconsider the appropriateness of the proposed new section, we would hear argument. The Minister might then say he would be happier if we did not proceed in regard to proposed section 33 (2) when we consider that a little later, but there is nothing in his argument that adequately rebuts any of the arguments that I have put forward. If we are talking about Aboriginal self-management, and if we have any regard for the history of the Aboriginal Development Commission and the capacity of the Commission to appoint its own General Manager, it remains a valid point, and the amendments which we have proposed seek to maintain the status quo. For that reason we press them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not doubt Senator Tate's capacity or his integrity regarding this matter, but I doubt his knowledge of Aboriginals. What he is really saying is that the Aboriginal Development Commission cannot guarantee responsibility for its own accountability and that the only way that we will have accountability is to place a ministerial appointment in to the ADC. Senator Tate is falling into a very serious trap. Aboriginal people are very hurt by this. He is patronising the Aboriginal people. He is saying, `You haven't got the ability, you haven't got the capacity, and you haven't got the brains to guarantee accountability. We are going to put big brother in there to watch over you. You haven't been able to do it for 200 years and you are not going to do it for the next 200 years. We are going to hold your hand'. Senator Tate should not do that. He should give the Aboriginal people a go; he should let the Aboriginal people run their own organisation. They will make mistakes; a lot more mistakes will be made, but it is only by making mistakes that they are going to learn. The Aboriginal people are not going to learn anything if someone is appointed to the Commission to hold their hand and tell them what to do-someone who will make the decisions for them when they should be making the decisions themselves. They will fall back on that particular person and look to him instead of looking to themselves to make decisions. I know I am preaching to the converted when I am talking to Senator Coulter. He has said that we are supporting these amendments that will give self-determination, but I want to put on the record, and say to Senator Tate, that we must not patronise Aboriginals.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to add a few remarks to those that have been very cogently put in this debate on these clauses by Senator Peter Baume, my colleague Senator Boswell and, I understand, Senator Coulter of the Australian Democrats. It seems to me that what we have here is not merely the question to which most recently Senator Boswell has referred, but also a different question which the Government has failed to address. After all we have here a Commission the framework for the establishment of which is being set up by this Government, yet this Government appears to be professing so little faith in the product of its work that it is not prepared to endow that Commission with the power to appoint its own General Manager. I find this strange. The Minister for Justice has put forward an argument which is all very well as far as it goes but, as Senator Boswell has said, the failure by the Minister to accept the amendments put forward by the Opposition in this area really boils down to a lack of confidence in the people making up the Commission. With great respect, I think the Minister has not addressed that point and I would like to hear him, when responding, do so directly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All I am trying to establish is a way in which the Minister can be accountable to the Parliament for the appointment of the General Manager and the performance of his duties. It is a question, arising out of incidents in recent times, of looking at the termination of the appointment-if one likes to put it that way-of Mick O'Brien, which was spoken about by Senator Tambling. I believe one can make a case for the better protection of the General Manager, and a better method for enabling him to discharge his duties without fear of the undermining which was outlined by Senator Tambling, and there is better protection in the provisions of proposed new section 32g for termination of appointment, for which the Minister would be answerable to the Parliament. It is in relation to that that I believe the argument is best illustrated in favour of the clause put in by the Government which the Opposition is opposing.

But those of us who are supporting the package as a whole are making a judgment that, the Aboriginal people have to be given an opportunity to give it a go and they have to be trusted. It is no good simply going halfway. If we are fair dinkum about self-determination and self-management, that also means the right to fail as well as the right to succeed.

<PARA> (11) Page 5, clause 12, proposed subsection 32a (4) lines 3 to 6, leave out the proposed subsection. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will note that we have circulated this amendment under the heading `Group 4-General Manager's Duty to Commission, not Minister'. It becomes easier to argue for it in the light of the vote that has just been taken on amendments (3) to (10), the last group of amendments that we have just dealt with, which make it clear that the General Manager is a creature of the Commission, not a creature of the Minister. What I propose in this amendment is that we should leave out proposed subsection 32a (4). That subsection might have been appropriate had the General Manager of the Commission been an agent of the Minister. It might have been partly appropriate, because the proposed subsection reads:</PARA>
<PARA>In spite of any policy determined or direction given by the Commission for the purpose of subsection (3), the General Manager shall, when requested by the Minister, provide information or advice to the Minister on any matter specified by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>I will separate the words `on any matter specified by the Minister' for one moment. Had the General Manager been an appointee of the Minister, there would have been an argument to say that he should have been required to report to the Minister in a general way, which this subsection envisages. But that subsection as it stands would make it clear that the General Manager of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) is in a master/servant relationship-he is a servant of the Minister, not of the ADC. It would be the General Manager's duty really to tell on, to give information about, the very people for whom he works whenever a Minister asked. Such a proposal is a very gross intrusion upon the principle of self-management. </PARA>
<PARA> Without making too much of it, I ask honourable senators to direct their minds particularly to the words `on any matter specified by the Minister'. We argued about this matter earlier. I think Senator Coulter took me to task for the rather reductio ad absurdum example I used when I said, `You might be able to ask the General Manager about any information he may have gathered when shopping for the family groceries last week'. As the subsection is drafted, that would be possible. The subsection states that the General Manager must provide information or advice on any matter specified by the Minister. For the same reasons as we identified last night, we think that that is unduly wide. But in any event, in the light of the amendment to which we have just agreed, this subsection is no longer necessary or appropriate. Further, it creates the wrong relationship between the Commission and its chief officer. That is another reason why it should not be agreed to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst proposed new subsection 32a is extracted by the Opposition for another vote, nevertheless it forms part of proposed section 32. One has to keep in mind that, despite the vote that has been taken, what one is trying to achieve is a capacity for the Minister to be truly answerable to this Parliament in the ultimate political sense for the operations of the Aboriginal Development Commission. It is extremely difficult to do so if information which the Parliament is seeking cannot be provided to the Minister initially so that he can then make a response to the Parliament in its questions or in its general debate in relation to the operations of the Aboriginal Development Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can say from my own experience over the last 12 months or so that there have been times when I have been utterly embarrassed and left stranded by my inability to answer many questions put by the Opposition relating to the operations of the Aboriginal Development Commission simply because the Minister had no capacity to require information to be sent across from the Commission. I can assure the Committee that we found it extremely difficult to overcome that problem. Honourable senators will recall that there were delays of weeks, and of months on some occasions, in trying to get information for the Senate in answer to questions or for its consideration in the various debates that took place. The fact is that the General Manager would be in a position to ensure that the Minister had the information at his request so that if the Parliament wished, as is its right, to hold the Minister accountable in the ultimate political sense for the operations of the Commission, then it has the information properly available to it. It is in that sense that the clause was drafted by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This proposed new subsection has a very important role in ensuring that the proper processes of accountability on the part of the Minister to this Parliament take place. After listening to Senator Peter Baume and recalling last night's debate I wonder whether it might be possible to amend the particular clause seeking information in the same terms as the Opposition's group 1 amendment was last night, so that the information which might be properly sought by the Minister should relate to or be about the operations of the Commission or about the Act. I make it quite clear that that is what is intended-the Minister should be able to obtain information about the operations of the Commission or about the Act. That might be done on the run. Perhaps we could hear what Senator Coulter has to say before deciding whether we should pursue that further amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would be good if we could co-operate to resolve this issue. We agree with the goal which the Minister has stated in the arguments he has put. He has no disagreement from this side about the need for proper accountability and he had no disagreement from this side when he set out for us some of the difficulties he faced last year of which we were aware and with which we sympathised. But if this proposed subclause were written to require the Commission, when requested by the Minister, to provide information we would have no objection to it. If the Minister is proposing that he might amend it, perhaps he might consider amending it in two ways: first, to amend the last few words in the manner in which he has already suggested and, secondly, instead of the proposed new subsection saying that the General Manager shall do certain things it should say that the Commission shall do certain things. At that stage it may be possible to get agreement from this side of the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Peter Baume has pre-empted me. That was precisely the point I was going to make. My understanding was that the Minister could seek advice and information from the Commission. In the past, when that information has not been forthcoming promptly, the Commission has been derelict in its responsibility. I certainly support what Senator Baume has just said. The Minister has really addressed only one part of the concern about this-namely, the breadth of information and advice which can be obtained from the General Manager. The other part to which Senator Baume has just drawn our attention is the fact that information is obtainable from the General Manager and not the Commission. I would certainly be happier if the Government were prepared to look at inserting `Commission' rather than `General Manager' with or without the other word regarding the breadth or narrowness of the advice which the Minister may seek.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am extremely attracted to this idea but it is already in the Bill. If honourable senators look at page 2 of the Bill as circulated they will find that it states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>4. Section 8 of the Principal Act is amended:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) by inserting after paragraph (e) the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> `(ea) when requested by the Minister, to provide information or advice to the Minister on any matter specified by the Minister,';</PARA>

<PARA>shall, when requested . . . provide information . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I do not mind strengthening the clause in that way; I just indicate that, whilst the General Manager is on hand at all times, the Commission meets at irregular intervals. For that reason it might be more difficult to get the information in a timely way in order to assist the Parliament in its deliberations and to ensure the accountability of the Minister. But I can accept that, given Senator Coulter's indications, the proposed new subsection, as drafted, will not be carried. Therefore, if the clause were to read, `The Commission shall, when requested by the Minister, provide information or advice to the Minister about the operation of the Commission or about this Act', we could accept that. </PARA>

<PARA>(12) Page 7, clause 14, lines 10 to 25, leave out the clause. </PARA>
<PARA>This is an amendment to clause 14 of the Bill. It seeks to leave out the clause which appears between lines 10 and 25 on page 7 of the Bill. The clause which is sought to be omitted relates to the estimates of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). That clause seeks to add to the ADC Act some new subsections. The effect of the new subsections is to provide extra power for the Minister-power which the Minister has not previously had-to determine and oversight the estimates developed within the Aboriginal Development Commission. For example, proposed new subsection 2 would provide that the money of the Commission shall not be spent, except in accordance with estimates of expenditure approved by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsection 3, if passed, would provide that the amount spent by the Commission in relation to matters covered by an item in estimates approved by the Minister may differ from the amount allocated only within certain narrow limits. Proposed subsection 4, if passed, would provide that nothing in the above subsections empowers the Commission to spend amounts in relation to matters covered by the estimates approved by the Minister that exceed in total the total amount of expenditure provided for by those estimates. This brings the whole estimates process of the ADC under ministerial control. Honourable senators will appreciate that subsection 2 provides that the estimates shall be such and such, as approved by the Minister. Subsection 3 talks about estimates approved by the Minister. Subsection 4 limits the capacity of the ADC to vary those estimates. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs one of the things that made the Department so good-it was a splendid Department to work with in those days-was the fact that we had a global Budget. One of the great virtues of the global budgeting process was that I could move money around after consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I could respond to need as it arose. When the ADC was created in 1980 there was no provision such as the proposed provision in that Act. No previous Minister has found it necessary to seek such close controls over the estimates process. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to bore the Committee, but again and again we return to the theme of Aboriginal self-management. If that is what we are on about it is really important to question why this new constraint will be necessary. The things that occurred last year really occurred as a consequence of the great disturbances following the dismissal of certain commissioners. They were the consequences of poor decisions made by commissioners. The answer is to appoint better commissioners. The answer is not to try to seek to amend the ADC Act to tie up the estimates setting process of the ADC in a way which has never been done previously. It provides that the Minister must approve all estimates. That then binds the ADC completely. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say something else to the Committee. The standard organs of government-the central control organs of government-have never liked the ADC. They do not like statutory commissions. A statutory commission whose goal is self-management will not be liked. I know that the Minister may tell us that certain central groups within Government when asked to report to the ADC managed to report in ways that sought to bring the ADC back under standard public service control. That is not what the self-management ideal is about. It is not a question of our seeking to do away with something that exists. It is a question of our seeking to ask the Government why it is necessary to extend ministerial control over the estimates process of the ADC. That is the question. </PARA>
<PARA> Our amendment which seeks to leave out the clause would once again, as with previous amendments, merely seek to maintain the status quo ante. The ADC has been the flagship of Aboriginal self-management. It remains so. We have to be very careful about any exercise which seeks to constrain that Aboriginal self-management. If there have been errors-and indeed there have been-we should sack the commissioners and appoint better ones. We should not change the system unless there is an absolute need to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Baume really summed up the problem that we are facing in this particular debate by saying that we are merely trying to restore the status quo ante. It is all very well to accept that the chamber has voted for the motion for the second reading of the Bill and then clause by clause undo everything that is sought to be achieved by the Bill. I think the point has come in this particular debate when we are really onto a crucial nub in the reconstruction of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) as undertaken by the Government in good faith following the reports that were sought by this Parliament into the operations of the Aboriginal Development Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that if one looks at the special audit report on the Aboriginal Development Commission and the Department of Aborigi-nal Affairs one finds the comment-I think I read it last night-about the way in which the ADC is required to provide the Minister with annual estimates of proposed expenditure in such form as he directs but is not required to obtain his approval of the estimates. That is the difficulty that was taken up by the Department of Finance in its report on the financial management of the Aboriginal Development Commission dated March 1989. At the end of the report it recommended:</PARA>
<PARA>It is recommended that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs exercise greater ministerial authority over the Commission. In respect of the approval of the Commission's estimates, this would have an immediate effect on the operations of the Commission and would ensure that the Commission's programs at least reflect the priorities of the Government's policies. It is therefore recommended that the Minister for Finance write to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs suggesting he consider:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the means by which the Commission may be required to provide him with estimates for approval (including for the remainder of this financial year);</PARA>
<PARA> (b) advice of the financial policies to be followed in the administration and control of the Commission's programs; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) a Corporate Plan for endorsement. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) in statements of 11 April this year undertook to accept the various reports made into the apparent breakdown in the administration of elements of Aboriginal affairs at the national level in this country. We have brought into the Parliament a Bill which seeks to carry into statutory form the recommendations arising out of those reports which were sought by the Parliament. It is the Parliament that insisted that these investigations into the administration of Aboriginal affairs be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst we are not absolutely bound to implement everything that an Auditor- General or a Department of Finance report recommends, quite clearly and properly the Prime Minister and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs recognised that a good faith response to these reports was required. They did so and we have the clauses in the Bills before us. I say Bills because in the passage of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Bill 1989, which was achieved last night, we accepted amendments put forward by the Opposition, and in relation to the estimates procedure for the Institute the integrity of which Senator Peter Baume quite genuinely expressed a high regard for, Senator Baume inserted the following clause:</PARA>
<PARA>Estimates</PARA>
<PARA> ``35b. (1) The Council shall prepare estimates, in such form as the Minister directs, of the receipts and expenditure of the Institute for each financial year and, if the Minister so directs, for any other period specified by the Minister, and the Council shall submit estimates so prepared to the Minister not later than such date as the Minister directs. </PARA>
<PARA> ``(2) The money of the Institute, other than money held on trust, shall not be spent otherwise than in accordance with estimates of expenditure approved by the Minister.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition has already thought it compatible with the integrity of the Institute and the devising of the programs on which it would expend money appropriated by this Parliament that its estimates of expenditure be approved by the Minister. So I believe that the proposition put forward by the Government that the estimates of expenditure in relation to the ADC should be approved by the Minister is not really so radical and cannot be portrayed as undermining the integrity and the self-management ethos of the Commission. It is a matter which is compatible apparently with maintaining that integrity and yet obviously allows for the Minister to play the sort of role which the reports sought by this Parliament indicated was proper for him, if these elements of the national provision of moneys for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander purposes are to be properly dealt with in a way which is accountable to the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Several things that the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) has said require a response. First of all, the Opposition, having accepted the verdict of the Senate on the second reading, is not against any change to the Aboriginal Development Commission Act and our amendments do not seek to undo the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill clause by clause. I remind the Committee that this Bill has 20 clauses. I have very quickly gone through clauses 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17 ,18, 19 and 20. As far as the Opposition is concerned, we are not seeking to amend them; they do bring changes into the Act. So it is not correct that we are undoing it clause by clause. We are seeking, wherever we think that Aboriginal management has been unacceptably limited, to change it in those terms. The Minister has said that the Parliament sought change. He is quite correct. The Parliament did seek change, but the details and nature of that change have to be looked at by the Parliament when they are presented, and our duty in this chamber is to look at the statute, look at the clauses, and try to do the best job we can.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister raised an analogy with the Institute of Aboriginal Studies and made the point that last night we proposed an amendment, which was accepted, which gave some direct ministerial control over the estimates of the Institute. He is quite correct, but the analogy is not an appropriate one. The Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies will operate independently of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission now. It is not, and never has been, a flagship, as it were, of self-management, it has been an academic institution with an academic task. It has always operated in direct relationship with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. Its funding has always been departmental or direct from government. It is one of the portfolio agencies in direct relationship with the Minister. The clause to which the Committee agreed last night was an entirely appropriate clause. While it was appropriate for the Institute, we believe it is inappropriate for the Aboriginal Development Commission. I will not reiterate all the arguments, but I believe that each of the points that the Minister raised in rebuttal can in turn be rebutted. I believe that the amendment is an appropriate one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One point which neither the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) nor Senator Peter Baume picked up on, and which seems to me to be relevant here, is that the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill deals with the Aboriginal Development Commission transition. That circumstance is unlike the circumstance which has obtained in the past and unlike the circumstance which, presumably, will obtain in the future once the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and its dependent organs are fully operational. For the same reasons which I stated in relation to Senator Baume's amendment to clause 10a (3), it seems to me that under these transitional circumstances it is more appropriate that there be closer liaison between the Minister and the Commission. I do not see that in this instance as intruding into the matter of self-management and self-determination because it is a transitional circumstance. It is certainly not a circumstance I would like to see built into the permanent structure, but this is not the permanent structure; it is a transitional structure. I can foresee difficulties along the way which will require close cooperation between the Minister and the Commission. In those circumstances, I believe that the clause as presented by the Government is acceptable.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill. As I said last night, it is incumbent upon us, as a Committee, to discuss only the legislation in front of us. This Bill will have to go to the lower House to receive our amendments. All the Bills in this package, even the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill, have subsequential amendments. Who is to know what is going to happen to these Bills? Senator Coulter says that we are discussing a transitional Bill here at the moment. I do not think it is up to us to make a judgment on what is going to happen to this Bill. We have this legislation before us now. The Aboriginals may mount a campaign in the next two or three weeks and convince the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Gerry Hand, that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) is not appropriate. They may convince the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that ATSIC is not appropriate. Senator Coulter and I know from our travels in the bush together that ATSIC was by no means universally accepted. Ninety per cent of the people we talked to in the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs were not convinced that ATSIC was the appropriate way to go. Even those that were in limbo wanted more consultation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ATSIC Bill may not get up. We have to look at the Bill in front of us today. That Bill gives the Minister control of all expenditure that the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) has within its power to deal out. The amendment, which relates to page 7, clause 14, lines 10 to 25, depowers the ADC, which is the flagship of Aboriginal development in Australia. As Senator Coulter agreed to our last amendment on the grounds that great harm would otherwise have been done to self-management, self-determination, I think that to be consistent he should support this amendment. Clearly, our amendment will give Aboriginals greater self-determination and self-management. </PARA>
<PARA> We see the measure as just another ministerial attempt to control the ADC; just another attempt to put the Minister in control of a development commission which should be providing not only money for small business and businesses for the Aboriginal community but also an opportunity for Aboriginals to get business experience out in the field, for which it lends money, and in the decision-making process. Thankfully, Senator Coulter has removed the possibility of the Aboriginal commissioners being subservient to a Minister and then to a Minister's General Manager, but he has gone only half way. He said that the Minister cannot appoint a General Manager but, by not supporting our amendment, he is saying that the Minister himself can take control. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Coulter pointed out to Senator Tate a few moments ago, we cannot have it both ways. Either we want self-management or we do not want self-management. The Liberals, the Nationals and the Democrats support self-management, but Senator Coulter cannot have two bob each way. We cannot put the Minister in there and let him virtually run the Department. He knows as well as I do that under those circumstances people will not take the responsibility: they will not take their job seriously. They will say, `What's the use of coming down here, apart from getting a trip out of it? Ultimately the Minister will make the decisions. He will be in control of the Budget and we will be but black tokens sitting here putting our rubber stamp on a ministerial decision'. I ask Senator Coulter not to have two bob each way but to join with us in our amendment and go 100 per cent for self-determination and self-management. </PARA>

If this were a permanent arrangement I would find it objectionable for the reasons he has set out quite clearly and which have been the basis of a great deal of discussion this morning. However, these are not permanent arrangements: they are transitional arrangements. It is drawing somewhat of a long bow to deny the fact that this Bill is predicated on the assumption that ATSIC will become operational. If, as Senator Boswell has indicated-for whatever reason-ATSIC does not succeed in getting through and does not come into operation, the whole structure of the administration of Aboriginal affairs will have to be reassessed all over again. We would be looking at a new structure with new legislation and new Bills. Under those circumstances I think that we would be seeking something different, but we must proceed on the assumption that the Bills are being presented as a package. They foretell certain things happening, the shape of which is now being determined by our considerations at the committee stage. The shape of the ADC with respect to its estimates and financial arrangements in the transitional period is addressed appropriately by the clauses which the Government has presented.</PARA></TALK.START>

We have to look at this Bill which seeks to amend the Aboriginal Development Commission Act and assume that it is being proposed by the Government for some purpose.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Coulter thinks that it was April 1988. Its course has been very long. The Bill is still some way from completion-it is still some way from royal assent-and we have to assume that the amended ADC Act will operate for some significant time. The word `transitional' has to be looked at in that sense. Should the ATSIC Bill fail to become law, this is the Bill under which the Aboriginal Development Commission will operate. That is the point being made by my colleague Senator Boswell.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Coulter was well aware of the fact, when he agreed last night to certain amendments to the Bill for an Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, that clause 2 of the Bill, which sets the commencement date, sets a slightly unusual commencement date because the commencement date for the Institute Bill is in fact the date of commencement of the ATSIC Bill. In other words, Senator Coulter would have known that they were tied together. We can agree to certain amendments to the Institute Bill but we know that they will not have effect until and unless the ATSIC legislation comes into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter will also know that that is not the case with the Bill now before the Committee. The commencement date for this legislation is a standard commencement date-that is, it will commence on the day on which it receives royal assent. We have to assume that the ATSIC Bill still remains ahead of us. If the Government proceeds with its amendments, as I presume it will, at the very least the Bill will be amended to that extent. Should that happen the Bill will have to go back to another place, it will have to make its cycle through the Parliament again and it will then have to receive royal assent and be put into effect while all the time various other events are occurring around us, including our pilots strike. I cannot be certain that the amended Aboriginal Development Commission Act would not be the Act under which the ADC might be required to operate for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter has said that were that the case he might find the clause as proposed in the Bill difficult to accept, but he does accept it because he thinks that it will apply for a brief time only. He might be right, but he might be wrong. If he is wrong the ADC will be tied in the ways which the Bill proposes. I put it to all honourable senators that the safe thing to do is accept our amendment. If at that stage ATSIC does not proceed, as Senator Coulter said, it is quite within the Government's powers to come back with an amendment to the Bill, if it wishes to persist with or press this clause.

<PARA> (13) Pages 7 and 8, clause 15, line 26 (page 7) to line 4 (page 8), leave out the clause, insert the following clause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``15. After section 39 of the Principal Act the following section is inserted:</PARA>
<PARA>Finance Directions</PARA>
<PARA> `39a. (1) The Commission shall prepare and submit to the Minister written directions, not inconsistent with this Act or the regulations, about the administration of the Commission's finances. </PARA>
<PARA> `(2) The directions may apply, adopt or incorporate, with or without modifications, directions given under the Audit Act 1902 by the Minister for Finance, or the Secretary to the Department of Finance, being such directions as in force at a particular time or as in force from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> `(3) The Minister may approve directions prepared under subsection (1). </PARA>

<PARA> `(6) The General Manager shall cause notice of the approval of Finance Directions under this section to be published in the Gazette. </PARA>
<PARA> `(7) In this section, ``approved Finance Direction'' means a direction approved by the Minister under subsection (3).'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment seeks to leave out clause 15 which appears at page 7 of the Bill, for the purpose of inserting thereafter a new section. Clause 15, as drafted, relates to ministerial finance directions. It provides that the Minister shall give to the Commission written directions not inconsistent with this Act about the administration of the Commission's finances. It goes on to say certain things about the finance directions. The Opposition has no objection to appropriate finance directions being given to the Aboriginal Development Commission. The question arises: what should be the structure under which they are given? How should they be given and what should happen to the lines of authority?</PARA>
<PARA> We believe it is desirable, consistent with the principle of Aboriginal self-management, that the finance directions should be acceptable to government. We have no objection to that, but consistent with Aboriginal self-management we believe the Commission itself should be asked to prepare its finance directions and seek to have them accepted. That would require the Commission to prepare finance directions which complied with the general structure of finance directions. The Commission would then present them to the Minister and would have them approved by government. It seems that if that were done the aims of the Government would be met-that is, the Commission would operate under a proper set of finance directions, but in the name of self-management it could have had a proper role in preparing those directions.</PARA>
<PARA> The section we seek to have inserted is designed to give the ADC some say in the kind of ministerial finance directions that could be made to it. Again, the issue is one of just how serious the Government is about Aboriginal self-management. We are quite serious that the Commission should have proper finance directions. I draw to the attention of the Committee that the proposed section to be added by the Opposition, which is contained in the circulated amendments, is quite extensive. The first part of our proposed amendment is in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>`39A. (1) The Commission shall prepare and submit to the Minister written directions, not inconsistent with this Act or the regulations, about the administration of the Commission's finances. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a proper role to play. The second part of our proposed amendment is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>`(2) The directions may apply, adopt or incorporate, with or without modifications, directions given under the Audit Act 1902 by the Minister for Finance, or the Secretary to the Department of Finance . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So the Commission will have a point of reference to which to go when it is preparing those finance directions. Then we provide:</PARA>
<PARA>`(3) The Minister may approve directions prepared under subsection (1). </PARA>
<PARA>Because we wish to be appropriately responsible in this matter, we then provide:</PARA>
<PARA>`(4) The Commission shall comply with an approved Finance Direction even if it is inconsistent with the corporate plan. </PARA>
<PARA>We have done that to make sure that we pick up the point made earlier by the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), that it is not appropriate for a corporate plan to be brought up which in some way is inconsistent with proper accountability within government. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we provide that the Commission should ensure that copies of the approved finance directions should be publicly available for inspection and purchase at each office. There should be nothing secret about them. We also provide:</PARA>
<PARA>`(6) The General Manager shall cause notice of the approval of Finance Directions under this section to be published in the Gazette. </PARA>
<PARA>So the directions would be published in the most official organ of government. We then say what we mean by `approved finance direction'. We have tried to ensure that the finance directions which are prepared shall be adequate, proper and consistent with those required elsewhere in government. But we have tried to say, in the name of Aboriginal self-management, `Let them be prepared by the Commission and approved by the Minister-by the government of the day'. We believe that it is a very proper goal of government that there should be finance directions and that they should provide, as it were, a set of standards against which the Commission shall operate. We believe that they should be present but that they should be prepared, if possible, from within the Commission. That is the purpose of the amendment which I have moved on behalf of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I understand the point being made by Senator Coulter. Is Senator Coulter saying to us that the amendment would be acceptable if it were changed to read `The Minister shall approve . . .'? If I understand Senator Coulter, he is saying that if the Minister finds the finance directions unacceptable for some proper reason, we might want to give him the power of veto. However, we might also want to add that he should notify the Parliament if he takes such a course of action. If that is what Senator Coulter requires, the Opposition would not resist such a change.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think Senator Peter Baume quite took my point. Firstly, any legislation is required to cover all exigencies. The Opposition's amendment does not adequately cover the exigency that the Minister may not approve. If Senator Baume is interpreting my question to mean that the appropriate word is `shall' rather than `may', that leaves the Minister with no power to object. Really, several circumstances need to be covered. First, what happens if the Minister does not approve or wishes to modify a direction-in other words, what happens if he wishes to give some alternative direction or give the thing back to the Commission? Secondly, what powers does the Minister have actually to do that? That is also not covered in his proposed amendment. Both of those aspects need to be picked up. It seems to me that Senator Baume has picked up only one of those.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>We would then go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>If the Minister does not approve these directions the Commission shall prepare an alternative set. </PARA>
<PARA>I am suggesting that if the Minister wants to take that course, he should notify the Parliament. If Senator Coulter is saying that the Commission could not operate if it thumbed its nose at government which, after all, is responsible through the Parliament to the people, I think he makes a valid point. If he wishes us to amend the words in the manner I am suggesting to him, we would not be resistant to that suggestion. I need to know what he thinks is an appropriate resolution of the matter. If he wants to say `Directions prepared under subsection (1) must be submitted to the Minister for approval' and then wants us to go on and add `In the event that the Minister does not approve them, further directions must be prepared and submitted but the Minister shall notify the Parliament', I would be prepared to try to draft some words to meet that intention and to present them as an alternative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know that I have entirely understood but I take it that Senator Peter Baume is suggesting that the Aboriginal Development Commission might submit finance directions which may be resisted or rejected by the Minister and then the Commission would have to go back and draw up another set-and so we go on and on until it came up with a set which accorded with the Minister's wishes. I believe that we ought to go the direct way, which is that the finance directions be made from the start by the Minister in the way that is indicated in the clause. This is a matter of great importance with regard to the proper operation of the Commission. The administration by the Commission of the important matter of the way in which its finances are dealt with is absolutely crucial, as we know from the discussions over the last year or so. Having listened to Senator Baume, I think we would end up in a position where the Minister's will would prevail as the Commission went about trying to amend, modify and present a set of directions which was ultimately acceptable. I think it is best to go the direct route and accept the clause as it is proposed by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not believe for one moment that either the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs or the Aboriginal Development Commission will do other than prepare adequate and proper finance directions or that, at the end of the day, the content will be the issue. From what I know of the operations of the Aboriginal Development Commission and the professionalism which I have seen from its staff in the past, it will want to prepare finance directions which comply with the models that come from the Department of Finance. I believe that those directions will be completely consistent with the operation of the Audit Act 1902 and acceptable to the Minister. That is not the issue. I accept Senator Coulter's query, `But what if there were a conflict? How would we set about resolving it?'. Senator Tate now says, `If, in fact, you require ministerial acceptance why not go the direct route and let the Minister do it from the start?'. The answer to that question is precisely the same answer we have been giving all day. Surely, it is for the Commission to prepare the directions which comply with finance directions. Why should the Minister seek to interpose himself and to direct the Commission on this matter? Why not invite the Commission to prepare proper and adequate finance directions?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although I do not imagine that there will be any conflict at the end of the day with the finance directions that emerge, to insert this clause as proposed by the Government in the Bill is an eloquent statement of a lack of confidence in the Commission and the capacity of the Commission. It is another example of central control departments just sneaking in, exercising their longstanding dislike of the independent ADC. It does not sit well with the claims for self-management. To invite the Commission to prepare and to present finance directions, perhaps with a modification if Senator Coulter wishes it, to cover that one possible exigency, is a better way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister asks, `Why not go directly and have the Minister do it?'. The answer is because we do not think ministerial control over the ADC and many of the day to day functions of the ADC is consistent with the principle of Aboriginal self-management. This is one of those difficult interface situations where the requirements of public accountability require there to be finance directions. The requirements of Aboriginal self-management, we believe, would require us to allow the Commission to try to prepare proper finance directions. That is why we have proposed the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to support Senator Peter Baume and the Opposition's amendment and address the fundamental question the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) raises: Why not just let the Minister approve directions? The answer is that if the Minister approves directions and the Bill allows the Minister to appoint the General Manager, we are virtually taking away all the power from the ADC. Senator Coulter asked `What happens if the Minister approves directions prepared under subsection 1, and so forth?' Senator Coulter also asked `What if the Minister does not approve the directions?'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that Senator Peter Baume will come up with a form of words that will alleviate any concerns that the Australian Democrats have. Those words should provide that if the Minister does not approve those directions then they should come before the Parliament, which will give a direction as to whether what the Minister is seeking in his finance directions is reasonable or whether what the ADC is seeking is reasonable. The Parliament of Australia should ultimately be the final judge of whether the ministerial direction is fair and reasonable or whether the ADC's point of view is the one that should be enforced. That is really power to the people: the Australian people elect the Parliament; they elect the Senate to represent them; and the people will ultimately make the decision on whether a ministerial direction is fair or whether the Aboriginal Development Commission has prepared reasonable directions. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter has raised a very valid query. I believe my colleague Senator Baume has given him a way out. I hope that Senator Baume can come up with a form of words in an amendment that will be acceptable to Senator Coulter. </PARA>

I suggest then we take Government amendments 1 to 3, and 5 to 20, which I believe are non-controversial. Government amendment No. 4 should be deferred until we consider other amendments and it will be introduced at the end.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to waste the time of the Committee. I have to say to the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) that I am sorry that I have not seen the explanatory memorandum. I direct the Minister's attention only to his proposed amendments (19) and (20). First, I do not know what the amendments mean. These two amendments seek to alter schedule 1 on page 91 of the Bill. One of the amendments seeks to insert a new region; the other amendment seeks to take out a region. The first amendment seeks to insert the word `Deakin'-which I take is the name of a region-under Alice Springs. Why are we doing this? Why is it necessary? What is the name `Deakin'? Secondly, why are we taking out the name `Canberra' in amendment (20)? Again, I have not seen the explanatory memorandum. There may be some perfectly simple explanation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the problems is that we do not have a regional map. I am really anticipating some of the debate to follow, but I presume we will be asked to make decisions about regions and their regional councils. We will be asked to approve schedule 1 with the names of regions. We do not have a map to tell us what the regions are. We have input from Aboriginal communities, some of which I think are well known to Senator Collins. Representatives of those communities gave evidence to the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs earlier this year. They said, for example, that their out-stations were being separated into one region while the main centre of the same community was in a different region. We had other evidence that skin and kin groups were being separated between regions. The difficulty we have in trying to evaluate just how important these objections are, in trying to understand them, is that we do not have a map. Without a map we are at a loss as to what attitude we should take. I need the Minister to advise us on those two points. </PARA>
<PARA> I also ask the Minister to explain the effect of amendment (15). This amendment seeks to insert the words `except where the Commission, at the request of the Regional Council concerned, has approved the program for the purposes of this section'. Why are we doing that? The only other amendment that we have a question about is amendment (7). We want the Minister to explain why the Government is proposing that particular amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal with the 19 amendments and pick up some matters which Senator Peter Baume has raised. Just before turning to his matters, I note that the words `the Institute' where they appear in proposed new subclause 6 (c) in our proposed amendment (7) should be deleted. That is our own amendment consequential on the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Bill that was passed last night.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> ``(6) In this section:</PARA>
<PARA> `money of the Commission' does not include:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) money held in trust by the Commission;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) money in the Housing Fund; or</PARA>

<PARA> Amendment-by leave-withdrawn. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that amendment (19) provides for a new region to be part of the central Australian zone. It is an extra region that was requested during the consultations which were undertaken by the Minister with various communities in central Australia. I believe that the designated location of `Deakin' is on the transcontinental railway. It adds that extra region to the central Australian zone. The previous zones, as indicated on the maps, were unsatisfactory to the communities in central Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Cundeelee community, the Yalata community and the Oak Valley community apparently expressed their preference for a separate region to be carved out in the way indicated by amendment (19). Amendment (20) deletes from schedule 1 a region identified by the location `Canberra' from the New South Wales east zone. Canberra has a relatively small Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population. Many are from outside the Australian Capital Territory. It is completely surrounded by the Goulburn region and will now be included in that region. That is the effect of amendment (20).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Baume also asked me a question about proposed amendment (15), which is a provision designed to provide greater flexibility to regional councils. It will allow them to allocate funds in the regional program to State governments and their authorities including local government authorities, Aboriginal Hostels Ltd or the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies with the approval of the Commission. Apparently this will have particular relevance in the Northern Territory and Queensland, where many communities are incorporated under the respective local government Acts. The reason for retaining a requirement for Commission approval is that Commonwealth-State relations ought to be able to be managed on a coordinated basis if required. Apparently this is particularly helpful to the Northern Territory and Queensland, where many communities are incorporated under the respective local government Acts. It is for that reason that the ability for regional councils to allocate funds to local government authorities has been provided. </PARA>

Why is Mapoon, which is an Aboriginal settlement in the MPA area, listed with the Torres Strait Islands? Bamaga is a Torres Strait community on the northern tip of Queensland. Torres Strait and Mapoon should be with the Aboriginal communities. Also, I cannot find in the Bill Weipa, Kowanyama, Pormpuraaw-which was Edward River-Lockhart, Hopevale, Wujal Wujal, Cooktown, Laura, Coen, New Mapoon, Injinoo and Umagico. What regional council are they in? They are not mentioned in the zone and they are not mentioned in the regional councils in the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could I clarify something? As the Minister and his advisers will know, Senator Boswell has just raised for us a particularly sensitive and difficult geographical area. There are five communities on the tip of Cape York-Bamaga, New Mapoon, Umagico, Cowal Creek and Seisia-of which three identify closely with the Aboriginal community and two with the Torres Strait community.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister is still not answering the fundamental question regarding what will occur when this map is sent to the communities. There is some basic knowledge of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission proposal amongst the communities. Certainly, some leaders of the Aboriginal communities have a better understanding of ATSIC than do those at the grass roots level. If this map is sent out, people will not know what regional council or zone they are located in. They will probably be able to work out the zone, but the regional councils are not designated; the names are not printed on the map. It is an issue that has already caused confusion and, I suppose, even despair in some communities. They will now be more confused, if that is possible, when this map is sent out. The people in Lockhart River, for example, will not know what region they are located in. In fact, I do not know what region they are located in. How can we determine what region these people are located in if they are not listed? I suppose what I am seeking is a list which designates the regions and zonal councils for every community.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems to me that Senator Boswell has made an extremely reasonable request. I will endeavour, before next Monday, when I presume we will resume the debate, to provide as complete a list as possible of the various communities within these regions. The structure of this schedule is the same as that produced for the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. The schedule lists zones and regions, rather than breaking down into various communities within regions. Therefore, I believe that the structure of the schedule adequately displays what is intended for the purposes of the Act. I agree that the map would be helpful for the various communities. It could indicate to the communities which regions they will be part of.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister's duty is to gazette the final boundaries. Obviously, I am not able to say as yet precisely where each line will be finally drawn in relation to those boundaries. I presume that it will be able to be indicated to 99 out of 100 communities which region they fall into. I will certainly undertake to provide that list for Senator Boswell. Once the regional boundaries are clearly gazetted, the various communities, organisations and interested persons will be notified and made aware of where the particular boundary lines are drawn. The map that Senator Boswell is examining at the moment indicates regions within the zones. I will provide the more particular and precise information he asked for about the regions in which communities will fall. </PARA>

I suggest to the officers that there is another misprint at the bottom of the map where the word `Mapoon' should be crossed out and the word `Bamaga' inserted. I draw all honourable senators' attention to that. I understand that this is not the final draft of the map, and that some refinement is needed to get it right.

<PARA>The Opposition has moved these amendments together because there are a very large number of amendments for the Committee to consider. It would make life very difficult if we were to consider all of them individually. I appreciate Senator Coulter's point that this may make it more difficult for him, but there is logic in the grouping of these amendments. I say to Senator Coulter, in order to assist him, that these amendments are mostly clause 7 amendments as well as an amendment to clause 8 on page 8 of the Bill. They all relate to the functions of the Commission. There can be few things more important than the statutory declaration of the functions of the proposed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. The Opposition believes it is important to propose the necessary amendments to ensure that these functions are appropriate and correct. I remind Senator Coulter of something he said earlier. He put to us that, in his view, it was very likely that this Commission would be in place some time in the foreseeable future. He also put to us the argument that because of that one did not need to agree to certain other amendments to the Aboriginal Development Commission Act, but that argument is the very reason why it is now important to look at all the proposals in this enormous Bill and examine whether or not we wish to alter any of them. </PARA>
<PARA> Our amendment No. 2 proposes that on page 7, clause 7, we should leave out the words, `including programs conducted by bodies other than the Commission', so the clause would then read, `to monitor the effectiveness of programs for Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders'. Let us spend a moment in committee examining what would be the effect of that clause as it is drafted, and what would be the consequence of agreeing to the amendment. The clause as drafted would give the new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission the capacity to sit in judgment, by way of monitoring its effectiveness, on any program conducted by any organ or body or group or government in relation to Aboriginal matters-in fact, any program which could affect Aboriginals or Torres Strait Islanders, even if it was not a program specifically designed for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. This would enable ATSIC to sit in judgment on other programs within the Department of Employment, Education and Training which are not primarily Aboriginal programs at all but which may have several Aboriginal clients. Departments would continue, even if it is not proposed for ATSIC to do so, to report to Ministers, who are responsible to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very strange to imagine the situation of a department of state, for which there is a Minister appointed under the Constitution who is responsible for that Department's programs, and the Minister suddenly finds that he has a very ill-defined relationship with ATSIC because, under proposed clause 7 (b), the new Commission would have the capacity to look at any program anywhere in Australia affecting Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. This clause, as proposed, would enable ATSIC to sit in judgment on State governments and State government programs. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It certainly would have that effect. The Opposition has concluded that that really is too much. We are aware of the constitutional proprieties that exist as a result of the Constitution, particularly those clauses which establish Ministers of state and give appropriate relationships for Ministers of state with the departments they administer. We do not oppose the proposal that there should be a function of the new Commission-if it is the wish of the Parliament to appoint a new Commission-which should relate to the monitoring of the effectiveness of programs for Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders. It would not be our intention to see this whole subclause deleted, and we have not so proposed. All we have proposed is that those words, which take the function a bit too far, should come out. That is the first of our amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second of our amendments is to proposed subclause 7 (c). Honourable senators will see that we propose to insert some words into that subclause. Madam Temporary Chairman, I remind you that we have moved these amendments together, so I will go through them seriatim. We propose to insert the words `when requested by the Minister'. Consider the clause as it is written. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>to develop policy proposals to meet national, State, Territory and regional needs and priorities of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders;</PARA>
<PARA>Again, we think the Commission should remain within its own powers and functions as laid down in this statute, but when one reads proposed clause 7 (c), it suggests, to me anyhow, that it would be possible for the Commission to seek to develop policy proposals for the State of New South Wales in relation to State departments. With great respect, that is a matter for government to government negotiation. The Federal Government has been at some pains to say to us, `Do not regard ATSIC as some kind of Aboriginal parliament. Do not regard ATSIC in the way some of its critics do.' This clause as drafted, is the very thing about which people have been worrying. </PARA>
<PARA> What would happen if I were the Minister responsible for Aboriginal affairs in New South Wales and I suddenly got a phone call from someone in ATSIC to say, `Under sub-clause 7 (b) we intend to monitor the effectiveness of what you are on about'. I ask Senator Knowles to imagine this in the State of Western Australia. Under subclause 7 (c) I might suddenly get a phone call to say, `We intend, at Commonwealth level, to develop policy proposals'. It is not just a question of identifying unmet need. The identification of unmet need is another matter. It is a question of actually developing policy proposals to meet State needs and priorities of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, the Opposition wants to make it clear that it does not oppose the idea of the Commission having the function of developing policy proposals; but we think it should be limited to when it is requested to do so by the Minister. Some of these actions will involve the Minister. They will involve him in discussions with his colleagues within other governments and departments, and at other levels of government. We think that the Minister-he or she-should at least have a role in identifying these policy proposals, certainly as they relate to areas outside the portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> The third amendment in this group is amendment No. 4. I remind the Committee that we have put aside consideration of our amendment No. 1, which relates to the preamble, by agreement. Amendment 4 is to subclause 7 (d). That subclause, as drafted, worries the Opposition quite considerably. We suggest that subclause 7 (d) will need to be deleted and replaced by another. The amendment is designed to avoid the need for the proposed ATSIC to form or enter into arrangements which will enable it to establish any kind of hegemony in Aboriginal affairs. We are not being fanciful in our concern about this. If it has a function to assist, advise and cooperate with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, organisations and individuals at national, State, Territory and regional levels-that is what is proposed by the Government-that is altogether too broad. We propose instead that that paragraph should be deleted and there should be inserted in its place a different paragraph (d), which should read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>in connection with matters that are functions of the Commission because of other provisions of this Act, but not in any other circumstances, to assist, advise and co-operate with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, organisations and individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not limiting unduly the operations or potential operations of ATSIC. We are saying that in connection with any matters that are functions of the Commission because of other provisions of this Act it should be able to do certain things. We think that that is a proper and necessary amendment as well. Our fourth amendment-that is circulated amendment No. (5), which is part of this group-now relates to subclause 7 (e). I emphasise again that we are concentrating on the functions because this is a critical part of the whole ATSIC proposal. (Extension of time granted). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is contrary to the Standing Orders to use another language too, but no-one picked me up. The next amendment is to subclause 7 (e). This is the same kind of problem, but this time it talks about establishing consultative arrangements. We have proposed the deletion of this subclause because we think the function of establishing extra consultative arrangements is an incidental function. We think further that there is no need for the Commission to set up elaborate or overly intrusive consultative arrangements. What is more, we think that there is every reason why the Commission should not go down that road. One of the problems will be the acceptability and respectability of the new Commission. That does not only include its acceptability within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, but its acceptability within the rest of Australia. I want to see the Government of Queensland able to deal with this new Commission if it comes into existence without a great sense of threat or fear. I want to see the Government of Western Australia able to do the same thing, and the Government of South Australia, and so on. This involves not only goodwill but a statute in which people can have confidence. Our amendment No. (5), which I have already moved, will leave out paragraph (1) (e). The sixth amendment which we have circulated, and which we have moved, is in relation to subclause 7 (f). We propose that that subclause be deleted and be replaced by a new subparagraph (f) which would read:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>when requested by the Minister, to advise the Minister on matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs;</PARA>
<PARA>I invite honourable senators just to compare the existing subclause 7 (f) and the one which we propose to put in its place. In the Bill paragraph (f) reads:</PARA>
<PARA>to advise the Minister on:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, including the administration of legislation; and-</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Precisely. We think the amendment to subclause 7 (f) is essential to ensure that ATSIC does not have a role in the administration of legislation. Honourable senators should just think about that, look at it as it is presently presented and think what it means. The administration of legislation is a matter for a Minister of State properly appointed in pursuance of the relevant section of the Australian Constitution, who takes advice, as is normal, from a Department of State. It follows, once we have accepted that that is the model under which we operate, that the adoption of this particular amendment would be a vote for the retention-when I say `the amendment', I mean the amendment which the Opposition has proposed-of a Department of State because we believe that there has to be a Department of State, a Department of Aboriginal Affairs of this State, or else the assumption by some other Department of State, perhaps the mega department of the Department of Employment, Education and Training, of the traditional role of adviser to the Minister, but it must not be the new Commission. The new Commission cannot stand in relation to the Minister as if it were a Department of State. This is why we have proposed this amendment to subclause 7 (f).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have not just sought to delete it; we have sought to replace it with what we think is the reasonable function-that is, `when requested by the Minister, to advise the Minister on matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs'. That is to say, we still place the Minister as the person appointed by the Constitution, but the Commission becomes one adviser to the Minister in a rather more proper role. We think that ATSIC in this kind of sense should not consider itself as being able to operate at large in giving and promoting advice, but that it should do so only when the Government asks for that advice. </PARA>
<PARA> The seventh circulated amendment, which is a part of this group, is in relation to heritage protection and is proposed subclause 7 (h). Subclause 7 (h), as it is written, requires the Commission, as one of its functions:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to take such reasonable action as it thinks necessary to protect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural material and information, being material or information that is considered sacred or otherwise significant by Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders;</PARA>
<PARA>The deletion of this subclause is necessary to make it clear that ATSIC would not have a maverick role, as it were, in the protection of Aboriginal heritage which seems to be provided by this rather open-ended subclause. The matter is one for the Minister, advised by his Department, to take action on under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act and in accordance with the specific procedures set out within that Act. I just remind the Committee that the Senate Select Committee into the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs looked at this ATSIC legislation and reported at paragraph 2.43 through to 2.47 that subclause 7 (h) would actually interfere with the functions of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. We have already considered and agreed to that legislation. We have amended it appropriately, and we have included an amendment relating to heritage protection. I put it to the Committee that this particular paragraph as proposed by the Government in the Bill will still have the defect that the Senate Select Committee identified and about which it unanimously reported. </PARA>

Even on Mr Risstrom's interpretation, which I understand is wrong, there would certainly be no application of tax for shares which have already been sold.

As I said, the answers are yes to the first question, yes to the second, and yes to the third; and as to the last question, if it is related to my portfolio I will deal with it. I draw the Senate's attention to an article which appeared in the Cairns Post on 24 August and which was headed `Kidston mine pours one millioneth ounce of gold'. The black type subheading states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Far North Queensland is a prospective area for intensive mineral development, and the number of mining proposals currently being evaluated indicates there could be considerable mining expansion early next century.</PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Mines, Energy and Northern Development, Mr Martin Tenni, said that the mining industry was in a healthy state and would stay that way for decades.</PARA>
<PARA> The article quotes from Mr Tenni's speech, in which he particularly picks up the strong performance of the goldmining industry in north Queensland. Not only does Mr Tenni sprout what I believe to be accurate rhetoric about the future of the mining industry in north Queensland and of the goldmining industry in north Queensland, but he also gives some empirical evidence to back up that rhetoric. He cites for example the Red Dome prospect, in which an open cut goldmine has proven up 8.7 million tonnes of high quality ore. He said in his speech:</PARA>
<PARA> Gold continues to be the strongest performer in the region . . . There have been three major gold mines commissioned in the past two years and a number of proposed mines are being evaluated.</PARA>
<PARA>He talks about a mine project by Barrick Mines and Pancontinental at Croydon. He talks about a consortium of the Macquarie Bank Ltd, the Queensland Industry Development Corporation, and PAMP of Switzerland which is developing a gold refinery at Cairns. He paints a very glowing picture about the future of goldmining into the next century in north Queensland and the support industries that would service it, such as the refinery.</PARA>
<PARA> All I can say is that on 6 June I answered a question here rebutting an attack by Mr Tenni on the Commonwealth for extending ordinary taxation to goldmining companies. It may be that Mr Tenni has read that answer and has decided that he shall now support the Commonwealth's case and provide some evidence to justify its position. He has provided the rhetoric and the empirical evidence to justify an ongoing and solid future for the goldmining industry in north Queensland. I understand that Mr Tenni has announced that he will not be contesting his State seat of Barron River at the next election, so he will cease to be the responsible Minister within months. I do not know whether he intends to go into the goldmining industry.</PARA>

Senator Richardson, when yesterday responding to a question from Senator Reid, talked about the operation of Royal Australian Air Force aircraft to great tourist places such as Hamilton Island. The Minister would be aware of a proposal by Minister Beazley to allow tourists access to a number of Australia's most important defence facilities, including Pine Gap in the Northern Territory. How will the Minister facilitate the development of such a proposal, given that it has particular advantage to tourism in northern Australia? As Mr Beazley's announcement has created considerable interest among tour operators in the Northern Territory, can Senator Richardson now advise of the coordination responsibilities between his office and the Department of Defence? Can he also advise whom tour operators should contact in the first instance to develop acceptable proposals and guarantee that any financial arrangements are fair and equitable without hidden government subsidies?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator McMullan for his question, and for the advance notice which he gave me of it as I have been able to obtain a reply. I am aware of the change in interest in Chile in migration to Australia. Last year saw a substantial drop in inquiries. From October 1987 to June 1988 inquiries reached 63,415, but in the same period the following year, up to June 1989, 29,037 inquiries were recorded. That is a decrease of about 54 per cent. But I think we also have to take into account that an interest is being shown within Australia by Chilean refugees who wish to return home. I tend to think both sets of figures reflect a growing optimism in the normalisation process as Chile moves down the path towards a restitution of full democracy. As the honourable senator would know, these developments are against the background of a presidential plebiscite held in October 1988 which resulted in a loss for the Pinochet forces, and in July this year 85 per cent of Chilean voters overwhelmingly approved a significant constitutional reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the second matter, I do not believe that this reduction is due to restricted access to the Embassy. On the third question I cannot confirm immediately whether military police are still stationed at the gates of the Embassy. They were stationed there some time ago at the request of the Australian Ambassador as threats were received against the Embassy itself and against Australian nationals in Chile. The presence of the police officers at the entrance of the Embassy could deter special humanitarian applicants from personally presenting their papers. However, they are not obliged to lodge applications in this way; they may use the mailing system or lodge them with associated international organisations which, in many cases, not only assist in the completion of applications but are able to pass them on to Australian officials. As to the last part of the question, I am not aware of any arrangements that are deterring people from lodging such applications.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Royal Australian Air Force does not keep records of its personnel once they have departed, so there are no figures available to say how many former RAAF pilots may now be in the employment of domestic airlines. Having said that, I think the general concern of the Air Force over the years has been recruitment by Qantas Airways Ltd rather than by domestic airlines. I am led to believe that most of the people who have separated-to use the term the Defence Force uses-from the RAAF have gone in that direction rather than to the domestic airlines. Nonetheless, if the pilots were to be successful in achieving a massive increase, such as the one they have sought in this dispute, no doubt that would have an effect on the rate of pilot separation from the Air Force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has worked hard to make conditions for Defence Force personnel as attractive as possible. But, in the commercial world of airlines, it has been difficult to hold the line. Australian Defence Force pilots have received wage increases in line with the bounds of the accord. I dare say that, like all Australian workers, they would be outraged if the pilots were able to achieve, outside the system, a claim which is as massive in its scope as outlined by Senator McLean in his question.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="809" SPEAKER="Walsh Sen The Hon P.A." NAMEID="TJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will not be introducing a loan Bill in this financial year. The reason for that is that there is no necessity for a loan Bill. In the past the need for a loan Bill has derived from the legal requirement that expenditures from the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF) may not exceed the revenues available to it. And, to the extent that there are any shortfalls in revenues, balancing the CRF therefore requires the charging of expenditures to, or reimbursement of CRF from, the Loan Fund, where they can be financed out of loan raisings. In other words, it is a sort of bridging financial provision within a financial year. There will be no need for such a bridging financial provision in this financial year because there will be a Budget surplus estimated to be above $9 billion at the end of the financial year and at no time during the financial year is it expected that there will be any need for a financing mechanism such as a loan Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the loan Bill was never anything more than a bridging financing mechanism. It did not of itself authorise the expenditure of any money. But the Opposition, in the hope of scoring a few cheap political points, in every year that I can remember in the life of the present Government and back into the 1970s, used to pretend that the loan Bill was of crucial importance. Three years ago, I think, I introduced provisions to make a loan Bill a piece of standing legislation instead of a piece of annual legislation, but that was resisted by would-be big noters and the troglodytes in the Opposition as being some dirty trick that the Government was trying to play to deprive the Parliament of its power to scrutinise expenditure-all of which was total nonsense, like most of the words that pour out of the mouths of members of the Opposition, and was absolutely without foundation.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the more important point is the fact that there will be no loan Bill this year. This breaks new ground in Australia. I have not been able to find out in a brief time whether there has been a loan Bill every year since Federation. There has certainly been a loan Bill every year since the early 1950s. That is because there had never been a Budget surplus since the early 1950s until this Government produced one in the 1986-87 financial year. This year we will be producing a Budget surplus of such magnitude that, even within the financial year, the Consolidated Revenue Fund will not need any supplementation to meet the normal situation-that is, that Commonwealth outlays within any financial year occur before the full offsetting revenues are collected.</PARA>

As I understand it, the current situation is that there is a supply of uranium overhanging the world market at present. That has put a downward pressure on prices. The expected future development of nuclear power generation in Japan, for example, is under a substantial question mark at this stage-that is, whether there will be new capacity brought on line.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At this stage there is some doubt as to what the nuclear future will be in the United States. There appears to be little doubt as to what the nuclear future will be in France because it is committed to a very strong nuclear program. There is a uranium supply available to the market through Canada, southern Africa, Australia and, no doubt, other places as well. Essentially they are the three major centres of supply. The current and immediate situation seems to be that the market will be overhung with supply.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition's policy changed about three times yesterday. Opposition industrial relations policy is `what you see is what you get depending on whom you are watching on television or listening to on radio'. Senator Chaney has always had difficulty disciplining the Senate Opposition here but he has also not had much success in disciplining his shadow ministerial colleagues or himself on the question of developing an industrial relations policy because he has changed his own views a few times in the past week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Beahan asked me about Mr Macphee's comment that the Opposition's support for secret ballots in respect of strikes was a fetish. I do not know whether it is a fetish but that is not a bad word. I had some discussions in Britain in July when there was a bus and underground transport strike in London. Britain has provisions whereby there has to be a secret ballot before people go on strike in some organisations. They get a lock-in effect-that is, once a decision is made to go on strike it is very hard to get out of it. That is one of the difficulties which the Thatcher Government has with its industrial relations policy which, in some respects, Opposition spokesmen aspire to emulate. If we look at its industrial relations policy we should look at the level of increase in wages in Britain in the last year compared with the increase that has taken place in Australia. We see some of their problems. Ultimately, we see that Mr Macphee is probably right to describe some of these things in Opposition policies as a fetish.</PARA>
<PARA> The third issue which Senator Beahan touched on in his question-by the way, it was not a Dorothy Dix question; it came to me completely out of the blue-related to a comment made by Mr Macphee. It was a thoughtful and intelligent question which therefore produces a thoughtful and intelligent answer, which I am in the course of giving. Mr Macphee said that it was a most propitious time and there had been no more propitious time in the last 25 years for action by management in various enterprises to deal with many of the problems confronting the industrial relations area, particularly the question of productivity in the work place. Mr Macphee is totally right about that. As I have pointed out to the Senate on several occasions, in the last couple of weeks there are many companies that are taking advantage of those propitious opportunities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence. I refer to the answer that the Minister gave at the end of Question Time yesterday concerning the financial arrangements applying to the emergency airlift of passengers stranded by the pilots dispute and, in particular, to the Minister's statement that the airlines are chartering aircraft from the defence forces-an expression that he used again in the answer that he just gave to the Senate. Does the Minister agree that any charter arrangement means payment for full operational cost? While I concede the difficulties in accurately estimating the total cost at this stage, does the Minister not agree that, in the event of a shortfall, this should be picked up by the airlines, not by taxpayers? Does he agree that there should be no suggestion of the airlines making a profit out of the emergency arrangements? Finally, can he advise the Senate whether Hamilton Island flights using military aircraft are continuing and whether other popular tourist destinations are being similarly served?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On that general question, it is worth repeating what I said yesterday. The arrangements between the airlines and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) effectively amount to a charter and the airlines are no doubt attempting to cover as many of the air services as they need to. It is a matter for them as to where they are sending them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can give some further information regarding the expenses of the RAAF and the manner of charging the airlines. First of all, the aim of the Government in arranging for the RAAF to assist in maintaining domestic services during the length of the strike has been to ensure that people in isolated destinations, where there is no alternative to air travel, are not particularly disadvantaged. The Government is, therefore, aiming to facilitate the maintenance of air services at normal fares. It is not a matter of the airlines making money out of it; it is a matter of the Government performing a public service and not having people, by reason of where they live, where they find themselves or where they are wanting to go, being disadvantaged during the course of the strike. As a public service, that is what governments ought to be doing. The aircraft are chartered by the airlines at a cost which approximates the normal operating costs of the aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA> In the light of those principles, the Government reached agreement with the airlines by which ticketing and seat allocation continues to be handled by the airlines. They retain the proceeds of ticket sales. In return, the airlines are responsible for providing, at their expense, fuel, crew and ground maintenance staff accommodation, meals and transfer costs, ground handling, aircraft cleaning, in-flight rations and minor miscellaneous expenditure. In addition, the airlines are paying an hourly rate to cover spare parts and contractor maintenance. Those rates are: for a Boeing 707, $1,500 an hour; for a HS748, $800 an hour; and for a C130, $970 an hour. These rates are similar to maintenance rates on similar passenger aircraft. Whether they cover the RAAF's actual maintenance expenses will depend on the number of hours flown. We will not know that until the end of the operation. As I said yesterday, if they do not cover the costs, it is the Minister's intention to seek supplementation of the Defence budget to cover that shortfall in the Additional Estimates.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been some press publicity in relation to this matter. I think it is instructive to think back a few years when the concerns of the community were very much directed at nuclear disarmament issues. It is important that the chemical weapons issue has now come more to the forefront in negotiations between the major powers. There has been progress in the bilateral talks on chemical weapons between the United States and Soviet negotiators in Geneva. The talks have covered some of the most intractable problems still facing the 40 members of the conference on disarmament as they move towards a comprehensive chemical weapons convention. Agreements reached between the United States and the USSR on issues such as verification procedures, challenge inspections and timetables for destruction of existing chemical weapon stocks will contribute significantly to the multilateral negotiations. A final resolution of the remaining issues must take place in the multilateral forum. However, the chemical weapons convention will be effective only if all nations have confidence in it and are willing to adhere to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As an active participant in the conference on disarmament negotiations for a chemical weapons treaty, Australia is taking practical steps to supplement the conference on disarmament process. Australia will hold a major international conference later this month aimed at fostering a government-industry dialogue on chemical weapons so as to prepare the world's chemical industry for the implementation of the convention and to involve industry in its design and realisation. Australia is also conducting trial inspections of chemical plants to check the effective operation of the proposed verification provisions of the convention and, through the Prime Minister's regional initiative, promoting understanding and acceptance of the proposed convention among our neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome Senator Burns's question. I suspect that Senator Parer, who sits opposite, may be able to support many of the remarks I am about to make in answering it. The facts on coal rail freights in Queensland are as follows. No new coalmine has been opened in Queensland in the last five years. Many critics in the industry say that one of the reasons for that is the pernicious form of rail freight tax levied by that State Government. An analysis that I have seen shows that it costs more to send one tonne of coal 200 kilometres in Queensland by rail than it does to ship it anywhere in the world. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics showed in its March publication Agricultural and Resources Quarterly that the total freight cost in open-cut coalmines in Australia is 24 per cent. One would say that it is probably higher than that in Queensland. The International Energy Agency of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development criticised the level of the pernicious hidden tax in Queensland. In the post-Fitzgerald report scene in Queensland there has been no move to open up the issue on this form of hidden tax for public scrutiny, although the report of the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct recommended that there be open government. The industry's ability to pay the tax is also questionable. Just this Wednesday Mount Isa Mines' coal division announced a loss of $85m for its 1988-89 trading year, which follows a $66m loss for its coal division in 1987-88.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The total freight surcharge has been estimated as being $399m in 1986-87 and $376m in 1987-88, which is quite a levy on an export industry. The freight charge is a regressive tax in that sense. Against that background, this week the Ahern Government announced changes to its freight levels. There have been consultations with the industry. One can take a cynical view and say that in the rampant expectation of an election in Queensland this is a manoeuvre in the political scene to try to kill what is a major domestic issue in Queensland. Has it succeeded? The Ahern Government talked to the industry and announced a new formula. However, the formula applies only to new mines and major extensions to existing mines. So there is total discrimination against existing producers and there will be no relief for those producers. It has done nothing about the provision for increasing freight charges if coal prices increase. I have received many representations from industry to the effect that it is very unhappy about this. Senator Burns has obviously touched on a very sensitive question in Queensland. He has identified a government in panic. We are not quite sure whether Ahern will be leader next week or next month. I hope that Senator Parer will be as outspoken on this matter as are some of his industry supporters within the National Party and his party room.</PARA>

The building industry, together with the motor vehicle industry, is one of the biggest areas for consumer complaint in Australia. What action can the Government take to try to protect young home buyers from some of the shady dealers in the industry?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Childs is correct in saying that the building industry is one of the two areas of major complaint. It can be quite rightly called `a rich source of complaints by consumers'. The honourable senator was also right in isolating home buyers as being a particularly vulnerable part of the industry. The most common sources of complaints are in one of two areas: firstly, either harassment or coercion into buying a property, and secondly-it is the activity which Senator Child mentioned-the use of a so-called fixed price contract which by unnecessary delay is evaded by the builder involved and thereafter the home buyer has to pay extra costs because of the expiry of the term to which the fixed price applies. It is fair to say that this sort of activity does not extend across the building industry, but it is also fair to say that it applies in more than one State. It has occurred not only in New South Wales, but also in Western Australia-there was a notorious participant there-and Queensland. I have been concerned about it and I spent some time in Queensland a couple of months ago. In one part of Brisbane a particular builder was fleecing, ripping off, young home buyers in this way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has responded through the Trade Practices Commission which has moved quite swiftly to try to protect home buyers and to make sure that they get their houses at fair prices. It should be recognised that the direct implication of this is that we level out the playing field in the building industry, in that builders can compete fairly, instead of one particular builder having an advantage because of such devious behaviour. In particular, and leading up to a case that was settled yesterday, the Trade Practices Commission took legal action against a New South Wales company, Kimberley Homes Pty Ltd. That action resulted in a settlement without admission, but a settlement nonetheless, with four families being paid $35,000 in compensation for damages they incurred because of this sort of activity.</PARA>
<PARA> This was in fact a precedent-setting case. It was one taken in accordance with the commitment of the Trade Practices Commission to give priority to the use of the unconscionable conduct provisions of the Trade Practices Act. It was also an unprecedented one in that it was once again the use of representative actions-the limited source of representative actions-that applied under the Trade Practices Act. As I said, the couples involved have been compensated to the extent of $35,000. It is a major victory for first home buyers, in particular. It brings honesty into the marketplace. The Trade Practices Commission has already given an indication that it will enforce these results not only with further action against Kimberley Homes, but also with an education campaign through this part of the building industry as well as through other industries to alert them to the implications of this part of the Trade Practices Act. It is a clear demonstration that the Government is quite serious about achieving fairness in the marketplace, fairness to consumers--</PARA>

Even allowing for the fact that the second figure includes fuel and crewing costs, it stretches the imagination absolutely beyond credulity to believe that the fuel cost is more than $4,000.

It is expected that some 4 1/2 thousand young people will be assisted through those arrangements in a full year. The Newstart program will also be extended to 18 to 20-year-olds in receipt of unemployment benefits, thus extending the benefits of that program to an additional 6,000 18 to 20-year-olds in a full year.

There were two elements on which I promised to get back to him-first, the price sold at the other Gulf ports, and, second, final quarantine testing before shipments leave Australia. I now have an answer to those questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the first question, all the consignments were sold by Australian interests on an FOB basis. The privately owned foreign interests which purchased those sheep from Australia have, not unexpectedly, not revealed the prices negotiated with alternative Gulf buyers for the resale of the sheep. However, given that the sellers were in a forced sale situation and that other Gulf states markets for sheep are now in oversupply it could be expected that the resale prices would have involved discounting. The Mawashi Tabuk discharged its full consignment in Kuwait; the Al Yasrah unloaded in a number of Gulf ports, with a final discharge in Kuwait; the El Cordero finally unloaded in Ras al Khaimah in the United Arab Emirates; the Al Qurain fully unloaded in Kuwait; and the El Redil discharged into Abu Dhabi in the UAE. The El Redil consignment is presently being held under quarantine control on suspicion of brucella melitensis being present in the sheep.</PARA>
<PARA> In answer to the second question, it would be unrealistic to ask importing countries to abandon all quarantine measures to import discharge on the basis of testing undertaken in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The Opposition has raised as a matter of public importance:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The damage caused to Australian small business by the anti-business policies of the Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA>We have done this because over the past seven years we have seen this Government completely ignore the importance of small business. It is becoming increasingly obvious to us that the Government is becoming more and more intolerant to the small business community as a whole. Only yesterday we saw an attack-I can only describe it as a vendetta-on the pharmacies of Australia. We have seen taxes increase by 105 per cent since the Federal election held seven years ago. We have seen sales tax increase and we have seen the industrial relations policies of the Government impacting on small business. In all, the Government's policies have been a total disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> That is probably understandable. I went to the Parliamentary Library today to find out details of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) platform on small business. The ALP believes small business is worthy of three paragraphs in its platform. That is all the response it could muster to small business. It reads in part:</PARA>
<PARA>Labor recognises the importance of maintaining a strong, viable and diverse small business sector. It accounts for 95% of all businesses in Australia, over 50% of private sector employment and 40% of value-added. </PARA>
<PARA>That is rhetoric; it does not do much for small business. When Senator Button responded to the Coles-Myer amalgamation which was to give those two companies tremendous market clout, he said that it was not in the best interests of Australian commerce. That is all Senator Button did regarding that amalgamation. The third point in the Labor platform on small business reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Improve the co-ordination between business regulatory agencies to minimise the administrative complexity and cost for industry of government regulations and procedures, particularly for small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA>The total response to more than 750,000 small businesses in Australia comprises three paragraphs of Labor Party policy. The small business sector employs 52 per cent of the private sector employees. There are over 50,000 small manufacturers and over 80,000 small businesses involved in providing services. These businesses are the major source of tax collections-sales tax, pay as you earn tax and child support payments. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the Government is treating the small business area as a means through which to raise tax revenue. The Government is not giving sufficient recognition to the small business sector. Small business does not have the influence with this Government consistent with its importance. Apart from one lone voice on the Economic Planning Advisory Council there is very little representation on any Government instrumentality, council or organisation that represents the voice of small business. Big business is represented by the Business Council of Australia and the Confederation of Australian Industry. But the voice of small business is not very often heard. Apart from Peter Boyle, Director of the Australian Small Business Association, and Rob Bastian, from the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, there are very few organisations that represent this terribly important sector-small business. That needs to be remedied because the small business voice is not coming through to this Government. I want to refer to the attack on the pharmacies. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And the tourism industry. I will move through some of the other areas in which this Government has been totally negligent in its response to small business. As I said in my opening remarks, this Government seems to have some sort of vendetta against the pharmacists and the chemists of Australia. This vendetta has been running since January 1988, when the Government lowered the wholesale margin by 5 per cent for the chemists and the pharmacists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In August 1988, the Government doubled the number of items per prescription and effectively halved the handling fee. Some expensive but essential drugs were then put on a hit list and doctors had to seek approval from the Department of Community Services and Health before prescribing the drugs and allowing patients access to these drugs. Due to public pressure and extensive complaints by a number of groups, particularly the pensioners, this was reversed. In January 1989 the Government attempted to further reduce the prescription fee to below $2.64. That has put pressure on the pharmacists. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one could have expected that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal's report would have been accepted by the Government, but the Government accepted the recommendations to reduce the pharmacists' dispensing payments by $1.05 per item and abolish the pharmacists' 25 per cent mark-up. I do not know how any government can support a recommendation such as that. How can any business work without some type of mark-up? There are 5,000 chemists in Australia and, on present indications, about 1,000 of those would become bankrupt were the Government to implement those recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, Barry Jones, doing about that? I recognise Barry Jones's capabilities in many areas. He may be the Minister for Science, but he certainly has no expertise in small business. I would have thought that the Australian Labor Party could have come up with someone that could have given some representation to small business. We never hear Barry Jones speaking up on how government legislation will affect small business, what it will do to small business and whether small business has a capacity to pay. In effect, the Labor Party does not have anyone within its ranks that can truly represent small business. I do not believe there is one person in the Labor Party that has ever been in small business. I could be corrected but, as I look around the Senate today-there are not too many people here from the Labor side; there are many National Party members and many Liberal Party members-there is not one person on the other side who could represent small business. There is no-one here to listen to the pleadings of small business. The Minister, Mr Jones, should be more responsible for the actions affecting small business that this Government has taken. </PARA>
<PARA> What has small business had to put up with? We have seen cripplingly high interest rates. They are supposed to slow the economy down, but as Senator Stone quite correctly pointed out, it is a very vague and hollow way to slow down an economy because once it slows down where does one go from there? The present high interest rates are impacting directly on the building industry. Retail sales figures and figures for new car registrations have shown that consumer demand is still strong. But there is plenty of evidence to suggest that the present high interest rates are bankrupting small businesses. The Hawke Government has promised consistently and constantly that interest rates will come down. Interest rates for housing loans are now 18 per cent. In the small business community they can be as high as 23 per cent. What small business can afford to pay 23 per cent interest rates? Very few small businesses have the capacity to earn 23 per cent profit, let alone pay interest rates of 23 per cent. A string of bankruptcies is occurring throughout Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This year's figures will be a total disaster. Of course, when one sits in this place and looks at the frontbench one sees the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, who is a lawyer; Senator Cooney, who is a barrister; and trade union officials. They do not know what it does to people to have their businesses crash around them. The Government does not know what it does to their families, and their self-confidence. The Government is leaving a trail of disasters around Australia with its high interest rates and it does not care about the destruction it is causing: families splitting up, the destruction of people's self-confidence. Those are the sorts of things that one must consider.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think that the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, Barry Jones, understands it. I am certain that no-one in the Senate understands the feelings of small business owners. Small business people get out there, on a very low capital base, and try to achieve. They are Australia's greatest battlers. I know; I have been one of them. For 16 years I worked my own small business. Under Labor, if one wants a small business one buys a big business and watches it get smaller. That is the only thing the Government can say it knows about small business-buy a big business and under Labor it will get smaller. The alternative to that is that one goes bankrupt, as the figures have indicated. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It sounds like one of Senator Bolkus's ideas. Madam Acting Deputy President, I know that you understand small business because your husband was involved in small business before he entered politics. Let us consider the progressive taxation take from 1983 to 1990. This Government has extracted-pulled out like teeth-a 105 per cent tax increase. Total Commonwealth tax revenue has increased by 105 per cent. Total individual tax has gone up by 107 per cent. The Medicare levy has gone up; company tax has gone up by 162 per cent; sales tax has gone up by 156 per cent; Customs import duty has gone up by 73.9 per cent; and petroleum excise has gone up by 186.3 per cent. Yet this Government tells us that it has a Budget surplus. It claims that it is a wonderful economic manager and that it has a $9 billion surplus. Of course, it will have a $9 billion Budget surplus if it increases everything from sales tax and fuel excise to Customs duty and the Medicare levy. Every tax has increased, and the major impact has been felt by small business. The Government does not realise that when it increases petroleum excise by 186.3 per cent it is the small business sales representatives that pay most of it, as they travel in their cars to sell their products. These taxes are impacting on small business. It is no wonder that bankruptcies have increased by 56 per cent. I say to the Minister for Justice, who is a barrister and solicitor-and probably a very good one-that his Government needs to understand what it is doing to small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government has introduced a capital gains tax which has impacted on small businesses. Many small business want to expand by buying out other businesses. Farmers may wish to move from a smaller property to a bigger property. They have to pay a capital gains tax every time there is a roll-over. In the past, many small businesses, particularly newsagents, could afford to take a holiday only after they had sold their business. Many small business people cannot even afford to do that any more because of the capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government's tax regime has been a disaster for all small businesses. The capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax and other taxes have impacted heavily on small business. Small businesses account for much of Australia's wealth. They provide many jobs and much of the tax revenue, yet they do not receive a fair go from this Government. This Government treats the small business sector as an area from which to gather tax. This Government thinks in terms of how much sales tax it can collect from that sector, how much pay as you earn tax or capital gains tax small businesses can pay. Small businesses are the greatest milch cows that this Government has, yet it does not give small businesses one voice. It does not give small business any consideration. This Government does not have a Minister who can adequately represent the interest of small business in Cabinet, who can look at the impact of Government policy on small business. This Government's total contribution to the small business area comprises three paragraphs in its policy document. It is a shocking indictment of any government that an area which provides 52 per cent of employment, and probably most of Australia's taxation revenue, receives three paragraphs in the Australian Labor Party's policy document. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not good enough for the small business community. It is not good enough for Australia. I hope that this Government will look at the problem in its next six months in office, although I do not suppose there is much time left for it to do anything for small business. I suppose that the message that I can give to small business is, `Hang on by your fingernails. Help is coming. The coalition will be in government in six months time'. </PARA>

We do very well by them because they vote us into office, which is proper. They do well by us because, their having voted us into office, we give them the best available for the community. Let me make it clear that what is best available for the community at the moment is not as good as it might be. There are hard economic times upon us. There are difficulties for all sections of the community.

<PARA> Senator Boswell says that taxes have increased. The reality is that under this Government tax rates have been reduced. Small business has benefited by that, and benefited mightily. It is worth going through the tax rates. One can earn up to $5,100 without any tax being imposed at all. From $5,100 to $17,650 the tax rate is 21 per cent; from $17,650 to $26,000 it is 29 per cent. </PARA>

I do not expect actual applause from the other side but I think, deep in the hearts of honourable senators opposite-including Senator Stone-there is admiration for what this Government has done in terms of the tax rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Boswell has spoken about capital gains tax. He says it has impacted on business and farmers because, in the process of buying and selling property, they have to pay capital gains tax if they sell for more than they paid, at an indexed value. That argument is always put up, no matter what tax is imposed. People who earn money have to pay tax. All that means is that for the country to run, for there to be an economic policy, there has to be some collection of moneys from the community, and it is a question of where that collection ought to fall. I am sure that Senator Boswell would not say that if capital gains tax were removed the rates of income tax should be raised. I am sure that is not his position. It is all very well to come into the chamber day in and day out-it sometimes leads to good debate-and say that there are problems. Of course there are problems in the economy. The real question is: What are the answers? It is easy enough for anybody to come along and say that there is a problem. It is easy to see where the difficulties are. But the real skill-this skill has been shown by the great Treasurer, Paul Keating, and the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, whom we all admire-is to devise an answer to these problems. </PARA>

What is happening-this statement has been made again and again-and what is quite real is that the economy is overheating. As the Treasurer has said, it is bubbling up as bubbles might rise in a champagne glass, and something has to be done about it. The policy that has been pursued here is both a fiscal and a monetary policy. The monetary policy is one of high interest rates, and it has been stated again and again that it is dampening down the economy, perhaps not as fast as it should. If that were not the case, things would be more disastrous.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Brownhill says that it is killing the economy. I have a quote from one of the papers which says that there is just too much high investment going on and that it has to be slowed down. If it is killing the economy, the reality of the matter is that that has not been reflected. Senator Boswell has said that the pharmacies are an illustration of how badly this Government has dealt with small business. It is true that there has been a proposed change to the rate at which chemists are to be remunerated. Nobody likes the remuneration reduced; in fact, the work force has had its remuneration reduced considerably over the last few years and discussions are still taking place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Boswell says-I can understand his keenness and desperation almost to help the small business person, and in this particular case the pharmacist-`Let us ignore what the Tribunal has said. There is no need for the Government to accept what the Tribunal has said'. The great difficulty about that argument is: if we ignore the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal, what other tribunals do we ignore? Do we ignore the Industrial Relations Tribunal, and do we start ignoring the courts themselves?</PARA>
<PARA> The real problem in all this is that the more we ignore the tribunals, the courts and the institutions that have been set up to carry out particular functions, the greater threat there is to the structures of society and the way it works. I quote from an article by Milton Cockburn headed `Pharmacist fee cut a Labor headache' which appears in today's Sydney Morning Herald:</PARA>
<PARA> When the Fraser Government established the tribunal the then Minister for Health, Mr Michael MacKellar, promised it would `remove from the political arena the level of fees paid to chemists for the dispensing of pharmaceutical benefits'. That has proved to be a naive promise with Opposition MPs falling over themselves in the past few days to attack the tribunal's decision and the Democrats threatening legislation to overturn the decision. </PARA>
<PARA>What we take from that is this: there is a recognition, at least by Milton Cockburn, of the particular problems that are faced not only by this Government but also by the community and by other governments that if we are going to have a tribunal we cannot accept some things and not accept other things. That is the real difficulty. I would like honourable senators who will speak after me to explain how we overcome that problem. This is a great illustration of the sorts of debates that we have in this chamber again and again. People come to us and say `we have a problem'. In this case there is a problem with the chemists, they say they are not getting enough. We may or may not agree with that, but say for the purpose of the argument that we agree. The pharmacists go to the Tribunal to put their case and the Tribunal says, `Look, X is the amount of money you are going to get'. </PARA>

We will just legislate our way out of this because we don't like it'. The problem is that the whole system breaks down because we say, `We think that a particular group has not been properly rewarded'.

<PARA> It is said that this Government ignores small business. It is said that Barry Jones does not press his case as well as he should. A lot of this is in the eyes of the perceiver. The perceiver does not look often enough at what is done for small business or other sections. Let us look, for example, at a body that this Government encourages-the Business Regulation Review Unit-as an illustration of what can be done. The Government has issued an invitation to anybody in small business who thinks that the regulations imposed upon his business or the class of business that he is in are unfair to take a complaint to or make a request of this body. The Business Regulation Review Unit has an information paper No. 15 entitled Review of Business Regulations-Major Changes in Business Regulation during 1988. This information paper, which was published in July 1989, sets out the procedure by which that can be done. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said that the taxation system has gone against small business. It is true that the amount of money owed, not only by small business but also by business generally, now has to be paid earlier than it otherwise would have been paid.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is true. I wish to make one point before I run out of time: a small business which is run by, say, a family and which is not incorporated has had to pay taxes as it earns. Only companies have been affected by these changes in the past so that they could pay due taxes a year or up to two years after earning their income. That has been changed. Honourable senators opposite might think it is fairer that people running a business, no matter who they are-a company, a man and a woman, or a family-be on equal footing. This change has put everybody in small business, whether a company or a family concern not incorporated, on an equal footing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other thing this Government has done for small business people is to offer them better corporate law than has been available up until now. It has introduced concepts such as the close corporations legislation so that there is one law to guide companies throughout Australia. In fact, the more we think about it, the more it becomes apparent that this Government has done many things for small business. This Budget has made things fairer. Look at what it has done now. It has introduced deductions for the cost of tax advice--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats to support the essential proposition before the chamber-namely, that it is indeed a tragedy that small business in this country has been decimated by governments. That is the situation in Australia today. I do not think, however, that the Australian Democrats are prepared to accept the precise wording of the matter of public importance that has been brought before the chamber by Senator Boswell-namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The damage caused to Australian small business by the anti-business policies of the Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA>In reality the tragedy has been the damage caused to Australian small business by the big business policies of successive governments. It is not only the Hawke Government that has let down small business. Small business has been let down over decades in this nation by successive governments, and in the letting down of small business big business has been sustained. </PARA>
<PARA> Some businesses have thrived in Australia in recent times. We all know of the giants that have emerged, the people who have come to this country and have thrived, presumably through a stage of small business, into the stage of big business where they have been favoured and lived in a climate that has sustained, savoured, spoilt and nurtured them to the point where they have become greedy. Some of them are now beginning to collapse and are moving into a stage of demise. When this proposition was tabled here today and we were advised of it my colleague Senator Macklin was prompted to say that it is possible to be successful in small business in Australia today. The successful small businesses are those that have been big and in their period of demise, if they are shrewd enough, can hang in for a short period when they are successful before finally being sent packing by a palling government. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am agreeing with Senator Boswell that there is a tragic situation in Australia today. We acknowledge what he has already cited, that small business is an area that has been too long neglected by successive Federal and State governments. We acknowledge the fact that more than half of our private sector is made up of businesses which employ fewer than 100 people. This is obviously an immensely important group of people but they have been, and probably still are, largely uncoordinated. They do not pull their power together as an effective lobby in this country. Despite the genuine attempts of the Australian Small Business Association (ASBA) and the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia (COSBOA), small business has not become the potent lobby that it should be in this country. We call ourselves a free enterprise economy, a free enterprise nation, which the Australian Democrats endorse as the fundamental posture and structure of our economy. The essence of such a free enterprise economy is effective small business, yet successive government after government has decimated that essential ingredient of the free enterprise economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If all small businesses, including farmers, could gather under one umbrella organisation they would make the most powerful lobby in the nation, but for some reason or other they have not been able to get their act together. The reason is probably that most of them work for 70 or 80 hours a week and barely manage to get a substantial living together. They simply do not have the time to assemble the clout to render effective what should be one of the most powerful lobbies in the nation. The current Labor Government has not seen small business as particularly high on its list of priorities. Neither did the Fraser Government, for that matter. The coalition supports big business. The Australian Labor Party supposedly is the party of trade unions, although lately it has been more the party of big businesses as well. Neither has done a great deal to sustain the small business sector in this country over the last two or three decades. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of this, it is sad to reflect that several of the small business umbrella organisations appear to have been hijacked by the New Right. It is a move which has brought them no advantage whatsoever. In the discussion of the Australian Democrats with small businesses, they have said that if they are going to have political muscle they have got to be prepared to move their vote around. In fact, they have stayed in a constant allegiance to the right in politics, and that has delivered to them very little indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Small business is the key to decentralising economic power. For this reason, the Australian Democrats believe that they should be supported as much as possible. That will probably not be a popular view among those who believe in cronyism and the beneficent power of monopolies. We emphasise that small businesses are the key to the decentralisation of power in this nation, power which is concentrated increasingly in the hands of fewer and fewer enterprises. High interest rates, which appear currently to be the only economic tool being used by the Government, are putting immense pressure on small business. They are decimating small business. </PARA>
<PARA> In an article in the most recent edition of the news bulletin of the Australian Small Business Association, ASBA News, Brian Buckley suggested that the Treasurer should be replaced by the Minister for Finance and their two departments merged. The most interesting thing about the suggestion is the reasons he gives for it. He sees some qualities in the Finance Minister which, presumably, would be advantageous to small business. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>Walsh is as tough as Keating, fights even dirtier, is extremely sceptical of official advice, understands the broad economic issues, has no special mates in the union movement and is a wheat farmer (i.e. an exporter). </PARA>
<PARA>The Labor, Liberal and National parties all agree that deregulation is an excellent thing and that the sooner it is done the better, but none of them has supported my private members Bill which focuses specifically on the challenges of deregulating in order to free up the climate in which small businesses attempt to operate. On the issue of sales tax, in 1981 my predecessor as Australian Democrat senator for New South Wales, Colin Mason, gave notice of the following motion:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate is of the opinion that the Government should extend the prescribed period of time currently allowed to pay sales tax from 21 days to 60 days . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The notice of motion elaborated on that, yet it has not received the support of the Opposition and, therefore, has never been successfully brought forward. Nothing has changed. Small businesses and their umbrella organisations are still crying out for this basic relief, and for the same reasons. The Liberal-National Party Government refused to listen when it was in power and had the power to do something about it, and the Labor Government has refused to listen ever since. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the last Federal election, COSBOA produced a matrix in which it cited what it believed to be the 13 critical factors which were bringing down small business in this nation, and it sought the response of the political parties before the election. On its matrix, under the heading of `The Government', is simply written `Polite refusal'. In other words, the Government refused to respond to a questionnaire about the 13 most critical factors relating to small business. It is interesting that it adjudged the policies of the Australian Democrats to be the most generous in terms of the requirements of people in small business. </PARA>
<PARA> One field which should be of particular use to small business is that of research and development, which has been grossly neglected for decades in this country. Governments and businesses of all sizes should be required to put far more resources into this vital field. We must encourage scientific research, product and service development and scholarship. </PARA>
<PARA> I have devoted a great deal of attention to banks. Banks are devastating small business in this country. That process of devastation was brought into effect in 1984 when the present Government deregulated the banking system. Traditionally, small business people have looked to banks as being their primary ally but today, in the context of deregulation, banks are literally devastating small business people. Irrespective of whether they are small farmers or your typical small business in an urban area, their traditional ally has left them high and dry in the interests of what it describes as super profits. Six months ago I suggested that this country's banking system be placed before the appropriate Senate committee for inquiry, but my proposition was defeated by the combined vote of the Government and the Opposition. </PARA>

The proposition that banking be referred to a Senate committee will come before the Senate again in a few weeks time because I will bring it back.

The proposition of a Senate inquiry into banking falls very well with the business community and the community at large.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On four occasions this week we have considered the pilots dispute. That dispute has been cited as having a devastating impact on the business community. In a question to Senator Richardson today I implied-and I think that he accepted the fact-that it has the potential to have a devastating effect on the morale of pilots in the defence forces. Small business people are vulnerable in numerous ways. They are particularly vulnerable to government policies which are designed essentially to favour big business. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1984 we cited a predatory situation in which big business picks off small businesses one after the other, often with the assistance of bankers. The big business predators, in conjunction with the banks, go around like devastated animals and live off small business. When we attempted, with the support of COSBOA and ASBA, to introduce a private member's Bill to rectify that predatory situation, the Bill was defeated by the combined vote of the Government and the Opposition. Sadly, over and over again, legislation or amendment to legislation in favour of small business is defeated by the combined vote of both Government and Opposition. We support the proposition before the chamber that it is a matter of public importance that small business has been devastated, but we argue that it has been devastated by successive Federal and State governments. It is certainly worthy of this chamber's attention and it will, hopefully, begin to acknowledge the extraordinary place of small business in the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the benefit of the Senate, I will repeat the terms of the matter of public importance introduced today by Senator Boswell, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The damage caused to Australian small business by the anti-business policies of the Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I refer briefly to a couple of matters put forward by an honourable senator from Victoria, Senator Cooney. In the 20 minutes or half an hour that he spoke, he did not state at any stage what help this Government had been to small business, although he did admit that my colleague from Tasmania, Senator Watson, has been very good to small business by finding a loophole in the small business system. However, the honourable senator did say that the Government had the answers. If the Government has the answers, I would like to know what answers it has to the pilots dispute that is on at the moment. I would like to know what answers the Government has with respect to bankruptcies. Senator Stone mentioned that Senator Bolkus has put out a video on bankruptcy. I suppose that will really help to ease the pain of those people who see their houses being sold up and their cars going down the road! I am sure that will be a great help. </PARA>
<PARA> I just wonder what answers the Government has to those pharmacists who will be forced to close their doors because of the recommendations from the Remuneration Tribunal that Senator Cooney spent so much time defending. I note he mentioned the fact that the Australian Democrats are also concerned about the matter. With respect to the pharmacists, I ask who else in the history of this nation-certainly not any union worker-would accept the fact that having increased their productivity by 5 per cent, their incomes are to be reduced by between $25,000 and $40,000 a year. I can just imagine the sorts of disputes we would see around this country if unionised workers were asked to accept such a situation. They would make this pilots dispute seem like a boy scouts picnic. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason we brought this matter forward is the drastic plight that is facing small business in Australia today. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating)-who is the man responsible for the Federal Budget-over the years have developed a very good reputation as friends of the rich and powerful. I was very interested to hear even Senator Cooney refer to that; he almost supported it. This could be the reason that the Government has lost sight of small business. It is simply too busy looking after its big mates. Regardless of that and regardless of the comments made by Senator McLean that big business is getting all the runs on the board, it is interesting to note that the 800,000 small businesses in Australia employ around 70 per cent of the work force, a not insignificant figure. So if we have a healthy and prosperous small business sector in Australia, our economy will improve. Unfortunately, the Government has blatantly ignored the pleas for assistance from small business. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Boswell said earlier, the Government remains the highest taxing government since the last world war. Inflation is rampant and petrol excise, a cost borne by all small businesses, has skyrocketed from 6.15c just six years ago to 22.39c in February of this year. The total expected Budget surplus for 1989-90 is $9.6 billion. I had to wonder what small business people thought today when they heard the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) gloating about the huge Budget surplus. The Government has a Budget surplus all right-but it has accrued at the expense of the taxpayers and the small business community of this country. The Government has increased sales taxes and indexed them to the consumer price index, thereby ensuring that there will be rises, with inflation, twice a year. Our gross current account deficit has blown out of all proportion. The Government, to its shame, has succeeded in increasing our debt level by over $100 billion in just six years. Amidst all this crisis it has used but one tool to try to control the situation-that is, interest rates. If high interest rates ever hit anybody, they hit small business, which employs the majority of the work force, as I said earlier. High interest rates mean that small businesses face increasing problems just to stay in business. Fewer small businesses mean less employment, and less employment in small business means that more people will be receiving unemployment benefits instead of paying a reasonable tax which this country needs to survive. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is any conclusion to be drawn, surely it is that this Government favours big business, union power and a centralised government. It is not a government which is prepared to help the Aussie worker who has helped to develop our country over the years. Would it be a caring government that has refused to bite the bullet and make our shipping lines and wharves more effective? As an example, just the other day I heard it stated that clay pottery can be transported from England to Tasmania more cheaply than from Melbourne. This is a ridiculous situation, and it has continued during the entire period that this Government has been in office. The Government has only paid lip service to the real action while the small business operators have paid the price-a price which is hampering their cost effectiveness compared to overseas competitors and hence their ability to expand. </PARA>
<PARA> Only yesterday we heard the news of the biggest slump in housing approvals for more than a decade. The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures indicate that approvals for dwelling units fell by a massive 18.2 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis, from 14,831 in June to 12,134 in July-the biggest monthly drop for over 12 years. A little over a year ago approvals stood at 15,299. The number of private sector houses approved fell by 13.3 per cent to 8,136 in July. That figure is the lowest monthly figure since August 1987. In unadjusted terms, dwelling unit approvals plunged 21.8 per cent. It is quite clear-it has been admitted-what has caused this drop in approvals: record interest rates. They are hitting the mortgage belt. As they bite hard and hit the mortgage belt a lot of other people will suffer. I refer to the people down the track who do all the work: the builders, the bricklayers, the tilers-all those people involved in the building industry, all those small businesses. We only have to read what Mr John Murray, the Executive Director of the Construction and Housing Association of Australia, said recently. He summed up the situation when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is totally inappropriate for interest rate sensitive sectors to become the battering ram for macroeconomic policy. </PARA>
<PARA>The Executive Director of the Housing Industry Association, Dr Silberberg, also commented, saying that to force the housing industry into a recession does not make sense. Not only does it not make sense from an economic point of view but it also does not make sense when we look at the hundreds of small businesses around Australia which are going to feel the weight of this interest rate saga. It will be the plumbers, contractors, carpenters and carpet layers and others involved in small businesses that will suffer because of these ridiculously high interest rates forced on us by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We can look at the real estate industry. I am aware of a company on the north-west coast of Tasmania which, prior to this interest rate hike, was selling six houses a week. Now it would be lucky to sell six houses a month. They are feeling the pinch just like other small businesses around the country. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to another matter which affects small business-something else this Government supports strongly-that is, the centralised wage fixing system. It has been widely acknowledged that one of the key problems facing small business today is the inadequacy of the centralised wage fixing system in the prevailing economic conditions. Centralised wage fixing has become a disincentive for productivity and until businesses are given the opportunity to negotiate fair wage systems with their employees on an individual basis the situation will not get any better. We have had terrific examples of the failure of the wage fixing system over recent weeks. One such example is the number of innovative small businesses which have emerged to enter the recycling area. In Lismore there is a very significant small business involved in the recycling of paper, plastic and glass. The centralised wage fixing system had forced that business to the edge of bankruptcy. Jobs were on the line. The owner had only one way to turn. So with the consent of his employees he converted them to subcontractors. He restored incentive to the workplace. As a result, productivity has improved threefold while the wages of his former employees, who are now his subcontractors, have doubled. That is not a figment of my imagination. If Senator Burns would like to look at the press release where this information appears I will show it to him. </PARA>
<PARA> There is definitely an urgent need for voluntary employment agreements which would be enforceable under common law and would not be subject to the rorts and the unenforceability that operate under this current wage system. Wages and conditions must closely parallel the needs and profitability of an enterprise. It has really been sad to see the handling by our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) of the current airlines dispute. The `them and us' attitude referred to by Mr Hawke has been a thing of the past. He is a product of an outmoded industrial relations system which uses confrontation rather than consensus as the opening gambit to negotiation. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard all week about the horrific effect this industrial relations system is having on small business, particularly the travel industry and resort leisure activities and facilities. Travel agents have lost thousands of dollars. It goes on and on. Only today one of the contracted hire car drivers who is used in the Senate car pool claimed that unless this matter is resolved within a month he and a number of others like him in Canberra will be bankrupt. We have already talked about bankruptcy. We know what happens when that occurs-we can get a video from Senator Bolkus which will tell us all about it. It is a deplorable situation. </PARA>
<PARA> It was said earlier, I think by Senator McLean, that the small business sector does not have political clout. But it does have the Australian Small Business Association. I would like to quote a couple of extracts from a press release issued by that Association's President last July-before the pilots strike, before the attack on the pharmacists, before the Budget, before the high interest rates:</PARA>
<PARA> Far from helping small business the government and government agencies use their monopoly power, tax concessions and taxpayers' subsidies to disadvantage small businesses in every part of Australia. All government agencies and government run instrumentalities are exempt from land rates, council rates, petrol tax, sales tax, fringe benefits tax and payroll tax. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> The small business sector employs 60 per cent of the private work force and has the capacity to expand and cure the twin evils of unemployment and foreign debt. The Government should be giving small business every possible assistance, but sadly the Ministers are slow to act to correct inequities . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The important thing that the President of the Association said was:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Small Business Association does not call for any financial subsidy whatsoever for small business, but merely asks that government get off the back of small business and create a climate of incentive and reward for the small business proprietor who is prepared to work far longer hours than most people in the community. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that paragraph sums up the situation so far as small business is concerned. If small business were allowed to compete, to employ people without being interfered with by a government that seems to be interested only in the big operator, a government-as Senator Boswell said earlier-that is responsible only for turning big business into small business because of the economic situation, small business would certainly start to give benefits to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> In the final few seconds I have left I will refer to another matter that is coming forward: the privacy legislation. Mr Barron, the State Director of the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce, when speaking of the Privacy Amendment Bill, said:</PARA>
<PARA> In this State, the overwhelming majority of businesses are small . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He said that there is no doubt that some will fail if this legislation is passed. There will be a lot more debate over the next couple of weeks about the privacy legislation. I hope I have the opportunity to speak on it because this, in itself, is another attack on small business. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to depart from what other honourable senators have been doing in this debate and talk about the matter of public importance-I hope I am excused for that. Before doing so, I would like to rebut some of the points raised about pharmacists. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal has been in operation for some years. Many of the decisions that it has made have been accepted by the pharmacists because they have been fairly beneficial. This Government does not lose sight of the importance of pharmacists. But the bottom line for us obviously is that they deliver a service at a reasonable cost to the ordinary people of this country. We are, however, conscious that in some areas there will be a need to assist pharmacies-for example, pharmacies in isolated areas which need that service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Boswell said that he would rather look at symptoms than causes in relation to small business problems. I can assure him that I would rather look at the causes. If we can eliminate them we will not have the symptoms. I think Senator Calvert mentioned centralised wage fixation. I can assure him, if he does not know, that this system sets only a minimum wage; it does not prevent any employer from paying additional wages. It does not in any way restrict any employee from doing his best and creating the highest level of productivity. Even Justice Higgins in 1907 made the point that if an employer had a horse that he used in his business, he would make sure it was well fed and healthy so that it could do its job. A worker, his wife and three children should be treated no less. If an employer cannot pay the desired wage levels, he should get out of business and allow those who are efficient to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Any government that does not realise the importance of small business is very stupid. That tag cannot be applied to this Government. The problem is that many people often go into small business badly equipped and ill-prepared. They have heaps of enthusiasm and some knowledge but they cannot translate that into a successful business. They have problems of inadequate finances and lack of adequate knowledge of business practices. These deficiencies are endemic. Problems that many of them bring to their new endeavours include lack of adequate finance, inadequate knowledge of bookkeeping and difficulties with debtors. Recognising these problems, the Federal Government has given considerable assistance to small business. Ninety-five per cent of agricultural businesses are small businesses and they employ 44 per cent of the private sector work force. </PARA>
<PARA> During 1986 to 1987 there was a 15 per cent increase in the number of enterprises. This hardly amounts to a dramatic downturn in business. The Australian Labor Party has always had a concern for the democratic process. People involved in manufacturing and small business of any kind should have a say about the future of their businesses. With this in mind, we set up the Small Business Council in 1984 to provide advice on small business issues. </PARA>
<PARA> In March 1988 the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) asked the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology to inquire into problems facing small business. That report, which is expected soon, will focus on issues of concern to all small businesses. What is the Committee inquiring into? Its terms of reference are: the unique problems faced by small business as a result of the extensive, yet fragmented, regulations under which they are governed and ways in which the administration of regulations can be improved-I refer here to the different State government, Federal government and local government laws; the impact of government policies in such areas as taxation, superannuation, training, marketing, access to information, advice and industrial relations; and the ultimate extent of policies on small businesses compared with larger businesses. The Committee has held hearings in all States and there has been considerable small business input. That is tremendously important. Small businesses have had an opportunity to say what they think. Their views can be considered and recommendations can be made to the Parliament. It is hoped that the report will provide a blueprint for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1986, the Commonwealth has provided $17m per annum to the States for programs. It decided to set up a body which is called the National Industries Extension Services (NIES). Before NIES was set up, private consultants were retained to focus on the problems and suggest solutions. We did not just say, `Let's set up the service and decide what to do later'. We had a look at what needed to be done. NIES is a joint Federal-State initiative. It provides the manufacturing industry with a central source of information and advice and it subsidises firms in the traded goods sector to receive specialist consulting advice. The Federal Government supplies the money and the States do most of the work, and very successfully, even though the States may have governments of different political persuasions. For example, management and marketing aspects are taken into consideration, as are productivity and design, plant layout, technology application, job design and employee participation-something that honourable senators on the other side of the House are not interested in. They are not concerned about industrial democracy whereby people are encouraged to be part of the decision-making process and therefore have a responsibility in terms of production and the quality of the goods that they produce. </PARA>
<PARA> NIES is not into rescuing companies but into making good companies better; that is, if a company is hopeless the market will find that out and the market will deal with it. Australian United Gems, which two years ago was a two-man company with a vision to export, now has the planning, marketing and manufacturing know-how to realise a $1m a year dream. This Queensland company had received a NIES maximum subsidy of $7,000 for business planning. That was a Federal Government initiative in conjunction with the State Government. Of course, we are concerned about small business. We are doing something in a concrete fashion to meet that need. </PARA>
<PARA> In Queensland more than 500 companies have been helped by NIES with business plans and manufacturing programs. A NIES work book kit has been produced. It is a very substantial instrument to help small business to be successful. There is a video and a business planner. There is a booklet entitled, `Your Business Now: A Self Diagnostic Work Book' which helps one to see where one is going wrong. The NIES work book kit allows one to focus on those sorts of things. These are real and important steps that the Government has been taking. </PARA>

<PARA> In February this year, the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) released the NIES work book kit which was designed to help small business. It has sold more than 5,000 copies at a price of $55 per copy. Obviously, it is a useful tool and is much sought after by small business. The kit is designed to help companies which employ between 10 and 100 people and which have little opportunity to employ professional help. The comprehensive work book, video and business planner pose questions such as, `How strong is your industry position?', `How strong is your organisation?', `What is the enterprise strength of your organisation?', and also look at financial performance check lists and performance criteria. The kit is designed to focus on the key issues that determine success or failure. It emphasises the causes rather than the symptoms. If one removes the causes, there are no symptoms. Honourable senators opposite will have to tell Senator Boswell that. He is not here; he should have waited and listened. We could have educated him, like we are educating other honourable senators opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, the work book provides detailed information for small business to assess their profitability, gearing and finance, liquidity, efficiency and productivity. This is a real help for small business, rather than this raving by Opposition senators about economic circumstances and how the Government has not cared about business. I am talking specifically about the way in which the Government assists business, so that people in this country can understand, in a very basic and simple way, what we are doing. The Minister, Barry Jones, when announcing the release of a work book kit to assist small business, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Small businesses were vital to the nation's economic well being. Although the market was tough and uncompromising, it held great opportunities for growth and prosperity for well-managed firms. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are not the words of someone who does not care; those are the words of a man who cares about small business, who understands its importance to the community and who also understands the importance to the community of individuals in small business. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of assistance provided in the Budget, much has been said about increased taxation revenue, but recently we reduced company tax from 49c to 39c in the dollar. That was a pretty substantial reduction. Another important aspect that is often missed is that the prices and incomes accord that was agreed to between the Australian Labor Party before it came to government and the unions provides for the acceptance of the redirection by companies of some wages into profits. That has been the case for nine to 10 years. Obviously, they must be used for the purpose of reinvestment, to provide more jobs. We are not in the business of saying, `We want you to have more profits so that you can go to Hawaii twice a month. We want you to reinvest, provide more jobs and thus increase the prosperity of more people in the community'. To some extent that has happened, but in some cases it has not. It shows the very conscious, positive and productive way in which the trade unions go about their work and the way in which this Labor Government has provided opportunities for business. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has amended the wholesale tax law exempting equipment and materials for use in specified processes in the manufacture of goods. The threshold amount of average sales by a manufacturer above which goods will become taxable increased from $12,000 to $50,000. The threshold amount of sales tax liability above which goods become taxable increased from $250 to $1,000. All of these measures are meant to help small business, yet the Opposition has the hide to say that we do not care about small businesses. We care about them much more than does the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The deregulation of financial markets, the removal of interest rate controls, was also accomplished by this Government. We also abolished State purchasing preferences, which allowed small businesses who had the capacity to compete from State to State to get interstate contracts. Previously, small businesses were only protected by their own State laws and therefore we did not have a situation where the most competent companies provided goods by way of tender. This Government has also continued support for the small business award program. That is only a small thing, but it is important. There was also the introduction of the `Buy Australian' program, and the publication of the Small Business Review, which is an informative source of data for small businesses. Austrade assists with the development of business strategy, taking into account emerging international market opportunities and intelligence. Before the Labor Party came into office, most of this applied to agricultural goods, not to manufactured goods. The current Government has altered that policy, and Austrade now assists tremendously with the marketing of manufactured goods overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> In competitive world marketing, the Commonwealth Government has taken certain initiatives. It has provided assistance to small business for research and development. Small business has received a 150 per cent tax break for this purpose. The management and investment companies program has encouraged the development of the venture capital market in Australia. It has provided financial support for Australian based overseas enterprises to invest in start-up early growth. Investors in these companies gain significant tax relief totalling 100 per cent. I refer also to Government purchasing policies, export incentives, export insurance and finance facilities, the Commonwealth Development Bank and the Australian Industry Development Corporation. The vast majority of small innovative firms in emerging Australian industries are engaged in exporting to some degree. Many of these industries are highly export oriented. All of these measures are directed towards helping small business, by a conscientious government that really cares. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Taxation Office will introduce new information to assist small business. A major problem facing small business is how to tackle its tax affairs and the lack of information to do so. The Australian Taxation Office has identified small business as a priority area for information services in 1989-90. Following discussions with the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia it has more closely identified the information needs of small businesses and the best way in which it can meet those needs. The Australian Taxation Office has said to small businesses, `What are your problems? We will try to help you with them'. The Taxation Commissioner's advisory panel is to have an input from the Council of Small Business Organisations. `What do you want? How can we help you?' is the cry from the Labor Government. It is not, `We will tell you how to do it' but, `We will help. Tell us what your problems are'. There is the inclusion of a tax component in TAFE college courses. We are trying to change our culture so that when young people go through school they will understand what small business is about. They will not think one just puts up a sign, has $5,000, opens up a shop or business and has to be successful. Those are the things this Government is doing. I think they are important. The proposition put forward by the Opposition is totally dishonest and cannot be supported. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate my coalition colleagues Senator Boswell and Senator Calvert on their important and significant contribution to this debate on small business this afternoon. At the same time, I would like to acknowledge that charitable gentleman from Victoria, Senator Barney Cooney, for his very generous comments on my private member's Bill being taken up as part of the Government's Budget. The tragedy for the Australian Labor Party (ALP) is that the real thinkers in the Labor Party, like Senator Barney Cooney, Mr John Langmore and others, are not on the front bench.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Almost 800,000 small business enterprises currently operate in Australia and employ almost 2,000,000 people. Almost 31 per cent of the Australian work force is employed in this small business sector. It is significant to note that small business accounts for 55 per cent of all private sector investment and 40 per cent of industry value added. The significance of this matter of importance today is that small business is under attack by this uncaring Federal Government. No longer does the ALP Government consult adequately with the relevant sectors before imposing changes, many of which are detrimental to the maintenance of a stable business environment which is so essential for small business. One finds that in taxation, retirement incomes policy, monetary policy with its high interest rates, government charges and regulations and micro-economic policy, small business is the forgotten sector.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Burns, who has now left the chamber, was so proud of the high uptake of some of the Government booklets to help small business. I remind him that the uptake was less than one per cent. The Government's peak department in this area, the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, provides no direction as its personnel are demoralised with the lack of leadership, high staff losses and the number of its activities being transferred to other Ministries, whose heads believe that they can do a better job. Earlier initiatives by the Minister are being scaled down, with small business being placed in a position of going it alone, despite the earlier high expectations. The rhetoric is still there, as Senator Burns will tell us, but the delivery is missing. No longer is government fulfilling its essential role of establishing and maintaining stable conditions within which all firms can compete on reasonably equal terms, particularly with government. If there is any monitoring of the effect of the Government's economic, fiscal and industry policies, and the impact of its leadership, the Government is certainly not responding to the signals that are there, or heeding the advice. </PARA>
<PARA> Small businesses and home owners are being singled out. They are being asked, unreasonably, to carry the full impact of the Government's single-minded resolution to adjust an overheated economy through excessive reliance on interest rate policy with its very damaging effects on small business and small home owners. No wonder bankruptcies are rising and running at record levels. In the same environment we find Government business enterprises continuing their spending sprees, with instrumentalities such as Telecom Australia anticipating spending over $300m on an office block in a central business district of Melbourne in Exhibition Street. We have other statutory organisations and departments on spending sprees with computers costing hundreds of millions of dollars. For example, the Taxation Office has spent $1,000m, and the Department of Defence has spent $400m on project DESINE. At the same time these spending sprees on computers add to the massive pressure on the government sector and add significant weight to our balance of payments difficulties. It is not surprising that there is so much bitterness coming from the business sector because of the treatment by this Federal Labor Government. Large foreign debt has ensured that the cost of capital needed to make business competitive is very much higher in this country than in other countries. The taxation regime has undermined incentive; the changing nature of government policy has created an air of uncertainty in the public mind, particularly from small business; and then there is the complexity of legislation, for example, the drawback scheme. Often we find the cost of producing the information required for a refund exceeds benefits which are able to be claimed. The system is geared to the large concerns producing simple products but not to small business. </PARA>
<PARA> May I contrast this position with that which is operating in Japan, where small businesses are encouraged; they facilitate and underpin the great flexibility and productive capacity of the great Japanese economy. In Japan small business has played, and is expected to continue to play, a pivotal role in that nation's economic success. It is not under attack, as it is in Australia, but is encouraged. Major Japanese industries extensively contract out work to an array of small, flexible and efficient family businesses. This Federal Government can assist small business by providing a stable economic environment which places greater reliance on market forces to facilitate economic growth and employment without undue government interference and intervention. Rules and regulations imposed on small businesses by the three tiers of government pose a threat to the efficient operation and growth of the small business sector. Small business is constantly frustrated by a myriad of rules and regulations which, to small business, appear to have no clear purpose or rationale. Small business feels that it has particular burdens in regulations relating to superannuation, the fringe benefits tax, pay as you earn tax, sales tax, child support, capital gains tax, Customs, tax audits, municipal taxes and numerous other rules and regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to point out that numerous Budget changes have had an impact on small business. Many small businesses are in a corporate form. Recently they have adjusted to the new method of quarterly instalments for meeting their company tax obligations. As a result of these Budget changes they now find themselves having to pay 85 per cent of their tax obligation within 15 days of the close of a financial year. The severity of this measure will have a major impact on the small business sector and on financial markets. Many small businesses just will not be in a position to raise overdraft facilities to find such a massive amount of money. My colleagues on the other side of the House seem oblivious to the fact that profit earned is not always simultaneous with cash received. In many cases the cash has to go out to pay the tax obligation before it is even received by the taxpayer under these conditions. They will have to be revised. </PARA>
<PARA> In conditions of declining profitability the rush to get accountants from outside the business to prepare the accounts within 15 days and pay the tax is an impossible situation. In other words, there are not enough accountants to meet the sort of demand that will be expected by this Government, which has lost touch with the small business community. The Government has just gone too far too quickly. It is not surprising that the wrath of the business community is gaining such a head of steam, the effects of which will be felt by this Government. Mr Bob Gottliebsen from the Business Review Weekly said that Canberra's pay as you earn politicians and public servants simply did not understand that business was run on cash flow rather than profits. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I must say that all is not gloom and doom. I acknowledge the Government's generosity in picking up my private member's Bill. This was something which was well overdue, something that should have been introduced when self-assessment was first introduced into the system. I am pleased that we now have a greater equality or neutrality between the Tax Office and taxpayers. It is only right that, in the provision of information to the Taxation Office, a taxpayer is able to secure professional advice and claim a deduction for it. On the other hand, the high cost of appeals through the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has risen dramatically under this Government. It is now $300 per person involved. So for a small business with, say, three partners the cost would be $900. If that appeal is successful they do not get even one cent of the $900 back. So there is not much incentive to appeal. </PARA>
<PARA> Of concern also is the fact that where errors are made by the Taxation Office, for example where a computer operator keys in a wrong figure for prescribed payments tax and there is a delay in a refund to the taxpayer of perhaps four months, there is no obligation or even a requirement for interest to be paid by the Tax Office for the Tax Commissioner's mistake. But if a taxpayer or small business is late in paying tax, heavy penalties are involved. All too frequently press releases precede legislation, not by weeks, not by months, but by years. Having adjusted their businesses to the foreshadowed changes, small businesses frequently find themselves in a position where the subsequent legislation differs in major areas from the original announcement. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Budget announcement of 15 August we saw a retrospective application of capital gains tax. If it had not been for the early intervention of the Australian Taxpayers Association, the Government would have taken excessive amounts through additional issues of shares via the capital gains tax mechanisms. In the retirement incomes area, we find that stable businesses require a long term superannuation regime where amounts must be put aside for retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> In May 1988 the Treasurer promised that there would be no further changes to superannuation, that Australians now could plan with confidence and certainty. Yet the recently passed tax Bills create a myriad of uncertainty and complexity. They will raise an extra $1m from the savings of ordinary Australians and small businesses. The legislation is an administrative nightmare in terms of both complexity and retrospectivity. The real beneficiaries are the Government-by virtue of the extra money it can get-the actuaries, the accountants, and the large superannuation firms. The small people have been raped of their savings and of their independence. Superannuation for lower and middle income earners is now becoming a much less attractive investment proposition. No longer is superannuation the efficient, long term retirement vehicle which is so necessary to guarantee security for people in their retirement years. In the last three years there has been a 400 per cent increase in the volume of legislation and rules relating to superannuation. Previously, the bureaucracy was limited to the Australian Taxation Office. Now we have two major bureaucracies administering this area: the Tax Office and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Contractors Association Ltd is an important small business organisation which is concerned about the Commissioner of Taxation rewriting the rule book. It is concerned that these reassessments are being issued not because of any dishonesty or non-disclosure by the taxpayer, but simply because of new interpretations of the Income Tax Assessment Act. It says that taxpayers have structured their affairs on the best professional advice only to find that the Commissioner for Taxation has rewritten the rule book. It says, `As small business people, we cannot live in a regime of retrospective reassessments'. Currently, many casual workers are disadvantaged by the tax system, particularly those who work for a second employer. This affects many small businesses which require daily casual labour. Section 221d of the tax file number provision of the Income Tax Assessment Act is not helping these people get jobs. If the Government were really concerned about helping low income earners it could devise a daily tax scale for those people similar to what has been achieved on a weekly basis for shearers. Small business is constantly calling for a simplification of the present 2,000 pages of complex, unclear rules. It has had to cope with capital gains tax, changes to negative gearing, substantiation prescribed payments and so on. There is a need for a greater re-examination of tax returns at the time of lodgment and the calculations of taxpayers. I am not advocating a lessening of the tax or the field audits but honest mistakes and misunderstandings of the Act are not being referred by the Australian Taxation Office to the Commissioner of Taxation quickly enough. Sometimes it takes three or five years and the penalties under such circumstances are quite horrific. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was formerly in small business-it seems like an awfully long time ago; almost like another incarnation-so I have some sympathy with that sector. I acknowledge the important contribution of small business not only in those well-acknowledged areas of employment and the value that it adds to products but also because, in a sense, it is the wealth distributor. It is through the small business sector that wealth is conveyed to the people of this country. I acknowledge also the importance of keeping the small business sector strong and healthy. I believe that this Government, not only in its rhetoric but also through its actions, has acknowledged that importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a sector fraught with problems but the problems are not unique to this Government, nor are they unique to this country; the problems are found worldwide and they cross political boundaries. Senator Watson talked about Japan as a shining example of how things should be done, but he failed to mention, because it did not suit his argument, that bankruptcies are rife in Japan and are probably comparable-I cannot give figures now because I did not come prepared for that-to those in Australia, as they are in Margaret Thatcher's England and as they are in Bush's United States of America. As these problems are a worldwide thing across political styles they cannot be uniquely sheeted home to the Australian Labor Party and this Government. So there is no point in quoting statistics and saying, `My bankruptcy rate is better than your bankruptcy rate', or that sort of thing. </PARA>
<PARA> The failure rate of small business is, I admit, a depressing problem. Let us look at the most comprehensive study at hand-the Williams longitudinal study entitled The Characteristics and Performance of Small Business in Australia 1973-85. That publication shows that of start-up businesses examined between 1973 and 1985, within three years 40 per cent failed and within five years 60 per cent failed. I draw attention to the fact that the period of the study spans the Fraser and Hawke governments. Eighty per cent of businesses failed because of a lack of management expertise, yet there is a marked reluctance to seek or use external help. Again that is something that is evident across the board and throughout the world; it is part of a small business syndrome, if you like. Only 6 per cent of businesses consulted advisers regularly in that period and 63 per cent never consulted external advisers. </PARA>
<PARA> It needs to be stressed again that this problem is not unique to this Government; it is worldwide and across styles of government. It is a problem in the nature of small business. The fact is that there is no shortage of Australians-and this is a sad fact-willing to gamble all on the prospect of running their own business. They are prepared to give it a go without much information and without any outside consultation; so they fail. It is also a fact that the Government's role in any direct sense will always be limited. In our system it is a shared role with the States. In essence, the Federal Government's role is twofold: the provision of economic conditions and a business infrastructure which is conducive to sustained growth and to the development of small firms-in the Federal Government's case it will also be interested particularly in export oriented firms-and, secondly, the provision of more direct assistance and exhortation with the assistance of the States and institutions such as banks, education institutions, professional groups, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Government's achievements in both of these areas have been remarkable. In the short time available to me I do not have time to go into them but some other speakers have already alluded to some of them. But I would like to draw attention to one area in which government, outside all the direct influences, has assisted quite a bit-that is, in exhorting institutions such as banks to take note--</PARA>

I refer to the question of the status of Sheikh Mohammad Al Hilaly, the imam of the Lakemba Mosque in Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have raised this matter in the past. It is a matter of major concern. The imam has been a resident of Australia with either a temporary permit or no permit whatsoever for something like seven years. Four years ago he was required to leave Australia because his permit to stay had expired. He failed to keep a commitment to leave, as required by the Government of the day. Yet now seven years later he is still without a permit to exist here, although an additional temporary one was given to him just a couple of months ago in a manner which involved misleading the Senate-I will raise that matter later-in order to allow him to go to Mecca. I have no concern on religious or other grounds. My concerns relate to whether or not the imam is a fit and proper person to be a permanent resident of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very concerned that specific and special arrangements appear to have been made for the imam which are not made and never have been made to my knowledge for people, for example, from the city of Wollongong, where I have my office. There is an enormous migrant community in Wollongong where this kind of special concession would be unheard of. There have been continuing extensions of his permit to reside in Australia temporarily covering a period of seven years. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) has still not made a determination about his status. I have before me the Department's draft submission to the Minister about whether or not the Minister should grant permanent residence to the imam. The reason I am raising this matter here is that a report on this application for resident status was to be forwarded to the Minister on 28 August 1989. That is long after any temporary permits would have expired and where normally someone would have been on their way out of the country by either being deported or under their own steam. </PARA>
<PARA> The imam was provided with an opportunity to make any comments in the letter dated 21 August by Thursday 24 August 1989. In other words, one assumes that the Minister has now received the detailed report and a decision is apparently about to be made at last. My concerns relate to some of the material in the draft submission to the Minister which strikes me as extraordinary. It is asserted in this recommendation that most allegations against Imam Hilaly are not supported by factual evidence and cannot be relied upon. It is not possible to determine on evidence whether they are true or not. The Jewish community in Sydney, for example, would be appalled that such a statement could be made. </PARA>
<PARA> It is incredible to me that an official document-and, as I understand it, this is the draft of the recommendation of the Minister-could make such an assertion. If there are people who can provide factual evidence-and I am assured that there are-I would hope that they would make certain that that factual evidence is presented to this Minister before he acts on this grossly inadequate departmental report. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>There is evidence indicating that the Imam Hilaly's presence in Australia has the support of the Government of Libya or its agents. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a very serious matter indeed. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>That Government has contributed not insubstantial sums to support the organizations which fund, inter alia, the Imam's expenses. Such expenses include the legal expenses for the Federal Court appeal against the Government's decision in 1986 not to grant Imam Hilaly permanent residence and for the Commonwealth's (successful) appeal to the Full Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA>As I say, it seems to me to be particularly serious when, as the report says, `There is evidence indicating that the Imam Hilaly's presence in Australia has the support of the Government of Libya or its agents'. The report goes on to say that, in responding to questions on this, Imam Hilaly indicated, `I also personally did not receive one cent out of this amount' and `I have not received any money and this report . . . is incorrect'-that was a contemporary media account. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Literally and physically, it is accepted that the Imam did not receive one cent from the grant from an agency supported by the Libyan Government. However, it is open to hold that the Imam did benefit from those funds which entered a pool of funds from which monies are paid, inter alia, for the Imam's purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to be to be quite a misleading statement by the Imam. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no evidence that the amount in question was directed specifically to meet the Imam's expenses. Moreover, there is no evidence that the grant of such monies to the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils was in consideration for general or specific responses to be made by that Federation or others in Australia. To the contrary, Imam Hilaly said, `We cooperate with those overseas Islamic organisations for the benefit of Moslems but we will not be tied to their political government or political system and we accept assistance without conditions'. </PARA>
<PARA>I thought it proper to put the other side of this case so that I could not be held to be making a one-sided statement. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Further, the Imam indicated that he was unaware of the grant ``until the press announced this.'' In responding to a question as to why the Imam did not refute contrary views in ``The Australian'' of 16 December 1987, The Imam indicated, ``Today''-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, 16 August 1989-</PARA>
<PARA>``this is the first time I've become aware that The Australian newspaper have written something like this about me.''</PARA>
<PARA>Quite frankly, I find that very difficult to accept. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>In pursuing the general theme, the Imam said that he visited Libya for an international conference some two years ago. According to Departmental records, this visit was between June and September 1987 when Imam Hilaly travelled out of Australia. The fare for this visit was also provided by an agency supported by the Libyan Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The Libyan Government-and its agents-has or have a reputation for actively and sometimes violently interfering in the affairs of foreign nations. Especially in matters concerning Israel and Lebanon, it has been seen by some as being aligned with the approach of governments which hold extreme views on international politics. It has as its president a person who is seen as the leader of the Revolution and who has been the ruler of Libya since before 1970. There have been suggestions that the Libyan Government or its agents have had an interest in extending its/their influence in areas of tension as remote from Libya as the Caribbean and the Pacific. Your views-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Minister's views-</PARA>
<PARA>on this matter and the relevance of it to Australia might or might not be relevant to the consideration of the Imam's application in light of all the evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the next bit which really concerns me. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>It is noteworthy, however, that the relevant Australian Government agency has, on the information then available to it-</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know what `then' means-</PARA>
<PARA>indicated no objection to the Imam's continued presence in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>If you-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Minister-</PARA>
<PARA>do not agree with that view, you would be expected to have a reasonable basis for differing with that view. </PARA>
<PARA>I find it incredible that any security organisation in Australia would take the view that there is no matter for concern and no objection to the imam on the basis of these links with Libya. It seems to me, from that choice of words, that the Department is encouraging the Minister to take the view that the imam is on that basis someone who is acceptable to become a permanent resident of Australia. The key point to remember is that the imam's behaviour, which has been so divisive over the past seven years and particularly over recent years, has been despite the admonition of the Australian Government that he should behave and despite his assurance that he would behave, having created such turmoil and distress among so many people who have been offended and upset by his intemperate comments. What would be the likely pattern of behaviour of this man once those constraints which have acted so ineffectively against him were removed? That question is not raised in the Department's submission to the Minister. The report to the Minister continues:</PARA>
<PARA>You might hold that answers to questions put to Imam Hilaly on this most sensitive question do not allay reasonably held concerns about the Imam's links with Libya which, to our knowledge, commenced in 1973. Certainly the answers speak of receiving grants without attached conditions, and the Imam says, `From my earlier days in Libya I have taken the stand that is in opposition to Libya . . .'.-</PARA>
<PARA>I must say that that seems unlikely-</PARA>
<PARA>But the Imam's answers also contain apparent inconsistencies about his actions in the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Even though some allegations made against Imam Hilaly are not supported by evidence, it is undeniable that there are divisions within the Lebanese community in Sydney, evidenced by the fact that strong allegations are made against Imam Hilaly and equally strongly denied by his supporters. Imam Hilaly's presence appears to arouse deep-seated passions within the community among both his supporters and opponents. </PARA>
<PARA>I stress, without any special pleading for the Jewish community, that the report recognises that Imam Hilaly has not publicly retracted or apologised for his remarks of September 1988 which were massively divisive and grievously offensive to the Jewish community in Australia. The Executive Council of Australian Jewry wrote to the Minister expressing unequivocal opposition to Imam Hilaly being allowed to remain in Australia. That Council believes that Imam Hilaly represents a direct threat to the Jewish community here and presents a real danger of inciting anti-Semitic acts, including violent acts, against Jewish people and institutions in Australia. After recognition of that submission by the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, it is intriguing that the report to the Minister states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult to know, amid all the claims and counter claims in this case just where the real truth lies. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Department cannot tell where the real truth lies on the evidence that abounds, I hope that its level of performance can increase substantially in a qualitative sense. Having read the recommendation, it appears to be paving the way for an acceptance by the Minister of the suggestion that perhaps the imam should be allowed to stay which would involve a breaking of almost every one of the accepted standards of a multicultural society on which there is bipartisan support in Australian politics. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply say once again that I raised this matter because of my extreme concern that what strikes me as a misleading and inadequate recommendation to the Minister may be acted on in the very near future. I can only hope that the Minister, whom I personally regard very highly for both his integrity and his capacity, will be able to see from the very brief remarks I have made here today that his actions in this area should not be encouraged by this report by his Department to allow Sheikh Al Hilaly the Imam of the Lakemba Mosque, to become a permanent resident of Australia, because I believe that he would be an even more divisive element in the future than he has been in the past. </PARA>
