<TITLE>Television Transmission, Tasmania</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned residents of Tasmania respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the mountainous terrain and geography of Tasmania makes VHF television transmissions the most suitable for the State;</PARA>
<PARA> That more than 30,000 Tasmanians will have to purchase new television receivers and new antennae if commercial television in the State is forced to change from the VHF to the UHF band;</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore request that the requirement by the Department of Transport and Communications to force Tasmania's two commercial television stations to change from the VHF to the UHF band by 1993 be immediately rescinded.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed cuts in funding to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will have serious effects on the viability of many family chemists, leading to increased charges and reduction in services and availability of medicines to the community.</PARA>
<PARA> We therefore call on the Federal Government to reject the findings of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal and maintain the level of funding existing prior to the Tribunal's findings.</PARA>

<PARA>Petition to the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Romania, whose Human Rights Record had been worse than that of South Africa's even before she embarked on a diabolic village destruction program, deservedly attracts worldwide condemnation. The systematic cultural genocide of the peoples affected must be prevented.</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore your petitioners humbly pray that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. the Australian Parliament establish whether or not Romania has satisfied fully her obligations under the Treaty of Trianon (1920) and the Peace Treaty of Paris (1947),</PARA>

<PARA> The members of the Australian Armed Forces who served in the Vietnam from 1962 to 1973 did so with distinction, valour and professionalism, upholding the traditions of the Armed Forces.</PARA>
<PARA> After World War 2 and the Korean War the Australian Government approved an End of War List of Gallantry Medals for individual acts of bravery that were not rewarded during wartime.</PARA>
<PARA> The Whitlam Government refused to approve such an End of War List at the end of the Vietnam War.</PARA>
<PARA> Your humble petitioners pray that the Federal Government reverse the decision of the Whitlam Government and thus approve an End of War List for the Australian Armed Forces personnel that served in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA> Upon the approval of the End of War List, the case of the 2nd Lieutenant John Fraser, 3RAR be considered for the award of a posthumous military honour.</PARA>

<TITLE>Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</TITLE>

<PARA> The Government's attack upon the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has cast grave doubts over the future viability of our community pharmacies and their ability to provide much-needed service to the community, including particularly those in rural areas;</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will further jeopardise the viability of pharmacists;</PARA>
<PARA> The latest decision to slash PBS payments to pharmacists by an average of $1.05 per script is simply unacceptable and will force the closure of many pharmacies.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) notes:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) that Senate Estimates Committee B was reconvened on Wednesday, 11 October 1989, with the agreement of all parties, to enable questioning of the Civil Aviation Authority and the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation on allegations relating to air safety in Australia,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) that specific allegations made in documents signed by Captain Segan and Captain Lewino, and tabled in the Senate, were unable to be tested due to the ruling by the Chairman of the Committee that these documents were subject to the sub judice rule in that he was informed by the Minister at the table, Senator Bolkus, that writs may have been issued,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) that the Chairman ruled that, as he was an inexperienced Chairman, he was unwilling to allow questioning of witnesses which might relate to a future legal action and that, despite contrary advice received from the Clerk of the Senate as to the practice in the Senate and other legislatures, he was unwilling to vary his ruling,</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) the questionable nature of the Chairman's ruling in that the written advice of the Clerk was that:</PARA>
<PARA> `For the rule to be invoked</PARA>
<PARA> there must be proceedings on foot or in near prospect</PARA>
<PARA> there must be a substantial danger of prejudice to the proceedings . . . The danger of prejudice is regarded as small unless there is a jury empanelled or the proceedings are likely to be before a jury in the near future',</PARA>
<PARA> (v) the ruling of the President of the Senate on 10 May 1988 that the issue of writs does not mean that there are any proceedings in danger of being prejudiced, and</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) that the investigations of the Committee were frustrated by the Chairman's ruling, by the Minister's failure to provide documents as requested by the Committee and by his attempts to restrict certain lines of questioning by the Committee;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) calls on chairmen of all Senate committees, in considering and ruling on the application of the sub judice principle, to have regard to, and follow, the accepted and proper approach to this principle as enunciated by successive Presidents of the Senate and established in practice by the Senate over the years; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) notes that any other approach may lead, intentionally or otherwise, to the stifling of proper inquiries, and would allow parliamentary inquiry and debate to be suppressed simply by the issue of a writ.</PARA>

<PARA> (ii) that, before becoming the site of a brewery, the subject land was documented by the first settlers of Perth as an important site for the Aborigines and, in 1833, was reserved `to the service of the natives' according to a notice published in the Perth Gazette, and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) with concern that the Dowding State Government has failed to consult effectively with opponents of redevelopment, both Nyungah and Wadjellah (`white' Australians);</PARA>

<PARA> (b) recommends that, rather than pursuing economic salvation through property speculation and megalithic tourist developments, the Federal Government should seek a compromise with the State Government so that some of this land can be allocated for the construction of a modern and sweet-smelling sewage treatment plant which the NSW Government would be unwillingly compelled to construct; and</PARA>

<PARA> (iii) that food aid constitutes $117.1 million of the overall total of just over $1 billion, and that to get this figure in some perspective, Australians spent $560 million on pet food in the last year, and probably more than we spend on food aid in dieting and trying to get rid of excess weight;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pursuant to contingent notice of motion, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Chaney moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely, a motion to give precedence over all other business to the Notice of Motion given this day relating to the establishment of a select committee. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to speak briefly to the motion although I understand that it will be carried by the Senate. On 3 October I gave notice of a similar motion-a somewhat shorter motion-to establish a select committee which would examine matters relating to airline safety during the current dispute. Two days later some documents appeared in the press-they were also provided to the Opposition and were tabled in the Senate and I think in the other place-which indicated that, within the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), senior officers have very deep concerns about the administration of safety requirements during the currency of this dispute. The statements that were made in those reports were pretty stark and included comments such as:</PARA>
<PARA>We had a basic duty to our employer, the public, to maintain standards and this area I believe we have been totally inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> I indicated to the Government that it was the Opposition's intention to seek to bring on the motion. Indeed, the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) publicly indicated that he would like some time to consider the matter and that he would not oppose the matter being brought on for debate on the following Friday. Pursuant to his intervention, Senator MacGibbon and I met with the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Willis) and him to discuss the Opposition's proposal for a select committee. During the course of those discussions it was clear that Minister Willis was very strongly opposed to a committee. But we had what I thought appeared to be a more rational and reasonable response from Senator Ray who made the suggestion that, rather than proceed to a select committee, the estimates of the Department of Transport and Communications and the Civil Aviation Authority should be resubmitted to Estimates Committee B so that there could be some parliamentary examination of the issues which have been raised. One of the reasons which were put forward for making that alternative suggestion was that this would be less likely to cause alarm and concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I think, in a broad sense, that would be a fair description of the discussion we had. As a result, the Opposition agreed to stand back from its original proposal to enable the Estimates Committee to be reconvened and for officials to be questioned about the matters which had been raised, in particular the very specific concerns raised by the officers of the Civil Aviation Authority itself. But I stress that a series of other matters had also come through the press and other sources relating to concerns about operational standards and safety. </PARA>
<PARA> When I inquired last week of the senators participating in the Estimates Committee as to how that had proceeded, I was given a very negative response. It was suggested to me--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The bellowing of Senator Ray is very different from what I thought was the very rational and sensible approach that he adopted in the meeting that we held. When I said I was going to bring this matter on he responded by way of interjection, `You got done like a dinner on the Committee'. Let us just pause at that point. We are dealing with a matter of airline safety and the Opposition's concerns about the standards which have been produced. The Government is treating this as some sort of bovver boy contest. Senator Collins came in with his bovver boots and proceeded to intimidate the Committee and the witnesses and generally carried on like a larrikin and a lout. That was the response of Government senators to what I understood to be a proper attempt to examine the concerns which have been raised. I will be very happy to expand on my concerns when I move the motion that I gave notice of this morning. Suffice it to say that I do not believe that anybody--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I get interjections such as, `They ran out of questions'. Anyone who carefully reads the Hansard will find that Senator Bolkus continually drew up questioners, as though he were in the chair, on the basis that matters had already been canvassed. They had been canvassed by dint of Senator Collins and, to a lesser extent Senator Schacht, giving evidence to the Committee. It was the most absurd demonstration of senators acting not as inquirers but as givers of evidence. I will read some of the Hansard into the record because here we have the agent for the airlines and the agent for the Civil Aviation Authority, Senator Collins, not seeking the public interest and seeking to establish whether there are concerns to be allayed, but acting as an advocate and a witness. There are serious matters which touch on the question of airline safety. The Estimates Committee was a gross abuse of parliamentary procedures and a total stepping back from the basis on which the Opposition agreed to follow this procedure rather than have a select committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

The difficulty is that this Hansard is so riddled with the improprieties of Senator Collins and Senator Schacht that it would be impossible to analyse it all in the space of one speech.

<PARA> The serious issue which has been raised is whether there has been a reduction in the safety standards which are applied to the aviation industry, whether there has been a shortening or a change of procedures under the pressure of this dispute. That is a matter which we are determined to see examined. We are also happy to have a number of the other issues which arise in this dispute examined. We are happy to have the nature, extent and legality of the compensation arrangements examined by a committee. We have very serious doubts about the legality of what the Government is doing as well as its propriety. We are happy to have the economic implications of this dispute examined. I suspect that some of Senator Collins's constituents are bleeding rather more than Senator Collins at this stage from the prolongation of this dispute and the incapacity of the airlines to deliver the services required to the people of Australia. I commend this suspension motion. I believe that we should carry it quickly and move to debate the issue of substance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not take any longer than Senator Chaney in expressing my opposition to the suspension of Standing Orders. The first thing to be said about this particular matter is that it is a no confidence motion in the Senate committee system. This is a quite different motion from the motion which Senator Chaney moved on another occasion, which was more inclined towards the select committee route than the standing committee route. This is a more comprehensive inquiry. We have a standing committee, yet we cannot refer these broad terms of reference to a standing committee. One has to ask why. It could be a vote of no confidence in standing committees. I guess that from time to time we have all shared sentiments that a standing committee does not necessarily provide the best possible route to get an answer to an inquiry, but it does raise the question: Why have all these standing committees covering these areas? We have the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure covering this area. It has a cast of thousands because it has got an extra inquiry. Something we should consider in the suspension of Standing Orders is that we are not going the standing committee route and, therefore, there must be something wrong with the standing committees. It must be remembered that we have 76 senators and something like 30-odd Senate committees running at the moment when we include Estimates committees, standing committees and select committees. We are adding an extra committee every two or three months. I do not know where that leaves the Independents. They cannot possible cover all these committees that may be of interest to them, although I know how hard some of them try. So the first thing is that it is a no confidence motion in the standing committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, and at least I appreciate that Senator Chaney did not allege that we went the Estimates committee route to deliberately obstruct-I should put on the record why I supported going the Estimates committee route. It was not simply that there would be a lot of publicity attached to a select committee. I made the point-and I think it was a fair one-that one of the problems with the committee system, whether a standing committee or a select committee, is that all the allegations are made up front. One tends to get all the witnesses in with a gripe or an allegation. They are all made up front, and they are made under immense publicity. When the defence comes two or three weeks later, that does not get coverage. The advantage I saw in the Estimates committee approach is that each allegation could be answered as we went along. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think I made any secret of the fact that this was not going to be a normally reconvened Estimates committee where the Opposition has 13 hours of questioning all by itself like it normally does, that it was not going to be Little Big Horn all over again at the Estimates Committee. We also saw on our side of politics a necessity for close questioning on some of these issues, especially as leaked allegations had been made by certain officers of that department-not necessarily by those who had written the documents. It was always going to be a fairly robust affair. </PARA>
<PARA> We also had someone-someone not present here-strutting around the day before saying that his fax machine was overloaded with allegations. It was not as big a beat-up as Senator Tambling gave for the original Estimates Committee considering the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, but there was a bit of strutting on his side of the stage about all having these allegations. They were related not just to the two documents but to all the other questions that had been asked at Question Time. Basically the Opposition's side of politics, having peddled those at Question Time, having pushed them time and time again, could not substantiate them at the Estimates Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have now is not just an inquiry into air safety-because if Senator Chaney had put that up today, I suspect it would have been defeated in this chamber. Senator Chaney-I think it is a clever move-has picked up Senator Sanders's notice of motion from two or three weeks ago. He has not picked it up word for word because that would be a dent to his pride, but he has picked up the basic tenets of that motion to incorporate it all into one motion. That is why we have this motion to suspend Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA> The biggest joke about this motion is found at the very start. It says, `. . . report, not later than the last sitting day of November 1989'. We have heard the great promises of the world-`The cheque's in the mail', `I will respect you tomorrow morning', `Private polls in our marginal seats show . . .'-but this has to be one of the biggest promises in history. Does--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was coming to that. Does Senator Chaney realistically expect this committee to report by the end of November? It suggests that he is going to have a quick cheapie inquiry with virtually no advertising for witnesses, remembering that everyone will be stuck here all bar two weeks of November and maybe a couple of days this week. Senator Chaney should be saying to us today that he also intends the Committee to sit during sitting hours, because I do not see how on earth he can possible get an inquiry done without sitting during sitting hours. Or is it going to sit for only a couple of days in November and write up a quick report? Senator Chaney, by way of interjection, asks whether I have heard of extensions. I might as well acknowledge now that we will support an extension to the end of January-because that is how long it is going to take.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Chaney indicated that the numbers are here to carry the suspension of Standing Orders. I oppose it basically because it is politically motivated. Throughout this whole pilots dispute the coalition has never known where it stood. Occasionally it likes to oppose a trade union movement, unless their gross income is less than $50,000 a year, and then some magic moment occurs: If it is the doctors, the pharmacists or the pilots, suddenly it has to get in and support them. Senator Chaney said that the behaviour of Labor Party members at the Estimates Committee was disgraceful. It was nowhere near as disgraceful as some of the cheap questions that have been asked in this chamber, which were never checked or verified-`chuck the allegation out and let it have a run'. When the Opposition had a chance to test it at the Estimates Committee-99 per cent of its claims could have been tested in the Estimates Committee--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) That, a select committee be appointed, to be known as the Senate Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Airline Pilots' Dispute, to inquire into and report, not later than the last sitting day of November 1989, on:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the nature, extent and legality of all changes to training, licensing, administration, employment and other organisational and operational practices during the pilots' dispute relevant to the operation of airline services in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the extent to which air safety may have been affected by any such changes;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the nature, extent and legality of the compensation arrangements entered into by the Government and the airlines;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the economic implications of the dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) That the provisions relating to the powers and membership of the Committee be contained in a subsequent resolution. </PARA>
<PARA>I have already outlined the history of this matter and the fact that on 3 October we gave notice of a motion seeking the establishment of a select committee which was solely concerned with the issue of airline safety. Some time later, on 6 October, Senator Sanders gave notice of a motion which related to the events and issues which led to the airlines dispute and the most appropriate actions in the best interests of the country to bring the dispute to a just and speedy conclusion. In light of the comments made by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) about the change of form of the new motion we are putting forward today-which encompasses the issues of safety, compensation and the economic implications of the dispute-let me say that the Opposition's concern about the Australian Democrats' original proposal was that we believed we should not establish a Senate committee which in effect was a mini-industrial relations commission. I discussed that matter with Senator McLean of the Democrats and subsequently with Senator Sanders. We now have a motion which I think has the support of both the Opposition and the Australian Democrats. It picks up the vital issue of safety, some of the broader economic questions and the legality of the extraordinary arrangements which the Government has entered into with respect to compensation. </PARA>
<PARA> In moving for the suspension of Standing Orders I canvassed the concession which was offered by the Opposition with respect to this proposal when we said that the matter could be considered by the Estimates Committee. We saw that as a reasonable response to the concerns that were expressed by Senator Ray that this matter should not be dealt with in what I might term a flamboyant way which might cause alarm. We went along with that and the Estimates Committee sat last Wednesday. </PARA>
<PARA> The object of an Estimates committee is to enable Ministers to appear before a Senate committee to be questioned and to call upon public servants to make available information and evidence to the Parliament. That procedure has been developed over a period of 15 to 20 years. It is a valuable variation on the general parliamentary committee system and permits evidence to be given by public servants to assist the Parliament to do its job. It is a different sort of procedure from the operation of a normal select committee where witnesses come forward, give their evidence and are subsequently questioned. In the case of an Estimates committee the evidence is given, effectively, by the Minister or such public servants as he designates. That is one part of the concern that the Opposition has about this Estimates Committee hearing-that the limitations of that process were used by the Minister to limit questioning of relevant public servants on issues which had been raised, including those raised by those public servants themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me take the Senate through parts of this record. One of the most notable and extraordinary features of this record is that the principal witness before the Senate Estimates Committee was Senator Collins. Senator Collins adopted a role which was quite extraordinary, when he was supposed to be there as a senator inquiring into this matter. I invite honourable senators to look at the opening pages of the record of what happened at the Estimates Committee. When questions were being asked of a Dr Lee about incident reports and accident notifications, we find Senator Collins breaking in and saying this:</PARA>
<PARA> Fine. I noted Senator Panizza's claims that Royal Brunei crews had, in fact, exceeded their approved operational times and out of a healthy degree of self-interest, as a regular passenger on Royal Brunei Airline, I spoke to a number of Royal Brunei crews myself. I also spoke to the senior operations officer within Ansett-</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate to say that throughout this inquiry it was clear where Senator Collins was getting his information, advice and, for all I know, instructions from, because he was always coming back to the Committee and telling it what he had been told. Let me go with what Senator Collins said. The report continues as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>I also spoke to the senior operations officer within Ansett responsible for scheduling and supervising the Royal Brunei operations. The story I got from both sources was absolutely consistent even though I spoke to them independently. </PARA>
<PARA> The senior Royal Brunei pilot I spoke to was British to his bootstraps, an ex-RAF Harrier pilot et cetera-just one of these horribly unqualified pilots flying in our air space at the moment, according to the Federation. He was absolutely stiff upper lip, plum in the mouth Oxford accent, the whole bit. He told me he was horrified at such a suggestion because-and perhaps you can confirm this information-Royal Brunei operates under British regulations and the equivalent of the CAA in Great Britain and they have a very strict company procedure. </PARA>
<PARA> This was confirmed by the Ansett manager . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I could go on reading the evidence of Senator Collins because when he was challenged later by Senator Brownhill-when he finally got a question in-who said that Senator Collins had been talking for two hours, Senator Collins said, `No, only for 45 minutes'. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that if one reads this Hansard one finds that Senator Collins, who likes to come into this Senate and accuse the Opposition of being the agents of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, has made it patently clear that he spent his time obtaining evidence and then choosing to make whatever evidence he thought suited him available to this Committee. What an absurd way to suggest that a parliamentary committee should proceed. All we have had is Senator Collins as a witness. He reminds me of my first experience of a public servant. Was Senator Collins ever a public servant?</PARA>

He walked into court, stood at the bar table as a would-be prosecutor of this unfortunate woman and proceeded to read from his file the facts which, he said, justified taking her children from her. As I read this account I was reminded of the habits of that public servant and of how ridiculous it is to inquire into a matter when the evidence is given by a member of the Committee itself. It was a farce. For hour after hour during the sittings of this Committee Senator Collins and Senator Schacht were not seeking evidence, not asking questions and making inquiries, but giving evidence to the Committee and seeking to overbear and override the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

On the face of this record it is quite clear that there was a concerted and planned action to abort the procedures which were suggested by the Government to avoid the select committee procedure which was originally suggested by the Opposition.

I do not know how widely Senator Schacht and Senator Collins conspired with the Minister and with the airlines.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, all that I can say is that on the face of this record it is quite clear that Senator Collins spent all of his time getting his instructions from the airlines. The Opposition says that this is a totally unsatisfactory procedure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter which made this procedure totally unsatisfactory was the abuse of the sub judice rule. The record shows that all of a sudden Senator Collins explained to the Committee that legal proceedings have been commenced, perhaps have been commenced or perhaps will be commenced. If one wants an indication of the linkages between Senator Collins and those we are seeking to examine, one need only note that he came into the Committee and told us that legal proceedings are probably to be commenced. From that point on we find a limitation in the capacity of the Senate Committee to inquire into these facts. The idea that the mere threat of legal proceedings should restrict the capacity of the Parliament to examine the problems of airline safety is absolutely preposterous. It is patently absurd to suggest that it is in the public interest to prevent in the name of sub judice the relevant public servants being asked questions about the operational and safety procedures that they have challenged. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is-and we find it on the face of this record-that a most restrictive approach was adopted. Senator Collins is guilty of the most appalling inconsistency. He insisted that the sub judice rule be applied. But after he had been outside the Committee for a while, he came back and proceeded to ask a whole series of questions in total contravention of the view that he had previously put. So there was the selective use of the sub judice rule by the Labor members of this Committee to prevent proper inquiries into a matter of public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that it has never been a parliamentary rule of this chamber, any more than it has been a rule of public debate for the newspapers, that the mere existence of legal proceedings is enough in itself to prevent questioning. There are ample Senate rulings which show that a judgment has to be made on the facts of the individual case. In any event, the mere threatened issue of a writ cannot give rise to the rule. The Clerk of the Senate offered his oral advice to the Chairman of the Committee, which was ignored by him. The Clerk of the Senate offered his written advice, which is part of the record of this Committee. Again, it was ignored by the majority of this Committee. I would simply say that it was the most absurd attempt to stifle inquiry into matters which are of vital public interest. If one asks any citizen whether an inquiry into airline safety standards should be aborted by the issue of stop writs, the answer would be a resounding no. Yet these bovver boys, these bully boys, used that rule to their advantage to cut off questioning which they did not approve of by Opposition senators and totally ignored the rules. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Collins says, `Rubbish'. The face of the record is clear: Senator Collins played a pathetic, bullying role as an agent for the airlines and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). He should be condemned for his part in this whole exercise. It was a pathetic failure by him to live up to his public responsibilities. It is quite clear that in this case the sub judice rule was abused to prevent a proper examination of those officials except when it suited Senator Collins who, having raised the sub judice rule, then turned around and ignored that same provision when he wished to question the officers at the table.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have a clear admission from the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) about the pressures which were being put upon people because of the issue of writs. I quote from what Senator Bolkus said during the inquiry:</PARA>
<PARA>The reason I went up to Mr Segan was in recognition of the fact that we were skating on very thin ice at that moment and I wanted to let him know that if at any stage he was concerned about his legal rights he could just ask for a short adjournment. I am very sensitive to the fact that we have before us a rather intimidating situation, whether you people realise it or not. </PARA>
<PARA>The man who is being intimidated is Mr Segan, one of the public servants who have said that there is a serious problem with safety standards as they are being administered by the Civil Aviation Authority. We find in the Senate record, brought out by Senator Brownhill in his questioning, another allegation of intimidation. Senator Brownhill referred to a public claim by a Captain Grady that he had been offered a job but had said that he had not flown for 20 years and would need almost a month of training to become proficient again, but was told that he would be flying in two days and so on. </PARA>

In a matter which should not be subject to the argy-bargying which is going on in the chamber now and which was subject to the same argy-bargying in the Senate Estimates Committee, when there should be a clear public interest concern on all sides of the chamber for a proper examination of the facts, there has been a highly partisan approach by Government senators and an attempt to suppress the facts. That, I think, is the only interpretation that can be placed upon this record of the Estimates Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Collins expresses great dismay and boredom-a whole range of emotions-as I make these comments. I do not believe that at any previous time in the history of the Senate a government senator would have engaged in the conduct in which Senator Collins engaged before the Committee. He has appeared as a partial advocate for particular interests. He has given evidence rather than been a person who has examined the available evidence. He has chosen to act as a conduit for evidence from other areas. Senator Collins will now be able to ensure that evidence can be given directly to the Senate instead of this abuse of procedures at last Wednesday's hearing of which, I suspect from his interjections, he was the principal architect. The Opposition believes that this is a serious matter which is of concern to many Australians, particularly those who have to use the airlines to travel, or those who are able to do so. In those circumstances we believe that the only proper course is for a Senate select committee to be established. </PARA>
<PARA> Before a Senate select committee, witnesses will have an opportunity of coming forward and giving their evidence without interference from Senator Collins or Senator Schacht, or indeed a Minister at the table or a chairman. They will have a chance to make their submissions and then be questioned properly. In putting forward the proposal for a select committee, I accuse the Government of having engaged in a systematic rorting of the Senate Estimates Committee in an attempt to intimidate people and to prevent facts from being examined. The Opposition will not tolerate that. It will therefore participate in the proposed committee and ensure that it gets to the truth as soon as possible. </PARA>

It is crippling the country. We have to do something about it. As senators, we must make every effort to use our offices, whatever they are, to resolve this dispute. Whatever we can do we should be doing. The Senate committee system is a possible forum for resolutions of disputes. Certainly, the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare acted for years as a clearing house for information, as an agency which could hear all points of view, which could give the protection of parliamentary privilege to all points of view. That Committee and others-it is that Committee I am familiar with-arrived at a consensus amongst all participants on a workable solution. That is what I think a committee of well intentioned people could do in the case of the airline pilots dispute. I know I am naive, but I would like to see such a committee operate in an honest and a non-political way. I think we are adult enough in this place to do this and I would like to do it.

<PARA> One of the problems we have had in this entire dispute-and we have it constantly-is the way the media interprets what we are saying, what we are doing or what the situation is. I think that a Senate select committee on the airline pilots dispute-and honourable senators will note that the proposed committee is to inquire into certain aspects of the dispute, not aviation safety-could focus the media's attention on the real issues so that they do not go haring off after sensational issues to the jeopardy of the real, basic issues which we need to cover. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a commitment to aviation. I have been in the aviation industry for 40 years. I have been a commercial pilot and a flight instructor. I believe in what aviation can do for the country. At the moment it is crippled. Air safety is just one consideration. There are many others. That is why we wanted this reference broadened, to include the economic implications of the dispute on everyone: on the tourist industry, on the rest of the workers in the airline industry, on all the companies and businesses that depend on rapid air transport around this country, and on the airline pilots themselves. Certainly they are suffering. Many are making agonising decisions about their futures. What seems to be happening now is that Sir Peter Abeles has moved into this dispute, seeing a grand opportunity presented to him by the pilots to streamline his organisation in preparation for deregulation and to get a generally more compliant staff, a group of pilots who will do what Sir Peter Abeles wants. This is one thing I think we should look at. Sir Peter Abeles is a very capable businessman but he is ending up in a position of tremendous power in our transport industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a good point. The Senate Standing Committee on Transport and Infrastructure is already overloaded. The honourable senator knows it and I know it. If we referred this matter to that Committee what would it do to the rest of the Committee's references? It would not be able to operate. That is why we need a Senate select committee. I do not accept the argument that simply because a committee exists with that name it can take on this reference. It cannot.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Air safety is one consideration which has been pretty well answered. As a professional pilot, I see the arguments. I have heard the response to the arguments. I am satisfied in my own mind that, while some incidents deserve looking at, in the overall sense airline safety has not been degraded in this dispute. I think the system is safe, as it always has been, and it has not been very degraded. Certainly there have been some instances of foreign pilots not understanding the language. I have that difficulty myself sometimes, I must admit, and some people have trouble understanding me, but it works out. An inherent buffer system is built into all of this. We in the aviation business are very safety conscious, and rightly so, but there is still room for some flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings me to another point which is of great concern to me: the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)-it has been called a number of other things in the past-is undergoing a period of great change during which the old rules and regulations which so stifled aviation in this country are being rewritten. It is actually introducing a ray of sunshine, a ray of commonsense, into its operations. If there is a great concentration on safety issues, many of which are very sensational and get a lot of press coverage, it gives the hard- liners in the CAA the opportunity to stick to their rule books and say that they will not make any changes whatsoever but will simply work to rules and therefore cover themselves. This would be a very retrograde step in Australia, which depends so much on air transport and which has been so hampered by bureaucratic red tape in the past. It is my worry that these discussions will give ammunition to the hardliners in the CAA who do not want to make changes. That is something we have to look out for and I think we can. In a Senate select committee we can make sure that the issues which are brought up are real issues and not merely propaganda. Senator Collins agrees with me and I am glad that he does. </PARA>
<PARA> The cooperation between us and the Opposition is a beneficial one. We can hear all aspects of this airline pilots dispute and hopefully furnish a forum for all parties, including the airline pilots, to have a say unfettered by the fear of writs. At the moment the writs are flying fast and every time anybody, including any CAA official or pilot, says something, a writ flies. That has a chilling effect and it means that some people who have a point of view simply cannot express it. I think in a democracy that is reprehensible. Anything we can do to make this situation more democratic, we should do. Therefore, we support the motion. </PARA>

One of the more disturbing things about the Leader of the Opposition is just how bitter and twisted he is getting these days. We all understand that that is the result of his suffering an extraordinary sense of political frustration from being in the Senate, but he should appreciate that he will not have to suffer it much longer. He will soon be in the little green room, so perhaps he could spare us a little of his bile.

We decided early in the day that Senator Alston would have been far more useful to the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A couple of things about that Estimates Committee hearing need to be said in relation to the motion this morning. It is recorded in the Hansard transcript that very early in the proceedings it was decided that in fairness to the gravity of the issue being discussed, that is, air safety, the Estimates Committee could not be conducted strictly according to the rules of Estimates committees because, were it to be conducted on those grounds, the Opposition would have been prevented from asking a single question related to the issues of air safety because the Chairman could have ruled and the Minister certainly would have ruled, as Ministers have ruled in Estimates committees, that because questions did not relate to Estimates they were out of order. I do not know how long it has been since Senator Chaney sat on an Estimates committee, but certainly in my hearing Ministers have so ruled. To nail this particular furphy to the wall, very early in the proceedings-and it is recorded in Hansard-the proposal that some degree of latitude would need to be applied was canvassed. On behalf of Opposition members, who were incapable of making any points for themselves, I made the point that, were the strict rules to be applied, the Opposition would be effectively gagged in terms of the extent to which it could canvass the issues raised in the two leaked documents, which it was slaving to do. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the matters were related to air safety and because the Opposition had been running the most appalling and contemptible scaremongering campaign, which has been brought to earth every time it has run it, it was relevant to the Estimates Committee that some of those stories put about by members of the Opposition be nailed when the opportunity was there to have the officers of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) there to nail them. That is precisely the reason that I raised that outrageous piece of nonsense perpetrated by Senator Panizza who alleged that Royal Brunei crews, who I would say would be some of the more professional of the overseas crews currently flying in Australia, were breaching regulations. The reality is different, as is the case with all the other furphies run by the Opposition. They were not breaching the regulations, and we have not since heard from Senator Panizza. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has been made of the debate on sub judice. Senator Chaney took a flying leap into space and said that I had raised the question of sub judice because the fact that writs had been issued or were likely to be issued had been leaked to me. It was leaked to me by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation national news because that is where I heard it. I said that at the Committee hearing and it can be found in the Hansard transcript. I do not need to read selectively from the Hansard transcript between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. I was at the meeting and I recall every word spoken during the entire 13 hours in which Opposition members failed to land a blow. I was there for the whole 13 hours watching as one by one the outrageous and nonsensical claims peddled by the Opposition were nailed to the ground. The result was that the members of the press-our show was the only show in Parliament House that day-were there for the entire proceedings. That is the reason we have this motion before us today. I did not realise until Senator Chaney obliged me this morning by retailing it that that was a view put in private this morning by Senator Robert Ray. Senator Ray, as usual, was spot on because the Opposition spent 13 hours trying to beat up the storm on air safety to the point where its behaviour became so outrageous-this will also be recorded in Hansard-that Senator Sanders turned around and with considerable anger said to Senator MacGibbon and Senator Newman that they would not get the support of the Australian Democrats for their select committee. </PARA>

<PARA> In respect of the sub judice rule-and I am happy to stand my record of parliamentary propriety alongside Senator Chaney's any day of the week, and I know which one will come out best-I happen to have a strong view that parliaments should not be cowards' castles and that parliamentary privilege should not be abused by having grossly defamatory statements-and in my non-legal opinion they are grossly defamatory statements-made about individuals canvassed before a committee of the Parliament without giving an individual the opportunity to defend himself. </PARA>
<PARA> My particular concern, to get down to specifics-no doubt it will be canvassed before the select committee and I will be happy under those circumstances to see it canvassed before that select committee-is that Mr Lewino's paper does make some very nasty personal aspersions about an individual. I am concerned about the sub judice rule, and I do not apologise for it. I will be quite honest. I did not want to see Mr Segan or Mr Lewino called to give evidence before the committee, not because I did not want the issues of air safety tested, but because of two things: firstly, the statements made about Captain Smith by Mr Lewino in his paper, whether they are true or false, are highly damaging to Captain Smith; secondly, the extent of the personal distress caused to both Mr Segan and Mr Lewino was clear. The papers that had been written for internal use inside the CAA have been used disgracefully by members of the Opposition who have no scruples at all in terms of smearing individuals in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of fact that, with the exception of Captain Smith, that was the only issue contained in either of the papers by Mr Segan and Mr Lewino that was not canvassed. I am grateful that it was not. The difficulty is that we sat for 13 hours that day. We canvassed every substantive issue that was raised by those papers. The issues were categorically refuted again and again by the senior executives of the CAA. That is important because an extremely perceptive and key question was asked of Mr Segan during those proceedings by Senator Sanders-very deliberately asked, I might add-and the answer was very revealing. The question to Mr Segan was: Do you have any problems with the regulatory changes that are being made inside the CAA and have been made since February this year-that is, well before the pilots dispute started-as a result of the review processes that have been conducted inside the CAA? Mr Segan replied-and he is entitled to reply-`Yes, I do'. I am paraphrasing him, but it is a fairly accurate account of what he said. He went on to say, `I am known as one of the more conservative officers of the Civil Aviation Authority and I do have deep concerns about the changes that are being made to streamline the regulations'. In other words-and it was a perceptive question by Senator Sanders and it is a particular interest of his--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be glad to get back to that interjection, which I thought I had already covered. We were there to discuss a grave issue. Senator Chaney keeps saying that it is a grave issue, but he does not want it canvassed. We were there to discuss the question of air safety in front of the nation's media. I have no hesitation in saying that when allegations are made of breaches of air safety-in my view, criminally made by members of the Opposition, one after the other, including the leader-when the officers of the CAA are present at a committee meeting and people want these issues canvassed, they should be. Members of the Opposition were not going to canvass these issues because it would be embarrassing to have their nonsense laid to rest, so somebody had to, and I was happy to do it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Chaney made an extraordinary point this morning in debate because I took the trouble that the Opposition has not bothered to take to go to the source of the information inside an airline to get authoritative information on the record-and I did say to the officer that the conversation was on the record-about Ansett schedules for Royal Brunei. Who else does Senator Chaney suggest that I go to except the officer in Ansett responsible for scheduling the airline operations of Royal Brunei? I had never spoken to that officer before in my life until I spoke to him on the telephone. I also spoke to Royal Brunei pilots. As a responsible member of parliament with a very keen personal interest in air safety that overrides any partisan allegiances I might have-I consider my own safety and the safety of fellow Australians a more important-I have done what the Opposition has consistently not bothered to do; that is, check the facts instead of running the fiction that is peddled to it by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. </PARA>
<PARA> If I ring an officer in Ansett Airlines of Australia who is specifically responsible for scheduling the hours that Royal Brunei pilots fly in Australia and I tell him that the conversation is a matter of record and that it is not a private conversation, that I am seeking information that I will put on the public record, it is not unreasonable to think that that officer will give me an accurate answer. I do not apologise for wanting to seek the truth. Senator Chaney, of course, is frightened of it and does not want it sought out. If that is called a leak from an airline, I suggest to Senator Chaney, with great respect, that he is drawing a very long bow indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I also say to Senator Chaney that I did not stop there. I tried to contact officers such as Mr Scaife from the CAA, and I failed, I regret to say. I rang the CAA office in Perth where he works, was referred to Canberra; rang the office in Canberra and was referred to Melbourne; rang Melbourne and was referred back to Canberra. When I spoke to officers in Canberra, they referred me back to Melbourne and the officers there said that Mr Scaife had gone off sick. I tried to contact Mr Scaife to inform myself about these issues. Why did I do so? Because Mr Scaife was mentioned in Mr Lewino's document as having made serious allegations about a particular pilot in terms of repeated breaches of the rules and I wanted to ask Mr Scaife whether that particular matter contained in the papers would stand up. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not apologise for trying to seek information. I think it is incumbent on responsible members of this Parliament that they do so and that they deal with the facts instead of the fiction, which is what the Opposition has been dealing with. I did make a number of statements to the Committee on information that I possessed which, clearly, no other member of the Committee possessed. In terms of the debate on air safety it was useful to have those matters aired publicly. But the issue that I raised that has upset the Opposition and really got Senator MacGibbon and Senator Newman going was the question of breaches of CAA regulations by the President of the Air Pilots Federation, Mr Brian McCarthy. That was absolutely relevant. When I raised that matter the Opposition members went into an absolute fit and almost bit their legs off trying to stop me canvassing it. I think one of the most amusing outbursts all day was when Senator MacGibbon got on his high horse and said how outrageous it was that I was obviously retailing this information from leaked documents. He said it: it is in the Hansard. It killed us on the Government side, considering the fact that he has been running on nothing but leaked documents from the Federation for the last eight weeks of this dispute.</PARA>
<PARA> On the question of sub judice, in terms of canvassing the views of the Clerk, which are views I take into account whenever they come my way, I pointed out-it also happens to be a little hobbyhorse of mine, too-that the chairmen of committees make rulings and not the Clerk of the Senate, as erudite as his advice must be. The Chair makes the rulings. In fact, it really annoys me that constant air time is given in this chamber-it was always ruled out of order in the chamber that I came from in the Northern Territory-when the views of the Clerks at the table are canvassed at length as being reasons why the Senate should do this, that or the other. Usually, their advice is supposed to be provided in confidence. Senator MacGibbon went so far as to say-this is also recorded in the Hansard-that our esteemed Clerk of the Senate was a member of the Senate. The comment I made to Chris Schacht was that that would probably have caused Harry Evans to break out in a cold sweat had he heard it. Apart from anything else, it would probably have confirmed all his worst nightmares.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that my concerns about sub judice were related very much to two officers of the CAA being questioned about papers, containing highly personal reflections on individuals, that neither of the officers clearly intended to see the light of day; I have no difficulty in accepting the assurances they gave on those points. They were clearly embarrassed at having those papers canvassed because of the highly personal remarks contained certainly in one of them. The relevance of raising the matter, and it is a serious matter, of the President of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, the Ayatollah McCarthy, was that he gives interviews to the press every day-he has done it again this morning-on safety issues. He has run a stream of allegations publicly about breaches of air safety regulations in Australia, and the Federation has peddled a bucket load of nonsense to members of the Opposition, which they have run in here without question. Yet, with impunity, Brian McCarthy seems to think that the CAA regulations do not apply to him. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the ire of the Opposition was raised, not by the comments I made earlier in the day about sub judice or anything else, but by the information that I had no hesitation in placing before the Committee about breaches of CAA regulations that had been committed by Brian McCarthy. If honourable senators do not think that flying an aircraft which you are not endorsed to fly is a substantive breach of air safety regulations, I do not know what is. In fact, the pilot, Mr Vuillerman, who took the heat off Brian McCarthy-it was very brave of him, I must say-was a former senior pilot with Australian Airlines. He lost his licence for a fortnight as a result not just of this one breach but half a dozen breaches of CAA regulations. That upset the Opposition dreadfully. </PARA>
<PARA> Having canvassed all of that, the reality is that we sat that day for 13 hours, with the sole exception--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Newman" NAMEID="BE4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to that interjection, the fact is that I consider Senator Brownhill to be one of the more reasonable and civilised members of the Opposition and, because he conducted himself with some degree of propriety, I was happy to sit and listen, without making a single interjection, to him put at the Committee hearing every single question that he wanted to put, one after the other. We sat for 13 hours and every single question that Opposition members of that Committee wanted asked was asked. We adjourned at 11 o'clock. It will be borne out by reference to the Chairman of the Committee, the Minister at the table, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray), or to any other Government member of the Committee that, had it been necessary to have done so to accommodate the Opposition, we would have sat for the entire night. We would have had no problems with that. To sit for 36 hours straight is no problem for me. We have done it in here plenty of times. When it is necessary, we will do it. The last 10 or 12 pages of Hansard will show, and I recall clearly, that the Opposition had absolutely run out of puff at that hour of the day. The press gallery had departed hours before because most of the substantive issues had been canvassed early in the day and the press realised there was nothing in them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We sat and listened to the allegations from Senator MacGibbon about the outrageous episode concerning the British Aerospace (BAe) check captains checking out international pilots on 146 aircraft. Those allegations were knocked to earth. We listened once again to the nonsense that Senator MacGibbon ran in here about airliners colliding over the city of Sydney because of alleged breaches of air safety regulations by French pilots. That allegation was nailed to the ground not just by the CAA but also by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation officers who confirmed that the pilots had committed no breaches, had flown perfectly, had lodged a flight plan that had been approved and had stuck to it. If any errors were made, they were made elsewhere-not by the pilots. But we sat and listened to all of that. </PARA>
<PARA> I questioned the other officer from the CAA, Mr Segan, about an opening statement he had made in his paper to the effect that the CAA's supervision of air safety in Australia was `totally inadequate'. Mr Segan said on the public record that that was a piece of journalistic licence. I did not say it was journalistic licence; Mr Segan did. As anyone who was present at the hearings will attest, both Mr Lewino and Mr Segan, despite the fact that they were clearly uncomfortable about internal documents containing many personal aspersions about individuals being canvassed publicly, acquitted themselves very capably before the Committee. What was the result? How did the press report Mr Segan's comments in his paper about the CAA's adherence to air safety being totally inadequate? How did they treat his comments about the BAe check captains? That should be briefly canvassed. As I said to Mr Segan at the table, he was very good at sweeping statements in that paper. He had asserted that there was--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Newman was obviously at some other committee hearing. Mr Segan said that his remarks about the totally inadequate supervision of air safety were journalistic licence. In addition, Mr Segan said that there was `absolutely no evidence whatever that the BAe check captains knew anything about the company's operations manuals'. When Mr Segan was confronted with the information that not only did they know about them but they had participated in writing them, his response was, `That information was not available to me when I wrote my paper'. On four occasions four very substantive and serious allegations made by Mr Segan in that paper were qualified by him totally in evidence before the Committee and Mr Segan went on to say that he had considerable problems with the overhauling of regulations inside the CAA.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have another concern about the way Mr Segan and Mr Lewino were dragged before the Estimates Committee by the Opposition. If there is one organisation in Australia that needs a healthy degree of internal dissent and internal questioning, it has to be the CAA. Who raised questions of witch-hunting? Was there even the slightest suggestion of it on the part of the CAA? Was there ever a suggestion of it by members of the Government? No. But who canvassed it again and again at the Estimates Committee in front of the officers concerned? Senator Newman and Senator MacGibbon did. They made disgraceful remarks in front of those officers about the potential for witch-hunting and for the officers' heads to roll as a result of their appearing before the Estimates Committee. The whole issue of witch-hunting was a creation of the Opposition. Those Opposition senators displayed disgraceful behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point that I hope that, of all the authorities in Australia, the CAA and the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation will continue to have a very healthy degree of internal questioning, whether by memos, orally or in any other way, about what they do and how they operate. What was obvious that day was that the outrageous statements by the Opposition about head-hunting and having internal documents leaked from the CAA are absolutely inimical to that process of internal questioning continuing. I would like to hear Opposition senators defend leaks. I would like to hear them say that leaking is a good and supportable thing. If I had to think of one pre-eminent organisation where leaks of sensitive internal documents would damage the effectiveness of that organisation more than any other, it would have to be the CAA. What officers of the CAA who have genuine, serious and heartfelt concerns-as is obvious from the papers-about disagreements they are having with the central office about air safety, which is what it is all about, would want to run the risk of being hauled before a Senate committee and being asked stupid questions by Senator Newman and Senator MacGibbon for 13 hours and of having their internal documents paraded before the media and the public? I suggest not very many. Inevitably, when officers put pen to paper in the future to express their legitimate concerns about what is going on in the CAA, they will qualify them to the extent that they will be drafting those papers as though they were public documents, which means that the value of those papers will be almost totally destroyed. That is a classic example of the great damage, to Senator Newman's delight, that leaked documents handed from-and let us trace the route again-the Victorian and Tasmanian offices of the CAA to the Air Pilots Federation and then to the Opposition and the Press Gallery can cause to the proper operation of air safety in Australia. If Opposition members were fair dinkum about air safety, they would be the first in the front line to say that those leaked documents should not see the light of day, provided that the issues that are canvassed in those documents are properly debated. </PARA>
<PARA> I make an important point in closing. Firstly, the Estimates Committee canvassed all issues that were pertinent to air safety during those 13 hours of hearing. Secondly, the Opposition asked every single question it had to ask-which is why we adjourned the Estimates Committee. It was for no other reason; the Opposition had finished. If because of their absolute inadequacy and stupidity, Opposition members who were running the debate could not nail their points, more fool them. Another relevant matter is that when the Select Committee is established and canvasses the issues that have to be canvassed--</PARA>

Every single one of the furphies they ran was shot down and brought to earth. The media quite accurately determined that, and they did not publish a bad headline. They did not get full page scaremongering stories in the press about airline disasters over Sydney. In fact, they got no press about disasters at all. That is why we are here today. That is why we are debating this motion; there is no other reason. I hope that when the Select Committee starts its work it will do so being very conscious of the fact that whatever it does has a direct bearing on air safety in Australia and that whatever it does should not prejudice that.</PARA></TALK.START>

I do not think there is any doubt that there was an opportunity for these matters to be explored in a reasonable and sensible way, and that opportunity was destroyed by the behaviour of Senator Collins. If one examines the transcript-and I have had a chance to re-read some of it since I read it last night during this debate-it will become quite clear that numerous ways were used by Senator Collins and his colleagues to prevent questions being asked. There are examples of direct intervention by Senator Collins in the middle of a line of questioning from Senator Newman. There are examples of Senator Bolkus saying that certain questions had already been answered and of his refusing to have them further explored. All in all, it was a charade last Wednesday. There was no proper examination of the concerns. There was simply an attempt by the bovver boys of the Australian Labor Party to ensure that did not occur. We had the misuse of the sub judice rule and the most extraordinarily inconsistent attitude was expressed to that rule, particularly, again, by Senator Collins.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think this debate needs to be prolonged. I simply affirm that in the view of the Opposition there is an obligation on the Parliament to ensure that the concerns, which have been raised not just by officials of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, as Senator Collins would have us believe, but from within the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), are properly examined. The Committee will have the jurisdiction to look at some of the wider questions which arise with respect to this dispute. I remind the Senate that the original proposition which was put forward by the Opposition was for a Senate inquiry which would examine the implications for Australia's outstanding record of aviation safety of any changes to procedures or regulations introduced since the commencement of the pilots dispute, and also reports of mistakes or breaches of normal operational standards. The motion which has been moved today is totally consistent with that. We are seeking an inquiry into, firstly, the nature, extent and legality of all changes to training, licensing, administration, employment and other organisational and operational practices during the pilots dispute relevant to the operation of airline services in Australia and, secondly, the extent to which air safety may have been affected by any such changes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats originally sought an inquiry into the events and issues which led to the dispute. That, of course, has been dropped from the proposal. The Australian Democrats were suggesting an inquiry into `the most appropriate actions, in the best interests of the country, to bring the dispute to a just and speedy conclusion'. I make it clear again that the Opposition does not regard a Senate committee as a substitute for an arbitration commission, nor does it see Senate committees as normally having a place in the settling of industrial disputes. I note what was said by Senator Sanders in his support of the motion, and his hope that this Committee might assist in the resolution of the dispute. If it ensures that the activities of the Government and the Authority are subject to proper scrutiny, it may well contribute to that outcome. I commend the motion, and I look forward to bringing into the Senate a motion relating to the powers and membership of the Committee which I will seek to move, if possible, later today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this stage there has been a change in the Opposition batting order. It will be my responsibility to continue the debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill and related Bills on behalf of my colleague Senator Peter Baume. As the Committee would be aware, currently seven Opposition amendments-numbered 101 to 106-are outstanding. It is not our intention to move any of these amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say by way of explanation that amendment No. 101 was consequential upon the passage of an earlier amendment. That earlier amendment having been defeated, the consequential amendment No. 101 is no longer necessary and, for that reason, we will not proceed to move it. The Opposition still believes that amendments Nos 102 to 106 would improve the legislation. However, both the Government and the Australian Democrats have indicated to us that they will not be agreeing to them. In order to save the time of the Committee, it is not our intention, therefore, to press those amendments or to argue them. My colleague Senator Peter Baume has already canvassed in his earlier remarks the fundamental issues which have been raised in these amendments. Therefore, I simply indicate to the Committee that it is for those reasons that we do not propose to proceed further with the outstanding amendments which were circulated in the name of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA> Page 72, after clause 190, insert the following new clause in Part 4:</PARA>
<PARA>Telephone access to ATSIC offices</PARA>
<PARA> ``190a. The Commission shall make provision for the development of a service which will enable a person to make a telephone call to the nearest regional office of the Commission at no greater cost than the cost of a local telephone call.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment relates to the provision of a 008 number for people wishing to contact any of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) offices. The original amendment, as circulated, would have enabled people to make a call to the General Manager. This would have involved making a call from anywhere in Australia, presumably to Canberra, where the General Manager would be sited. That amendment has now been modified to provide that a 008 call can be made only to the nearest regional office. </PARA>
<PARA> This general matter of the provision of 008 numbers for government offices has been debated at some length on several previous occasions. I simply make the point here that, in relation to ATSIC, we are dealing with some of the most disadvantaged people in the Australian community. If any government department or instrumentality should provide this sort of service for potential clients and inquirers the ATSIC mechanism should. </PARA>
<PARA> On a number of occasions Government and Opposition senators have indicated in their speeches that the involvement of Aboriginal people with ATSIC from its inception will, to a large extent, determine its success or otherwise. In a previous speech in this committee stage, I pointed out that if a small number of Aboriginal people begin to be involved with ATSIC it is quite likely that the bulk of Aboriginal people will see ATSIC as irrelevant to their needs and the number of people involved will fall. On the other hand, if a large number of people begin to be involved with ATSIC, are involved in the election processes and so on, the number of people will increase as the Aboriginal people will then see ATSIC as highly relevant to their needs, and ATSIC will be the considerable success which we all hope it will be. It is for those reasons that the Australian Democrats have moved the amendment that the Commission should make this telephone facility available for people to contact the nearest regional office. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has indicated in private discussion that this may be an extremely expensive operation. I venture to suggest that as it is to the nearest regional office-and we now have 60 regional councils around Australia-most of these calls are not going to be long distance calls or particularly expensive calls. For the reasons indicated, this amendment should receive the support of both the Government and the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government does not accept this particular amendment. I can see the point behind it. I do not know that it is a very satisfactory process for the Parliament to insert a mandatory requirement that a body such as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) should provide a particular service with certain budgetary implications which are indeterminate. It could be a quarter of a million dollars or half a million dollars, which is a considerable sum. I do not think Senator Coulter can say how much it will cost and I cannot say. In my submission, it is a matter which would probably be best dealt with in the ordinary Estimates process where competing bids for the provision of services by ATSIC could be looked at. This particular proposal would then be set alongside other competing proposals, and no doubt the wishes of local communities would be taken into account in deciding where the priority was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think it is a satisfactory process for the Parliament to be mandatorily insisting that this service be provided. I would have much preferred to have given an undertaking-which I would have given but I understand the Opposition is supporting Senator Coulter-for the Minister to write to the Commission, enclosing a copy of the proposal and Senator Coulter's comments in the Hansard, asking it to consider the matter in relation to the preparation of estimates. I think that would have been a way to go. It would have been more satisfactory in parliamentary and Budget preparation terms than the inclusion of this particular clause. I am not even sure of its constitutionality, but that is another matter. I have not had time to think about whether Parliament can insert a clause which requires expenditure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports the amendment of the Australian Democrats. I think it is an important principle. Senator Sheil has raised this matter on a number of previous occasions in debate. I think we need to recognise that there are a number of Commonwealth agencies and government departments that, as a matter of practice, offer this facility now, particularly in areas that relate to welfare. The provision of a 008 number provides a great deal of accessibility for people within the local areas or regions that apply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, it is important to recognise that the people who will be most dependent upon the services are Aboriginal people in many isolated and remote communities in Australia. They will have need to call on the regions and zones and the Commission itself on a number of occasions. I believe that the initiative has merit. It will provide a benefit that is appropriate, and it is consistent with the other proposals which, as I have said, Senator Sheil has raised on a number of occasions. </PARA>

Quite correctly, the preamble attached to the Bill concludes with the words `Be it therefore enacted by the Queen . . .'.

<PARA>the Australian people voted overwhelmingly to amend the Australian Constitution to provide the Parliament of the Commonwealth with power to make laws for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples,</PARA>
<PARA>(ii)</PARA>
<PARA>the people whose descendants are now known as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of Australia were the prior occupiers and original owners of this land,</PARA>
<PARA>(iii)</PARA>
<PARA>they were dispossessed by subsequent European occupation and have no recognised rights over land yet recognised by the Courts, other than those granted or recognised by the Crown,</PARA>
<PARA>(iv)</PARA>
<PARA>dispossession occurred without compensation and no serious attempt was made to reach a lasting and equitable agreement with them on the use of their land,</PARA>
<PARA>(v)</PARA>
<PARA>as a consequence of these and subsequent deprivations, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have become, as a group, the most disadvantaged in Australian society,</PARA>
<PARA>(vi)</PARA>
<PARA>it is the intention of the people of Australia to make provision for rectification, by measures referred to in legislation and such measures as are agreed by Parliament from time to time, of the consequences of past injustices and to ensure for all time that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples receive that full recognition and status within the Australian nation to which history, their prior ownership and occupation of the land, and their rich and diverse culture, fully entitle them to aspire,</PARA>
<PARA>(vii)</PARA>
<PARA>it is also the wish of the people of Australia that there be reached with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples a real and lasting reconciliation of these matters,</PARA>
<PARA>(viii)</PARA>
<PARA>it is the firm objective of the people of Australia that policies and programs be maintained and developed by the Governments of the Commonwealth, the States and Territories, that will overcome the economic and social disadvantages of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, entitle them to the enjoyment of their culture and recognition of their traditional laws wherever practicable, and enable them, with pride and dignity, to achieve full recognition and status within the Australian nation,</PARA>
<PARA>(ix)</PARA>
<PARA>it is appropriate to establish measures for the furtherance of the aforementioned objective that are consistent with the aims of self-determination and self-management for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples within the Australian nation, and</PARA>
<PARA>(x)</PARA>
<PARA>the Australian Government has given effect to its long-standing commitment to protect the rights of all of its citizens, and in particular its indigenous peoples, by recognising international standards for the protection of universal human rights and fundamental freedoms through the ratification of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and other standard-setting instruments such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenants on Economic Social and Cultural Rights and on Civil and Political Rights; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) declares that an instrument of understanding and reconciliation with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples should be negotiated by the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA>We are now debating these words as a separate motion. I wish to defend the passage of this separate motion. The Government has made it absolutely clear that the preamble in the Bill has no force in law. It has no force in law for two quite separate reasons. Firstly, for a preamble to have some force in law I understand that it is necessary for the words in the preamble in some way or other to relate to clauses in the Bill such that, in seeking clarification of a particular clause or clauses should a matter come before a court of law, the court can turn to the preamble for an explanation. In other words, there must be some nexus between the words in the preamble and a clause or clauses in the Bill. As this preamble does not contain any clauses which relate to particular clauses of the Bill the preamble has no force in law. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, it is a fact that in seeking an explanation of clauses in a Bill if a matter does come before the courts the court can turn to the second reading speech of the Minister in introducing the Bill. On both occasions when this Bill and the revoked Bill that it replaces were introduced the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) made it absolutely clear that the preamble had no force in law. As the preamble has no force in law, it seems to the Democrats that it is quite misleading, immoral and deceptive for the Government to put those words into a Bill, as part of a piece of legislation. I make the point that in months or years to come Aboriginal people and others might well pick up this Bill and, looking at those words in the preamble, be misled into believing that, because those words are very noble, significant and important, they have some force in law. For that reason it is wrong to place those words in a position where they can be misleading. </PARA>
<PARA> For both those reasons, firstly, that it has no force in law because it has no real connection with the Bill-let us remember that we are dealing with a matter that has no legal connection with this Bill; that has been made quite clear by the Minister-and, secondly, that it may be misleading to leave it in the Bill, it is appropriate that this preamble be separated from the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> My understanding of the Government's approach to the general question of the passage of some instrument of understanding, as I have called it in this motion, is that this procedure was envisaged by the Government in three stages: Firstly, the passage of a motion through both Houses of Parliament was the first matter to be dealt with in this new Parliament House when we first sat. That motion passed through both the Senate and the House of Representatives and contained words in some respect similar in intent to what we find in the preamble. The second stage which I understand that Government envisaged was the preamble to the ATSIC legislation, the matter that we are now dealing with. The Government saw that this would then lead to the third stage, which was the conclusion of a treaty, a makarrata, an instrument of understanding-it was known by a number of separate names-which would conclude a trilogy of actions leading to reconciliation and proper recognition of prior Aboriginal occupation and possession of Australia and the dispossession of Aboriginal and Islander people by European and subsequent other settlers in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for that reason that the words that I have chosen to put into proposed paragraph (b) of the modified preamble, which is now a separate motion, are that the Senate `declares that an instrument of understanding and reconciliation with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples should be negotiated by the Australian Government'. In other words, rather than leaving the preamble simply hanging in space as a nice form of words which has no force in law and which does not give any indication as to where the Government is going in this three- part approach to reconciliation, the form of words in this motion clearly presages the next stage and hopefully ties the Government into some commitment to that stage. I express the hope that this motion will also be taken up by the House of Representatives and be passed by it in complementary form, in which case paragraph (b) would read `the House of Representatives declares that an instrument . . .'. It would give to this form of words a much greater impact than they have as attached to this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> I therefore put to my fellow senators a strong plea-that they recognise that this form of words, with the different concluding clause, has considerable merit over the similar form of words attached as a preamble to the Bill. I ask the Committee to support this motion. I understand that the Opposition is opposed, possibly for similar reasons but also for some other reasons, to the inclusion of the preamble in the Bill. I suspect that the motion to remove the preamble from the Bill will be supported by the Opposition, so it is very likely that the Bill will stand without a preamble. We are now debating the words of the preamble as a separate motion, and I appeal particularly to the Government to support this motion. If that does not occur the words of the preamble disappear entirely from the business of this debate. I believe the Opposition will support the removal of the preamble but not the words of the preamble as a separate motion, whereas the Government will not support the separation of the preamble but will support the words of the preamble as a separate motion. At this stage I make a plea to the Government to support the words contained in the motion, with their different conclusions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition agrees with Senator Coulter's proposal to remove the so-called preamble from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill 1989. He is correct in saying that the preamble has no force in law. Similarly, the passage of a resolution does not have any force in law, whether it be this proposed resolution or the precedent set by the earlier Bonner resolution passed in the Senate making a declaration of Aboriginal prior ownership. A resolution is simply an expression of the view of the Parliament. My understanding is that it has no statutory effect and has no force in law, although undoubtedly judicial authorities, when they cast their eyes over extraneous material, may or may not choose to take it into account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To the extent that Senator Coulter has indicated the basic reasons for the removal of the preamble from the legislation he will have the support of the Opposition. We believe that the way in which the preamble has been handled by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) is an act of gross and malevolent tokenism and we are certainly not prepared to lend any degree of support to that. Equally I should make it clear that the Opposition opposes the passage of the proposed resolution in the form in which it is now before the Senate-that is, basically a recast version of the preamble, to which Senator Coulter has added an additional clause dealing with what he calls an instrument of understanding and reconciliation, something which has previously been referred to as makarrata, a treaty or a compact. It has been through all sorts of manifestations and we have opposed it in all of them. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to look at the precise words of the preamble and the motion and to indicate why we find both unacceptable. I shall refer to the words in the preamble rather than those in the proposed resolution. First, I refer to the opening statement:</PARA>
<PARA>WHEREAS the Australian people voted overwhelmingly to amend the Australian Constitution to provide the Parliament of the Commonwealth with power to make laws for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is only half the truth. As a result of the referendum certain words were deleted from the old section 51 (xxvi) of the Constitution which prevented the Commonwealth from making laws for people of the Aboriginal race. The old section of the Constitution said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It continued with the subclause:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . The people of any race, other than the aboriginal race in any State, for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws. </PARA>
<PARA>That prohibition was removed by the 1967 referendum. If one looks at the document prepared as part of the Yes case, which was circulated to all Australian electors on that occasion, one will see that it starts-and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>The purposes of these proposed amendments to the Commonwealth Constitution are to remove any ground for the belief that, as at present worded, the Constitution discriminates in some ways against people of the Aboriginal race . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to make the point that, by passage of this amendment, the Commonwealth would be empowered to make laws for the people of the Aboriginal race and Torres Strait Islanders. But it was primarily a device to remove a discriminatory part of the Constitution. Of course, the other part of the 1967 referendum repealed the old section 127 of the Constitution which included the prohibition on counting `Aboriginal natives', as the Constitution described them, in reckoning the numbers of the people of the Commonwealth or of a State or other part of the Commonwealth. In other words, the very first statement in the preamble is only half true. It does not reflect in its entirety the historical reality or the truth of what was done in 1967 or reflect accurately the motives which caused the Parliament to enact the legislation which was subsequently put to referendum. I object very strongly indeed to that sort of historical half-truth and misstatement. The preamble goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>AND WHEREAS the people whose descendants are now known as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of Australia were the prior occupiers and original owners of this land . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We come to the question of prior occupation and prior ownership. I object with particular force-not as a politician and member of an Opposition party but as a person whose professional qualifications are as an historian-to the misstatement of history. It says `the prior occupiers'. This is not the time for a lengthy anthropological debate about the findings at Kow Swamp or Mungo 1 but there is genuine historical doubt as to who were the prior occupiers, the original occupiers, of this land. On 1 August 1988 the Sydney Morning Herald published an article by Dr Rhys Jones, one of the most significant anthropologists and historians in Australia. In the article entitled `Exploring landscapes of the past' Dr Rhys Jones deals with the question of the fossils found at Kow Swamp, Mungo 1 and the Willandra Lakes area. He indicates that we are dealing with human remains of people who were very distant ancestors of modern Australian Aborigines. He says in part:</PARA>
<PARA>Doubtless their descendants include many of the indigenous people who now constitute the various island States and colonies of the Pacific. A great depth of time separates modern Aboriginal people from those who left the earliest traces I have described. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a real historical question here about the original occupiers and whether the people who constitute the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of today are the first rather than the second or third wave of prior occupiers of this land. </PARA>
<PARA> We then come to the question of original owners of this land. That concept is European. To my understanding, the concept is quite alien to the way in which most Aboriginal people themselves genuinely perceive the question of ownership. Later I will come to some of the evidence laid before the courts in the Milirrpum case, the original Gove land rights decision, but let me quote from a more recent example in terms of the question of ownership. I refer to an article written by Charles Perkins and entitled `Land rights, Uluru and the MCG'. In his speech in January 1984 Mr Perkins said in part:</PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginal people are of a vastly different culture to non-Aboriginal culture. Traditional Aboriginal culture is governed by a deep, spiritual affinity with the land. </PARA>
<PARA> Land to Aboriginal people is part of their being. It is not, as it is to non-Aboriginal people, a saleable commodity. </PARA>
<PARA>The whole concept of ownership is entirely alien to the way in which it is described in the preamble to the Bill we are discussing. It is an important core concept which is a central concept for Aboriginal people but it is not the same as our concept of ownership. That was the point made in the Milirrpum case. It does not imply the same consequences that the definition of the term `ownership' would for non-Aboriginal people. The introduction of that terminology in this case is totally misleading. The motion goes on as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>they were dispossessed by subsequent European occupation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is neither factual nor correct in relation to the Torres Strait Islander people. Where were the Torres Strait Islander people dispossessed by subsequent European occupation? They were not. This is another misstatement of the historical truth. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>and have no recognised rights over land yet recognised by the Courts, other than those granted or recognised by the Crown . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Nobody has those rights. The right of the ownership of land is ownership granted by the Crown. The Aboriginal people are in no sense different in that respect from Senator Tate, Senator Coulter, or recent migrants like me or whoever it happens to be. Under our system of law ownership of the land resides with the Crown. The extent to which this part of the motion is an attempt to say that some people should have rights of ownership recognised independent of the Crown, and the rest of the Australian population should have their rights of ownership recognised only as a consequence of the grant by the Crown, is, I believe, an absolute denial of the very principles of equal treatment and equal recognition that ought to apply as far as dealing with the rights of people in Australia is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The very term `occupation' is deliberately pejorative. The motion does not say `dispossessed by subsequent European settlement'. No, it says, `occupation', with all the implications of violence. Nobody denies that violence occurred, but the overwhelming majority of people who came, and who have come, to this country did not come here with the concept of being occupiers. They came here with the concept of being settlers-of improving their lives and contributing to this country. My family and I did not migrate here with the concept of being occupiers of this country. I object most vigorously, on behalf of all of those who have chosen to make this country their home, to being told by preamble or resolution that we are occupiers, with all the pejorative hatred and negative connotations that that term implies. This country has been built and developed by people who came here with goodwill, not to do harm to anybody, not to do harm to the Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people, but to participate in the growth and development of this country. To be told by Mr Hand or Senator Coulter that we are part of the `subsequent European occupation' of this country is a gross insult, and one which I reject entirely. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion continues as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>dispossession occurred without compensation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Compensation to whom? Two hundred years later we are to find people to compensate, people who themselves may have only the most tenuous and vague connections, of blood and of race. I thought that those terms went out of our concept of how to deal with people some years ago. The motion continues:</PARA>
<PARA>and no serious attempt was made to reach a lasting and equitable agreement with them on the use of their land . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is again a denial of a large part of the tradition of European history on the Australian continent of attempting to deal fairly and equitably. It does not say that inadequate attempts were made; it says, `no serious attempt was made'. All of those people who participated in the work of the churches and the missions, and all of those who, during the last 200 years, have seriously sought to find an accommodation with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, are dismissed. The motion states, `no serious attempt was made'. Again, that is a misstatement of the historical truth. It is part of the guilt-building and is a quite appalling attempt to indicate to people that somehow we ought to be generationally guilty and generationally apologetic for what has gone before. I do not accept that, and I do not believe that the majority of Australians do. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion continues:</PARA>
<PARA>as a consequence of these and subsequent deprivations . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The subsequent deprivations have had more to do not with questions of occupation, ownership and traditional relationships but with the failure to deliver proper health services, education, and proper housing services. Nobody denies that. But it is not the sort of thing to be put in a preamble or a resolution. </PARA>

<PARA>to ensure for all time that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples receive that full recognition and status within the Australian nation to which history, their prior ownership and occupation of the land-</PARA>
<PARA>that is a point upon which I have already touched-</PARA>
<PARA>and their rich and diverse culture, fully entitle them to aspire. </PARA>
<PARA>One would have thought that `full recognition and status' implies that somehow everything had been wrong, and that there had been no proper recognition of, or proper status accorded to, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Temporary Chairman, let me give one example which, undoubtedly, will be a matter of particular interest to you, and that is the question of the franchise. You will recall that the Commonwealth Constitution provided that at the time of Federation anybody who was entitled to vote in the elections for a State parliament was entitled to vote in Commonwealth elections. At the time of Federation the Aboriginal people of New South Wales were entitled to be electors. They were entitled to be on the electoral roll and, if they were on the electoral roll, they were entitled to vote, and subsequently they were subject to compulsory voting. In Victoria the electoral law provided that Aboriginal people were not denied the franchise. The only difference was that in Victoria it was not compulsory for Aboriginal people to enrol whereas it was compulsory for other people to enrol. Senator Coulter would have no objection to that; when we were talking about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) roll the other day, he found voluntary enrolment attractive. In South Australia the majority of Aboriginal people were entitled to be on the electoral roll. There was no prohibition in the States of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia of Aboriginal people being on the electoral roll, nor was there in Tasmania. In other words, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia, if they were residents of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia or Tasmania, were entitled to be electors in 1901, the time of Federation, whereas in the United Kingdom women were not entitled to the full rights of the franchise until 1928. The idea that in every respect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were not granted recognition and status, which is implicit in the words of this motion, is absolutely incorrect. Certainly they were not treated or respected in the way in which we think all people-whether they happen to be Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, new Australians or old Australians of European descent-should be treated. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion continues:</PARA>
<PARA>it is also the wish of the people of Australia that there be reached with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples a real and lasting reconciliation of these matters. </PARA>
<PARA>That is another tokenistic form of words, again unsuitable for a piece of legislation or a resolution of the Commonwealth Parliament. There is then the matter of the maintenance of Aboriginal cultural and the recognition of traditional laws `wherever practicable'. `Wherever practicable'-what weasel words they are in this respect. One only has to look at the massive two-volume report by the Australian Law Reform Commission entitled Recognition of Aboriginal Customary Laws to see the enormous difficulties inherent in that. This is a holding out of some sort of a promise, some sort of a token hope, which we know will not be recognised. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only are these difficulties raised in the Law Reform Commission report but also they are raised in a paper given by His Honour Mr Justice Kirby, the former President of the Law Reform Commission, entitled T. G. H. Strehlow and Aboriginal Customary Laws. In that paper, Mr Justice Kirby draws attention to the difficulties of recognising Aboriginal traditional law and discusses unacceptable secrecy, unacceptable substantive rules regarding kinship relationships, unacceptable punishments and unacceptable procedures. One only has to look at what the High Court of Australia said in the case of Denis Walker v. The Queen in terms of the recognition of the problems of Aboriginal traditional and customary law. One only has to look at what Mr Justice Michael Maurice said in 1985 when dealing with the Warumungu land claims. Apart from his significant warning about the role of professional anthropologists in the Northern Territory, Mr Justice Maurice, then speaking as the Aboriginal Land Commissioner, said about the matter before him:</PARA>
<PARA>There is a unitary system of law in Australia and Aboriginal people live under it. I doubt it they have any problem understanding this but I am afraid that a lot of the evidence I have heard from non-Aboriginal witnesses suggests that some of their advisers do not. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me to be wrong to put down in a preamble or a resolution that there ought to be recognition of Aboriginal traditional laws, wherever practicable, when we know that this is a vain and forlorn hope. It is not the sort of thing that ought to be held out by way of Government preamble or Democrat motion because it will not be taken seriously and acted upon by this Commonwealth Parliament or indeed, I imagine, by any other Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the addition which Senator Coulter has proposed, namely, the declaration that an instrument of understanding and reconciliation with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people be negotiated by the Australian Government. Frankly, I thought we had effectively disposed of all of these questions of treaties, compacts and makarratas; of whether a nation should make compacts or treaties within itself and between its constituent parts 200 years after the event. This is not like starting to negotiate a Treaty of Waitangi; this is 200 years later. Australians will be divided into two classes-black and white-if we say, `We now want you to make a treaty with each other'. I can think of nothing more divisive, nothing more fundamentally likely to increase tensions and divisions or to set group against group, person against person, institution against institution than a motion passed by the Commonwealth Parliament which says that we want to have an instrument of understanding and reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude with the point that I made earlier. I do not accept the philosophy of generational guilt which underlies both this preamble and this motion. What happened 150 or 200 years ago does not concern a large number of people, particularly those who migrated to this country in the post-war period. Indeed, I do not feel personally responsible for the incidents that occurred in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s when Aboriginal families were broken up and separated, when children were taken away from their parents and when physical acts of violence took place in the remoter parts of Australia as they did in colonial times. I will not have a sense of guilt and sense of personal responsibility for those events put upon my shoulders. It may well be that generations of my ancestors were guilty of oppressing native people in India. That is where members of my family were for several generations before they went to the United Kingdom and then came to Australia. Maybe I should have a sense of guilt about the natives of the province of Hyderabad, but I do not. And I certainly do not have it about contemporary politics and contemporary events in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The underlying philosophy of this preamble and this motion that we should feel guilty is wrong. In exactly the same way as attempts to make current generations of young West Germans feel responsible for incidents that occurred in their parents' era are wrong, it is wrong to attempt to make current generations of Australia bear the burden of guilt for the past. We are responsible for the present and we are responsible for the future; we are not responsible for bearing some sort of collective guilt as is put forward in this motion and this preamble. For those reasons, and with the degree of concern that I express, I indicate once again that we will support the removal of the preamble from the Bill; it should not be in the Bill. However, the motion is flawed, wrong, wicked and divisive and it will not be supported by the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I share Senator Puplick's concerns about the intent of both the preamble and the motion. Whilst for technical reasons it is appropriate to support the Australian Democrats' motion to remove the preamble for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill-and that will be a formality-it is really a matter of looking in detail at the content and the wording of both the preamble and the Democrat motion, which the Opposition cannot support. The concentration of effort and argument really hinges on the concept of what is the resultant dispossession of Aboriginal people. This is a matter of contention in our society that cannot help being highly controversial. Given the general philosophical stance taken by the Australian Democrats, I am surprised that they want to pursue and maintain this degree of controversy in an area in which we should be seeking to negotiate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have problems with some words in both the preamble and the Democrats' motion-words such as `original owners of the land', `dispossession', `dispossession occurred without compensation', `as a consequence . . . Aboriginal . . . peoples have become . . . the most disadvantaged in Australian society' and `rectification'. These types of words concern us. They create and continue the very unnecessary common debate in the community. If the Parliament were to pass the motion or the preamble, it would set down Australia's negotiating position on the proposed treaty even before any such discussions had begun. We would be setting out in the preamble matters that, at court, could be held to be prima facie evidence of fact. The preamble could then have some unexpected, even unintended, legal consequences in relation to other legislation. It is concerning that in the preparation of the legislation the Government has chosen not to tender the legal advice given to it by the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen). It has been notified by the Queensland and New South Wales Ministers that they have legal advice as to the undesired consequences that could well arise. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably the best article I have seen on this whole issue was that by Professor Colin Howard from the University of Melbourne. The article, headed `Australia's Proposed Race Law', was published in the IPA Review of December-February 1988-89. I seek leave to have the article incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The article read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's Proposed Race Law</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Colin Howard</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>A Bill currently before the Federal Parliament would establish a separate system of political representation for blacks. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Constitution includes a power for the Australian Parliament to make laws on the subject of the people of any race for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws. This clause of the Constitution raises the question whether it is right and proper to make laws by reference to people's race at all. The widespread public assumption that such a legislative power is for the benefit of groups of people described by the imprecise term `race' has no legal foundation. The power can be just as well be used to oppress people identified by race as to assist them. But this is only the beginning of the problem. What is a race? It seems easy to distinguish between, for example, black Africans, Arabs, Polynesians and Chinese on a racial basis. But this line of thought will not get you very far. Difficulties arise when you consider groups of people who have some characteristics in common and others which are very different. Are Greeks a different race from Turks, Italians from Icelanders, Iranians from Iraqis, Zulus from Shonas, English from Scots? Are the Jews a race? Only arbitrary answers can be given to such questions because of each of them depends on what one means by race, there is no agreement on that subject. </PARA>
<PARA> When one considers how vociferous the Hawke Government has been about racially-based laws in South Africa, it is worth remembering that no one has suggested that we repudiate the power to make laws with respect to race. It can be argued that we are different, we do not make laws directed against the people of any race and that any such policy would be politically unacceptable. As a justification this is a weak reed. The current danger is not that the power will be used to make laws which are crudely and overtly directed against one minority group in the community. The danger is that in the pursuit of a course of action believed to be good, damage will be done to our entire social structure by way of racially-based laws because nobody perceives what their underlying significance is. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, before the Australian Parliament at the moment, a Bill for an Act entitled the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill, or ATSIC Bill for short. According to the Government this is a good thing because it represents the first major attempt in our history to provide a formal framework through which Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders can influence government decisions which affect them and their interests. The Bill has for the time being been sidelined by the uproar about the Aboriginal Development Commission and the dismissal of Mr Charles Perkins. </PARA>
<PARA> If and when the Bill comes to life again, one thing above all should be squarely confronted. It is that the Bill aims to set up an organization closely resembling a mini-parliament for the sole use and advantage of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. What this will mean is that a section of the Australian population will have been singled out by reference to race for separate representation based on a separate voting roll. If anyone suggests that this resembles apartheid, the answer will no doubt be made that in the first place the Bill does not deprive Aborigines or Torres Strait Islanders of any rights they may already enjoy, but on the contrary adds to those rights, and that the Government is trying to help them, not repress them. The fact remains that they are being singled out, and the process enshrined in law, on undisguisedly racial grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the consequences may not be welcome. Among other things, a body will have been brought into existence with which the Federal Government can negotiate a treaty analogous to the Treaty of Waitangi reached between whites and Maoris in New Zealand a century-and-a-half ago. Although there are supporters in this country of the idea of a treaty, there are others who legitimately have misgivings about it. It can be said, for example, that land rights have caused enough trouble already, without giving one side of the argument the status of a quasi-national independent community. It can be said also that in the long-run it is folly to enact a racial law which manifestly divides Australians instead of uniting them. The New Zealand experience has not been an entirely happy one, to put it mildly. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fundamental cause for unease that, contrary to our professed political ideology, the ATSIC Bill, if it becomes law, will have revealed us as being as racist as anyone else. We should not be in the business of deliberately creating a sub-nation with a sub-parliament with enormous powers to claim land and other property as its own. Whatever the motives, this is a recipe for racial disaster. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Committee. Ever since the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, handed down his study document Foundations for the Future in December 1987, there has been tremendous and lengthy debate on this issue. The nature of consultation on the part of the Government has been to sell a concept that was highly flawed. That is best demonstrated by the fact that in this place we have passed some 120-odd amendments to the legislation. Of course we have debated considerably more amendments that the Government chose not to accept, though we on this side of the chamber argued that those amendments would have been commonsense and would have taken us a long way into the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The concentration has been on putting forward a very patronising system of government for Aboriginal people which crosses many areas. The focus has not been, more appropriately, on reconciliation, on looking to the future rather than dwelling on the past and talking largely in terms of compensation. We must ensure that in our society all groups are able to work together conveniently and appropriately. Any preoccupation-whether it is with ATSIC, a compact, a treaty or some legal implementation-always gives us cause for great concern. The former Secretary to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, Charles Perkins, was quoted in the Canberra Times of 5 September this year in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> He described the proposed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission as the greatest calamity that ever faced the Aboriginal people, apart from the arrival of the Europeans 200 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> ``I supported the concept,'' he said. ``But I do not support the mechanism . . . It's a disaster worse than the missionaries, or the introduced diseases they brought.''</PARA>
<PARA> He criticised the lack of consultancy with the Aboriginal people and said the commission would lead only to conflict and disillusionment. </PARA>
<PARA> ``It's a recipe for racial disharmony,'' he said. ``[Minister for Aboriginal Affairs] Gerry Hand and the bureaucrats did not have the mandate to proceed. They had no right to go ahead.''</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hand had not spent the months consulting the people, as he had promised. Mr Perkins had been there for the initial consultations. </PARA>
<PARA> ``We promised we'd go back,'' he said. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Perkins has certainly highlighted the problems that have become apparent in ATSIC. We need to look carefully at the words of the preamble and the motion. Several very important statements were made by the Northern Territory Government in evidence before the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. I quote from page 22:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is virtually certain that the Preamble would be used as a tool to seek to influence the High Court to recognise an antecedent title of the Aboriginal inhabitants of Australia and further, that title to that land continues in respect of those lands which can be shown to be (or even to have been) traditional lands. In other words, if the Federal Government acknowledges prior ownership by way of the Preamble, and that ownership continues or some residual Aboriginal rights continue, then the Commonwealth may, in effect be creating a mechanism, not through the Parliament (where the decision should properly belong) but through the Courts, whereby the failed uniform land rights proposal sought to be imposed on the States and the Territory in 1984, is imposed by another means, namely the Courts. The regime thus achieved would extend land rights to land in towns and also to non-urban leased land (pastoral land). The regime would seem to apply to all land in the States and, given the preamble as proposed, any litigation is likely to favour Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA>Page 29 of the submission states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Northern Territory Government's concerns as to effects of the proposed Preamble it is believed that the Federal Government has a duty to make its intentions clear on a number of key issues. These are:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) What does the Preamble purport to do as a matter of law?</PARA>
<PARA> (b) What are the effects on mining and industry?</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Are proprietary rights of individuals or the Crown in right of the States and Territory affected and if so how?</PARA>
<PARA> (d) What are the constitutional and compensatory ramifications?</PARA>
<PARA>It is incumbent on the Government to table any legal advice it has received on this issue from the Commonwealth Attorney-General. The Government has been negligent in that throughout this entire debate it has not sought to provide the advice that has been available to it. Obviously it wants to camouflage some serious issue. Senator Collins and I represent a peculiar and particular electorate, the Northern Territory, which contains a very high proportion of Aboriginal constituents. The issues of the preamble, a treaty, ATSIC and Aboriginal administration are almost daily reading in Northern Territory newspapers. There is no uniform or standard approach either within the Aboriginal constituency or in the broader community of the Northern Territory regarding the proposals which the Labor Government has put forward. The difficult problems will not be solved by pious motions that the Democrats might seek to put forward, and they will not be solved by the convoluted and fundamentally flawed provisions that are so inherent in the ATSIC legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> We need to consider the future options of how the Government can provide support for Aboriginal Australians. We are well aware that currently the Commonwealth Budget provides about $1 billion per annum for specific programs that will assist Aboriginal people. In addition, Aboriginal people enjoy the standard entitlements such as social security and welfare, health and education as well as the facilities of State governments and local government throughout Australia. The order of costs is probably double the $1 billion that is actually expended by way of identifiable Aboriginal programs of the Commonwealth Government. The expenditure is provided for the 230,000 Aboriginal Australians who have a very important role to play in our society. Their culture and traditions are rich. They have a lot to offer by way of family relationships and example both in consultation and in communication. It is a pity that the Minister, Mr Hand, did not choose to continue a negotiation process that would have ensured that the entire Australia community, and Aboriginal Australians, could have understood the new forms of administration that he has proposed. Instead, we will be left with a bastardised form of legislation that will not serve the purposes of Aboriginal Australians or the Australian community generally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not one to follow what Mr Ruxton has ever said on immigration because I do not believe that he is particularly well qualified to speak on it. He is very well qualified to look after the welfare interests of returned servicemen, which he does very well. When he pontificates on every other subject under the sun I am inclined to ignore him. I notice that he has now become a regular contributor to the Melbourne newspaper Truth. I think that says something for his credibility. Trying to establish what the RSL attitude is on all these issues is complex. RSL conferences remind me in some ways of the old Labor Party conferences. They carry a whole range of resolutions, some of which are totally contradictory. In some instances they will pick up a motion that there should be no discrimination in immigration policy and five minutes later carry one almost diametrically opposite. The RSL is entitled to its point of view, but no more than that. Every time it corresponds with me I try to give it a sensible reply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the broad question of Mr Ruxton's views, I think they are given far too much publicity. I do not think they are terribly reflective of the total membership, which is more concerned with other matters, and I do not intend to give him any publicity.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would take a lot longer than that. The decision on Coronation Hill was taken after Cabinet had been made aware of an exchange of letters. Part of my statutory duty was to inform the action Minister, as he is so designated, Mr West, of my advice. If one goes back to that letter-I do not have a copy of it now but I would be happy to make it available to Senator Stone if he does not have one-one finds that I said then that, were Coronation Hill to be considered on its own, I would have no objection to it going ahead on the basis of the assessment done by my Department. I put that in black and white so that no-one could suggest that we would be hoodwinking anyone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Coronation Hill is not to be considered on its own because of the impact upon it of El Sherana going ahead. The drilling program at El Sherana is a comparatively new thing. It has only been on in very recent times, but it has shown a highly promising deposit. If that deposit were to go ahead, the ore from El Sherana would be trucked into Coronation Hill and processed there. That would mean, at a minimum, a doubling of a number of facilities like tailings dams and storage dams, not to mention the processing facility itself. As well as that, one would have to look at the impact of an extraordinary number of trucks carrying not just the ore but, of course, the chemicals and equipment that would go into the processing.</PARA>
<PARA> They were the things that Cabinet was considering when Cabinet made its decision on Coronation Hill. In my view Cabinet quite rightly came to the view that Coronation Hill could not be considered on its own because of the impacts that were possible from El Sherana. Those impacts had not been examined. Within that strip which is being referred to Mr Justice Stewart are the prospects of not only Coronation Hill and El Sherana, but also a number of other sites. After his examination and that of his fellow commissioners, the Government will be in a position to know just what is entailed in the operation of Coronation Hill and we will be able to make the appropriate decision then in the light of that full knowledge.</PARA>

I thank the Minister for his answer and refer particularly to that part of it in which he informed the Senate that in the light of exploration in most recent times a `highly promising'-I think those were his words-mineral deposit has now been located at El Sherana, as distinct from the original Coronation Hill deposit. Will the Minister therefore explain to the Senate and thereby to the Australian people why the Government has taken it upon itself to lock away for the rest of time-that is, if it were left to this Government-almost 99 per cent of the so-called conservation zone in order that Australians will never know what other highly promising deposits are to be found in that part of what will now be national park?</PARA></TALK.START>

I will not quibble too much with the figure but I think it was 98 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I do not know whether it is $7 billion. I think that is a speculative figure, but it is the figure upon which we were asked to work. One needs to look for a balance. If one looks at 98 per cent of the conservation zone, one is looking at practically all of the catchment area of the South Alligator River. The Fox inquiry recommended that the full catchment area be conserved. Cabinet had to weigh up the environmental values of the conservation zone against its dollar value or potential dollar value, whichever figure one wanted to believe. Rightly, Cabinet came down on the side of the environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On Sunday night when I was watching television I saw an advertisement to promote the Northern Territory. It was sponsored by the Northern Territory Government. It heavily promoted Kakadu. It heavily promoted the magnificent natural beauties of the Northern Territory. Not once did it suggest that anyone came to the Northern Territory to view mining. Not once did it suggest that it would be happy with mining trucks carrying tonnes of ore battling with tourists along the road from the South Alligator River. It concentrated, quite rightly, on the magnificent natural values of the area. I suggest to Senator Stone that, like the Tourist Bureau of the Northern Territory, he look at these values as well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister's statement to Parliament on 22 August 1985 confirmed that the Australian Government recognises the sovereign authority of Indonesia over East Timor, though it does not condone the manner in which the province was incorporated into Indonesia. The reported declaration of 33 Australian members of parliament lending their support to the request by Bishop Belo for a referendum on self-determination in East Timor does not therefore reflect the Australian Government's view. In the statement on 22 August 1985 the Prime Minister also affirmed that Australia would continue to raise questions of human rights in East Timor. Since that time the Government has continued to make known to the Indonesian Government Australia's concerns that internationally accepted standards of human rights be universally observed. Specifically, the Government has pursued Australia's legitimate interest in the human rights situation in East Timor through raising with Indonesian Ministers concerns about human rights abuses and regular visits to the province by the Australian Embassy in Jakarta.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the allegations of brutality and torture following the Pope's visit to Indonesia, including East Timor, in the period 9 to 14 October, our Ambassador in Jakarta will visit East Timor in the period 19 to 27 October. The visit will provide the opportunity to examine and raise a number of issues with the authorities in the province and remind them of the continuing interest of Australia in developments there. The Ambassador is being instructed, in particular, to report on these recent allegations of human rights abuses. There have been other allegations concerning East Timor in the recent past which the Government has investigated fully and found to have been inaccurate and exaggerated. The Government remains firmly of the view that the only effective way of pursuing Australia's interests in East Timor is through our diplomatic relations with Indonesia.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are times when one has to travel abroad really to appreciate the virtues of living in this country. After travelling abroad during the winter recess and talking with law enforcement agencies in Europe, the United States and elsewhere, I came back greatly reassured at the very evident high standing in which the Australian Federal Police is held by its colleagues in many nations overseas. I believe that that very high standing has been earned by the taking of innovative steps over the last decade since its formation so that it can carry out the mandate and the challenge which has been placed before it by this Parliament and by successive governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The 10 years of work have occurred under three commissioners-Sir Colin Woods initially, Major-General Grey, and now Mr Peter McAulay. Each commissioner has brought very distinctive abilities to the task of forming and refocusing the Federal Police in attaining its objectives. I will mention only two areas where I believe it has been innovative: first, the placing of overseas liaison officers in our embassies abroad has enabled the Australian Federal Police-I believe in a way which is cost-effective, but also requires courage and perseverance on the part of those officers placed abroad-to gather intelligence and information, particularly in relation to drug trafficking into Australia, which has enabled us to become aware of those who want to peddle and traffic those drugs down to Australia. We have been able to nip some of those operations in the bud; break up syndicates. Sometimes we allow the drug in, then put it under surveillance, following either the container to a warehouse or the passenger through an airline terminal to a hotel room, and find the persons who were going to be the first distributors within Australia. This has been a very effective method indeed of policing in relation to drug trafficking.</PARA>
<PARA> To take another example in relation to the Australian Capital Territory and its community policing, once again I have been able to reach a general agreement with the new Chief Minister of the Territory to enable the Federal Police to draw on its nationwide pool of very talented men and women to enable the local community in the Australian Capital Territory to get the best possible policing service on a model which is akin to the way in which the Canadian Mounties operate in relation to various provinces and cities throughout Canada. I believe the particular adaptation of that model indicates once again how the Federal Police is really focusing on being quite creative in the sorts of ways in which it provides policing, in this case not only to the local community in the Australian Capital Territory, but also nationwide in its responsibilities as it earns the title of the premier law enforcement agency in Australia and certainly becomes the leading investigative agency in the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA> I know that the Prime Minister has written to the Commissioner offering the Government's congratulations. I certainly join him and wish the AFP success in its next decade. Its success will be a measure of our success as we remain a free, democratic and civilised society where the adherence to the laws promulgated by our parliaments and courts is guaranteed. I firmly believe that the AFP-by that I suppose I really mean the several thousand men and women throughout Australia, both police and staff members, who I continually meet while travelling around Australia and who give their service-can meet the challenge of its next decade with great distinction.</PARA>

My own Department did not oppose mining at Coronation Hill if it was considered to be a one-off event either.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Most of the security services in government buildings and installations are currently provided by private contractors appointed through a public tender process. The Australian Protective Service (APS) provides security and guarding services under the following criteria: firstly, the fulfilment of security aspects of international obligations, such as protecting embassies, visiting dignitaries, et cetera; secondly, protection of the highest political institutions and public offices of the Commonwealth, such as Parliament House, the Lodge, Kirribilli House, et cetera; and, thirdly, the prevention of access to sensitive national security and law enforcement information and sensitive dangerous materials, such as defence facilities, the National Crime Authority, et cetera. Finally, it looks after the custody of certain persons such as immigrants in immigration detention centres, et cetera. Those specific criteria require the services of the Australian Protective Service. In most instances those services cannot be carried out by private contractors because these functions require very rigorous selection procedures and security clearances, a high standard of training, unequivocal powers of arrest and search, ready access to backup information from other Federal agencies and State police and experience and understanding necessary to deal sensitively with security incidents and demonstrations. We need a permanent and reliable work force and sufficient resources to allow flexible deployment. The Australian Protective Service operates on a fully commercial basis, charging clients the full amount for its services in order to avoid overservicing and to ration resources effectively. Contracting out in the areas currently covered by APS would compromise security and leave Australia open to charges of human rights abuse and dereliction of international obligations.</PARA></TALK.START>

But I do not accept it as a description of the entire industry. The reason for that is that I believe that the Australian Mining Industry Council, the peak body representing the industry, has embraced the concept of sustainable development. Indeed, my understanding is that the Executive Director of that Council, Lauchlan McIntosh, has just recently met the Norwegian Prime Minister, Madam Brundtland, the author of the Brundtland report of the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development, which sets out the parameters for sustainable development. The Council advocates, as a central council on behalf of the industry, that line. When there are major mineral developments in prospect, it seeks to have environmental impact surveys properly conducted and to have an obligation on miners at the completion of mining to rehabilitate the mine site. However, like all organisations, it represents a general view. It does not represent all viewpoints and it is true to say that some spokesmen for the mining industry have made comments worthy of the description that Senator Puplick has given.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stone makes another gratuitous comment. I will refer to him in a second. The Government recognises that there are two factors which obviously influence unemployment benefit numbers. One is the state of the labour market and the other is the integrity of the administration of the work test. The Government has used both these measures in its last six years in office. We can compare this to the way in which the Opposition has abused those measures in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is informative to look at the numbers from 1981 to 1983. Because of the labour market collapse in that period, there was a massive increase in unemployment numbers. Not only was there a labour market collapse but also administrative controls were removed. It is no surprise that Senator Stone has intervened because he was the principal economic adviser to the former Government. The other two players who were as important were Dr Hewson, who was the Fraser Government's alternative economic adviser at the time, and Senator Chaney, who managed the social security policies and who was responsible for the integrity of the administration of the work test.</PARA>
<PARA> In essence, our policy differs from that of the past in that Senator Stone and Dr Hewson set out to control inflation in the only way that they could without a wages policy-by driving the economy into a recession. We are not in the business of doing that. At that time Senator Chaney, responsible as he then was for the administration of the work test, took the approach that the Opposition wants to take again. He was responsible for abolishing the lodgment of fortnightly continuation forms and for abolishing the requirement for unemployment beneficiaries to register with the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES). Because of the pressure applied by Dr Hewson and Senator Stone, Senator Chaney found it all too hard then. This is not the policy response of this Government. Our policy approach is fundamentally different. Fiscal, wages, monetary and social policies, as well as employment and training policies, have been meshed together and directed towards creating jobs and helping Australians to find work. We reject policies that say that we need unemployment to control inflation. We have re-established the integrity of the unemployment benefit system.</PARA>

For example, we have deployed 20 mobile unemployment benefit review teams. Ten were announced in the last Budget.

Another vitally important aspect of the policy-and I am sure the Opposition does not want to hear this-was pointed out by Senator Walsh last month. If Australia today had the same labour market that we had under Senator Stone, Dr Hewson and Senator Chaney, in 1983, we would have to spend an extra $3.2 billion on the social security system every year in order to meet the cost of the unemployment benefit. The question is: Are we now faced with a new policy direction from the Opposition?

On that occasion Australia abstained in the ensuing vote. There are no indications so far that a challenge will be mounted in the current session of the UN General Assembly. Australia's assessment is that, if a challenge were to be mounted, it would not be successful in view of strong majority support for the CGDK among members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), most Western countries and many developing countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Cambodian conflict will not be resolved by a vote on who is entitled to hold the Cambodian seat at the UN. It can be achieved only by a comprehensive political settlement which establishes an interim administration which will assume the Cambodia seat pending elections. Australia's efforts, and those of others, especially the ASEAN countries, are directed at achieving such a comprehensive settlement. The Government would not wish to take any action which might compromise those efforts towards a settlement as a result of the implicit action in respect of the UN seat.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories aware that on Monday, 9 October, busloads of armed Western Australian police smashed their way into an Aboriginal sacred ground in Perth and arrested and mishandled men, women and children who had been peacefully protesting their civil and religious rights in connection with the site of the derelict Swan brewery? Can the Minister advise whether news media in Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong and other potential sources of tourist revenue carried any reports of this violation of the human rights of our Aboriginal ethnic minority? Have such reports undermined the Western Australian Premier's well-publicised endeavours to persuade our Asian neighbours that racism is not a problem in his State for tourists, visitors and business migrants? Finally, bearing in mind the last question what does the Minister intend to do to persuade the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade that the Western Australian Government has embarked on a course which is in breach of the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ratified by Australia in 1984, and the convention of the International Labour Organisation which guarantees the rights of tribal and indigenous people?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women. In light of her earlier answer on this subject and the answer that she gave on 5 October to a question asked by Senator Vanstone, when she stated that the Government is totally committed to the implementation of equal employment opportunity in the Public Service, is she aware that a female public servant in the Department of Employment, Education and Training who took court action over promotion and alleges continuing harassment against her, was arrested three times during April 1989 at the instigation of an assistant secretary within that Department-such assistant secretary being the person against whom she alleges continuing harassment? Is the Minister further aware that the reason for her arrest, which took place in the suite of the Secretary to that Department, was that she wished to see the Secretary about the alleged harassment and victimisation and refused to leave until she had done so? The woman concerned had been advised by a deputy secretary to the Department to discuss the matter with the departmental Secretary. Is the Minister aware that that same female public servant was subsequently imprisoned in the Belconnen Remand Centre from 11 to 19 April because she refused to say that she would not continue to attempt to see the Secretary to the Department of Employment, Education and Training?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At Question Time yesterday Senator Brownhill asked me a question relating to the amounts paid to Ansett Airlines of Australia and particularly asked whether that figure could be updated. As regards further claims, the following have now been approved: Ansett Airlines, $854,289 in respect of the period 12 September to 28 September; and Australian Airlines, $1,422,935 in respect of the period 28 August to 29 September and $871,545 in respect of the period 30 September to 6 October.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Regarding the Royal Australian Air Force, the Government has said on a number of occasions that the precise cost of the operation will not be known until the operation is concluded because the cost per hour will depend on the total number of hours flown, which of course will not be known until the end of the operation.</PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the dispute, to facilitate the maintenance of air services at normal fares, it has been required that aircraft be chartered to the airlines at a cost which approximates the normal operating costs of their aircraft. The airlines are responsible for providing at their own expense fuel; crew and ground maintenance staff accommodation, meals and transfer costs; ground handling; aircraft cleaning; in-flight catering; and minor miscellaneous expenditure. In addition, the airlines are paying an hourly rate to cover spare parts and contractor maintenance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At Question Time yesterday Senator Knowles also asked me a question relating to the airlines. I have an answer for her which perhaps does not take the matter much further than yesterday. As I said yesterday, and I now confirm it, the Government has not attempted at any time to claim that any particular service is achieving 62 per cent of capacity. Rather, it is the airlines' assessment that current capacity across their whole network is at a level equivalent to approximately 62 per cent of demand prior to the disruptions caused by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the information supplied by the airlines, 38 per cent of normal capacity is being provided to Perth. Senator Knowles specifically asked me about Perth. So that this figure can be seen in context, I advise that Sydney-Melbourne, the most heavily travelled route by far, is receiving around 65 per cent and Brisbane-Cairns somewhat more. I understand that Ansett Airlines of Australia is currently finalising its timetable for daylight saving, and it expects to enhance Western Australian services. For instance, Ansett is intending to operate from the end of this month daily return services from Melbourne and additional weekly Sydney-Perth services using larger aircraft, and to commence an Adelaide-Perth-Adelaide service with the frequency of five per week.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 5 October Senator Vanstone asked me a question about effective equal employment opportunity (EEO) within the Public Service and I undertook to get further detail for her. Under section 22 (b) of the Public Service Act, all departments are required to adopt equal opportunity programs. All 19 departments have lodged EEO programs with the Public Service Commission. There are 82 agencies covered by the EEO provisions of the Public Service Act and required to report to the Public Service Commissioner on their programs. All Australian Public Service departments have lodged an EEO program. Some have prepared several programs for different organisational units.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I indicated in my response on 5 October, major organisational changes in Commonwealth departments have slowed the progress of EEO to some extent. However, the transition period following this restructuring is now complete, and the Government expects senior managers to ensure that EEO programs are given proper priority with improved results. The Public Service Commission has commenced processing this data and will publish a report on EEO statistics, expected to be released later this year.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to that detail, Senator Vanstone raised the question of enforceability of EEO programs and referred specifically to the Styles case involving the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. An essential point in that case is that the Full Court of the Federal Court on appeal affirmed that the EEO program must be taken into account and weight must be given to the program as an element in employment decisions. The court also held that the decision maker had had regard to the departmental EEO program.</PARA>
<PARA> On the issue of indirect discrimination, as set out in section 5 of the Sex Discrimination Act, the court found that there was no indirect discrimination and that the practice of appointing officers at their substantive position accorded with the precept of fairness and was reasonable in the circumstances of the case.</PARA>
<PARA> Further, on the issue of clarity of the drafting of section 5 of the Sex Discrimination Act, the Government will be looking at the criticisms which have been made when the approach of the High Court is known in the appeal from the decision of Australian Iron and Steel Pty Ltd v. Najdovska and when the outcome of Miss Styles's application for leave to appeal to the High Court is known.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian economy is about to enter its most difficult period since the Second World War. When we get into government the Liberal and National parties will be facing the problems of a nation suffering from the highest taxes ever, high inflation, high interest rates, high domestic demand, a massive overseas debt and imports exceeding exports by about $2 billion a month.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no world recession, as there was in 1982. There is no Australia-wide drought, as there was in 1982. Our commodity prices are currently at very high levels; indeed, some have been at record levels. In short, there is no excuse for our current economic crisis. Clearly, this crisis is the direct fault of the policies, or lack of policies, of this Labor Government. The Government's snake oil remedies-the accord, Priority One, the promise that no child will live in poverty by 1990 and other shoddy high-profile gimmicks-have all failed because they did not address the basic problems of the economy. The public is now aware that they were snake oil remedies and is dissatisfied with the expensively advertised product. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic mismanagement of the Hawke-Keating Government has left Australia with a legacy of debt, the servicing of which has already mortgaged the future of all Australians. Indeed, the simple fact is that the accord and the Australian Council of Trade Unions have hamstrung the Government so that it cannot attack inflation. It cannot cut further into public expenditure; it is unable to fix up the waterfront or coastal shipping; it is unable to privatise public enterprises; it is unable to reduce the burdens on business; and it is unable to free up the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer (Mr Keating) continues to engineer high interest rates in the hope that this will delay the crisis long enough to enable the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to call an election. Home owners in Australia continue to be sacrificed to this policy. Small business continues to be sacrificed and manufacturers continue to be sacrificed all because this Government is unwilling or unable to address the real problems of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition's Economic Action Plan is the most detailed and comprehensive economic policy document ever prepared by an opposition party, which puts it in sharp contrast to the hotch-potch of proposals put forward as the policies in the Australian Labor Party's platform speech in 1983. This action plan, with supplementary notes on expenditure decisions, runs to many pages and addresses the basic problems of the economy so that by the end of our first term in government tax rates will be cut, interest rates will be lower, government will be smaller, inflation will be reduced, productivity and real wages will be higher, growth in foreign debt will be brought under control, and fraud and abuse of government programs will be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Tough decisions have not been shirked and that is in marked contrast to this Government which has failed to match its rhetoric by pursuing a genuine broad-based program of micro-economic reform. Senator Bolkus is to follow me in this debate. I will be interested to hear him set out where the Government has followed any broad-based micro-economic reform. In 1987 this Government said that micro-economic reform would be the key to its policy program. What have we had? Nothing except an attack on one area of primary industry in relation to micro-economic reform. All the tough decisions have been dodged. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators should look at what is happening on the waterfront at the moment. This Government is dodging the issue of trying to bring about some reform on the waterfront and with coastal shipping. Where is the equity? Where is the tough mindedness in the actions of this Government? What is equitable about giving unlimited millions of dollars to a couple of rich mates in the airline industry? Senator Bolkus should answer that question in his speech. What is equitable about giving these people millions of dollars? What is equitable about using $60m of taxpayers' money to buy off an American company in the Prime Minister's seat of Wills? What is equitable about giving $200m to the four big banks? What is equitable about the $160,000-each average redundancy package given to waterside workers without any guarantees of major reform or increased productivity? What is tough minded about any of these decisions?</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian economy is currently teetering on the edge of an economic abyss. This Government is using taxpayers' funds to try temporarily to buy its way out of its problems. At the same time it keeps its fingers crossed and keeps touching wood looking for some lucky way out. The Liberal and National parties' Economic Action Plan will end Labor's tax rip-off. We have undertaken to hand back the increase in revenue from bracket creep. That is a very significant discipline to impose upon ourselves. We should contrast this with Mr Keating who is openly acknowledging at present that this year his taxes will claw back 50 per cent of the recent tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> Our package recognises the forgotten people of Australia-the families-and the economic burdens of raising a family under the Hawke Government. It seeks to ease those economic burdens which are at the centre of so many family crises and marriage break-ups. Honourable senators can ask families what has happened to their weekly shopping budget or any other item of their household budget under the Hawke-Keating Government. The average Australian family is really battling under the high interest rate policies of this Government. Inflation and interest rates are well in excess of our Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development counterparts. Our program seeks to remedy this huge burden on families as a priority. One of the most common complaints heard today is, `If I work harder and earn more the Government grabs it all back'. There is no incentive from this Government. All this Government is interested in doing is lowering everyone down to some common denominator. Our program seeks to remedy this huge burden on families as a priority. Our policy addresses this and gives a commitment to give back money from bracket creep and eventually to have a two-tiered tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems of small business, which provides the bulk of employment in Australia, are also recognised. Small business will welcome the replacement of Labor's capital gains tax with a speculative gains tax. The glib Government response to this Economic Action Plan-we have heard Senator Bolkus during Question Time trying to come out with these sorts of glib responses-is that it is divisive and an attack on the poor, the Aboriginal people and the underprivileged. Those allegations are simply not true. Hardworking people will be delighted with the decision to finally end the waste of their taxes on hand-outs to people who just abuse the system. After nine months on the dole under a coalition government people will have to prove why further benefits should continue. But those benefits will be available as a safety net if they can establish their entitlement to them. There are people who have abused the system at the taxpayer's expense. A Liberal-National Party government will be cracking down on them. </PARA>
<PARA> Migrants coming to work in Australia-that is, excluding refugees-should be expected to support themselves for at least 12 months. We will ensure that they do so. Illegal migrants should not be entitled to any benefits and we will make sure that they do not receive them. Certainly our program attacks the wastes and inefficiencies of the administration of Aboriginal affairs but this will be to the benefit of the Aboriginal people of Australia. Claims that the plan involves an attack on welfare are nonsense. All the existing welfare programs for low income families have been left intact. I wonder how Senator Bolkus will respond to that statement. The elderly are also protected and receive some genuine benefits. The assets test will be made fairer. People who delay their retirement age will have their age pensions increased and pensions will be indexed and paid on time. Under our new superannuation scheme no tax will be paid on lump sum entitlements up to $125,000, whereas under Labor anything over $60,000 is taxed. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole policy package provided by the Liberal and National parties eases the pressure on families, protects the elderly, gives small business a fair go and stops people rorting the system. It is a thoughtful, caring package and it is fully funded by cuts in expenditure-not like the Treasurer's recent unfunded tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> That is only the revenue and expenditure side of the package, the side which gains the most publicity. The really crucial side is that part of the package which deals with our economic policies-our economic liberalisation process. Here we address the fundamental economic problems of the nation. The cornerstone of our strategy is a coordinated approach to economic reform, getting the basics right to improve the general economic environment and create a more productive and fairer Australia. Industry problems are addressed, with the introduction of greater flexibility into the labour market; reform of the waterfront, coastal shipping and transport services; the promotion of real competition in industry, for example, communications; a reduction in the regulatory burden and business on-costs and incentives to work and to invest. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been saying for two years in this Senate chamber that these are the areas to which the Government needs to address its mind. Under the Hawke Government we have seen nothing other than reports, with committees set up to inquire into matters, but no fundamental restructuring. Nothing is happening with regard to the restructuring of the labour market or the waterfront. There is some talk about a package of about $160,000 to members of the waterfront industry to retire but no talk about what they will do to increase their productivity. We have been talking to the Government about real competition in this industry. Earlier this year the Government had an opportunity to introduce real competition in the communications industry. What did it do? It dodged the issue. The Government established a Business Regulation Review Unit but it starved it of staff-I think there is a maximum number of only six on its staff. It has not bothered to implement any of the recommendations which have come from that Business Regulation Review Unit. When we get into office we will make sure that the Unit is freed up from oppressive government interference with its recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> Business on-costs are a great disincentive to manufacturers in Australia but how will we turn around the $2 billion deficit occurring each month-the deficit between our imports and our exports-unless business is encouraged? Our economic policy directs itself to that. The proceeds of the sale of 12 Commonwealth enterprises will be used to reduce the public debt. We believe that a vigorous, competitive and internationally oriented manufacturing sector is absolutely fundamental to the future prosperity of Australia and the restoration of our living standards. Protection will be reduced further to accelerate the pace of adjustment. Our plan will be an integrated one to improve production and productivity and to reduce inflation so that we can trade our way out of our difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> The Reserve Bank of Australia in its most recent annual report said that changes at the micro-economic level were `essential if we are to avoid a re-emergence in the next upswing of the problems of the past year'. We have addressed the micro-economic changes referred to in the Reserve Bank's report. But the Reserve Bank went on further and said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . but the vital key is inflation. Restructuring is much more difficult, even impossible, in a high inflation environment which destroys competitiveness and discourages saving. Altering this situation must have top priority. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the priority we have given it. We are determined to attack inflation. We have announced that we will bolster the independence of the Reserve Bank to help us in this attack. A monetary policy pursued steadily over the medium term in conjunction with our industrial relations, fiscal and structural policies provides the only means of reducing inflation and hence interest rates. That is what ultimately it will lead to. I will say that again so that it is perfectly clear: our policy to reduce interest rates is monetary policy pursued steadily over the medium term in conjunction with our industrial relations liberalisation and our fiscal and structural policies which will provide the means of reducing inflation and hence ultimately reducing interest rates. Interest rates will no longer have to be kept at record and punitive levels as this Government has done to cover up lack of action in other areas. Home buyers and small business operators no longer will have to pay a heavy price for the policy failures of the Government being unable to deliver the right economic strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> Our commitments and our integrated policy package stand in sharp contrast to the Hawke-Keating Government's current abysmal performance. With the basics right, the coalition package provides a basis for sustained national recovery and a more productive and fairer Australia. It is clear now that the Liberal Party is the party of low taxation. </PARA>

Our policies will bring foreign debt under control and begin to wind it back. As I said before, our main attack is on an economic basis. Once we get the basics right the coalition package will provide a basis for sustained national recovery and a more productive and fairer Australia for all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the benefit of those who may be listening, it is probably worth while reciting the words of the matter of public importance this afternoon because I am sure that after the last speech they might be a bit lost as to its content. The matter of public importance reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need for the Government to implement as a matter of urgency the Liberal and National Parties' Economic Action Plan to relieve the unfair burdens on Australian families and provide a basis for sustained national recovery. </PARA>
<PARA>What has the Government been asked to do? It has been asked to endorse an economic policy which is no more than a black hole-a con job. It is a black hole in more ways than one. It is a black hole because, no matter how hard one seeks one will not find the economics in the policy. Where is the tax policy costed? Where is the fiscal policy addressed? Where is the monetary policy addressed? Where is the wages policy spelt out? It is a black hole for rational and economic thinking. Where is the costing of the Opposition's bracket creep policy and who will pay for it and how and when? It is a black hole for the millions of Australian families who will suffer because it leads to the only policy that Senator Stone knows, and that is the policy of the short, sharp shock-a recession. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no targeting of the poor in our community and, because of the general sweep of the policy direction, the poor will miss out. What about the migrants? It is very easy to target the migrants, but they will be disadvantaged, as will the long term unemployed. As Steve Burrell wrote in the Australian Financial Review the other day, this policy requires a leap in faith from the community. The Opposition want us to leap with it into an uncertain future; it wants the Australian people to sign a blank cheque. </PARA>
<PARA> We have waited a 2 1/2-year gestation period for this policy. Andrew Peacock was expected to bite the bullet but by this policy he has shown that he could not even make an impression on a cream puff. Who is here today to spell out this policy but Senator Lewis. Poor old Senator Lewis-Mr 5 per cent. He has absolutely no credibility when it comes to dealing with the major economic issues facing Australia today, but he had to raise the issue in the Senate this afternoon. I remind the Senate that it was Senator Lewis who so confidently predicted in August this year that during the first term of a Peacock Government interest rates could be expected to fall to 5 per cent. Having then displayed his ignorance of economic matters and having so thoroughly embarrassed his coalition colleagues, he has the temerity to stand here today and pretend that the Opposition can deliver an economic plan which will achieve something positive for Australia. He does not understand economics, has shown that he does not understand economics, and his colleagues have recognised that. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the issues which the Opposition promises to tackle in its Claytons tax policy-the tax policy you have when you do not bother to address taxation issues. It was only a few weeks ago that Mr Peacock announced in his mock election campaign-and one wonders whether he will call this a mock campaign in a few weeks time-the `bold initiative' of inflation adjustment which would `cut to the heart of one of the most critical problems we have in Australia'. If the problem is so critical, why was he rolled? Where is inflation adjustment in this policy? Senator Stone knows where it is-he rolled him. </PARA>
<PARA> Another member of the committee was Dr Hewson. Dr Hewson came into this committee system with grand plans for a broadly-based consumption tax, and he canvassed them widely at the weekend. Where did his plans go? They were rolled by the committee as well. Senator Chaney, happy now to accept this vicious slug on Australian Aborigines and struggling families, came to the committee wanting a wages policy. That is not spelt out in this policy. He also came with a long history of targeting welfare. I quote Senator Chaney in 1982, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>If one can isolate those who generally need assistance one can provide assistance to them. The job is possible. However, on the other hand, if one tries to apply a broad blanket measure to the whole population of Australia it is unlikely that any success will be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA>Where was Senator Chaney when this policy was devolved? This is a blanket plan. Has he given up on fighting poverty? It is quite apparent, from what he believes and what this policy is about, that Senator Chaney has either given up or he, too, was rolled. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there is Senator Lewis-the doyen of kindergarten economics-who was obviously prejudged by his colleagues as having not much of an understanding about economic measures. He was simply left out. In the Australian, dated 14 October, Laura Tingle wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>The `kitchen Cabinet' comprises Mr Peacock, Dr Hewson, Senator John Stone, Mr Charles Blunt and Senator Fred Chaney. Senator Austin Lewis also plays a role, but does not have the same economic credentials as other members of the group.</PARA>
<PARA>What a field to run last in. Who, then, was the winner? It is quite obvious that the economics committee of the Opposition was well and truly stoned, because all that is left in this policy are the politics of the Stone-age of Senator John Stone. This policy is going back to pre-1983. Senator Stone is the winner. The rationality and prejudice are part of his philosophy. That is what he talked about on radio last week. He said, `This package is about some philosophy'. Senator Stone's blatant attack on the social justice and social security policies of this Government last Friday spelt out what the real agenda of this Opposition is. It is not, as he and others might claim, about helping families. The result of this policy-the result of the short, sharp shock-will be a direct and vicious attack on family life in Australia. If one really wants to help families one targets, as Senator Chaney said. This policy is not about targeting. </PARA>
<PARA> Who will benefit? It is quite obvious that the coalition's rich mates will benefit-families like the Hewsons will be better off-but ordinary Australians will be made to suffer more and more and face harder times. As I said, targeting is what it is all about, particularly at a time of tight economic restraint. This is not an economic policy, it is a political document, and the Opposition is leaving no doubt about that. The fact that this is a cynical, political document is starting to seep through to the community. Adele Horin, dealing with the policy and the rebates contained in it, put it succinctly in the Sydney Morning Herald this morning:</PARA>
<PARA>The trouble is, it doesn't feel like a gift-it feels like a bribe. </PARA>
<PARA>It feels like a handful of dollars, which we saw when Senator Stone was in charge of the Treasury and Mr Malcolm Fraser was the Prime Minister. We all know what happened to that handful of dollars then. So who will benefit? The young will not. Under this policy they will have even less chance of being able to start a family. Thousands of Australians will be out of work under a Peacock government, because that is the policy we are talking about. The policy which Senator Stone, Senator Chaney and Senator Lewis talk about will increase the breakdown of families and social relations. What is this policy? As I said, it is a political document and there is a political philosophy behind it. That philosophy is very much one of the politics of division. I quote again Adele Horin:</PARA>
<PARA>In rewarding the people who pay the bills, as Senator Stone called them, and ignoring or punishing the rest, the policy sets the scene for a more divided Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what this policy is all about. It is also about the politics of economic disaster, because it is certainly not a comprehensive policy. Where is fiscal policy addressed in any decent, comprehensive way? Where is tax policy adequately covered? Where is monetary policy adequately covered? It is certainly not a wages policy. What is more, no-one in Australia believes that this is a relevant and appropriate social policy. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the document which we have been asked by Senator Lewis to implement started life 2 1/2 years ago as a tax policy, but it is a tax policy with no fine print. It is a tax policy without costings for its key elements, and without costings there cannot be firm commitments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can Senator Stone tell me how the Opposition will pay for bracket creep in the next financial year? The Opposition has not costed that and told us what cuts will be made to pay for it. Senator Stone will not admit that. I ask how the Opposition will do that. This goes back to the edicts of Senator Stone and Mr Peacock that the Opposition would not give comprehensive listings of cutbacks before the election. This is a deceptive document, and to that extent Senator Stone acknowledges that it is. There are no firm costings about how the bracket creep policy will be paid for. It is a tax policy without costings and, consequently, cannot be treated seriously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are promised a flatter tax system, but where is it? What are the scales? Again, what are the costings? We are promised indexed bracket creep. Once again, who will pay? That is the major question we have to ask when we are talking about extra funding and measures in this area. We were told it would be a radical fiscal policy, but its surplus would probably not be lower than what we have got now. In fact, it would not be lower. We were also told it would be a monetary policy. Senator Lewis is on record as saying that it would reduce interest rates to 5 per cent in the Opposition's first term in government. Instead, the direct consequence of this, as economic writers such as Ross Gittins can attest, is that we can expect interest rates to rise. What do we have when we look to the wages policy aspect of this package? There is nothing but a bland, general statement and silence. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, this is not an economic policy at all-it is an economic black hole. All of the questions are raised; none of them are answered. The Opposition has asked Australians to take a leap into the dark. Some media commentators have seen through it. For instance, in the Australian of 16= October the economic editor states:</PARA>
<PARA>Andrew Peacock's economic policy adds up-once you realise it's predicated on protracted recession. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a recipe for slow growth, weak investment, rising unemployment, falling real wages, high interest rates and an over-valued dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us turn to the family policy-the sugar coating of the bitter pill. It is not a policy for families; it is, in fact, a policy for family apartheid. It creates two classes of Australians-those who are mates of Stone, Peacock and Chaney and the mass of ordinary Australians; those who are able to avoid tax and those who have to pay for it. All Australians should ask themselves, `How many families with children will need to be thrown onto the streets to pay for Elliott's latest tax break?'. That is precisely what will happen. This Opposition plans to abolish retrospectively the capital gains tax, giving a windfall gain of hundreds of millions of dollars to Elliott and other Liberal mates. Not only that, it will be replaced in such a way that distortions will be brought into the system. Senator Stone, with his professional knowledge, should know something about this. I do not know how they got this one past him, but they must have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the speculative gains tax that will bring about distortions. But, basically it is inequitable that the Opposition's proposal can remove the obligation on people to pay capital gains tax. This financial year Labor's capital gains tax will produce half a billion dollars. That money is targeted at and directed back to ordinary Australians through the family allowance, the family allowance supplement and Medicare. Hewson wants to give this money back to Elliott. We are asked to sacrifice not only this money but also fundamental, well thought out, long term changes to our system of government and to our social security system-changes that have been worked out comprehensively through independent reviews, changes which are laying the groundwork for future developments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Where are the Opposition's commitments to the indexation of children's benefits? Where are its commitments to a long term retirement incomes policy? We are asked to sacrifice all these for tax breaks for the rich. So it is very much the politics of family apartheid. Why have we embarked upon this? Why does the Opposition promise a return to the politics of division? The answer is pretty clear. A graph of unemployment benefits between 1978 and 1989 shows very clearly that during the time of Hewson-Stone-Chaney unemployment skyrocketed, almost to the top of the graph, to almost 640,000. The people who created this situation are the ones who are now responsible--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having failed once, Senator Stone and Dr Hewson-the men who brought Australia record unemployment and record inflation-have been promoted. It is a sad reflection on the Opposition that Senator Stone and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) have been recycled. These men, who threw 200,000 Australians on to the dole queues in the last two years of coalition government and who threw into poverty almost half a million children of those unemployed parents, have been promoted to do it again. They want another chance. Australians may well ask why they still have no answers, why the bullet has not been bitten in this policy. I suppose that one of the meretricious players in the group of three-Dr Hewson-can tell us. He was there last time. What does he have to say about policy development in the coalition? I quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the whole thing was that big decisions were not taken . . . the consumption tax, industry protection levels, policy restraint measures . . . it was very frustrating. </PARA>
<PARA> Howard would get rolled, Cabinet Ministers would sway the debate on the basis of an anecdote in the non-Members Bar the night before-even if we had four feet of paper on the table . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The farmers could produce anecdotes out of the air. I used to wonder a lot how much many of them understood. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the way it was played. I am sure that Senator Stone, when writing his memoirs after losing the seat of Fairfax, will tell us that that is the way it was played this time. We are concerned, but I am sure that the Australian people will not be conned. The Opposition has some basic problems. This Government does have a fiscal policy, a monetary policy and a wages policy. It is now up to the Opposition to show us the fine detail of its grand plan. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian people will not be conned because they do not believe that Andrew Peacock can deliver the morning's milk, let alone deliver on this economic policy. They do not believe Andrew Peacock when he says that fighting inflation first will not mean higher unemployment. And they do not believe people such as Senator Lewis, who expects interest rates to fall to 5 per cent. The Opposition has a major credibility problem-a problem that was around before the mock campaign and which was underscored by that campaign. The major policy of that campaign has been dropped. I am sure that as the Australian people analyse more precisely the policy that has been put to them, as the parliamentary press gallery, commentators and economic analysts are starting to do, they will also see that one cannot trust Andrew Peacock to deliver the morning's milk, let alone an economic policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance before us today, which has been proposed by the Opposition, calls on the Government to implement, as a matter of urgency, the Liberal and National parties' Economic Action Plan to relieve, it claims, the unfair burdens on Australian families and provide a basis for sustained national recovery. Those of us who have been watching the behaviour of the Opposition in this chamber for the last five or so years are somewhat astounded at the claims being made in this matter of public importance. The fact is that, of course, the majority of Australian families are hard hit simply because of the very policies that the Liberal and National parties in opposition in this chamber have supported and which the Australian Labor Party has been implementing over the years. We have seen a number of most inequitable moves undertaken by the current Labor Government with the support of the Opposition that have put the needy in the community into an even more parlous situation and left those who are already well off even better off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All that we can say about the Opposition's package is not that it should be undertaken as a matter of urgency by the current Government because, by and large, it is already being implemented, but that the additional aspects of it will serve only to make matters worse. Despite the fact that some writers were deluded into using such headlines as `Liberals' package aimed at helping families', other journalists and editorial writers saw it for what it was-a significant con trick very largely playing on the prejudices of those people who believe that anybody who is a long term unemployed is a layabout 18- or 19-year-old who does not want to work, is not capable of working and would not accept a job if he were offered one on a gold plate. The fact is, of course, that many of the long term unemployed in Australia are men in their forties and early fifties who have been made redundant by changes in industry plans. Those people will not benefit in any way at all from the policies contained in the Opposition's tax package. Ross Dunn, writing for the Australian Financial Review, had this to say on 13 October under a headline of `Needy to subsidise big hand-outs to families':</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Peacock, shifted the Liberal Party significantly to the right yesterday by asking the most disadvantaged groups to suffer the burden of a decision to focus more government spending on families . . . But new measures have been found which will be applauded by those who believe honest hard-working families are paying higher taxes than necessary to keep dole-bludgers, migrants, and invalid pensioners on social welfare benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to point out some of the examples that Mr Peacock gave of how families would benefit. He said that a two-income family earning $26,000 and $13,000-that is, a total income of $39,000-with one child under the age of five and one between five and 12 would benefit by $36.35 a week extra after tax. If a family earned $24,000 and $15,000-that is, a total combined income of $39,000-and was supporting a four-year-old, a nine-year-old and an 11-year-old, it would get $49.42 a week extra. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The dependant-spouse rebate will be made more generous, with spouses able to earn $1,000, rather than the existing $282, before the rebate is phased out. </PARA>
<PARA>The point that Mr Dunn makes, which is most telling and was picked up by an Age editorial of the same day, is that the benefits will be funded by huge cuts in social welfare-a budget which, I might add, has been pared down by the current Government, with the support of the Opposition, over the last few years. The Age editorial highlights the policy with the headline `Clever politics, dubious economics'. The first paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA>The federal coalition parties' long-awaited economic and tax policy may possibly achieve its purpose of winning for them the next election. If it does, it will do little to solve Australia's daunting economic problems and less to create a fairer society. It is essentially a political document, carefully crafted to tantalise the hip-pocket nerves of the potential swinging voters of Middle Australia. In so far as it addresses Australia's economic crisis of growing indebtedness, excessive inflation and poor productivity, it makes the right noises but offers little convincing evidence that the proposed remedies would bring about the desired results. In so far as it proposes to redistribute taxation and welfare, the message is that more shall be given to those who have, and less shall be available for those who have little. </PARA>
<PARA>It is outrageous for the Opposition to call for a fair deal for struggling Australian families when in recent years it has supported policy after policy of the Labor Government, particularly those of the second and third Hawke governments, to cut, both directly and indirectly, the living standards of those families. We have seen families which are classified as low income families deprived of Austudy payments for 15-year-olds in their last two years of school. We have seen 45-year-old women told that, once their youngest child turns 16, they must go off the class B widow's pension and onto the unemployment benefit. The unemployment benefit will be denied after nine months if the Liberal Party comes to power. We have seen the Opposition and the Labor Government combine to delay consumer price index linked increases for pensioners by six weeks and to discount ex-service pensions by 2 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> At the time the Opposition supported these cuts it quite cheerfully supported, at a cost of $2,000m, a 20 per cent tax cut to big business-a cut from 49c in the dollar to 39c. So it is hardly surprising, given these joint actions of the Opposition and the Australian Labor Party, that recent university studies show that the top 20 per cent of Australian families own 44 per cent of the wealth and the bottom 20 per cent own 4.6 per cent of the wealth and income in this country. Presumably the remaining 60 per cent share the remaining 51 per cent of the country's income and wealth. </PARA>
<PARA> What does the Opposition want to see happening? If we are to believe the policy that Mr Peacock has released recently, it wants to decrease the income of the bottom 20 per cent so that the top 80 per cent can get a bit more. One wonders what impact it thinks its nine-month unemployment benefit proposal will have on 45- to 50-year-old men who have been made redundant because of restructuring within the industries that have employed them, or on the 45-year-old women I mentioned a moment ago. Has the Opposition thought what will happen to families who are getting some benefits from child tax rebates but are then expected to front up with $1,200 in fees for their university students? Has it added up the net loss to families who are being promised $200 to $350 per annum in tax benefit for children under 15 but who face a cost of $1,200 when they send their 17-year-olds and 18-year-olds to university? Where is the fairness and equity in that? The result will be that high income families will send their sons to do the long courses of medicine, law, dentistry and architecture. The profile of universities will return to that of the 1960s. When I and most of the people in this chamber were university students, we were lucky if 25 per cent of students on campus were women. Very few low income earners and migrant families were able to afford to send their offspring to university. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's policy is no better than the policy of the current Government when it comes to directly benefiting Australian families. It fails to deal with some of the major issues. It has ignored the need for incentives to encourage saving generally. Certainly, it has done something with regard to retirement savings accounts, but it has done nothing to release the tax burden on interest paid by ordinary individuals and the fact that pensioners have to pay provisional tax once their interest earnings reach $1,000 a year. It has done nothing to address the issue of increased housing interest costs to the average Australian family and it has done nothing to attend to the level of foreign investment in this country. The first two factors-that is, savings incentives and housing loan interest costs-barely rate a mention in the package. The third, far from being attended to, was given a green light, with no restrictions, no impediments and no questions asked. </PARA>
<PARA> Where are Australian families going to benefit from the Opposition's wages policy, unless the wage earners are in a powerful position and are able to hold employers to ransom? Anybody who thought there was any merit in an enterprise-based system for wage fixation should look closely at the pilots dispute. Where guns can be held to employers' heads there will be big wage increases. For shop assistants, nurses, teachers and others who have no chance of holding a country to ransom, there will be little benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Where and how will Australian families benefit from deregulated, totally privatised transport, health, financial and communications systems? We have already heard Liberal senator Richard Alston deriding the idea of cross-subsidies for people living in country areas and needing affordable telephone services. Clearly, a Liberal-National Party government is prepared to impose additional costs on people in country areas. There is no plan to encourage saving, there is no plan to relieve the costs of housing loan repayments and there is no plan to end the foreign debt, foreign investment, high interest rate cycle. There is no plan to do anything but to play on the prejudices of some middle-class voters to win short term political gain. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's policy is based on the theory-outlined at page 17 of its document-that an economic environment should be encouraged `in which winners can select themselves'. But, if that is the case, what chance will small business and ordinary Australian families have when the likely winners are given a head start; when investors in housing get a tax deduction for interest payments but home buyers do not; when Australian big businesses can borrow from overseas at lower interest rates but small businesses have to borrow on shore at high interest rates; when major companies can push up our foreign debt to record levels forcing governments, including a possible coalition government, to keep interest rates high to encourage foreign investment to come into Australia; and when the Opposition is planning to do this by removing all restraints on foreign investment, including abolishing the Foreign Investment Review Board?</PARA>
<PARA> Who will be the winners if these policies are put into effect? It certainly will not be the Australian families in the middle income bracket or low income earners. The winners will be the Japanese and other foreign investors, shareholders in major Australian companies, the private owners of our transport and communications systems and well off families who can afford high interest rates and the high cost of tertiary education and whose capital gains tax payments will be reduced. Australian families on $59,000 per annum and up will have no difficulty at all living under a future coalition government. The rest will be even worse off than they have been under the second and third Hawke governments. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that anybody in the community who believes that these policies are a recipe for improved standards of living in Australia ought to look at what some areas of deregulation have already achieved for Australian families. The banking sector, for example, far from providing cheaper interest rates and better services and putting more flexible items on offer to the public, has done just the reverse. This policy offered to us by the Opposition will make matters far worse in the short as well as the long term for most families in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are addressing today the need for the Government to implement as a matter of urgency the Economic Action Plan of the Liberal and National parties announced on Thursday of last week in order to relieve the unfair burdens on Australian families and provide a basis for sustained national recovery. Senator Bolkus, who has spoken for the Government on this matter, seemed to describe this policy as a black hole. I have probably forgotten most of my physics, but I seem to recall that black holes have an extraordinarily powerful gravitational force, uppermost in the firmament. I suspect that this policy will have exactly that quality about it. It will have a very strong gravitational force upon Australians, particularly the 2.7 million Australian families whose cause this policy takes up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other thing which Senator Bolkus was at pains to say was how terribly unfair and biased this policy was, how it was all directed towards the interests of our rich mates. I am not aware that I have any rich mates, as a matter of fact. The funny thing about that is that on the one hand Senator Bolkus seems to feel that the policy can be directed at a few rich people and on the other hand he describes it as a political document. I thought that political documents were about attracting votes from large numbers of people. I think there is a certain inconsequentiality, a certain internal contradiction between Senator Bolkus's arguments which I suggest he look at before he makes another speech on the subject. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal economic challenge of the 1990s is to restructure our economy in order to deal with the excessive external debt levels which have accumulated under the feckless period of office of the Hawke-Keating Government. Today our net foreign debt is over $110 billion. We are now third in a list of countries ranked according to the level of external debt they own to commercial banks. We are behind only Brazil and Mexico in that list. We are just in front of Argentina and the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> Inflation, which the Treasurer (Mr Keating), two Budgets ago, described as Australia's number one economic disease, is averaging twice that of our major trading partners and eight times that of the Japanese. The Hawke-Keating Government has had no answer to inflation, no answer to the growing problem of foreign debt, no answer to the imbalance in our external accounts. It has been complacent about all of them for far too long and it has no answers to them today. The Government's blind faith in its now clearly failed accord has led to high money wages growth-not real wages growth-resulting in a floor on inflation of 7 or 8 per cent. We have interest rates today at record high levels because the Government has no answers except its brutal, one-dimensional, tight money-that is to say, high interest rate-policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Hawke-Keating Government cannot undertake the necessary micro-economic reform that will get the cost structure of industry down and get inflation down. It cannot do so because it is hamstrung by the need to obey its trade union masters. As a result, the economy continues to go down the plughole. </PARA>
<PARA> Last Thursday we produced a blueprint for reform. The coalition's action plan represents an integrated attack on Australia's problems. It calls for cuts in Commonwealth Government spending and other savings of over $2.7 billion. It calls for an end-and it makes not apologies for doing so-to the present open-ended unemployment benefits way of life system. It calls for a far reaching program of reform to transport, communications and other key areas of the economy. It calls for a credible, medium term monetary policy directed at reducing inflation. It calls for a major program of privatisation of government enterprises to transfer to private enterprise what it can do more efficiently and at lower cost. Most importantly, it calls for total reform of the labour market to boost productivity-the only source of rising real incomes-by encouraging closer and more rewarding working relationships between management and employees. It also calls for an end to compulsory age retirement. Those people who do not want to retire should not be forced to do so. It is a policy that in all respects the Government cannot challenge. </PARA>
<PARA> The accord has failed. The Australian Council of Trade Unions will not let this Government privatise government business enterprises, even though it would like to do so in a few cases. Its union masters will not let it undertake reform of either the coastal shipping industry or the waterfront. The Hawke-Keating Government today has been reduced to an empty shell of empty rhetoric which it cannot even get right. The day after the coalition policy launch, Mr Keating, the Treasurer, from a doorstep somewhere in Perth uttered what are still his only substantive comments on our policy. What did Mr Keating say? I can put it no better than it was put in yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald by Mr Alan Kennedy in his `Stay in Touch' column:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has been running around in ever-decreasing circles trying to find a counter to Opposition Leader Andrew Peacock's tax policy. Just before he disappeared completely, the Treasurer, Mr Keating, weighed in with a few well-chosen words. </PARA>
<PARA> He said: `In actual fact, the Opposition has brought down a set of intended changes that overwhelmingly endorse the basic economic direction being pursued by the Government.'</PARA>
<PARA> Near the end, however, he said: `But what is crystal clear is that today's document does nothing fundamental to address Australia's balance of payments and external debt crisis.'</PARA>
<PARA> The Silver Budgie-</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is slightly disrespectful to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) but that is how Mr Kennedy describes him-</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hawke, didn't help clear matters up, either. He took time off from dismantling the trade union movement to say of Mr Peacock's statement: `It is obviously economically irrelevant. It offers no alternative to the basic economic strategy that is being followed by this Government.'</PARA>
<PARA> Exactly. </PARA>
<PARA>Without committing oneself to agreeing with the limited views that have been stated either by Mr Hawke or Mr Keating, one can only say that the sheer internal contradictions of the Government's attitudes on these matters could not be more starkly revealed than by those quotations. Why was the Treasurer saying all this from a doorstep in Perth? It is widely known, after all, that he cancelled his annual trip to the International Monetary Fund meeting so that he could stay in Canberra, so he said, to attack the coalition's tax policy. A heading in the Age of 25 August is `Keating cancels Washington trip'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer, Mr Keating, has cancelled his annual trip to the International Monetary Fund meeting so that he can stay in Australia to attack the Opposition's tax policy. </PARA>
<PARA> A spokesman for Mr Keating said last night that nothing at the IMF meeting, in Washington next month, was as important as the tasks Mr Keating could undertake in Australia. `We'll see what Andrew Peacock comes up with at around that time.'</PARA>
<PARA>An article in the Canberra Times on Wednesday, 13 September, states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Government is like a `heat-seeking missile' bearing down on the federal Opposition and ready to destroy its policies in the run-up to the next election, according to the Treasurer, Paul Keating. </PARA>
<PARA> `We are just like those infra-red missiles targeted on the Liberals,'-</PARA>
<PARA>he might have included the Nationals as well-</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Keating told a meeting of Australian Labor Party supporters in Sydney. `We are now on red alert and locked on. </PARA>
<PARA>On red alert? Nobody can find the Treasurer! He has gone into a burrow somewhere in Western Australia. I am not sure whether he is still in Western Australia; he may have come back. Is he hiding in a bunker here in the Parliament? Where is he? Mr Keating continued to beat up this hype about what he would do to the Opposition's tax policy. Geoff Kitney, in the Australian Financial Review on Friday, 6 October, began his article with the headline, `The political Cobra winds up for the strike'. </PARA>

Yesterday Mr Hawke flew out to Kuala Lumpur for 10 days, so presumably we will not get any comment from him in that time. Apart from that doorstop interview in Perth last Friday, Mr Keating's only contribution was to put out a three-paragraph press statement yesterday. Talking about the sharp fall on the stock markets, he states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>This is the man who in that very same interview in Perth on Friday said that since 1 July this year, which is four months ago, the Government has spent $5.7 billion. He does not describe that as a `profligate policy of public handouts', even though he has paid for none of it with spending cuts, not a penny. This man cannot even get his lines right any longer. He is a figure of fun. The greatest Treasurer in the world has been reduced to a figure of fun; it is a pathetic farce. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought Senator Puplick would like that. For the record, I am sure that Hansard has that in parentheses, because Hansard understands how such things are said. Senator Puplick will spend a lot of time saying I do not know economics. Indeed, I may have just succumbed to Senator Stone's sin of using the smart word instead of the accurate word. Nothing in a balanced budget of the sort the Opposition has proposed-taking from one side and putting it on the other side-will do anything to alter the broad economic criteria with which Opposition members claim the Government is ruining the country. Nothing the Opposition has offered in its Economic Action Plan document will do anything to address that. The big concern I have is about words like `steady monetary policy' which, according to any advice I have, will do nothing to lower interest rates; indeed, it would probably put them up. If it is to have any effect at all, it will be only by increasing unemployment. If we look at the years 1981 and 1982, we see that it is a policy which those opposite are very well practised at.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take issue with the definition of `family' and which part of the Australian family will benefit, as presumed in this extraordinary document. Quite clearly, the Opposition thinks that a family has one breadwinner and occasionally two. Those opposite have finally come round to the fact that occasionally there are two breadwinners in a family and that they have the standard 2 1/2 children. We do not find any reference to women in this document. That is, at least, a going back on the Opposition's previous Future Directions document. It is pretty hard to go further back than that, but it has. At least that document mentioned women; they rated a very small comment. The figures have changed very little for child-care, which rated two column inches in the original document. Now women do not get a guernsey at all, but child-care gets a lot. We presume that that is because those opposite think that that will talk to women. </PARA>
<PARA> What is this family? It is not a family that covers low income people. It is not a family that is affected by being on social security benefits or pensions. The Opposition's notion of a family in this document does not include those on low incomes, the poor or black people. Migrants are excluded if they have just come here and cannot speak English too well. The Opposition says, `That is not a real family'. It says, `You are not a real family; we do not want to target benefits to you'. Of course, those opposite could not target benefits to those people because all they would have to do is improve on the splendid record of this Government. One of the people who say that we have a splendid record for low income people is Senator Fred Chaney! In the Hansard of 23 November 1988, at page 2632, he states:</PARA>
<PARA>With respect to assistance to families, I condemn the Government for the fact that the only families it has been prepared to help have been those on the lowest incomes. </PARA>

It means that people in Australia are working-not the people who had a job, but people who could not get a job under the previous Government, under the dreadful Liberal Government policies of 1981-82 which drove unemployment so high. Those people want to work. In fact, 1 1/2 million people have taken up the opportunity to get back to work under this Government. This Government has helped those people.

Under social security we do not abandon the unemployed. We say, `Those of you who are legitimately able to enjoy these benefits can do so', but we are also sure that we do not want people abusing the system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the other hand, this Government is not singling out the unemployed or sole parents. I am a bit surprised to find that members of the Opposition did not give them a kick on the way through; they usually do. We are not singling out any recipients under social security, but the rules, which require a thorough scrutiny to ensure that people are properly using those benefits, have meant a number of important things. Firstly, the percentage outlays have fallen. Secondly, the payment of benefits has dramatically increased and, for the first time ever, this year the Australian Government has increased family allowance and indexed it. Payments on behalf of families are now all indexed and associated with the consumer price index; if they are not directly indexed, they are indexed as a package. Benchmarks and standards in relation to the cost of rearing a child have been established as a percentage of the married rate of pension and are fixed, indexed and are never to be written down-unless those on the other side get into government. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the commitment this Government has made to families and to all children. The benefits are there for all people across the country under the April statement and the recent Budget that has seen them implemented. The next stage in the Government's stepped program is to assist low income earners as a priority. There have been recent changes to assist the middle income earners. Of course we have appreciated the contribution that people have made. We have had tough times-left to us after the seven years of Fraser Government. The Hawke Government has redressed those tough times and has asked everybody in Australia to take part in that recovery. So they have, with fairness, honour and dignity. </PARA>
<PARA> The worst thing about the Opposition's program is not so much that its figures are funny or that it is targeting middle-class families, but that it insists on going back to the policies of disgusting division, of singling out the people who have to be kicked and blamed in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance before the Senate this afternoon states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need for the Government to implement as a matter of urgency the Liberal and National Parties' Economic Action Plan to relieve the unfair burdens on Australian families and provide a basis for sustained national recovery. </PARA>
<PARA>This focuses on the twin elements of how our recently announced Economic Action Plan would, first, help Australian families and, secondly, help to rescue the Australian economy from the parlous state to which it has been reduced purely as a result of the policies of the Hawke-Keating-Kelty Government. My colleagues Senator Lewis and Senator Stone have already dealt with the broad issues of the economy. They have demonstrated how this package would constitute a major attack upon inflation, how it would have a major impact in bringing about the reduction of interest rates and how it would have a major effect on increasing incentives in the Australian economy-incentives to work, incentives to save, incentives to productivity and incentives to raise living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The responses that we have had so far from the Government in this debate have been absolutely pathetic. We had 15 or 20 minutes of disaggregated waffle from Senator Bolkus, who is the responsible Minister. His only contribution to public life in Australia has been to persuade Telecom Australia to introduce tamper-proof telephones. We had 15 minutes of equally disaggregated waffle from Senator Crowley, who has decided that, as one half of the Budget is called outlays, the other half of the Budget must of necessity be called inlays-the sort of economics that one would expect from a Balmain basket weaver. She told us that the tax cuts of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) were, firstly, funded, when they are totally unfunded, and, secondly-and probably the only correct thing that she said during the whole of her remarks-that they were `on a promise'. They certainly were on a promise! That is precisely what the Treasurer has been doing-promising to get everything right and promising to restore the Australian economy. Undoubtedly Senator Crowley knows all about being on a promise as far as these things are concerned. But, frankly, that is not a good enough basis for the conduct of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my intention this afternoon to deal with the family taxation package, which is an integral and an absolutely central part of the Economic Action Plan produced last Thursday by the Liberal and National parties. The coalition parties' family tax package comprises, firstly, a new program of child tax rebates, secondly, an increase in the eligibility threshold and a reduction in the withdrawal rate for the dependent spouse rebate and, thirdly, a new program of child- care tax rebates. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax rebates for children would be available for deduction against the tax liability of a sole parent or against the combined tax liability of both parents in two-parent families. It was our recognition of the legitimate sole parent component that had Senator Crowley in such a lather. The amount of child tax rebate that can be claimed would vary according to the number and age of children in each family. For example, a first child under the age of 13 would attract a rebate of $250 per annum and those aged 13, 14 and 15 would attract a rebate of $350 per annum. For the second and each subsequent child under the age of 13 the rebate would be $200 per annum and for the second and each subsequent child aged 13, 14 or 15 it would be $300 per annum. The cost of the child-care tax rebate reaches the figure of approximately $1,000m. </PARA>
<PARA> The dependent spouse rebate is to be changed in two ways. Currently, where the dependent spouse derives separate net income, the maximum rate is reduced by $1 for every complete $4 by which the separate net income exceeds $282. The eligibility threshold would be raised from the current level of $282 to $1,000 and the withdrawal rate would be eased. So, where a spouse's net income is up to $1,000, the dependent spouse rebate would be $1,000 per annum without children and $1,200 with children. Eligibility for the dependent spouse rebate would fall by $1 for every $6 by which the dependent spouse's separate net income exceeds $1,000. The cost to revenue would be about $200m. </PARA>
<PARA> The child-care tax rebate would be available for deduction against the tax liability of a sole parent or against tax calculated on the secondary earner's income in two-parent families. A rebate of $20 per week would be paid for the first child under five years of age. For each other child under five years and for each child aged between five and 12 the rebate would be $10 per week. For couples, rebates would be paid only where the second earner's income is derived from wage, salary or self-employment income and where that income exceeds the relevant tax-free threshold. For example, a parent who earns more than the tax-free threshold and has one child under five, assuming four weeks' annual leave, would receive $960 a year. To receive the full rebate entitlement, child-care expenditure would have to be fully substantiated. That point is fair. However, payment of the rebate would not be restricted to formal child-care. As far as possible a range of child-care facilities would be eligible. The estimated cost of that child-care rebate package is $820m. </PARA>
<PARA> Why have families been particularly singled out and targeted as the key element in this recently announced package? It is because families have been the most disadvantaged, neglected and financially abused group in Australian society under the policies deliberately pursued by the Hawke-Keating-Kelty Government. One has only to look at a few of the comments that have been made in that regard in the last couple of years. In October 1988, the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) produced its report entitled Income Support Policies, Taxation and Incentives which drew attention to the fact that at that time the proportion of families with children in relative poverty had been higher during the 1980s than during the previous decade. It drew attention to the facts that low income families with children and individuals with families on low incomes and with high housing costs were among the neediest groups, and that the impact of high housing costs has continued because it is part of the Government's central economic strategy to keep interest rates at their highest level ever in Australia. Other research to which EPAC drew attention indicated that housing related poverty had continued to increase. A number of comments were made at that time and I draw attention to one by Peter Stephens in the Age in November 1988. In discussing the EPAC report he said:</PARA>
<PARA> To alleviate poverty among families (EPAC says families have done badly) the tax system should recognise the existence of children and compensate to some degree for the costs of raising a family. </PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely correct and central to what this package will do. In February this year the Institute of Family Studies issued a report entitled Families and Tax in 1989. I quote from the first paragraph of the summary:</PARA>
<PARA>Average tax rates have risen between 1976-77 and 1988-89 for all individuals and families with the exception of those on very high incomes and low income families with children. </PARA>
<PARA>The exceptions have been those on very high incomes, who basically constitute the new class of mates which this Government has been so assiduous in courting, and low income families with children. Let me remind Senator Crowley that the first important step taken to deal with the problems of low income families with children was not taken by the Hawke Labor Government but by the Fraser coalition Government when Senator Chaney as the Minister for Social Security introduced the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1982 and the start of the family income supplement program. The very basis upon which assistance to low income families is predicated grows from a program introduced by Senator Chaney and the Fraser coalition Government. The summary in the report from the Institute of Family Studies, referring to average weekly earnings, goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>In 1988-89 dollar terms, the same AWE family is now paying $30.80 per week more tax than they did 12 years ago compared to the twice AWE single person who is paying $18.88 more and the single person on four times AWE who is paying $105.32 less. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Since 1984-85, real disposable incomes have fallen sharply for all income units dependent on one income. The falls have ranged from $30.61 for single persons to $47.85 for couples with four children . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It further states:</PARA>
<PARA> `Bracket creep' has contributed to the rises in average tax rates for all taxpayers . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It concludes:</PARA>
<PARA> Tax cuts are justified for all taxpayers but the cuts should be especially targeted to middle income families, particularly those with children. </PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely what this package does. It attacks the problem of bracket creep by the policies which Senator Lewis and Senator Stone have indicated are central to this package, to this commitment, to return the profits of bracket creep to Australian taxpayers. It is no wonder that the reaction to this package has been as favourable as it has. The Daily Mirror says that this is a:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . radical strategy for returning to middle Australians (and particularly those with children) much of the ground they have lost in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA>The Daily Telegraph says:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Peacock's support for the family unit is admirable, a reinforcement of one of the strongest planks of Liberal philosophy in this era of the breakdown of traditional lifestyles. </PARA>
<PARA>Paul Kelly, writing in the Australian, draws attention to the considerable benefits to be gained. Daryl Dixon, writing in the Sydney Morning Herald, says:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Opposition has targeted the weakest parts of the Hawke-Labor tax policies-the reliance on bracket creep to raise revenue and the unfair treatment of families, especially those incurring child care outlays. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Robert Ray described this policy in here yesterday as bludging on the less well-off in our society and diverting income from them to the better off. He said that that is what the Opposition is doing. I will tell the Senate who is diverting income to whom. The Labor Party is diverting income to the less well-off called Rupert Murdoch. As announced by Senator Button today, another $1m or so will go to Rupert Murdoch. It is diverting income to the less well-off called Sir Peter Abeles, and the less well-off called Alan Bond. It put forward $30m to defend a sporting trophy. It is diverting income to the less well-off called Rothwells Ltd, the less well-off called Laurie Connell, the less well-off called the four large banks in this country and the less well-off called Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd, owned by an American multinational company, which used to be in the electorate of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). It is now in Mr Howe's electorate. This Government is taking $60m away from the poor and needy in this country to give as a handout to an American multinational company. That is what this Government's priorities are in terms of who is getting the money, who is getting the redistributed income. Let Mr Howe, as the Minister for Social Security, explain that to all the homeless youth and children in poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> You will remember, Madam Acting Deputy President, that there are no children in poverty in this country any longer because the Prime Minister has abolished that, not by doing anything about it but by changing the definition! Let him go out into the streets of Sydney at night and tell those kids living in the parks, sleeping on the streets, in genuine need and in genuine poverty, that there is no child poverty and that there is $60m for Kodak, $30m for Bond, a couple of million dollars for Abeles, a couple of million dollars for Murdoch, $200m for the banks and millions of dollars for Connell and Rothwells and all of the sleazy mates that the Labor Party has tucked away in the hollow logs around Western Australia and the rest of this country. Let him tell them what the impact of this package is as far as they are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of questions have been asked by the Government about this package in the two days that we have been sitting here so that Senator Bolkus can give his pre-arranged five-page statements. Senator Robert Ray made one feeble attempt today to talk about the Government contracting out costs and services. The Labor Party has not been able to lay a glove upon this package. Every commentator, every editorial, every writer and every analyst has demonstrated quite clearly the benefit that this package gives to Australian families. They have denounced the extent to which families and family living standards have been targeted, have been depressed, and have been driven down under the policies of the Hawke-Keating-Kelty Government. They have remarked on the relief families will get as a result of our package being put in place, as a result of the bracket creep decisions which we have announced, and as a result of funding our promises out of cuts in profligate government spending-not on the basis of overlaying inlays, as Senator Crowley would have it, with taxation deals which, as she described them, were on a promise from Mr Keating. That is why the package will succeed. That is why the Opposition will win the next Federal election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of public importance is the first opportunity we have had to make a parliamentary response to the Liberal Party's so-called Economic Action Plan. The Economic Action Plan represents the most cynical and immoral vote buying exercise in the history of Australian politics. It is a document based on prejudice and aimed at dividing the Australian community. The document claims to target the so-called forgotten people of Australian politics-the family. I was interested to read in the Sun-Herald on the weekend in the `Candid Comment' column by Peter Robinson a comment on this question of the forgotten people. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These voters, for some incomprehensible reason, are being dubbed ``the forgotten people''</PARA>
<PARA> What indescribable balderdash this is-a classic case of the inbred Canberra hothouse creating its own jargon remote from the realities of Australian life.</PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that this group of swinging voters must be the most-remembered ``forgotten people'' in the history of Australian politics. </PARA>
<PARA>He may or may not be right. However, I know that the Opposition's definition of families is very narrow indeed. The Opposition cares nothing about families who do not live in marginal electorates. The Opposition is very interested in families whom it defines as families of swinging voters, but outside that small number of families the Opposition could not care less. In our community there are all kinds of families-families from ethnic communities, Aboriginal families, sole parent families, families of the unemployed, those on low incomes and a whole range of other disadvantaged families. What interests me-and I am sure it will interest the Australian people-is what this Liberal policy means for ordinary Australians; the ones who do not have great property portfolios; the ones who do not have share portfolios; the ones whose sole source of income is their salary and their biggest investment is the family home. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important to compare the Hawke Government's record for families with these desperate promises of Mr Peacock and the Liberals' most recent leadership team. This Government has an effective social justice strategy, a strategy that is working. Even at a time of reduced and reducing government expenditure, the Hawke Government has continued funding to people and families in need. No-one with an ounce of credibility would say that the Labor Government was other than totally responsible in the manner it runs the country and manages the economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not count Senator Puplick and Senator Lewis as people of responsibility. They are certainly not people of credibility. According to Senator Lewis's own colleagues, he has so much credibility that, when it came to the inner leadership group of the Liberal Party who determined this Economic Action Plan, Mr Peacock, Senator Chaney, Dr Hewson, Mr Blunt and Senator Stone were the five people in the core group, and who was on the reserve bench? Senator Lewis was carrying the oranges, of course. They would not even let him into the group of five who determined this Economic Action Plan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government's record is there for all Australian families to see. It is a record to be proud of. This Government has created 1.6 million jobs; this Government has reformed the tax system; this Government has created 70,000 child-care places; this Government has bolstered family allowance payments; and this Government has introduced the family allowance supplement. Our record on behalf of Australian families cannot be questioned. We have the runs on the board. But I am afraid that the Opposition's so-called Economic Action Plan would throw all these achievements out the window. Of course, the fairness and equity of the Government's program would be lost. It is the old Liberal Party philosophy that we all know: assist the powerful, the rich and the wealthy in our community always at the expense of the powerless and the most disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> Coming from the State of New South Wales, I do not need reminding of what a Peacock Liberal-National Party alternative government would mean, at the household level, for ordinary Australians. In March 1988, many New South Wales voters blithely committed political suicide at the ballot box in the belief that there were no major differences between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party. Of course, many New South Wales voters believed that the Liberals would never carry out the more extreme promises that they made. They have not carried out too many of their promises, but their more extreme policies have been put into action. After 18 months of Greiner Government, after the loss of some 20,000 jobs in the New South Wales Public Service, after the creation of the newfangled, unmanned railway station, after the closure of thousands of hospital beds, after the breaking of some 150-plus pre-election promises, after the closing of dozens of viable government schools, after the implementation of policies which mean that decent and affordable housing is beyond the reach of the ordinary citizens of New South Wales, and after the breach of the promise that no Greiner State Government would increase State charges beyond the consumer price index, not to mention the destruction of the environment that the Greiner Government has been responsible for at the behest of Senator Stone's National Party mates, does anyone seriously believe that Andrew Peacock would be more trustworthy than Nick Greiner? Do we have any reason to believe that Andrew Peacock would deliver on any of his promises? Would Andrew Peacock show the same commitment to the Economic Action Plan as he showed loyalty to John Howard just a few months ago?</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, John Howard is no longer the Liberal Party Leader, but his economic views prevail in all elements of this Liberal Party Economic Action Plan. I suppose that it is not surprising because his one-time staffer, John Hewson, is there to keep the flame burning. Does anyone really believe that a powder puff like Andrew Peacock-or a feather puff as I am sure he will be called in the future-has a single strong view on economics or any other area of government activity? Of course not! Andrew Peacock cares only about winning the next election. It is the politics of expedience-cut $2 billion off the most needy in our community and, hopefully, redistribute it to the swinging voters. He figures that, if he does that, it will be a sufficient election bribe for him to become Prime Minister. As I have said, I believe that Andrew Peacock is just as trustworthy as Nick Greiner. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government recognises the needs of disadvantaged people. This Government is doing something about the plight of Aborigines-the most disadvantaged people in our community. What about Aboriginal families? Where do they figure in the Liberal Party's Economic Action Plan? Of course, the Liberal Party figures that there are not too many Aboriginal families in marginal seats. The Liberal Party's Economic Action Plan will have a monumental negative impact on the Aboriginal people in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's policy on Aboriginal affairs offers no new policy prescriptions; it merely proposes a savage reduction in funding. The programs targeted for the biggest reductions are the community infrastructure programs and the community development employment projects scheme. These programs are the very areas for which funding is directed at the most impoverished, disadvantaged and remote Aboriginal communities. Cuts in these programs will serve only to emphasise further the Opposition's determination to redistribute funding away from the most needy in Australian society without any thought for the consequences of its action. By any measure Aboriginals are the most disadvantaged people in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition speaks of reform of the structure and method of service delivery as a medium-term goal; yet it continues to oppose the fundamental reform envisaged by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission legislation as we have seen in the Senate over the last few days. One of the Liberals' most vicious proposals is to cut $23m from the Department of Employment, Education and Training for Aboriginal employment, education and training programs. This is full on the Liberal Party's strategy of hitting the most disadvantaged groups in our community. The Aboriginal unemployment rate is six times higher than the national rate. Aboriginal employment rates are half those for other Australians. The Aboriginal retention rate to year 12 is a third of the national retention rate. Only 85 per cent of Aboriginal children are receiving compulsory schooling compared with the national rate of almost 100 per cent. Participation rates in technical and further education, in higher education and in senior secondary education are only one-third of those of Australians generally. These proposed cuts-they will never be implemented because the Opposition will not win the next election-are incredibly short-sighted and will inevitably lead to higher government outlays on welfare and obviously reduce the prospects for Aboriginal people to reduce their dependency on welfare payments. In finishing, I refer to the Age editorial of 13 October 1989 headed `Clever politics, dubious economics'. It sums up very well the Economic Action Plan of the Opposition. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . all higher-income earners would benefit through the promised reduction of the top marginal rate and restructuring to a flatter two-tier system. this would be financed by a $2.7 billion drop in federal spending, largely from social security and welfare. The losers include the jobless, the disadvantaged, the sick and disabled and Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA>... ... ... </PARA>
<PARA>Its impact on Australian society would be to widen the gap between the haves and have-nots. Political cleverness, unfortunately, is not an admirable substitute for economic credibility or social justice. </PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely right. Lastly, the Canberra Times in its editorial calls it, quite properly, `Appeal to greed by Coalition'. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Peacock hopes that an appeal to greed will win him the Prime Ministership. </PARA>
<PARA>... ... ... </PARA>
<PARA>On the question of equity, the policy released yesterday falls wide of the mark. </PARA>
<PARA>... ... ... </PARA>
<PARA>The documents are high in rhetoric, especially on fairness for families. But doesn't Mr Peacock realise that Aborigines and the long-term unemployed come from families, too. </PARA>
<PARA>He realises it, but he could not care less. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Australian Democrat motion moved by Senator Coulter. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill, which we have been debating now for some time, is practical legislation which will, if implemented, enable the Aboriginal people to move towards self-government, self-management and self-determination. It will certainly result in regional councils containing councillors elected by Aboriginal people who will work towards aiding the Aboriginal people to move to self-management and self-determination at a local level. These regional councils will also be responsible for electing commissioners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The words in the motion moved by Senator Coulter would indeed be misleading if included in a preamble to this practically motivated legislation. As Senator Coulter said, it could lead people to believe that explicit in the legislation would be the results included in the motion itself. That is not necessarily the case. The legislation, as I have just said, provides the framework within which the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people can forge their own cultural, educational and financial destinies. </PARA>
<PARA> I found what Senator Puplick and Senator Tambling had to say earlier today about the words in this motion quite offensive. I believe that Senator Puplick, by semantic nitpicking in describing the words, was really expressing his opposition to the general substance of the words and the sentiments included in those words. As Senator Puplick said, the motion is not legislation, but I can assure Senator Puplick that the substance and sentiments included in this motion are of great importance to a large number of Aboriginal people with whom I have spoken at length. Senator Puplick believes that we have to feel guilty to accept these words. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is a matter of social justice at present, albeit in words only. Whether Senator Puplick, and presumably the coalition Opposition, can accept it or not, a lot of Aboriginal people feel dispossessed right now. They feel dispossessed not just of access to their former tribal lands but also of their language, culture, their self-esteem and, indeed, in many cases their essential being. We see very many tragic results of that today. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that coalition Opposition speakers to this Australian Democrat motion have revealed their real stance towards the Aboriginal people in this present debate. That stance is that it is better to argue in terms of semantics than to show any generosity of spirit towards our own Aboriginal people. In this case I can state quite categorically that members of the Opposition divorce themselves from the stance of the Catholic Social Justice Commission in Western Australia, the Anglican Social Responsibility Commission in Western Australia and the Uniting Church in Western Australia. All these bodies have made very strong statements in support of the Western Australian Nyungah Aboriginal people who seek continuous access to their former lands of importance and the sacred site where the old Swan brewery stands today. Paragraph (i) of the motion moved by Senator Coulter states that the Senate notes that:</PARA>
<PARA>the Australian people voted overwhelmingly to amend the Australian Constitution to provide the Parliament of the Commonwealth with power to make laws for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, this was to grant them citizenship. Senator Puplick said that he did not like the wording of that, so he is not going to vote for it. Paragraph (ii) states that the Senate notes that:</PARA>
<PARA>the people whose descendants are now known as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of Australia were the prior occupiers and original owners of this land . . . </PARA>
<PARA>They were here before the Europeans. That is what that says. Paragraph (iii) states:</PARA>
<PARA>they were dispossessed by subsequent European occupation and have no recognised rights over land yet recognised by the Courts, other than those granted or recognised by the Crown . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That happens to be true. Paragraph (iv) notes:</PARA>
<PARA>dispossession occurred without compensation and no serious attempt was made to reach a lasting and equitable agreement with them on the use of their land . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That also happens to be true, although happily there are now some agreements being made. I suggest that these are by no means lasting or equitable at present. Paragraph (v) states:</PARA>
<PARA>as a consequence of these and subsequent deprivations, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have become, as a group, the most disadvantaged in Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA>Whether Senator Puplick likes it or not, I would put it to him that that statement is certainly true. Paragraph (vi) notes:</PARA>
<PARA>it is the intention of the people of Australia to make provision for rectification, by measures referred to in legislation and such measures as are agreed by Parliament from time to time, of the consequences of past injustices and to ensure for all time that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples receive that full recognition and status within the Australian nation to which history, their prior ownership and occupation of the land, and their rich and diverse culture, fully entitle them to aspire . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I really cannot see how that motion of intent could be objected to, bearing in mind the past paragraphs in this particular motion. Paragraph (vii) states:</PARA>
<PARA>it is also the wish of the people of Australia that there be reached with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples a real and lasting reconciliation of these matters . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Puplick took particular objection to the term `lasting reconciliation'. However, where we have ethnic or indigenous minorities in a nation we either have revolution, continuous bubbling unrest or a real and lasting reconciliation. I believe that at present it is inevitable that books such as Sally Morgan's My Place will be written. For those honourable senators who have not read it, Sally Morgan describes how her mother and her grandmother felt obliged to deny their Aboriginality for fear of being discriminated against and for fear of the most cruel kind of discrimination, that is, having their children removed from them. When we read the recent history-when I say `recent history' I mean going back over the last few years-of these sorts of feelings still being there because of incidents which occurred up to a mere 20 years ago, obviously people feel the need for a lasting reconciliation. Paragraph (viii) states:</PARA>
<PARA>it is the firm objective of the people of Australia that policies and programs be maintained and developed by the Governments of the Commonwealth, the States and Territories, that will overcome the economic and social disadvantages of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, entitle them to the enjoyment of their culture and recognition of their traditional laws wherever practicable, and enable them, with pride and dignity, to achieve full recognition and status within the Australian nation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I cannot see how anyone could disagree with that statement. Paragraph (ix) states:</PARA>
<PARA>it is appropriate to establish measures for the furtherance of the aforementioned objective that are consistent with the aims of self-determination and self-management for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples within the Australian nation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legislation itself is such a measure. It is certainly consistent with the aim of self-determination and self-management of our indigenous peoples. Other measures may need to be set up and in that case should be supported. Finally, paragraph (x) states:</PARA>
<PARA>the Australian Government has given effect to its long-standing commitment to protect the rights of all of its citizens, and in particular its indigenous peoples, by recognising international standards for the protection of universal human rights and fundamental freedoms through the ratification of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and other standard-setting instruments such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenants on Economic Social and Cultural Rights and on Civil and Political Rights . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Again that is simply a statement of fact. Australia is a signatory to these conventions. Therefore, it is correct that we should follow them through. Part (b) of the motion states that the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA>declares that an instrument of understanding and reconciliation with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples should be negotiated by the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats firmly believe that this particular move should be thoroughly explored. As Senator Coulter said, there have been various ways suggested of doing this and various names for such an understanding-a makarrata and so on. Some names have been found to be objectionable by some people. I believe that this is a measure that should be thoroughly explored. This is the right time to make this move. </PARA>
<PARA> I was disappointed earlier to find the degree of abuse that has passed from one side of the chamber to the other during this debate because in the early stages of the debate it did seem that we were really seeing democracy in action and the various clauses were being debated sensibly and rationally. So far the debate on this particular motion moved by Senator Coulter has not been totally rational. I look forward to hearing what further speakers from the Opposition will have to say on this score because I believe that they are doing themselves and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia a very great disservice if they cannot vote for this motion put forward by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this stage of the debate I want very briefly to support the remarks made earlier today by my colleagues Senator Puplick and Senator Tambling in respect of the motion moved by Senator Coulter to excise the preamble from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill and have it put in place by way of a separate motion of the Senate. As Senator Puplick said on behalf of the Opposition, the Opposition agrees with Senator Coulter's proposal to remove the preamble from the Bill. From the outset we have argued that that preamble should not for legal and a whole host of other reasons be part of a Bill of this nature. It is not just for that reason that we are opposed to the preamble's inclusion in the Bill; we are opposed to its inclusion because of its content and the proposed motion itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the detail of the motion, Senator Puplick made most of the points that I would have wanted to make today. There are two broad sections of the motion. The first is a noting section and the second is a declaration proposal that an instrument of understanding and reconciliation with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples should be negotiated by the Australian Government. In other words, the proposal for a treaty, compact or makarrata-whatever one may wish to call it-has surfaced yet again. Part (b) of the Australian Democrats' motion flows from the 10 preambular points contained under part (a) of the motion. As Senator Puplick put so cogently today, we are in grave disagreement-the strongest possible disagreement-with all of the paragraphs of part (a) of Senator Coulter's motion. The whole tone is negative and divisive. The motion smacks of separatism of the worst possible kind in a nation where surely the goals and objectives of us all should be to work together as a cohesive nation to solve the problems of those who are most disadvantaged amongst us. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not aware of any dispute from any quarter in Australia that parts of the Aboriginal community are without any doubt among the most disadvantaged in our society. But the way to tackle the problem that is implied in Senator Coulter's motion is to me the very worst possible way that one could go about attempting to solve the problem. The content of Senator Coulter's motion, which is taken straight from the preamble to the Bill, is of crucial importance because it gives the flavour of the motives behind the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) legislation as a whole. To excise the preamble from the Bill does not in any way change that motivation and the way in which it will be read. </PARA>
<PARA> As we have all seen, the preamble recites the prior ownership of Australia by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It also refers to their dispossession without compensation or agreement and to the current disadvantaged position they occupy within Australian society. The Opposition certainly accepts and fully agrees with that point. I and other members of the Opposition have several concerns about the motion. As Senator Puplick and others have said, the motion is not correct. It is not based on historical fact. It is highly negative; there is no positive approach at all in the motion, which looks back with anger and bitterness at the past but offers no hope or prospect for the present or the future. That is a very sad, unfortunate and wrong way to go about solving the problems that confront the Aboriginal communities and the Torres Strait Islander communities in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The preamble is absolute nonsense. The argument that all Aboriginal people of Australia blame the white men of yesteryear for their cruelty towards Aboriginal tribal ancestors is, as has been said by a leading spokesman for Aborigines in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, an absolute falsehood so far as the Aboriginal people themselves are concerned. The preamble also touches on and goes right to the doctrine of terra nullius, again a matter of very considerable importance. The first three clauses of the preamble suggest that European settlement in Australia was a thoughtless and unjust invasion and that thereby the Aborigines have been dispossessed. The preamble gives the impression that Captain Cook and Governor Phillip acted in an illegal and unjust way in taking possession of land by proclamation and settlement. It is also a de facto attack on the doctrine of terra nullius and eighteenth century international law and doctrine. I do not want to get into a debate on this now but I raise it to point to the negative approach of Senator Coulter's motion which was moved on behalf of the Australian Democrats. In terms of coming to grips with the real problems and issues that face the Aboriginal communities and Aboriginal people of Australia it is about time that we in this country started to look positively at these issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Once the Parliament agrees to the words in Senator Coulter's motion or in the preamble we will find it extremely difficult for this or any subsequent government-unless it is prepared to display quite unusual and sustained resolve and political will over a considerable time-to reverse the momentum and wind down the expectations which this motion will create for the development of separatism in this nation-a separate nation within a nation-and the divisiveness that will bring. The motion boils down to nothing short of an advocacy of a form of apartheid in this country which I think every Australian would find abhorrent. I join my colleagues on this side of the chamber in rejecting absolutely and totally the tone, nature and specific content of the wording of this motion. It would be a very sad day indeed for this nation if the motion in its new form or the preamble to the Bill were to pass through this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Short has just expressed a misgiving that the words in the proposed resolution or the preamble might be the precursor to, or somehow herald, a system of apartheid. I think he used that very word in respect of relations between Australians in this great Commonwealth. I think that Senator Short is wrong in any thought of separatism of that kind being found in the language of the preamble of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill 1989 or the proposed resolution. I think Senator Short is straining the language terribly. It has to be emphasised that whether the words become part of the preamble to the important enactment with which we are dealing or become a parliamentary resolution or simply a resolution of the Senate they have to be seen firmly in the context of a resolution of the Australian Parliament or a preamble to an enactment of the Australian Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important to keep on emphasising that we are all Australians, united in one indissoluble federal Commonwealth as stated in the preamble to our own Constitution. It cannot be said often enough that that indissoluble federal Commonwealth has but one sovereignty, and that is as expressed in this Parliament by the elected representatives of all the Australian people. That paramount sovereignty which resides here is recognised in a sense in the making of a resolution of the Parliament dealing with these matters or in putting in a preamble to an enactment of the Parliament. Nothing in the statute before us or, I believe, in the wording of the proposed resolution that Senator Coulter has put to this chamber intentionally or inadvertently creates a situation of dual sovereignty, apartheid or separatism, to use Senator Short's milder word. We certainly do not want ATSIC-and I have emphasised this on occasion during the debate-to become a black parliament. It is not to be vested with the sorts of powers that one would equate with a parliament. I do not believe that any Australian would tolerate for one moment the creation, by resolution, preamble or, certainly, enactment, of a situation in which dual sovereignty was allowed to creep into our society. There is but one nation, one indissoluble federal Commonwealth, in which all the peoples of Australia are united. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that if one looks at the language employed by Senator Coulter, or contained in the preamble, one will find that it builds on foundations which have already been laid in various resolutions of this Parliament. In fact, I recall Senator Bonner's resolution of 20 February 1975. I was not a member of this chamber at the time, but honourable senators will recall that unanimous resolution of the Senate to this effect:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate accepts the fact that the indigenous people of Australia, now known as Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, were in possession of this entire nation prior to the 1788 First Fleet landing at Botany Bay, urges the Australian Government to admit prior ownership by the said indigenous people, and introduce legislation to compensate the people now known as Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders for dispossession of their land. </PARA>
<PARA>That motion was moved by a most eminent Aboriginal Australian, Neville Bonner, for whom I know we all have tremendous affection and respect. The sort of language to be found in that motion, unanimously passed by the Senate, is, as I say, the true foundation for the sort of language to be found in the preamble or motion now before the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick has made some criticism that the language in the motion builds on the foundation of the Bonner resolution. Once again, I think this criticism is somewhat strained. I can see some of the points that he is making and I do not deny the validity of some of the colouring which he sought to attach to some of the language. Senator Puplick was greatly concerned about the idea of occupation. Although the word `occupation' is not found in the Bonner resolution, one finds that the Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders are spoken of as being in possession of this entire nation prior to the 1788 First Fleet landing at Botany Bay. I believe that the words `prior occupation' in the preamble are used in the same way and do not relate to the matters about which Senator Puplick sought aid from an historian or a professor of anthropology. Even he conceded that the first inhabitants of this continent were, I think he said, very distant ancestors of the present Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. But the question is really, prior to what? They are the occupiers prior to European settlement, and that is made clear in the next recital. I think there is no doubt about their dispossession, in a physical sense, from areas and tracts of Australia which were their exclusive responsibility and over which they exercised rights. </PARA>
<PARA> I have tried to use the language of rights and responsibility. I concede this point to Senator Puplick: it is hard to find language understandable by non-Aboriginal persons which we can all employ to convey the meaning of the relationship of Aboriginal persons to the land. The word `ownership', I suppose, normally has a feudal lineage and conveys certain meanings such as `freehold title'. Indeed, the Crown is the ultimate owner of all land in our system. But I think `ownership' is not a bad word to use when one is trying to convey to all Australians, through this motion or preamble, the notion that the Aboriginal people had a relationship to the land which was an exclusive responsibility for the sites which they had to tend or which provided areas for hunting and foraging which groups, clans or tribes required to sustain their physical being. Both their physical and spiritual needs, in so far as they can be differentiated-and it is difficult for us to differentiate our physical and spiritual needs-required a special relationship with a tract of land and the idea of ownership, while somewhat crude, can be seen to be a useful way of describing that exclusive relationship. For that reason, it is used in the preamble. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick was worried about the idea that some of these rights over land are said to be not only granted by but also recognised by the Crown. I think that is a fair expression because it is common on some of the pastoral leases in the Northern Territory and Western Australia-the Temporary Chairman may nod, if not speak, if I am correct-for hunting and foraging rights to be reserved for traditional communities. A right over land, not a land right in the sense of title, would be recognised by the Crown in the giving of those leases. I think that might be an example to which the preamble properly points. </PARA>
<PARA> The most difficult point brought up by Senator Puplick, who I take to be the spokesman for the coalition in respect of the motion or the preamble, is the question of collective guilt. I happen to share Senator Puplick's view that individual Australians of our generation do not bear personal guilt for past injustices done to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In so far as that is suggested, it is a quite unfair burden to place on the shoulders of those of our generation. But I think it has to be recognised that we are the beneficiaries of a society which was able to accumulate its common wealth-whether one is talking in a strictly financial sense or about the general, social and political life we lead-on a basis, as we are all aware, of initial dispossession, marginalising, and the disruption of Aboriginal life which has led to the present situation of grave disadvantage in which Aboriginals find themselves. That sense of responsibility to the persons who currently suffer grave disadvantage-generated, as it has been, by that initial dispossession, disruption and displacement-is really what is behind the idea of some collective responsibility which is focused on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We are the beneficiaries-the legatees-of much that went before. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that many Aboriginal people themselves are able to point, within their own recent family experiences, to the terrible injustices, of marginalisation and being treated as subhumans. It is amazing that more of them do not bear the sort of malice which would lend itself to violence in view of the consequences of this disruption to their families and the recent history of such terrible injustice. Perhaps it may be that because of their personalities they have been able to deal with these consequences. We have been spared the violence which might have otherwise been our due from a people other than the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. They have been really remarkably forgiving. Only last week, on Friday, 13 October, I read a letter to the Australian newspaper and sent from Rodney Rivers of Toowoomba. I will read it to the Committee:</PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia during the 1930s, my grandmother-a full-blood Aborigine but married to a white man-was separated, rounded up by police on horseback at Landsdowne Station and made to walk to Fitzroy Crossing in chains with her sister for about three days over rough terrain. </PARA>
<PARA> The police in those days were only obeying orders. Gran and my great-aunt had chains around their wrists and necks. They were linked to each other by a chain from neck to neck. </PARA>
<PARA> At nightfall when the police set up camp, Gran and my aunt had chains tied around their ankles to prevent them escaping. My mother, who was then a child, followed them to Fitzroy. </PARA>
<PARA> A few years later at Fitzroy Crossing, my mother-then seven years old-was separated from Gran and taken away to Moola Boola, a government settlement 100 miles east of Fitzroy. Mum grew up there, married and raised a family. In 1955, Moola Boola closed down and I was sent away as a boy on the back of an old blitz truck to a mission station near Fitzroy Crossing. I remained there for five years. During that time I was reunited with my mother, and later with Gran, who died in 1957. </PARA>
<PARA>What a remarkable recent history. Many thousands of Aboriginal persons could point to similar situations in their family lives which led to their present grave disadvantage. Yet the following paragraphs are even more remarkable:</PARA>
<PARA> We do not hold or harbour grudges or ill feelings towards those who treated us unkindly in the past. They are forgiven. Certainly, we cannot condone what happened in the past-but neither can we condemn the innocent white race of today and try to force them to pay restitution for events they played no part in. We of today are responsible for the present and for the future, not for the past. He or she who does not forgive, breaks the bridge over which they too some day have to cross, for each one of us needs to be forgiven!</PARA>
<PARA> My story is only one of hundreds of Aborigines who have suffered similar circumstances in the past, but who have also forgiven. </PARA>
<PARA>We can rectify present day consequences of past injustices. It is true that the past injustices cannot be put to right; no restitution can be made to those earlier victims. But there are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons and communities living out those consequences at present to whom we have a special responsibility. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In that situation the Parliament is now called upon to pass the motion. Naturally the Government would prefer that the substantive words be found in the preambular form which we first put to the Committee. I found Senator Coulter's statement rather extraordinary. He said that the preamble was misleading, deceptive and immoral. I thought that that was rather intemperate and strong. If he meant it in relation to the actual substantial parts of the preamble, of course that would condemn his motion. So I take it that he does not mean that. He must be referring to the fact that it has no legal force or effect. But there has never been any attempt-in fact the attempt has been all the other way, that is, to emphasise, whether in the second reading speech or in other public forums, that the preamble is indeed not of legal force and effect in the normal way, that it is not part of the enactment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is part of the history of our parliaments that the social setting which explains a statute of significance or the mischief which it seeks to remedy is set out in a preamble in order to provide in the statute books an indication to future generations of the sorts of considerations which led the parliament to make the enactment which it has. In so far as the second reading speech makes clear the sort of status which we wish to ascribe to this preamble and re-emphasise for the benefit of any future court that might ever be tempted to look at the preamble at the invitation of some litigant, we have made clear the position and certainly do not intend to mislead or be deceptive in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> Historically, preambles have a very real role to play. When one has a statute of this significance, the placing of these words, with which Senator Coulter agrees, in a preamble can be clearly justified. However these words emerge from the Committee, they are important. They will always be related, even if not in preambular form, to the passage of this legislation which, as the debate draws to its close, I believe will eventually find favour, or at least a majority vote, in its passage in this Committee and in the Senate as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> In that situation we are well poised then to throw the challenge from this Parliament to all those involved, whether they be descendants of the original inhabitants, descendants of the convicts and settlers to whom Senator Puplick referred, or to the new waves of migrants or refugees who have come to this country-all Australians united in one indissoluble federal Commonwealth with one sovereignty and being one nation. We will have to respond to the challenge of this legislation to create for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples within our one nation a future which is indeed worthy of their human dignity. I believe that this legislation, this Parliament and all the Australian people will respond to that challenge in a way that ensures that human dignity is indeed recognised and enhanced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly to make two or three comments only on the matter now before the Committee. The first relates to the argument to which Senator Tate has just been addressing himself. It relates to the presence in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill of this preamble, which we are now debating. If Senator Tate is correct in saying that it was never intended that the preamble have any legal effect, there is no place for it in the Bill. A Bill is a legal document, certainly a document with legal consequences. The thought that one can tart up Bills with learned dispositions, whether accurate or, in this case, inaccurate, simply for effect or for some public relations purpose, is nonsense. We should recognise it as such.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proper place for this chamber to express a view about the matters contained in this preamble, if it is to express such a view, is in a resolution of the chamber. That is indeed the course which Senator Coulter has taken. Either the preamble has legal and interpretative force, in which case it would be properly placed in the Bill, although I would object strongly to it being there, or it has no legal force, in which case it has no place in the Bill. That is a very clear cut-I hesitate to say black and white-argument. Its outcome is crystal clear. Senator Tate has said quite clearly that in his view it has no legal force. Therefore, on the basis of his statement, it ought not be in the Bill. At least that is my view. </PARA>
<PARA> I now come to the terms of the preamble and Senator Coulter's motion. I do not want to take the time of the Committee at this late stage in our deliberations on this very large and complex piece of legislation by going over ground which has already been particularly well covered by Senator Puplick and other speakers from this side of the chamber. But it is important to say, simply in my capacity as Leader of the National Party here, that many of the aspects of the preamble, and indeed of the motion to come before us, would be objected to most strongly by the people whom I represent, not merely National Party voters but the people of Queensland. I would even go so far as to say that in that respect the people of Queensland are no different from most people in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> When one finds emotive language of the kind contained in this preamble and/or resolution-whatever the Committee determines it to be in the end-which openly invites the raking up of the very kinds of old scores which Senator Tate, in quoting from that very moving and impressive letter a moment ago, was agreeing should be laid to rest, one sees that it is simply laying the foundations for future trouble. I do not want to take up the time of the Committee by speaking to the particular paragraphs of the preamble or the motion in detail. I am happy to let that aspect of my comments rest there. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate read to the Committee a letter from a gentleman in Toowoomba. I am very glad that he did so. I noticed that letter in the Australian a day or two ago. I had meant to bring it into the chamber this evening, but, in the rush of doing other things, I omitted to do so. One lesson that I draw from that letter in relation to the matters which were the subject of Senator Tate's remarks a moment ago, the great bulk of which I agreed with, is that government had nothing to do with that gentleman's reconciliation and coming to terms with his fellow Australians. That gentleman has done us a great service by writing that letter and putting on record not only the wrongs that were done to his family but also the manner in which he has approached the historical burden, if you like, which those wrongs placed on him. </PARA>
<PARA> Over a long period in public service, I have not noticed governments do much good in matters of this kind. That is why in the end I do not have any time for this whole elaborate construct of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission which the Minister has placed before us. I conclude by saying that I support the amendment to excise this preamble from the Bill and oppose the preamble in its resolution form. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my remarks to the matter of the motion being dealt with as a separate motion. Senator Tate has correctly drawn the conclusion that my remarks in relation to the placing of these words as part of the Bill related to the placing and not to the words themselves. Clearly, I have abstracted the words and used them in the separate motion. Senator Puplick has called this a pious motion. I guess that Senator Puplick means that it is a motion without any force and one which does not necessarily lead to any action. The honourable senator will have noted that the motion calls on the Government to do something, namely, to negotiate an instrument of reconciliation and understanding. So it certainly is not a pious motion. It presages a further action by the Government. If the Committee passes the motion, which I believe it will, we will be calling on the Government to proceed down that path.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need for such a course of action could not have been better illustrated than by Senator Puplick's remarks. He showed a remarkably superficial intellectual understanding of Aboriginal culture. He certainly has no emotional understanding of or commitment to Aboriginal culture. A few moments ago Senator Short remarked that the terms of the motion were wholly negative and would be seen as such. However, it seems to me that the context in which those statements are made is a context in which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people necessarily must become totally integrated in the mainstream culture, that there is no place whatsoever for a contribution from their unique and very valuable culture to a new and different Australian culture which incorporates elements of both the prevailing culture and that of the indigenous population. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick argued that this motion is divisive. I think that the very fact of this debate has illustrated how divided Australian society still is in relation to the two cultures. There are still two cultures in Australia. On the one hand, we have the Western, industrialist, exploitative, competitive, economic, growth oriented type culture. On the other hand, we have the indigenous culture-a culture which has lived with this country for at least 40,000 years-which is far more cooperative, healing and living with nature than living against nature. It seems clear that at the level of the two cultures and at the level of the effects on those two cultures, given what we now know of the environmental impact of our European approach, a confluence of these cultures-a melding of the cultures-and the emergence of a new culture are desperately needed. The instrument which we anticipate in the motion is an instrument of healing to lead towards that process. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite clearly the Opposition, from its remarks, does not share those views. It does not understand the very point that we are trying to make. The Opposition's view of reconciliation is one in which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders integrate totally in the mainstream culture. If one could invent a new and useful word, to be used in the same way as we use other words, such as `sexist' and `racist', it would be `culturist'. The Opposition's attitude is `culturist'. It accepts that the mainstream culture not only is dominant and superior but also should totally replace the culture of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick spoke of the need for housing for Aboriginal people. One would not argue with that. However, the cataloguing of those material needs which are seen predominantly as needs in a non-Aboriginal culture indicates again the attitude which the honourable senator has to the needs of Aboriginal people. One notes that the Opposition is preparing-if it forms government-to take $100m from the Aboriginal affairs areas, including $22m from the Government's infrastructure program which provides essential services such as water and sewerage. Therefore one has difficulty in accepting a real commitment even to those basic needs which are recognised as needs within the mainstream culture. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tambling again quoted Mr Charles Perkins. I cannot see how Senator Tambling can continue to do that, given that the Opposition, and Senator Tambling in particular, led the attack against Mr Perkins. The attack went on for some considerable time. There was nothing that that gentleman could do that the Opposition, and Senator Tambling in particular, saw any merit in whatsoever. Yet the Opposition now comes into this chamber-and Senator Tambling in particular-and quotes Mr Perkins and touts him as a font of wisdom and virtue because he said something on the ATSIC legislation which supports its case. It simply cannot have it both ways. </PARA>
<PARA> A point in passing I would like to pick up, because I did not pick it up earlier, concerns the preambles to two other Acts which have been passed by this Government, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act of 1987 and the Aboriginal Land (Lake Condah and Framlingham Forest) Act of 1987. Both of those Acts say specifically in their preambles that the Commonwealth does not acknowledge the matters acknowledged by the Government of Victoria. The Government of Victoria had acknowledged prior Aboriginal occupation and dispossession but the Federal Government, in the preambles to both of those Acts, failed to carry that through and, in fact, specifically dissociated itself from that acknowledgment. That, again, is a strong indication as to why this motion must be carried today. We must reverse the tendency which this Government has shown in the fairly recent past. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick also spoke in terms of not having any personal responsibility. He said, among other things, that he was not guilty, nor did he feel guilty, of the sins of his forebears or, indeed, the sins of previous possessors of Australia. He was referring to the non-Aboriginal possessors of Australia. I would certainly agree with Senator Puplick that guilt is a totally inappropriate emotion. Guilt is a very unproductive emotion. However, Senator Puplick and every other senator in this chamber are the inheritors of the advantages which accrued from that dispossession. Senator Tate referred to the same point. We are the inheritors of the advantages which have flowed from the acts of those who took this land from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. That, I believe, places a very great responsibility upon us, not because we feel guilty but because we are the inheritors of an advantage. Not only do we have the conditions described in the letter which was read out a few moments ago but we still have in our midst many descendants of the original inhabitants of the country who are severely disadvantaged by that same process which has advantaged us. So while guilt is not appropriate, certainly the picking up of responsibility is. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick went on to analyse the words of the motion bit by bit and took exception to certain words. He questioned whether `prior occupiers' referred to the first, second or third wave of Aboriginal occupation. It does not really matter. What it really means is that those people were the occupiers of this land before European occupation. Senator Puplick did not like the word `occupation', but he knows that probably everybody in this chamber owns and occupies land in a very Western sense. We buy and we sell land. We do not have the same commitment to land that the original occupiers of this land had. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, in writing a short form of words like this, one does not write a book of history. One does not attempt to use a sufficient number of words to define exactly what one means at every stage. One must, as it were, draw a line through this preamble or this motion and see what, in sum total, the motion and the preamble mean. In sum total one must be totally committed to the intention of those words. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick also took exception to the idea of land ownership. He quoted Professor Strehlow. Let me quote Professor Strehlow on the matter of ownership. I quote from Strehlow's `Central Australian region', page 44. I find these words very moving because they exactly underline the difference between the non-Aboriginal attitude to land and the Aboriginal attitude to land. Strehlow says:</PARA>
<PARA>My final comment on monototism-</PARA>
<PARA>that is a technical word, but I think it is self-explanatory-</PARA>
<PARA>relates to the sense of security based upon an inalienable right of personal land ownership which every individual derives from his conception site-</PARA>
<PARA>here he is talking about the Aranda people-</PARA>
<PARA>To every Aranda adult in the old days his conception site was `my home' . . . a place from which no-one could be debarred . . . his possession for as long as he lived. </PARA>
<PARA>What a marked difference between that attitude to land and the attitude to land which is exhibited by non-Aboriginal people. Clearly, the Aboriginal people in that sense have been dispossessed. They have been prevented from going back to their conception sites. `Dispossession' and `occupation' are absolutely the appropriate words to use. </PARA>
<PARA> The final remark I make is in relation to the handling of this motion when it gets to the House of Representatives. I make a plea to the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Hawke): a motion dealing with this matter was moved by the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives on the first day of sitting in this new Parliament House, and it would be very appropriate, when this resolution goes down to the House of Representatives, that it be put to the House not by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Gerry Hand, but by the Prime Minister of Australia. That would elevate it to the importance that it should have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak very briefly in the concluding stage of the debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill. I do not think there is much doubt that as time passes this legislation will be seen for the patronising legislation that it is. It is a great step backwards. One might well ask who the Government listened to in coming to its conclusions. Even at this late stage the Government ought to re-examine what it is doing, to take notice of some of the Aboriginal public servants who live and work in Canberra and who have been involved. I ask the Government to take notice particularly of the views of the National Aboriginal Professional and Business Women's Association which has made a statement on the legislation. It put out a media release on 27 September 1989. From my discussions with Miss Passmore, I understand that the Government has made no response to the Association's views. I shall not read all the press release put out by the members of the organisation, as I will seek to incorporate it. However, in conclusion, the document states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> An ATSIC Referendum would give a true indication by the people in favour of ATSIC if they voted for it-THAT'S ALL WE ASK, nothing more and nothing less. </PARA>
<PARA>The Association is very critical of the legislation. The Government ought to have listened to the views of women such as these. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the media release under the signature of Thomasisha Passmore dated 27 September 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>MEDIA RELEASE</PARA>
<PARA>WE SAY ``NO'' TO THE GOVERNMENTS ATSIC LEGISLATION</PARA>
<PARA>Members of the National Aboriginal Professional and Business Women's Association can no longer remain silent, passive and tolerant recipients of policies and programs the government and their officials have decided for us with the forthcoming ATSIC legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We are Aboriginal women of a proud heritage building a future with realistic targets which take into consideration our cultural role and active participation in decision-making. We have stepped forward to grasp new opportunities to make our own decisions, to make our voices heard and to make a positive and important contribution to our culture, economic and political life. We have sought a new dignity and pride in being Aboriginal women. We refuse to change our direction to promote, organise and foster activities in our environment that do not appeal to our needs, objectives or mission. </PARA>
<PARA> ATSIC is not what we want. We strongly support and have adapted to the economic, business and education climate and are working vigorously networking across the nation (and internationally) with professional and business people (black and white) to develop business interests that will give us independence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Aboriginal women of Australia are in fact the persons most competent to decide their own futures and destiny, and it certainly is not with ATSIC. We alone can feel our blood, emotional ties and duties. We are the ones with the leaky self-esteem and need economic independence as the confidence repair kit. Our thrust is to become owners of property and businesses. The hard earned dollar we have saved is our wealth-NOT ACCUMULATED FROM WELFARE OR GOVERNMENT HANDOUTS. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government's philosophy, rationale and criteria places a high priority on equal opportunity for Aboriginal women because they recognise that the Aboriginal women of Australia are the most disadvantaged of all Australian women. ATSIC doesn't give us equal status with non-Aboriginal Australia, it gives us welfare dependency. </PARA>
<PARA> We appeal to the Federal Government to hold a Referendum to clear all resistance to ATSIC which is crucial to its chances of success. The information about the numbers of supporters in the form of individuals and organisations supporting ATSIC is inadequate and unqualified. The referendum was overlooked when ATSIC plans were rumoured. It would demonstrate vision and communication by the Government to organise the referendum through the Electoral Commission as soon as practicable. </PARA>
<PARA> In the absence of the referendum, the rumour mill will go to work and non-cooperation will surface again, in the form of tense, hostile or antagonistic relationships between the Government and those against ATSIC. Power struggles will continue to develop between factions of Aboriginals for and against ATSIC and those persons attempting to protect themselves and their jobs in ATSIC. It will have long-term detrimental consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government is urged to demonstrate their thorough diagnostic and collaborative skill in such a simple equation. If a referendum were taken and the decision was made to go with ATSIC by the people in writing, it would end all assumptions, judgmental comments and negative feelings and perceptions as to the commencement of ATSIC. An ATSIC Referendum would give a true indication by the people in favour of ATSIC if they voted for it-THAT'S ALL WE ASK, nothing more and nothing less. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This third reading debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill will bring to an end a mammoth debate in this place. The Opposition will call for one division; as a matter of consistency we will do it on the ATSIC legislation. The Opposition has made clear throughout its opposition to the package. We have argued the case. We have put our reasons. It is not appropriate on the third reading, as honourable senators would tell me, to rehearse those reasons and I will not seek to do so. I indicate, however, that when the third reading vote is taken, we will call for a division on the ATSIC Bill. We will not call for divisions on the other two Bills, although our position remains quite clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation has been the main business before the Senate since the middle of August. It is now the middle of October. It has taken some two months. During that time, as one of the only two former Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs, it has fallen to my lot to have the carriage of the matter on behalf of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator. Until today the Senate had spent a few minutes short of 39 hours on this legislation. Today it has probably put another three or four hours into its careful consideration of the ATSIC legislation, making a total consideration in this place of probably a bit over 40 hours, which is a mammoth consideration by the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to take just a couple of moments to remind honourable senators that this is the way in which the Senate should operate. Unlike the House of Representatives, which is the Executive's House, we are the House of Parliament precisely because no government has had a majority here for most of the last 20 years. Governments that wish to have their legislation passed--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For most of the past 20 years. I was Whip when we had a majority and it was much easier. When one does not have a majority, it is necessary to negotiate and consider legislation. I do not wish at this late stage to earn the ire of my political opponents, but I wish to make a couple of quotes from Mr Odgers's book on Australian Senate Practice where he talks about the function of the Senate. He makes clear at page 3 that one of the functions of the Senate is to act as a House of review with the responsibility of expressing second opinions in relation to legislative and other proposals initiated in the House of Representatives. Mr Odgers goes on to put it in these terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In every walk of life-be it medicine, science or day-to-day family problems-the second opinion is sought and valued. So it is in government, where an Upper House acts as a brake on hasty legislation, imposes a period for reflection and provides an opportunity for anyone-the farmer, the banker, the industrialist, the representative of labour-to voice his opinion, support or protest regarding proposed legislation, after which the Upper House may make or suggest amendments to proposed laws. </PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on to talk about the Senate's committee system. Odgers goes on to discuss at some length criticisms which have been made of the Senate, and which I have heard recently, about its failure to function as a States House. I do not want to raise that argument. He goes on further to say at page 13:</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate's role as a House of review has not been challenged in like manner to its States House function. The accepted theory of Upper Houses is that they exist to apply the brakes to hasty legislation, to introduce a period of pause for second thought, to improve proposed legislation if the need be shown, and in a federal system to provide checks and balances on national and State issues. That two sieves must be better than one is an indisputable truth. It is one of the facts of Parliamentary life that the House of Representatives is more concerned with broad legislative policy than with detail and that it is in the Senate that the close examination of the clauses of bills takes place. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what has happened with this legislation. Whatever honourable senators can say, we have quite a notable achievement with this legislation. I have taken out from the Senate office a list of what were the most amended Bills of recent years. They include the Family Law Bill (No. 2) 1974, the Freedom of Information Bill 1981-I just interpolate that some of these were Bills when we were in government and some were Bills when Labor was in government-the Family Law Amendment Bill 1983, the Insurance Contracts Bill 1983, the Sex Discrimination Bill 1983, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1984, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Bill 1985, the Aboriginal Land Rights Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1987, the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Bill 1988, and the Copyright Amendment Bill 1988. To each of those Bills there were extensive amendments. Almost all of them were government amendments-whether the government was a Labor government, or a non-Labor government. For example, the Family Law Bill (No. 2) had 116 amendments inserted in the Senate, of which 104 came from the government of the day, the Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I can advise the Senate that on this package of Bills, as was reported by the Deputy President a few moments ago, a very large number of amendments have been accepted by the Government-91 amendments to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) Bill, 14 amendments to the Aboriginal Development Corporation Amendment Bill, and 17 amendments to the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Bill. Some of the amendments, particularly to the ATSIC Bill, have come from the Australian Democrats and some amendments have come from the Government, but the majority have come from the Opposition. This is the largest number of amendments that have been put into Bills by an Opposition in recent times. I seek leave of the Senate to have incorporated in Hansard a table, which I have shown the Minister and which sets out those most amended Bills. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition believes that this legislation is badly conceived and will not help Aboriginal people, but that argument is behind us. We have gone into the committee stage now complete with the object of doing our duty and trying to improve the legislation. It remains for me to thank a few people from this side. I thank my colleagues, who have assisted me in various ways, some by contributing as needed and some by not contributing. I would also like to make the observation that this has been assisted mightily by the fact that Senator Tate has been the Minister who has had the carriage of the legislation. I am reminded that when the Copyright Amendment Bill was amended extensively Senator Tate also had the carriage of that legislation. I would like to make known the thanks of the Opposition to Senator Tate for the way in which he has treated the Opposition's amendments. I would like to thank his advisers for the way in which they have assisted, and I would also like to thank the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for the help it has given to the Opposition in the work we have done. I repeat that we will oppose the third readings of the Bills, but will seek to divide only on the ATSIC legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-In speaking to the third reading, I simply want to make a few observations. It is very difficult not to sound a bit unctuous and not entirely convincing when one pays tributes in a chamber such as this which is given to conflict and to the drama of confrontation. I believe that the committee stage debate was conducted in an excellent spirit, and indeed the humour that broke through occasionally was necessary to relieve such a long debate from the perils of tedium and from the malice of a personal kind that can sometimes creep in. That was not the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that Senator Peter Baume handled the various amendments he put on behalf of the Opposition with great professionalism, as befits somebody who has been in the chamber for so many years. I believe that that tribute is one that would be paid by all members of the chamber. I thought that Senator Coulter remained extremely calm under quite a deal of provocation, particularly yesterday. On behalf of the Government, I wish to thank him not only for the support he has given to the essence of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill, but also for his rejection of the various amendments which were put by Senator Baume and which were such that they might have affected the way in which the essence of the Bill could have been implemented in a satisfactory way. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to pay a particular tribute to Giff Jones and Michael Dillon, who have been advising me, together with other members of the Department and of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. Their assistance has been invaluable to me personally and I believe were also made available to the Opposition from time to time. I wish to pay tribute to them for their advice given on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> Question put:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill 1989 be now read a third time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address briefly a matter that was mentioned in Estimates Committee B on 11 October 1989 relating to Royal Brunei Airlines Ltd crews. I hope Senator Collins will remain in here for a while as I wish to address some of the remarks he made. At page B214 of Estimates Committee B Hansard of that day, Senator Collins said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I noted Senator Panizza's claims that Royal Brunei crews had, in fact, exceeded their approved operational times and out of a healthy degree of self-interest, as a regular passenger on Royal Brunei Airline, I spoke to a number of Royal Brunei crews myself. I also spoke to the senior operations officer within Ansett responsible for scheduling and supervising the Royal Brunei operations. The story I got from both sources was absolutely consistent even though I spoke to them independently. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins did mention this today. I point out that I did not make any claim that the Royal Brunei crews had exceeded their operational times. I simply asked a question in this place on 6 October about whether it was correct or not. I asked it of Senator Button and to this day I have not had an answer. Senator Collins went on to say at the Estimates Committee:</PARA>
<PARA>I got a categorical denial from both Royal Brunei pilots themselves and from Ansett that there have been any breaches of regulations in this respect. </PARA>

<PARA>Senator Panizza's specific claim that a Royal Brunei crew had flown for 14 hours straight was categorically denied. I was told by Ansett that the longest scheduled period of flight that has been allowed so far for a Royal Brunei crew is 11 hours and 10 minutes, which was followed, as I understand, by a flight of six hours on the following day. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins would know that a scheduled flight may not arrive at the scheduled time of arrival. No fool will say that he has exceeded the scheduled time. Has Senator Collins ever been on a flight that has been held up because of strong winds, for instance? Has he not been on a flight from Canberra to Perth that has taken two hours longer than the scheduled time? Does Senator Collins not understand that that can happen?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not volunteer, but we can worry about that later. The Chairman of the Estimates Committee asked Senator Collins to make his statement a question. Senator Collins carried on for a while before he got around to asking the question. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question that I want to obviously ask is: Is the information that I have got from both sources correct? Is Senator Panizza's claim-</PARA>
<PARA>that is wrong; I asked a question and did not claim anything-</PARA>
<PARA>accurate that Royal Brunei crews have been breaching regulations?</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Lee answered:</PARA>
<PARA> We in the Bureau have not had any reports relating to that matter. I think the question of our standards versus overseas standards would be one for the CAA. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Freeland said:</PARA>
<PARA> If I may comment, it is also our understanding, as it is yours, that Royal Brunei operates under British standards. To my knowledge we have had no reports of breaching any of those standards-none. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator MacGibbon then said:</PARA>
<PARA> What Panizza said was that on one occasion-and is it true?-Royal Brunei operated a duty period of 14 hours 40 minutes on one day. He also went on to say-</PARA>
<PARA>in fact I did not go on to say; I asked a question-</PARA>
<PARA>that the airline is entitled to do that under British civil aviation regulations. He made the point in the question that there is a difference between the Australian duty periods and the British duty periods. I think that is where the matter ends. If Senator Collins can prove that on one day Royal Brunei did not fly a duty period of 14 hours 40 minutes, then that is another matter. The essence of that question was to illustrate that there is a difference in the periods of duty required for an Australian crew operating under CAA regulations from what applies for an overseas group. </PARA>
<PARA>The matter was discussed further. Apparently, a senior operations manager of Ansett Airlines of Australia said that the longest period of time that a Royal Brunei crew has ever flown in Australia is 11 hours 10 minutes. Senator Newman asked whether we could get that information verified. The transcript then reads:</PARA>
<PARA> CHAIRMAN-Is that something the officials are in a position to answer now, or is it something they can give us information about later?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Freeland-No, it is not. As has been mentioned, the oversight of that operation is by the British authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not by the CAA. The transcript continues:</PARA>
<PARA>If you wish, we could go and ask them if they have had any different reports. </PARA>
<PARA>That is where the matter rests. I have been through the rest of the Hansard and the question about whether that information could be verified was not answered and no answer has been given to this day. No answer has been given to the question I asked Senator Button in the last week or so about Royal Brunei. When I get those answers we will know what happened. In the meantime I ask Senator Collins to refrain from making statements saying that I claimed this and I claimed that when I simply asked a question. If we want to ask a question about somebody breaching regulations we should ask the Authority. We should not necessarily ask the pilots. They are not the be-all and end-all. We do not have to take their word for it. It is just like asking a thief, `Did you take it?'. Generally, he will say that he did not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A matter that concerns me and all members of the Commonwealth Public Service in Victoria is an apparent political pay-back to certain Commonwealth public servants in Victoria because they had the temerity recently to question some of the activities taking place in the Australian Electoral Commission in Victoria. On 15 May this year 34 divisional returning officers for the Federal electorates in Victoria wrote to the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr West, expressing their concern about the operations of a newly installed computer enrolment system called RMANS. It is a system specifically designed for terminal access. They pointed out in their letter that in several States, including Victoria, terminals have not been provided and that RMANS is currently used on a batch processing basis. The letter states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>For the following reasons the signatories to this request no longer have confidence in the accuracy of their electoral rolls . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is a fundamental lack of confidence because the state of the electoral roll is the whole basis for the propriety of elections. They said that because of the situation then prevailing:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) electors are being removed from the rolls for reasons unknown to the Divisional Returning Officers,</PARA>
<PARA>(2) there are unknown numbers of duplicated entries on the rolls as a result of mispunching, and</PARA>
<PARA>(3) many Divisions are reverting to outdated processing practices in an attempt to reduce the possibility of enrolment error. </PARA>
<PARA>Very serious allegations and concerns have been expressed in that letter of 15 May from 34 very responsible divisional returning officers in Victoria. On 18 May the Minister wrote a letter to all members and senators. It was addressed to `Dear Colleague'. He said that he had received a letter from returning officers for 34 Victorian divisions regarding electoral enrolment. The letter conveyed the response to the allegations that the Minister had received from the Commonwealth Electoral Commissioner. Of course, that letter found its way into the hands of the divisional returning officers and, as far as I know, it may have been sent to them directly. They were unsatisfied with the response by the Minister, so on 7 June they wrote him another letter in response to his letter of 18 May. I will not go into all the details but in that letter they say:</PARA>

<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA>Your urgent intervention in the following matter is requested. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Electoral Commission has recently introduced a computer enrolment system called RMANS, a system specifically designed for terminal access. </PARA>
<PARA>In several States, including Victoria, terminals have not been provided, and RMANS is currently used on a batch processing basis. </PARA>
<PARA>For the following reasons the signatories to this request no longer have confidence in the accuracy of their electoral rolls;</PARA>
<PARA> (1) electors are being removed from the rolls for reasons unknown to the Divisional Returning Officers,</PARA>
<PARA> (2) there are unknown numbers of duplicated entries on the rolls as a result of mispunching, and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) many Divisions are reverting to outdated processing practices in an attempt to reduce the possibility of enrolment error. </PARA>
<PARA>We have not attempted to highlight other problems associated with RMANS e.g. multiple acknowledg- ments of enrolment to electors, (up to five cards) as it is considered that the major problems must be addressed in the first instance.</PARA>
<PARA>The implications of these problems at a close of rolls for a Federal election would be apparent to you. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Colleague</PARA>
<PARA>I have received a letter from Returning Officers for 34 Victorian Divisions regarding electoral enrolment. I understand that a copy of this letter has been forwarded to you. I feel that it is important that I convey to you the following advice I have received from the Australian Electoral Commission:</PARA>
<PARA>``The recently introduced, computer enrolment system RMANS, to which the letter refers, replaces another computer system which was old and difficult to maintain and enhance. The new system was designed to run in State Head offices using batch processing. It was never designed specifically for terminal access from Division Offices as suggested in the letter. </PARA>
<PARA>In response to the specific points raised:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) Electors are being removed from the rolls for reasons unknown to the Divisional Returning Officers. </PARA>
<PARA>This is not so. In most cases electors are removed from rolls as a direct result of a DRO's action. When an elector enrols in any Division, the new system checks the national roll to determine whether or not the elector is currently enrolled elsewhere and automatically deletes the elector from the previous division's roll. Losing DROs are informed on a deletions report which advises them what has become of the deleted elector. </PARA>
<PARA>(2) There are unknown numbers of duplicated entries on the rolls as a result of mispunching</PARA>
<PARA>The introduction of RMANS has made this less likely. There will inevitably be duplicates under any system due to inconsistencies in key data provided by electors such as date of birth, order of given names and spelling of names. The number of duplicates resulting from mispunching should be no more under the new system than under the old. The rate of duplicates from causes other than punching errors in the new system is significantly lower than in the previous system. The AEC is also at present further enhancing RMANS to identify more accurately and eliminate possible duplicates. </PARA>
<PARA>(3) Many Divisions are reverting to outdated processing practices in an attempt to reduce the possibility of enrolment error</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Electoral Commission has been made aware of a redundant practice in some Divisions where claims for enrolment are checked against earlier microfiche records of enrolment before the claim cards are put into the system. There is no requirement for this procedure because RMANS does it automatically. The Australian Electoral Commission is writing to DROs to end this unnecessary practice, and to ensure DROs have a better understanding of the system. </PARA>
<PARA>The reference to multiple acknowledgments is a reference to an incident when duplicate acknowledgments were indeed sent to some Victorian electors in mid to late March this year. The problem which involved data transfer procedures between Canberra and Melbourne, not the enrolment system, was fixed. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Electoral Commission is happy to demonstrate the RMANS system at West Block for the information of Members, Senators and parties. Should you be interested in a demonstration, please contact the Electoral Commissioner (tel. 714400) to arrange a suitable time. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA>We refer to our fax of 15-5-89 concerning the Australian electoral Commissions new computer enrolment system called ``RMANS'', and your correspondence to members dated 18-5-89. </PARA>
<PARA> The information provided to you by the Commission is in some areas misleading and in others totally incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA> We note that the Commission has told you that RMANS was ``designed to run in State Head Offices using batch processing''. However, this advice appears to be contrary to the views expressed by the Commission in the following documents:</PARA>
<PARA>1986 ADP Strategic Plan produced by Computer Sciences of Australia Pty Ltd which was presented to the Minister of State in August 1985 (refer to attachment A)</PARA>
<PARA>the draft manual for the RMANS system</PARA>
<PARA>(refer to attachment B)</PARA>
<PARA>the A.E.C.'s Annual Report 1988 (Page 5)</PARA>
<PARA>(Refer to attachment C)</PARA>
<PARA> The Division of Melbourne is the only Division in Victoria that has been provided with a computer terminal and thus has direct access to the electoral roll master file. As a result, error reports for this Division contain less than 1% of entries generated for another comparative Division. Clearly, terminal access is essential for the production of a more accurate electoral roll. </PARA>
<PARA> The following comments are made in response to the Commission's replies to the points raised by us in our fax. </PARA>
<PARA> (1) Electors are being removed from the rolls for reasons unknown to the DRO's</PARA>
<PARA>The Commissions reply is selective and incorrect. Returning Officers are not worried about ``most'' cases. It is the remaining cases that are of concern. </PARA>
<PARA>This problem is occuring on an ongoing basis in every Division and we provide a small sample as attachment ``D''. It can clearly be seen that DRO's are not informed of the reasons for all deletions. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) There are unknown numbers of duplicated entries on the rolls as a result of mispunching. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commissions reply to this point relates to mismatching and not mispunching. Mispunching is causing duplicate entries on the rolls. Due to an increase in the number of input documents and now batch processing coding procedures a deterioration in the quality of data entry has occured. (Refer attachment E)</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Many Divisions are reverting to outdated processing practices in an attempt to reduce the possibility of enrolment error. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the old computer system (COM 11) Divisions had an initial reference point by way of State microfiche to check the enrolment status of electors. Any variance in elector details was detected at this point thereby preventing duplicate entries. Under RMANS, without terminal access, there is no initial point of reference, and therefore, errors are occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's response to the problem of multiple acknowledgments was to say that it had ``been fixed''. However, a sample check of acknowledgment cards received in Divisional offices on 25-5-89 has revealed that some Divisions had up to 500 duplicate cards. </PARA>
<PARA> Our initial concerns regarding the RMANS system still remain and were reinforced by the recent Local Government close to rolls in Victoria. Over one month after the close of rolls Divisional staff were still compiling manual lists of electors to be added or deleted from the master roll. </PARA>
<PARA> Documentation held at all Divisional Offices emphasizes the fact that there are major problems with the RMANS system. The following additional examples are provided:</PARA>
<PARA>electors are not only being removed from the roll to unknown Divisions but they are also apparently changing their surname and christian names completely, and in many cases, their sex (Refer to attachment F)</PARA>
<PARA>electors confirmed by our ADP section as being in the system have never appeared on an electoral roll additions list. </PARA>
<PARA>a new roll print recently ordered by one Division has, among other problems, electors enrolled for addresses that are not on the street file for that Division. </PARA>
<PARA>other miscellaneous matters (Refer to attachment G)</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, as the officers responsible for the maintenance of the electoral rolls in our respective Divisions, we inform you again that we hold grave concerns regarding the accuracy of the rolls under current operational procedures. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. My reasons for raising that correspondence tonight are two-fold. The first is to draw attention to serious concerns expressed by the divisional returning officers in Victoria about the state of the rolls in Victoria. With a Federal election coming up in the near future-at some stage between now and presumably the middle of next year-the state of the rolls is of the utmost importance. The Commonwealth Electoral Commissioner has said-and I do not doubt this; it is a fact-that a habitation review was undertaken in Victoria over the last 12 months or so, and that under the normal processes of the habitation review the rolls have been cleansed, to the extent that habitation reviews can cleanse rolls. Even if that is so and even if that habitation review produced a highly accurate roll review, the scope for computer error in deleting names from the rolls or causing other inaccuracies is a matter of considerable concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask the Minister for Local Government (Senator Reynolds), who is at the table tonight, to convey that matter to the Minister and to the Electoral Commissioner because I think it is demanding of an urgent response. Indeed, we have already had an example of the cost of computer errors to eligible voters. In the Victorian council elections in August 25,000, or thereabouts, eligible voters were disenfranchised, unable to vote at the council elections, because of these types of computer errors leading to their deletion from the rolls that the divisional returning officers have drawn attention to in the correspondence to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason why I have raised this matter tonight is another serious issue. As a result of this correspondence initiated by the divisional returning officers in Victoria, there appears to be a payback against them by the Labor Party in relation to the non-inclusion of any divisional returning staff in the Australian delegation that is shortly to go to Namibia as the observer team for the forthcoming Namibia elections. Mr Deputy President, as you may know, Australia is sending a team of 30 observers to Namibia in the next few weeks to join observers from many other countries to observe and, in some instances, take part in the actual conduct of the forthcoming elections in Namibia. I am told that about 1,000 observers from around the world will be at those elections. It is an important trip for observers and it is a particularly important trip for members of the Australian Electoral Commission. I understand that one senior member of the Commission, Mr Mike Maley, has been in Namibia since June, actually participating as an adviser in the run-up to the elections. As I have said, he will be joined by another 29 or 30 people, as observers, in the next few weeks. It is a plum trip; it is an important trip; and it is an important opportunity for Australian Electoral Commission personnel to gain valuable overseas experience. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been advised from Public Service sources in Victoria and elsewhere that no member of the staff of divisional returning officers in Victoria has been invited to join the team. Three persons from Victoria are part of the team but, as I understand it, none of those three comes from any of the divisional returning officers. It has been said by Public Service sources that the reason for this exclusion is political. It has been said by these sources that Victorian divisional staff are being punished for corresponding with the Minister and with other members of parliament about faults being experienced with computer equipment and, in particular, the failure to go ahead thoroughly and completely with the new RMANS system. </PARA>
<PARA> The omission of Victorian divisional staff from the team for Namibia appears to be a prime example of political or bureaucratic pettiness, or both. If the Minister has not been directly involved, I state categorically that he should carpet those responsible for this political payback. If he has been party to the decision he, too, stands condemned. The Australian contribution to this significant democratic event should not be allowed to become a junket for administrative favourites. It should be based on appropriate selection criteria. I want to know-and I ask the Minister whether she can convey this to the Minister for Administrative Services and to the Electoral Commission-the strength and the content of the allegations that I have raised tonight. As I have said, they are well based from sources within the Victorian Public Service. If those allegations are correct, both the Minister and the Commission deserve condemnation and this Senate certainly deserves an urgent explanation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many of my learned colleagues in the Senate have put down a book for a moment, reflected upon the times to which it relates and imagined the settings of the story being told. I ask my learned colleagues to stop and reflect upon the extraordinary times we live in today. In time to come some young historian will put down his or her book and imagine what it was like in such momentous times. The momentous events to which I refer are occurring in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. We are witnessing the tentative collapse, step by step, of the Marxist ideology and its communist system. Seventy-five years after the First World War and 50 years after the Second World War, the shape and direction of Europe are changing again. Poland has a democratically elected non-communist government; Hungary is to follow. The East German Government is losing its grip on its people with the exodus of its youth to the West; and the Baltic states and the Ukraine peoples are speaking out irreversibly for independence. Even the centre of the communist empire, the Soviet Union, has, to a qualified extent, freed up the press, held public elections and introduced free enterprise measures into the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These changes are affecting the politics of every continent. The most obvious examples are in the withdrawal of support and funding by the Soviet Union to many revolutionary and terrorist groups. It is almost as if, before the close of this century, the ledger is being balanced against the horrific effects of the two world wars and the subsequent aftermath, with a promise of peace and freedom into the next century. However, like any detailed study of historical events, it is often found that the turning points have been due only to good fortune. Perhaps some historians will tell us that many of the key events in history have been driven only by good fortune. I suggest that the moves towards democracy that we are witnessing in eastern Europe today could just as easily have been a time of great conflict in Europe, if not for a great deal of good fortune. </PARA>
<PARA> One should stop and remember what times were like in international politics between 1979 and 1984. In light of the nuclear age, it was potentially the darkest time in world history as it was the last gasp of the Soviet old guard before Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in 1985. By 1979 it was evident to the old guard in the Kremlin, who had ruled since the Leninist and Stalinist times, that the communist system was in terminal decay. The Soviet Union could simply not feed its people. This was my own conclusion following a visit to Russia and through Siberia in 1976. With a system in decline, yet in possession of an unprecedented military power, the old guard in the Kremlin knew nothing else but to strike out. </PARA>
<PARA> Afghanistan was invaded on 27 December 1979. The significance of the invasion lies in the fact that it put the Soviet forces only hours from the oilfields of the Persian Gulf, the blood supply of the economies of Europe, Japan and the United States. So great was the shock to the world of the invasion that it prompted President Carter to say about it:</PARA>
<PARA>A more dramatic change in my own opinion of what the Soviet Union's ultimate goals are than anything in the previous time I have been in office. </PARA>
<PARA>He added that, should the grander plan of the Soviets be to attack the oilfields of the Persian Gulf, he would have no choice but to deploy any means available, including nuclear means. The strength of this statement was significant in that the Carter Administration in its term had allowed the Soviets to gain a military superiority and was in the midst of the demoralising Iran-United States hostage crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall my visit to Afghanistan in 1979, just prior to the invasion. People came up to me in the streets pleading for help from the West as the Russians were poised to invade. The feeling of desperation that sweeps through a people who are about to lose their country is something I will never forget. United States intelligence must have been aware of the imminent invasion. However, the Kremlin under Brezhnev took advantage of the weakened United States Administration. Did the Kremlin have a grander plan of taking the Persian Gulf oilfields? It seems highly likely that this was the plan by the Kremlin, certainly if the opportunity arose, and particularly in the light of the Soviet Union's own oil supply crisis at the time. Anyone who doubts the intent of old guard Marxists to protect their power should remember the reaction of the Chinese leaders towards the students in Tiananmen Square, even as the world watched on television. </PARA>
<PARA> Soon after the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, the Solidarity movement began to rise led by Lech Walesa, and undoubtedly inspired by the election of the Polish Pope in 1978. The election of a Polish Pope was an inspiration towards freedom in a country whose history is intertwined with its religion. The flame of freedom, probably foreseen by the Kremlin, had been lit; yet to the Kremlin Poland was of supreme military importance to the Soviet bloc as well as being a political influence upon the other Eastern European states. They could not lose Poland if communism was to survive. The world stage was then set for its most tense period of international relations since World War II. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1980 Ronald Reagan was elected President of the United States. Reagan's first action was the freeing of the United States hostages in Iran. This sent out the strongest message possible that America had lifted itself out of its morass of self-doubt in world affairs. It was more likely that Reagan's strong leadership in these days had more to do with halting any grander plan of the Soviets in Afghanistan than did any of Carter's earlier threats. The tide was turning on the Soviet leadership. Poland was cracking, America was strengthening and Afghanistan was bogged down. However, the old guard was still in power in Russia and Brezhnev was their symbol. </PARA>
<PARA> Then in early 1981 two key events occurred which, if successful, I believe would have changed the course of today's events in Europe. The two events were the assassination attempt upon President Reagan outside the Washington Hilton in March 1981 and the assassination attempt upon Pope John Paul in St Peter's Square in May 1981. In both attempts the leaders were shot. Reagan was hit in the chest and required half his blood replaced. For a man in his seventies, this was an extraordinary strain. It would be an understatement to say that the assassination attempt was a near miss. The attempted assassination of Pope John Paul was probably more remarkable. The Pontiff was hit by three bullets. Yet, like Reagan, the Pope did not even sustain a permanent disability. A successful attempt upon Reagan's life at this early time in his presidency would have had a devastating effect for the Western world. </PARA>
<PARA> The years 1980 to 1984 required a special kind of leadership to confront the ailing and nervous Soviet empire. Reagan was the President for the times. His Vice-President, George Bush, could not have brought to the job the same vital skills that were needed in those crucial years of East-West relations. It was widely accepted that the assassination attempt upon the Pope was planned by the state of Bulgaria with the knowledge of the then KGB chief, Yuri Andropov.</PARA>
<PARA> Coincidentally, on the day of the Pope's assassination attempt the dramatic findings of the highly respected London based Institute of Strategic Studies were released. The Institute reported that the threats to the Soviet empire posed by unrest in Poland and the West-backed guerilla resistance in Afghanistan could soon lead to war with the West. The Institute said that securing its empire had become the Soviet Union's main preoccupation and that events in Poland threatened that domination. It reported that the Soviet leaders saw that time was running out and that solutions were hard to find. The assassination of the Polish Pope, John Paul, would have been a bitter moral blow to the Solidarity movement. A successful assassination attempt upon the Pope would, firstly, have stopped a papal-led resistance of the Polish people if Soviet troops had been sent into Poland and, secondly, would have prevented a papal-led rally of Western reaction to an invasion of Poland. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hungary and Poland uprisings in 1956 and the uprising in Czechoslovakia in 1968 would have been in the minds of Brezhnev and the other old guard Kremlin leaders. In those times the West bluffed and blustered how it would support uprisings in the Eastern Bloc countries. However, Soviet troops put down these uprisings in the face of Western rantings. The difference in the 1980s was that Poland had the support of a strong world leader in the West who would resist a Russian invasion. So it was only good fortune that saved us from a dark turn in world history. </PARA>
<PARA> The death of Brezhnev in 1982 did not see the end of the old guard's grip on power. Rather, Brezhnev was replaced by his protege, Yuri Andropov, who had been chief of the KGB for 15 years. The issue that followed the existing tensions between the East and West was the deployment of the Pershing missiles by the United States to Europe. These land-based missiles would give the Western Alliance an absolute first strike strategic advantage over the Soviets. The Kremlin, under Andropov, turned sharply contemptuous of the US Administration. The most vitriolic war of words in the history of East-West relations was launched. It was during this time, March 1983, that Reagan made his historic statement, describing the Soviet Union as an evil empire. Reagan warned that Soviet communism was `the focus of evil in the modern world'. </PARA>
<PARA> In September 1983 Andropov issued a personal statement that questioned the entire range of US-Soviet relations and accused the US of threatening peace and security around the globe. By November 1983 it was being widely reported by Moscow observers that we were closer to the nuclear brink than ever before. It was at this time that the Soviet Union began deploying near the coast of the US submarine-based nuclear missiles aimed at the US in response to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's decision to deploy the medium range missiles in Western Europe aimed at the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> As world events were reaching a dangerous crescendo a series of events struck the Kremlin hierarchy and finished the old guard control. These events can probably be described as bad fortune for the Kremlin. The Kremlin lost two leaders within 12 months. Firstly, Yuri Andropov died in February 1984. Secondly, Konstantin Chernenko died in March 1985. Then the Kremlin lost two of its key military personnel. Firstly, the Chief of Staff, Defence Forces, Semyon Romanov died on 22 May 1984. Secondly, the Minister for Defence Service, Vice-Marshal Dimitrii Ustinov, died on 20 December 1984. The Kremlin suffered the destruction of two of its key military installations. Firstly, on 13 May 1984 in Severomorsk the munitions base of the Soviet Arctic fleet was destroyed. Secondly, in December 1984 a second unexplained explosion at a major munitions factory around Leninek Kugnerskiy occurred. All those events occurred in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking back it would be fair to say that the rise of Mikhail Gorbachev was more a product of a Russia in 1985 utterly lacking any other option whatsoever than of any wisdom by the Politburo in choosing a new guard reformer. Rule under Mikhail Gorbachev is now set on its path but the good fortune in March and May of 1981 has played a critical role in the historic and ever-changing events of today. How quickly we forget events of only a few years ago, yet those years made our future years. If we keep this in mind we can then always be alert to the fine line in history between one course of events and another course of events and then be alert to holding on to the great future the world now looks forward to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate about the continued funding of abortions in Australia by the Federal Government has produced several stock arguments by those who support the Government's underwriting of the Australian abortion industry. Material which I have obtained from the Department of Community Services and Health during recent hearings by Senate Estimates committees puts paid to the underlying assumptions of most of those stock answers. No longer will members of Parliament and departmental officials be able to include these furphies in their replies to constituents and confidently expect to get away with it. Take the theory that all we need to do is throw millions of dollars in the direction of the family planning associations (FPAs) and this will result in a more responsible attitude about contraception and family spacing and will act as-I quote from an actual reply-`an important ameliorative measure'. Senator Button's stock reply to constituents also employs the FPA argument and in it he states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Government is actively promoting family planning, thus reducing women's need for termination of pregnancy services. </PARA>
<PARA>When Dr Blewett started to receive many letters on this subject he or his departmental officials worked out a standard reply which pursued this family planning theme and which stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government is acutely aware of the incidence of unwanted pregnancies and abortions in Australia and is committed to promoting family planning as an important ameliorative measure. </PARA>
<PARA>When the volume of mail increased even further the same text came out under the signature of various senior officials of the Minister's Department. When members of Parliament started directing letters which they were receiving from constituents to Dr Blewett for reply the Minister's private secretary very helpfully circulated a draft response which those members of Parliament who were gullible enough could put their name to and send direct to electors as representing their own original thoughts on the subject. The trouble is that this draft reply also relied on the family planning argument. The draft response from the Minister's office concludes:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government remains committed to promoting family planning to help women and families to plan their families, thereby reducing the need for termination of pregnancy. </PARA>
<PARA>What has been happening? Family planning organisations have been receiving generous funding from governments of all persuasions for several years now. While the FPAs might not actually perform abortions in their own clinics most of them are very much part of the abortion infrastructure in Australia. This explains why members of Parliament have received letters from FPAs criticising the Webster Bill. My remarks do not refer to natural family planning centres. </PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia, for example, family planning associations do not even bother to disguise the connections and thus in one part of the Perth telephone directory one can find an entry for the telephone information service of the FPA of Western Australia and in another section the same telephone number is used for the separate listing for the abortion information and counselling services. The more financially secure the FPAs become, the more the abortion mentality becomes entrenched. Rather than reducing our high abortion rate, the money paid by the Government to FPAs has helped to maintain our high abortion rate in Australia. If the Government's plausible sounding argument had any validity one would expect to see an inverse ratio between FPA funding and the abortion rate, but this has not happened. Prior to the recent Estimates committee meetings I asked the Department of Community Services and Health to provide me with figures and a graph for family planning funding for family planning associations between 1984-85 and 1988-89 and the payment for claims under Medicare item 6469 which is generally regarded as a measure of the incidence of abortion in Australia. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the table and the graph provided in reply by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>[Document not stored on database - see Hansard]</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The graph shows that, despite a rapidly growing allocation to FPAs during the past five years, item 6469, relating to abortions, shows that abortions have not decreased. Abortions have increased, as has taxpayer subsidisation thereof. The theory that extra family planning funds equals fewer abortions might have been a plausible sounding theory several years ago but all the money thrown at FPAs has not resulted in a decrease in the number of abortions. Rather, the reverse has occurred. Members of parliament who serve up this argument to their constituents are really treating them with disdain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another argument advanced by those who defend continued government funding is that if a medical procedure is legally able to be performed then the Federal Government is somehow obligated to pay Medicare benefits for it. There is a fundamental flaw in this argument, which has been used on occasions by Dr Blewett and, more recently, by Mr Peacock in his standard reply to constituents. There is no obligatory nexus at all between the written statute in a State and what the Commonwealth can spend money on, but once the Commonwealth chooses to reimburse a procedure it is underpinning its existence. This is what the Commonwealth is doing by reimbursing the abortion items. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth is the only sphere in Australia where a Government directly-and I emphasise `directly'-provides funds in support of abortion. But apart from this fundamental flaw there is an inconsistency in the Commonwealth's own position. Again, in official answers supplied to me, the Department of Community Services and Health has identified several medical services and procedures which can be performed legally in a State but which are not included in the medical benefits schedule. They include cosmetic surgery, radial keratotomy and chelation therapy. It is perhaps clear why cosmetic surgery might not be automatically covered. I quote from an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association dated 8 July 1988 which refers to radical paratotomy as:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the procedure of making radially oriented incisions in the anterior surface of the cornea to correct the refractive error of the eye. </PARA>
<PARA>It is noted in the article that the medical procedure known as radial keratotomy `has been the subject of a great deal of controversy'. This is an indication of why it is also not automatically covered. The other medical procedure mentioned by the Department is chelation therapy, in respect of which an article in the Journal of Toxicology, 1982-83, states that it:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . is a form of treatment aimed at removing a metal ion from a molecular site at which it is producing a biochemical lesion. </PARA>
<PARA>It also is apparently a controversial medical procedure and, hence, although it is quite legal to perform it in any State of Australia, it is not covered by the medical benefits schedule. These are just three examples of perfectly legal medical procedures which the Government has decided not to reimburse through the medical benefits schedule. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not accept that the abortions that are undertaken in a number of States are legal in any event under the statute laws of the majority of States. The argument is advanced that because it is legal it should be funded. I am attempting to show that the argument that if it is legal in the States it should be paid for by Medicare is not valid. It is not valid on the evidence given to us by the Department of Community Services and Health itself. Parliamentarians who tell their constituents that all procedures must be reimbursed and that they therefore cannot do anything about the abortion items should think twice before they employ such false arguments. </PARA>

<PARA> (5) Programs within the Portfolio are largely implemented by the various statutory and non-statutory bodies involved in the promotion of cultural, artistic and academic activities including exchanges. For example the Minister and the Department have placed a great deal of emphasis on the co-ordination of the activities of cultural bodies and the department provides policy co-ordination advice and secretariat services to the Minister. The Department co-ordinates meetings convened by the Minister from time to time with all cultural agencies in the Portfolio to discuss matters of common interest. These regular meetings include Chairpersons and Chief Executives of all agencies. The Department is included in the Cultural Ministers Council, a forum of Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers with responsibility for cultural matters. The ongoing business of the Council is pursued through its secretariat which is accommodated within the Department. Changes in budgetary arrangements introduced by the Government have led to greater co-ordination by the Department. Decisions by the Government on budgetary matters are taken at a Portfolio level rather than at an agency level so that the Minister in deciding on priorities draws on advice from the Department. The Portfolio is also represented on the Cultural Relations Coordination Committee which is chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and which seeks to promote greater cooperation in Australia's overseas cultural activities.</PARA>
<PARA> In its co-ordinating role the Department prepares instruments for appointment by the Governor-General and the Minister, to some 200 Board, Council and Advisory positions in respect of cultural agencies within the Portfolio. The Department also prepares policy advice for the Minister on matters of general cultural interest such as funding, taxation, education/training, copyright and international cultural activities.</PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth Indemnification Scheme-the Department administers the Scheme and provides advice to the Minister for the Arts, the Minister for Finance and the Prime Minister on exhibitions deemed suitable for indemnity by the Government. The exhibitions may include those from overseas which are thought to be of cultural or diplomatic significance. The Department co-ordinates meetings between Government and non-Government agencies to discuss policy matters relating to the Commonwealth Indemnification Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia-The Department has responsibility for an initiative contained in the Agenda relating to cultural heritage. The strategy agreed is to establish a Consultative Committee with representatives of the three levels of government, including the Department, collecting institutions, ethnic community groups, folklife and aboriginal interests. The Committee will develop a plan for the future to co-ordinate efforts by collecting institutions to enhance their collections to reflect cultural diversity and to promote awareness of the multicultural nature of these collections both within this country and internationally.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Coulter asked me as Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health, without notice, on 7 September 1989:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is the Minister aware of the serious, health-threatening problems of air pollution with silica dust at the Electrona plant? Is he aware that in Australia the allowable level of silica is presently 5000 micrograms per cubic metre but that, in recognition of the toxic nature of silica, the United States of America has recently reduced its allowable level to 200 micrograms per cubic metre, a reduction by a factor of 25. What, if any, overriding controls on occupational and environmental health does the Commonwealth possess and will these powers be invoked in this case to prevent the significant hazard to which workers at and residents near the Electrona plant are exposed?</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Community Services and Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The issue of standards for occupational exposures to silica is one for the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission which has advised that it is currently investigating an appropriate exposure standard for silica fume (which is understood to be the form of silica which may arise in the Electrona plant). It is awaiting the scientific documentation to support a recommendation by the American Conference of Government Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) for a threshold limit value of 200 micrograms per cubic metre.</PARA>
<PARA> The responsibility for application of these exposure standards lies with the relevant State/Territory regulatory agency.</PARA>
<PARA> As to public health issues, I am advised that the Tasmanian Department of Environment and Planning has indicated that the ambient particulate concentrations measured on a daily basis around the plant range from 20 to 60 micrograms per cubic metre. This compares with the National Health and Medical Research Council ambient air quality goal for total suspended particulates of 90 micrograms per cubic metre.</PARA>
<PARA> The Tasmanian Department of Environment and Planning is, apparently, reviewing the data collected from Electrona and is to prepare a summary report when this review is completed.</PARA>
