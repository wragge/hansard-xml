<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>The Honourable President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA> Medicare cannot pretend to be a universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access to items 6469, 274 and 275 on the Medicare schedule are poorer and disadvantaged women who will not be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners humbly pray and request that the Senate will vote against any attempt to restrict access to abortion or any abortion-related items on the Medicare schedule.</PARA>

<TITLE>Home Ownership</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Hawke-Keating Government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many Australians out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, the Therapeutic Goods Bill 1989 and the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Bill 1989. Last night before the adjournment debate I was putting the Opposition's position on a number of issues in regard to the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). The National Party and the Liberal Party support the charter and the agreement-the principles-but they wish to reiterate that the charter and the agreement should be brought before Parliament before the legislation is passed by both Houses and enacted. As the legislation stands at the moment, it gives the Minister massive power to bring the agreement and the charter before the House after the legislation has gone through. The agreement cannot even be removed by regulation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has some reservations also about the community visitor provision, which my contribution will pick up. The amendments that the Opposition has moved also have the support of the National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals, another major organisation representing nursing homes in Australia; Geriaction, an organisation representing nurses and the aged Australia-wide; the Association of Self-Help Organisations and Groups, representing all the self-help groups in Australia, including the Association of Blind Citizens, the Epilepsy Association, the Mental Health Coordinating Council, to name but a few; and nursing associations throughout the country. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the industry, the aged themselves, their relatives, the nursing profession and proprietors, the Opposition puts forward these amendments which will ensure that the charter and agreement will, when they are formulated, come back to both Houses of Parliament for scrutiny, debate and amendment if necessary, and then approval by both Houses. We also propose that the principles that the Minister is enabled by this legislation to lay down in respect of approved operators of approved nursing homes should be subject to approval by both Houses. That does not happen under this legislation. The Minister virtually has carte blanche to put anything he wishes into a charter without the supervision of the Senate or the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition believes that it is the responsibility of the Minister to report back to Parliament and not hide himself behind regulations and the bureaucracy. If there is no hidden agenda in this legislation, this should be the course to be followed. As my colleague Ray Braithwaite, the honourable member for Dawson, said in the other place, we are discussing in this case the quality of the care of our aged. We are talking about the rights of an individual to be absorbed into a higher quality of care, and that is what the Opposition intends. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on all the Bills which are being dealt with cognately this morning: the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, dealing with the matter of patients' rights in nursing homes; and the therapeutic goods legislation, which concerns registration, listing and the regulatory processes dealing with both therapeutic agents and physical therapeutic goods.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn first to the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), which Senator Boswell has just been addressing. This legislation is primarily designed, as the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) said in his second reading speech, to enable residents' rights to be implemented in nursing homes and hostels. He lists a number of other things which this Bill does and says that it removes the necessity for a medical certificate for nursing home admission, allows for backdating of domiciliary nursing care benefit in certain circumstances, provides for proprietors of nursing homes to be approved operators, provides for lodgment and processing fees for reviews of budgets or deficits of certain nursing homes and, finally, includes certain minor amendments consequential on the implementation of new respite care arrangements in nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal measure to which Senator Boswell has addressed his remarks and to which I will be addressing my remarks is the enabling of the establishment of a charter of patients' rights in nursing homes and hostels. The Minister, further on in his second reading speech, identifies that as the principal purpose of the Bill. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> The major purpose of the Bill is to produce new provisions which give effect to the rights and responsibilities of residents of Commonwealth funded aged care facilities. </PARA>
<PARA>There lies the rub, which has already been identified. The Bill does not give effect to these rights and responsibilities. This Bill is enabling legislation. The rights and responsibilities which are drawn in the Bill are very broadly drawn indeed. If we look at clause 4 of part 2 of the Bill we see that the Minister may, by instrument, formulate a statement of the rights and responsibilities of the residents of approved hostels. Proposed subsection (3) in clause 4 goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Without limiting the generality of subsection (2), the charter may state that the resident has:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a right to be treated as an individual; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a right to personal independence; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) a right to privacy;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) a right to access to all documents relating to the resident; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) a responsibility to respect the rights of others. </PARA>
<PARA>Nobody would disagree with the protection of those rights, especially in the area of aged care. But behind each of those simple forms of words lies a potentially incredibly complex quagmire and a difficult area of resolution. The first paragraph concerns the right to be treated as an individual. Certainly there are many aged people who go into this type of care who are still physically reasonably well and who have all their mental faculties about them. Clearly, the right to be treated as an individual is exactly the same right as one would accord to everybody in the community, without exception. But many patients who go into nursing homes suffer from various degrees of dementia and from a loss of mental capacity. The question of what it is to be treated as an individual under those circumstances is not clarified by this Bill, but presumably it will be clarified in the charter. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, as one goes down the list one finds `the right to personal independence'. What happens to a patient with Alzheimer's disease, who is progressively losing the ability to know exactly where he or she is, and whose geographic sense is progressively being lost? Most of these people go through a stage of wandering, of getting lost. How then does one interpret the right to personal independence? To what degree has one a right to restrain that person for the person's own good, because he or she may wander across roads and be run over and killed?</PARA>
<PARA> There is a similar difficulty with the right to privacy. As people with Alzheimer's disease deteriorate, they become incontinent. They have to be nursed, as babies have to be nursed. At what point does nursing care intersect with the stated principle of the right to privacy? Similarly, in dealing with patients in this category there is difficulty in resolving the conflicting rights of one patient vis-a-vis another patient and also with respect to the director of a nursing home and members of the nursing staff. It seems, to me that, while the idea of a charter of patients' rights is absolutely commendable and while one could not find exception to the outline we find in the Bill at a number of places, nonetheless, in the working out of the detail, the implementation of these clauses in terms of the identification of precise rights-bearing in mind that the charter will become a legal document once it is in place-is fraught with enormous difficulty. The implementation of those rights is something that is fraught with enormous difficulty and therefore needs to be approached with a great deal of care and in a completely open and transparent way so that one can get the best description of those rights, the best protection of the rights of patients and the balancing of the rights and responsibilities in that charter. It is for those sorts of reasons that the Australian Democrats are supporting the approach being taken by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is worth pointing out that the process which is implicit in the legislation is one in which the charter will be dealt with in the same manner as regulations. Proposed new section 10DA (4) states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Charter is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46a of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. </PARA>
<PARA> This means that if the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 were allowed to pass in its present form if would be quite possible for the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) to bring forward a charter in early January. I am hypothesising here-the Minister in the chamber yesterday Senator Bolkus, criticised me for hypothesising-but the rumour is that we might have an election in late February and we may not sit in this place again until April. The 15 sitting days during which the charter would be disallowable would begin some time in April and the charter could be in operation for at least six months before it was possible to modify it. </PARA>
<PARA> I think a lot of people in the community do not realise that one of the defects in the system of disallowable instruments is that we must either allow or disallow in toto. We are not given the option of, amending, changing and improving those disallowable instruments-usually regulations but, in this case, the charter of patients' rights. As I have indicated, it is for that reason that we believe the better process in this case is to support the legislation in its intention but to say to the Government that the better way to proceed with respect to the charter is to bring that charter forward in a way that allows it to be debated, to be amended and then to be implemented in the best possible form. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday, the Minister, Mr Staples, rang me and tried to convince me otherwise. His argument was along the lines that somehow or other allowing this legislation to pass and allowing him to introduce the charter in the form of a regulation would speed up the process. I did not accept his argument and I pointed out to him, and I point it out to fellow senators, that the process that is allowed for in the Opposition's series of amendments is far more likely to put in place an effective charter of patients, rights before one could go down the road of regulation and then through the process of disallowance with all the difficulties that that entails. If we were to find some objection to one minor but important element in that charter, we would have to disallow it. The Government would than have to go away and come back with a whole new charter. That would then have to be considered, and again it would be an allow or a disallow situation, not one open to amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a serious defect in the system. I believe that the Opposition has found a mechanism whereby one can get around this process in important matters, and this is a very important matter, so that the charter can be argued about in detail and amendments made to it. We will be supporting the Opposition's series of amendments. They are a series of amendments because the question of the charter comes up in a number of places in the Bill, the Bill being one which amends a number of other Acts. </PARA>
<PARA> To summarise, the Democrats favour the charter. We favour the broad principles which are outlined in the Bill. We are not happy, however, with the process by which this charter is to be introduced. It is for that reason that we support the mechanism whereby the charter can come back before both Houses of Parliament and be debated and, possibly, amended. We believe there are a number of potential difficulties in this area. We are dealing with extremely complex situations and the resolution of that complexity is something that will take a great deal of care. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to turn now to the therapeutic goods legislation. Again, the Democrats welcome the Therapeutic Goods Bill 1989. It provides for national controls over therapeutic goods, something we have not had hitherto, and in a sense it follows in the tradition of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill, which we passed in December 1988 when we brought the registration and regulation of those agents largely under Federal control. I think everybody would accept that this is an area where it is far more appropriate for the Federal Government to register and regulate these matters. The Bill does this with respect to drugs and therapeutic agents in that sense, but also with respect to instruments which are used in a medical sense. Instruments which are used in the diagnosis, cure or alleviation of illness-for example, pacemakers, catheters, specula, the whole range of medical instrumentation-will come under this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Appropriately, the major parts of the Bill cover the determination of standards, with respect to both the manufacturer and the efficacy and operation of the agents or the instruments, the establishment of a register of goods for import, export and supply, and also the licensing of Australian manufacturers. Behind that lies a process of factory inspections, so that, in the case of injectables, standards of sterility, standards of efficacy, toxicity and all the other data that will be required will go into that process. The register of therapeutic goods will consist of two parts-one for registered goods and the other forlisted goods. Goods to be registered will require evaluation as to quality, safety and effectiveness before being approved. Goods to be listed will be those of a less hazardous nature which require assessment for quality and compliance with official standards. </PARA>
<PARA> We will be seeking to move several amendments in relation to this legislation because, although the thrust of the legislation is one we totally support, and indeed, appears to be supported by the large number of people who have lobbied for it, there are some clear defects in the legislation which we will be seeking to amend. Firstly, in the matter of labelling, the Bill clearly allows that it would be possible for Australia to export items with lesser standards of labelling than would be applicable in Australia. As a general principle-and I think this has been enunciated with respect to a number of potentially hazardous situations-Australia should not be a country which exports agents or items which would not be acceptable for use in this country. Of course, that general principle should also apply to the labelling of items. Indeed, the World Health Organisation recently stated that all packaging and labelling materials should provide information consistent with that approved by the country's drug regulatory authority. Australia should not be known as a country which allows dumping of products in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Just harking back for a moment to the agricultural and veterinary chemical area, in times past we have been on the receiving end of some agents from the United States which were not permitted to be used in that country. I know of at least one drug-I had something to do with its testing-which was introduced to Australia before it was put on the American market. I am not suggesting that in that case we were used in any sense as a dumping ground. Nonetheless, the first registration occurred in this country and, therefore, we needed very adequate labelling and information on that agent. There was a need to make appropriate registration and regulatory decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter which is of concern to the Democrats is the role of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) in the assessment of therapeutic agents, particularly drugs. Some of those agents fall into two categories-medicines and vitamin treatments, which are espoused by many people but are somewhat outside the realm of orthodox medicine. The National Health and Medical Research Council is not a statutory body. For many years the processes by which the NHMRC committees consider these matters have not been open to close scrutiny. Moreover, the members of these committees are usually part time people who are drawn from research institutes and universities. They are busy people and very often there are long delays between the submission of a substance for testing and judgment in respect of efficacy, quality, pharmacology and so on. For all those reasons, the NHMRC system has not really worked very well. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible for us to amend this Bill to change the NHMRC system. But at the committee stage I will certainly be seeking from the Minister some assurance in relation to placing this committee system on a more full time basis so that decisions can be made more quickly and we can establish a more transparent system of review. I want to outline the sorts of concerns that have been expressed to me. Some companies which are making megavitamin or multivitamin tablets and putting those products on the market fear that the NHMRC committee system, composed of more conventional medical-type people, is likely to take an antagonistic view in regard to the registration of some of their products. Coming from a conventional medical background, I might share the NHMRC's judgment about those items. But that is not the point I want to make. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I want to make is that the NHMRC system of consideration of data should firstly be open to free import of information from bodies that are seeking the registration of these agents. Secondly, the processes of review of those agents should be open to scrutiny so that the NHMRC committee can be seen to have considered the data. Its judgments and the reasons behind them should be clear and open to scrutiny and if there is an element of prejudice which is not soundly scientifically based there should be some appeal mechanism. Again, one points to the fact that there is no appeal mechanism in the NHMRC system. That is an area on which this legislation will rely quite heavily. In the past it has not been very satisfactory and needs to be improved but it cannot be improved through this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Concern has also been expressed that the Victorian legislation in relation to therapeutic agents will continue for a time. Many companies have expressed the concern that they will still have to face a double system-a system of national legislation and also a system of Victorian legislation and standards. I am informed that the Victorian Premier and the Victorian Minister for Health have given assurance that when this legislation is proclaimed the Victorian system will be repealed. At the appropriate time, I will be seeking an assurance from the relevant Minister in this place that that is the intention of this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Baume has said, it should be certainly simultaneous or as close as technically feasible so that one simply supervenes the other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other major area of concern relates to both the therapeutic industry which manufactures a large range of small volume products and a number of small starter companies which manufacture medical instrumentation. Concern has been expressed that in both those instances the scale of fees foreshadowed in this legislation is such as to discourage or kill off companies that are making a large number of small volume products. Those who have expressed concern about this matter are principally in the herbal remedy area. If they have to face a very large fee, some of their products would not be profitable and would disappear from the market. </PARA>
<PARA> The imposition of large fees on some of the smaller manufacturers which may eventually have quite high volume sales but which in the start-up years have very small volume sales with very large development costs, may well simply prevent them from getting under way. In their lobbying these companies have pointed out that an important philosophical principle is involved in this. They point to the fact that in the United States this type of process is considered as a service to the public-it protects the public-and therefore the public pays for it. The scheme is run at public expense through taxation and no fee at all is charged to the individual company for the inspection processes, registration of goods and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> This contrasts with the alternative view that this system is run as a service to industry. In that case, clearly industry pays. One could argue that the advantages to industry would be that it gets the imprimatur of the Government in terms of quality, overseas sales and so on. If there is reciprocity of quality acceptance, these manufacturers can go into interstate markets without further complication. Evidently the Government has taken a totally arbitrary position, saying, `Okay, we'll charge half of what we reckon it costs to run this process', and the fees are designed to cover 50 per cent of the cost. Recognising that that is a completely arbitrary decision and satisfies neither philosophical position, I suggest to the Government-later on we will do so by way of amendment-that in certain areas the fee which is charged should be waivable. Indeed, there is a provision in the Bill for that to occur, but the wording is extremely weak and we believe it could be strengthened. Those who have lobbied in this area have drawn attention to the large number of small, export oriented, profitable companies which operate in the States and contrasted that with the situation in the United Kingdom, where the fees, albeit small, are nonetheless levied against the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, we support the thrust of the legislation. The idea of bringing this whole matter under Federal control rather than leaving it with the States is supported by the Democrats. Indeed, it is supported by most people in the industry. However, care needs to be taken that the processes of assessment are open to proper scrutiny. The fees which are charged need to be based on a scale which does not inhibit the ability of companies to begin and develop export business. We would argue strongly that nothing in this legislation or in any other legislation should permit Australia to export anything which would not be permitted to be used in this country or, indeed, to allow it to be labelled in a way which was less specific and therefore to be used in a potentially hazardous way in a foreign country that was not allowed in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it a package of three Bills-the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), the Therapeutic Goods Bill and the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Bill. Although the Bills are being debated cognately, they are not related measures in terms of therapeutic goods and community services and health. As a result, I find myself in some difficulty, as the Opposition's spokesman on health matters in this chamber, in trying to address both sets of Bills within the time available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) proposes a series of changes to the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the National Health Act 1953. The amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 are contained in part 5 of the legislation. There are nine changes proposed. The first restricts the eligibility for Medicare benefits to the head, the staff and the families of the diplomatic missions of countries which have an agreement with Australia specifically providing for their representatives to be treated as if they were Australian residents. This amendment is intended to rectify the current situation whereby diplomatic representatives in this country may be granted eligibility for Medicare benefits even if their own country confers no such privileges on Australian representatives serving there. </PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment removes the requirement that dental practitioners perform oral surgery in a hospital in order for those services to attract Medicare benefits. The third defines `officer' of the Health Insurance Commission to mean a member of the staff of the Commission and removes any possibility that `officer' could be interpreted as the General Manager, member or commissioner of the Health Insurance Commission. The fourth amendment is to the definition of the term `proprietor' of a pathology laboratory so that Medicare benefits for pathology services will be payable only when those laboratories have at least one proprietor who has effective control over the staffing, equipment and premises of the laboratory and can ensure the maintenance of certain standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The explanatory memorandum to the Bill argues that the corporate structure of some pathology laboratories currently makes it difficult to identify who is the operator of the services. This amendment is intended to overcome the problem. However, in spite of this statement it is not clear what the amendment can be expected to achieve. In cases where a laboratory is operated by a corporation or a number of equal partners, it is difficult to see how any one person could be made more responsible than some other person for the operation of that laboratory. As I understand it, there has been no consultation between the Government and the Australian Association of Pathology Practices on this issue. Therefore, I will ask the Minister who replies to the second reading debate to explain precisely what it is intended the amendment shall achieve and how that question can be addressed when there are equal partners or when the operator is a corporate entity. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth amendment removes the previous provisions in relation to the vocational register of general practitioners when the Minister for Community Services and Health had the power to make determinations with regard to the role of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) in the conduct of the vocational register of general practitioners. Changes affecting the RACGP will now have to be made by way of regulation and not determination, as recommended by the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> The sixth amendment extends to the recipients of the formal training allowance the same health care card and pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) concessional benefits as are currently available to those in receipt of unemployment benefit. The seventh amendment provides for the Health Insurance Commission to play a role in the pro- cessing of claims for health program grants, which until now have had to be lodged with the Department of Community Services and Health. The eighth amendment provides that, where an officer of the Health Insurance Commission is involved in counselling practitioners on the admissibility of evidence, in addition to being an officer of the Commission the counsellor must have relevant qualifications as a medical practitioner, dental practitioner or optometrist. Finally, the ninth amendment provides for what is euphemistically described as the free flow of information between officers of the Department of Community Services and Health and the Health Insurance Commission as a result of the recent transfer of administrative responsibility for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I say, once again, that the Opposition is conscious of and draws the attention of the Senate to the appalling record of the Health Insurance Commission in preserving the confidentiality of medical and personal records which it has under its control. The Commission has a disgraceful record, which its officers and senior managers should be ashamed of, in terms of the leaking of information, the deliberate political misuse of information within the hands of the Commission, and the deliberate policy of the Commission in making available details about individual medical practitioners for grubby and sleazy political purposes. The Health Insurance Commission has an appalling record in this regard. Although we will not oppose the Government's amendment in this regard to allow the exchange of information between the Department and the Commission, it is an area that we shall watch with considerable interest because it is about time that somebody in the Commission was effectively prosecuted and dealt with in the court system to prevent this sort of nonsense from occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 6 of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) makes amendments to the National Health Act 1953. Two amendments are proposed. The first relates to the arrangements for patients to pay an additional amount for a pharmaceutical item in cases where the manufacture disputes the price determined by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority. This amendment provides a formula for the calculation of a pro rata special patient contribution based on any prescribed quantity of such drugs rather than tying the payment to a fixed quantity. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there is an amendment providing for the Secretary to the Department of Community Services and Health (DCSH) to be able to grant a retrospective entitlement to a concession on a PBS item in situations where eligibility for such a concession was, for some unavoidable reason, not provided at the time that the drugs were dispensed, resulting in payment at an inappropriate higher level. The Opposition welcomes that amendment. It is therefore not our intention to oppose the sections of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 as they relate to amendments within the health portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> In the House of Representatives an amendment was moved by the Opposition regarding the determination of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal of 28 August 1989. It was proposed that we should move that amendment again within this legislation. But on the basis that the Senate yesterday insisted on insisting upon its amendment to the National Health Amendment Bill and has therefore sent back down to the House of Representatives a clear indication that the Senate requires that determination to be formally overturned by the Parliament, I have come to the view that we should not press that amendment in this particular piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the two Bills dealing with the regulation of therapeutic goods, the Therapeutic Goods Bill 1989 and the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Bill 1989. I indicate at this stage that, to get it on record, I would formally move the amendment which has been prepared on behalf of the Opposition for the Bill to be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. I would now like to have circulated the amendment in my name to the motion for the second reading. I now formally move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add: ``, but the Senate, while supporting the principle of uniform federal regulation of the manufacture of therapeutic goods in Australia, considers that the Therapeutic Goods Bill 1989 and the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Bill 1989 are deficient in a number of respects and consequently resolves that the Bills be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology for inquiry and report, by the first sitting day in March 1990, on:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the impact of the proposals in the Bills on the therapeutic goods industry, with particular reference to the export sector of that industry and product innovation;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the levels of service to be provided by the Department of Community Services and Health under the therapeutic goods program, the actual cost of listing and registering a product, and the means of measuring the performance of the therapeutic goods program;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the evaluation procedures to be adopted and the scope for utilising evaluations performed in other competent countries;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) whether the intensification of controls is warranted;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) whether the provisions of the Bills should commence before the States and Territories enact complementary legislation;</PARA>
<PARA> (f) whether the National Health and Medical Research Council is an appropriate body for determining the Poisons Standard and what industry input should be provided for in the poisons scheduling process;</PARA>
<PARA> (g) the protection of the confidentiality of information and the industry's involvement in ensuring that confidentiality provisions are observed;</PARA>
<PARA> (h) the principle of a public authority charging product sponsors for performing services associated with its statutory public safety functions;</PARA>
<PARA> (i) whether public safety may be jeopardised as a result of the Department of Community Services and Health trying to expedite approvals of new products in order to maintain revenues;</PARA>
<PARA> (j) whether there are sufficient guarantees that all fees collected will be transferred from Consolidated Revenue to the Therapeutic Goods Administration Trust Account;</PARA>
<PARA> (k) whether it would be more appropriate to charge fees only for examining imported products;</PARA>
<PARA> (l) the extent to which the implementation of the provisions of these Bills could undermine the efforts of other government programs to promote R&amp;D and export activity.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Therapeutic Goods Bill is to create a national system of control over the manufacture, evaluation and marketing of therapeutic goods and devices for both export and domestic consumption. The accompanying piece of legislation, the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Bill, relates to the application of a range of fees and charges for the registration and evaluation of therapeutic goods and devices and for the licensing of manufacturers and inspections under codes of good manufacturing practice. </PARA>
<PARA> For the purpose of this package of legislation the definition of therapeutic goods is a very wide one. It includes prescription and non-prescription medications, vitamin, mineral and dietary supplements, herbal and homeopathic preparations, as well as medical devices. The major parts of the Therapeutic Goods Bills relate to the determination of standards for therapeutic goods; the establishment of an Australian register of therapeutic goods approved for import, export or supply, and the licensing of Australian manufacturers of therapeutic goods. The proposed date of commencement of the legislation is 1 March 1990, with fees and charges to be collected from 1 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> In principle, both the Opposition and the therapeutic goods industry support the broad objectives of the Therapeutic Goods Bill. Indeed, I have just been reading an article by R. C. Hall in the Medical Journal of Australia, the 18 September 1989 issue, entitled `Drug Regulation in Australia'. In it Hall makes the point that there is a need for national legislation in this particular area. His article argues for the creation of a statutory authority to do that, and he derives some comfort in that view from an examination of the situation in both the United Kingdom and Sweden as far as these matters are concerned. Therefore I do not believe that there is any argument about the principle that there ought to be effective national regulation in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, there are a number of obvious advantages to the community and the therapeutic goods industry in having a unified system of controls over therapeutic products and their advertising. As my colleague Senator Peter Baume said by way of interjection during Senator Coulter's speech, the important challenge will be to ensure that there is not an overlap or a continuation of regulation between existing State regulation-particularly in Victoria-and Commonwealth regulation should such a scheme come into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no argument about the value of ensuring the quality, safety and efficiency of therapeutic goods and the need to protect the public interest in this regard. All of us in the Parliament are old enough to know something of the havoc wrought by thalidomide, for example. On the other hand, the Opposition shares a range of concerns expressed by the industry in relation to the Bills and the regulations which will underpin them. These matters include: doubts as to whether a national system of controls is achievable in this particular way; whether the Government's proposals contain adequate checks and balances and avenues of appeal; whether the codes of goods manufacturing practice are excessive and unreasonable on a benefit to risk basis; the damage which may be done to the manufacturing and export industries by the proposed fees and charges; and the fact that the whole structure is to be underpinned by regulations which have not been finalised or made available to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to that last point. It is akin to the debate we had about a vocational register of general practitioners and have had ad nauseam, as we had indeed, from what Senator Coulter was saying, in relation to parts of the community services legislation: The suck-it-and-see approach of this Government, the `Let us pass the Bill and trust us to get it all right in the regulations at some later stage' approach, is not acceptable. Senator Ray, who is the Minister on duty in the chamber, has had particular experience, in terms of immigration, in establishing a proper mechanism whereby the Parliament is actually involved in making decisions about that. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Robert Ray" NAMEID="UI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We still get criticised for it as not going far enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is inevitable, but at least Senator Ray has taken the first step in developing a system which, hopefully, will grow into a model of the way in which regulation should be made in complicated areas rather than simply leaving them permanently on the basis of saying, `Let the Parliament simply pass the enabling legislation, and let the Department, or the bureaucracy or the Commission or the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) or whoever it happens to be, put down a set of regulations'-knowing full well that regulations in this place can only be taken or left in globo. We cannot amend particular parts of regulations. We have to strike them all down and start again or accept them all. That is simply not a satisfactory way for a parliament to proceed in determining regulations in a very difficult area. It is primarily for reasons such as these that the Opposition has decided that it will oppose the legislation, despite the fact that the Bills themselves are ones to which we do not object in principle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to a more detailed discussion of why we have come to that conclusion. As I said, in principle, the package of legislation has been supported by the relevant industry groups, which see some advantage to the general public and the manufacturing industry in relation to the uniformity of scheduling and regulatory controls for manufactures. However, unless all of the States and Territories cooperate with the Commonwealth, the proposed system for the national registration of therapeutic goods will be unworkable. At this stage it appears that no Australian State or Territory government has drawn up complementary legislation. Apparently the Victorian Government has indicated that it is willing to look at repealing its own system of registration, but it will not do so until the spring 1990 parliamentary session. This means that if the national system comes into effect in March 1990 there will be dual registration in Victoria for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> These are matters with grave consequences for the industry, which wants a guarantee that the system will be implemented on a truly national basis. Therefore, there are grounds for arguing that Victoria should repeal or amend its legislation so that its system will not continue beyond the commencement of the national one and that all States and Territories should have complementary legislation in place when this Bill comes into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> On page (iv) of its information paper No. 13 of March 1989, entitled `Therapeutic Goods Regulation', the Business Regulation and Review Unit (BRRU) stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The paper considers that there are many areas where regulation generates unnecessarily high costs. It also considers that the intensifications of controls proposed by DCSH are not, in the main, warranted and that the charging proposals both for these intensifications and for the on-going program are excessive. These conclusions apply with particular force with regard to products having well known features and risks. </PARA>
<PARA>This proposition is totally consistent with the coalition parties' policy enunciated on page 16 of our Economic Action Plan, where recognition is given to the fact that accumulative regulation has become oppressive and a major obstacle to new investment and the improved productivity and competitiveness of Australian industry. The Business Regulation Review Unit also referred to an issue raised by the Therapeutic goods industry, namely, that a number of longstanding difficulties with the therapeutic goods program remain, and the increased regulation proposed-particularly the surveillance of a wider range of goods-may exacerbate rather than resolve these problems by reversing recent moves towards more risk related approaches. The DCSH proposes linking cost recovery through fees to an increase in the performance of the assessment and inspection sections of the therapeutics division. It envisages setting itself targets for clearance of drugs and an increased frequency of inspection of premises, although failure to meet those targets does not carry any specified penalty. </PARA>
<PARA> The BRRU states that in line with independent reviews conducted by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the Public Service Board, the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) and the Inquiry into the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Industry-the so-called Ralph report-economies could be achieved if assessments were undertaken by competent overseas authorities and were to be accepted in Australia. Not only would such a move achieve savings, but it would also reduce delays in the availability of new products. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the material that we have on this subject. There is a very detailed report from the IAC of April 1986, entitled Pharmaceutical Products; another detailed report, No. 295, from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in 1988 entitled Therapeutic Goods; and the Ralph report of August 1979, the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry inquiry. Many issues are raised in those reports and, indeed, in yet another report of the Public Service Board to which I have referred, which are not adequately addressed within this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The IAC estimated that drug approvals in Australia were slower by between 1.9 and 22.8 months than those of a group of developed countries. It also estimated that for the period 1970 to 1983 the average lag of 42.3 months, between first approval by another country and approval in Australia, was somewhat in excess of that of other countries. There is a scope within the Bill for goods manufactured overseas to be accepted on the basis of adequate evidence on the standard of manufacture from a relevant overseas authority. Whether an applicant has agreed to pay the costs of Australian inspectors visiting overseas manufacturing premises, and whether the manufacturer has agreed to such an inspection, are matters which may be considered in evaluating the registration of goods manufactured overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Considerable industry opposition has been raised in relation to the scale of fees to be imposed. These fees are viewed as representing a hidden form of additional taxation designed to hide Public Service expenditure, although clause 59 (2) of the Bill states:</PARA>
<PARA>Fees prescribed under this Act must not be such as to amount to taxation. </PARA>
<PARA>I shall return to the comments made by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee on that matter in due course. However, the Government has made it clear that it intends to raise one half of the costs of operating the therapeutic goods program from the industry, and departmental officers have told the industry that the Department regards the fees and charges as revenue and expects the costs to be passed on to the public. Industry argues that the fees represent double-dipping, as its companies are paying taxes for the provision of government services, and that individual taxpayers pay income tax for the same purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> The payment of additional fees and charges for government services is seen as being unreasonable and inequitable, and the level of charges does not relate to the level of services offered. Just how much service will be delivered in return for the payment, year after year, of a registration or listing fee for an unchanged item is hard to determine. In addition, the charges will have an inflationary impact and it can be expected that they will be lifted by the Government, maybe to the point where it carries out its own original intention to recover 100 per cent of the therapeutic goods program, and that will inevitably flow on to consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1988 report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts No. 295 entitled Therapeutic Goods, subtitled A Review of the Therapeutic Goods Evaluation and Testing Program; in paragraphs 7.20 to 7.23, refers to charges being performance-related, not merely income generating; that fees should be fair; that under no circumstances should there be cross-subsidisation by one category of goods in respect of another; and that fees for the inclusion of goods already on the market should not be substantial. The major burden of the fees as proposed-which are considerably higher than those in other countries, such as the United Kingdom-will fall most heavily on the Australian manufacturing industry. For example, the Australian Medical Devices and Diagnostics Association cites United Kingdom manufacturers' licences which amount to one thousand pounds sterling initially, with renewals half of that amount, compared with the Australian proposal to charge up to $8,300 each year for similar licensing and $13,000 for full evaluation of a therapeutic device.</PARA>
<PARA> The imposition of a high level of fees can be expected to decrease international competitiveness at the very time when national interest demands all possible support for Australian manufacturing industry and its export potential. The proposed fees could, therefore, negate existing government sponsored initiatives to encourage the therapeutic goods industry to expand its research and development and export activities. For example, Austrade is currently heavily involved in the promotion of the medical devices industry, but the small new companies being supported in this way could be driven out of business by the fees set under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> If fees are to be charged, an incentive to export could be achieved by granting exemption from the manufacturing licence and annual registration fees to manufacturers exporting a significant prescribed quantity of their annual output, for example, more than 20 per cent. There is also a view within the industry that there should be a range of differential fees based on the degree of evaluation required for particular goods and the size or quality of particular types of inspections. For example, the United Kingdom system of fees based on whether an inspection is minor, standard or major. The industry believes that the frequency of inspection should be clearly stated and that the United Kingdom scheme-where no charge is applied for inspectors' informal visits to discuss plans or follow up suspected defective products-should be adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> A further concern relates to the role of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and its standards for the uniform scheduling of drugs and poisons. The NHMRC is an unofficial organisation which exists pursuant to an Order in Council. Over the years the NHMRC, through its subcommittees, has made a number of recommendations which have had major impacts on the therapeutic goods industry, yet it is not accountable and is unrepresentative of the industry's interests. While the NHMRC is not mentioned in the legislation itself, the explanatory memorandum to the Therapeutic Goods Bill does refer to it, and the adoption of its standard for the uniform scheduling of drugs and poisons. Also, the regulations to the legislation define the `poison standard' as the `current edition of the standards for the uniform scheduling of poisons and drugs'. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry argues that giving the NHMRC the power to determine the poisons standard has serious implications in view of its track record in relation to matters affecting the therapeutic goods industry. For such reason the industry believes that responsibility for the standard should be passed to a new committee which is both accountable within the framework of the Bill, and representative of the therapeutic goods industry. Furthermore, in view of the technical nature of matters arising from a request for a review of a decision on a product, the industry does not believe that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is the appropriate body to hear such appeals and would prefer to have such issues resolved by a body consisting of industry representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> While, in principle, the legislation offers some advantage in relation to uniformity of scheduling and regulatory controls, nevertheless, there are significant areas of concern about the way in which the Hawke Government is seeking to achieve these objectives. As I have already said, there are widespread concerns about the negative impact these Bills will have on the therapeutic goods industry, particularly in relation to the expansion of export activity and the innovation of new products. The Business Regulation Review Unit found that there are many areas where regulation generates unnecessarily high costs. This view supports our own, which is reflected in our intention to reduce the burden of business regulation generally. </PARA>
<PARA> There appears to be insufficient evidence that the proposed intensification of controls is warranted, and a widely held view that the charging proposals are excessive. There are no guarantees that the Government or the Department will not see the fees as a handy source of extra revenue to step up charges on a regular basis, conduct more inspections to generate additional funds or impose fees for initially free services such as the provision to sponsors of information on their register entry. There is also no evidence that the implementation of these charges will produce significant improvements in the operation of the therapeutic goods program. It is for these reasons that the Opposition is proposing the amendment to the second reading of this Bill-which I have already moved-to refer this Bill to a Senate select committee. That second reading amendment states, in part, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Senate, while supporting the principle of uniform federal regulation of the manufacture of therapeutic goods in Australia, considers that the Therapeutic Goods Bill 1989 and the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Bill 1989 are deficient in a number of respects and consequently resolves that the Bills be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology for inquiry and report, by the first sitting day in March 1990 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>A range of matters is then set out in the motion. I have to take a few more minutes to detail one or two of the other criticisms of the Bill. I understand that at the expiry of my time I will be allowed to finish those matters. I will make a very brief comment in appreciation of the courtesy extended by the Senate on its account which arises from my having to discuss two quite separate Bills cognately. </PARA>
<PARA> The areas which have been drawn to our attention and to which I wish to draw the Senate's attention include the following: representations from the Australian Association of Professional Homeopaths draw attention to the fact that lack of regulations for examination means that the Government's intentions are not available for widespread scrutiny. The representations received from organisations such as the Victorian Herbalists Association Inc. make the same point and make the point which Senator Coulter made in his remarks that the NHMRC and the more established bodies within the profession may not have the same sort of attitude towards non-mainstream remedies as is the case with more traditional therapeutic goods. The representation from the Nutritional Foods Association of Australia makes precisely the same point that a view is likely to be taken which does not comprehend the sort of important service which it is providing. The Australian Dental Industry Association Inc. makes the point that within the guidelines being operated upon at the moment entitled `The Instructions for Therapeutic Goods Regulation' there is a proposal for dental instruments, devices and materials to be brought within the provisions of this legislation. This point is similarly made by the Australian Dental Association which draws attention to the fact that the Industries Assistance Commission Report No. 402 of April 1987 entitled `Medical and Scientific Equipment: Measuring, professional and scientific equipment. Appliances and parts, and medical, dental, and veterinary equipment' suggests at page 52 that such items should not be included and the Government is moving in the contrary direction as far as that area is concerned. Representations from The Australian Medical Devices and Diagnostic Association Inc. point out that in the United Kingdom, the Medicines Control Agency plays a role which is a far more acceptable one to the industry than the regime proposed for Australia. (Extension of time granted) That Association makes the point that this matter should be referred to a committee and should be evaluated to take account, in particular, of the way in which this system operates in the United Kingdom. Furthermore it says such an inquiry should take account of the export potential in this area. In a letter to the shadow Minister for health, Mr Shack, Mr Sutherland, on behalf of the Australian Medical Devices and Diagnostic Association Inc., said:</PARA>
<PARA> Further, I point out the burden which would fall upon the small, high technology companies which form the backbone of the medical devices and diagnostic industry . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Here, he is making a valid comment about the potential charges which might be levied on the industry. The 1988-89 annual report of Australiatrade on page 41, under the heading `Medical and scientific equipment', stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Medical and Scientific Equipment Strategy, launched by Senator Button in October 1988, established an export target of $735 million in 1991-92, almost doubling the 1987-88 exports of $398 million. Exports in 1988-89 are estimated at $460 million. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is well placed to take advantage of the 15 per cent annual growth in the world market. </PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely true and the target is likely to be set at some considerable peril by the way in which the Government has proceeded in this matter. I also draw attention to the fact that groups such as the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association have expressed concerns about the additional cost which will be imposed. A news release put out by that Association on 15 August stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The announcement of new initiatives to accelerate new drug approvals and improve oversight of pharmaceuticals has failed to demonstrate how the Department of Community Services and Health will achieve these desirable goals . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That Association is very critical of the way in which the Government has proceeded in this matter. In a letter to me dated 17 November, John Pentecost, the Chief Executive Officer of the Proprietary Association of Australia Incorporated, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>While we recognise that the Bill itself embodies basic and rational principles which Industry supports, we point out that the implementation mechanisms will be provided and controlled through the accompanying Regulations, yet to be presented to the House. The Bill itself cannot therefore be meaningfully considered without the accompanying Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>I endorse entirely those points. </PARA>
<PARA> In my concluding comments I draw attention to the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills in its eighteenth report of 22 November 1989 in which it found the Bill deficient in respect to the matter of prescribed codes of goods manufacturing process. It argues that the Minister should not be allowed simply to publish orders in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette; rather, that should be done by regulation. On page 5 of the report the Committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee . . . is of the opinion that to have the codes of goods manufacturing practice incorporated in regulations would not affect the flexibility of the system or the ability of the Orders to be altered in a timely fashion. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee suggests that that is the proper way in which this legislation should proceed rather than the way which is currently proposed by the Labor Government. In relation to the Therapeutic Goods Charges Bill the Committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee notes the matters raised by the Minister concerning the level of industry input to the determination of charges. The Committee does not regard it as appropriate that the amount of an annual charge can be fixed by regulation with no upper limit to the charge specified in the bill. The most appropriate means to ensure that the upper limit of a charge is not set by the regulations is to amend the bill to set a maximum level for the relevant charges. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Government is genuine about cost recovery up to 50 per cent but not up to 100 per cent, it could easily have put that in the legislation. The Government has not put the matter in the legislation. This leads the Opposition to believe that the Government, having had the matter drawn to its attention by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and having deliberately not proceeded in the recommended fashion, proposes to use this process as an open-ended tax arrangement. It is not the responsibility of the Opposition to draw that amendment. However, it is our responsibility to draw attention to the potential for misuse. It is for that additional reason that the reference to the Senate Committee has been proposed and is so necessary. This is yet another of those matters which need to be subject to detailed and close examination. We believe that the only way to do that effectively is by reference to the Senate Committee. We have therefore embarked on that course of action. If we are unsuccessful I indicate that the Opposition will be voting against this package of legislation. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME><ELECTORATE>(New South Wales)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(11.19)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is discussing a group of Bills-the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, the Therapeutic Goods Bill 1989 and the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Bill 1989. The first Bill has little relation to the other two Bills, which deal with therapeutic goods. My colleague Senator Boswell discussed the question of a residents' Bill of Rights. I will not address that matter. I will address my remarks particularly to the proposal for a national system of registration of therapeutic goods in Australia. I want to make just two points. First, the concept of a national register of therapeutic goods was promoted in 1981 by the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare in its report to the Senate entitled `Another side to the drug debate . . . a medicated society?'. I note that very few members of that Senate Committee remain in the Senate. Nevertheless, it was a report to the Senate under the chairmanship of Senator Shirley Walters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point I want to make is that there are sufficient grounds for uncertainty to support the Opposition's view that the proposal should go to a Senate standing committee for examination and report. I turn first to the 1981 report of the Senate Standing Committee: one finds in that report at page 61 the recommendation most relevant to this Bill. That recommendation reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Committee recommends that the national registration scheme be instituted as soon as practicable. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the recommendation made by the Committee to the Senate in 1981-that a national registration scheme for drugs be instituted as soon as practicable. The Committee reached that conclusion by a series of quite logical steps. It was aware that there was and still is no national system of registering therapeutic goods and no system of ensuring that they comply with minimum standards of purity and safety. I interpolate that the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) mechanism, admirable as it is, picks up only some therapeutic goods. There is no system at present for ensuring that the manufacture of all therapeutic goods requires adherence to certain minimum acceptable standards. </PARA>
<PARA> What existed at the time the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare was doing its work was a system in Victoria which was really only a system for drugs that escaped the ADEC net. That system is described at page 57 of the Senate Committee report under the heading, `The Victorian registration system'. Under that system, which was introduced in 1948, proprietary medicines had to be registered in Victoria before they could be advertised or sold in that State. In the absence of any other registration scheme, the Victorian system has been important in Australia, especially considering the small size of our national market and, therefore, the natural desire of manufacturers to be able to include Victoria within their marketing. Although a system has been operating in only one State, it has, in effect, been one that has been followed by manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA> The one reason that the Victorian scheme was so important was that it enabled the scrutiny of drugs manufactured locally from local raw materials. Had they not been manufactured locally or had the raw materials not been local, then the substances would have been picked up under the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee mechanism. This meant that any drugs or therapeutic goods which were manufactured locally from local materials which were not sold in Victoria, which were not intended to be sold in Victoria, and which, therefore, were not required for sale in Victoria could escape any scrutiny at all. I should declare an interest here. I was at one time a member of the National Therapeutic Goods Advisory Committee, so I have an interest in what was proposed then and in what has transpired since. </PARA>
<PARA> My concerns about drugs include safety, predictable manufacturing quality, predictable biological effect and so on. It is the consumers of drugs whose rights are put at risk if there exists no system of registration or no system to require or enforce proper standards of manufacture and performance. I do not believe that we have adequate standards up to this time. We have had a couple of quite unsavoury episodes in this country in the last five years, if not on this precise point then on a point close enough to bring home to us the dangers to consumers of a system which is not adequate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian system was clearly unable to meet even its own objectives when the Senate Committee examined it earlier this decade. I was a member of that Senate Committee until I became a Minister, at which stage Senator Shirley Walters became the Chair of the Committee. We discovered from the Victorians that there were staff shortages; that there were no inspectorial staff; that information storage and retrieval was done manually; that there were inadequate evaluation resources; and that information was not shared adequately between different levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of concerns like those, consideration was given, as long ago as 1970, to the establishment of a national registration scheme and of a national register. But it appears that even if we had taken the scheme that existed, the Victorian scheme, and the ADEC and said, `What can we do to improve those?', it was the view of the Senate Committee in 1981 that even reform of improvement of the existing scheme would not have overcome its shortcomings. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I remember that in 1970 the National Therapeutic Goods Advisory Committee put forward a suggestion to the Australian Health Ministers Conference for a national registration scheme. That was back as far as 1970. Thirdly, I remind the Senate that in 1986 at the Australian Health Ministers Conference it was agreed that a national registration scheme and its concomitant products register should be established. The Federal government of the day rejected that proposal later following objections from all sections of industry. The government of the day rejected the proposal even though all the State government authorities strongly supported implementation of the system. Nevertheless, in spite of the view of the Federal Government, the Senate Committee, supported by State governments, recommended unanimously in 1981 that a national registration scheme be instituted as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed that new products particularly should be made subject to the provisions of the scheme. But industry is still concerned, not unreasonably, about the equity of the charges. My colleague Senator Puplick has referred to these and I will not go over the points he made. Industry is concerned particularly about continuing charges where there may be no continuing service given. There is a point to be considered. Industry argues, I think reasonably, that the Victorian scheme should cease to operate on the day that the national scheme begins, so that there is at each stage a single set of regulations to which people must work. There is nothing in this Bill or in the statements that have been made by the Minister that gives us any reason to expect that the Victorian scheme will cease to operate at that point; and it should. It is all very well for those of us who receive our salaries as parliamentarians or who work in salaried positions. It is quite a different matter if one is manufacturing a product and trying to understand the codes to which one is working, to understand the regulations by which one is bound, and to realise that one is in a transitional period. We expect and demand that the Victorian scheme shall cease on the very day the national scheme begins, but we have no guarantee yet that that will happen. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of the self-interest which drives many industry representations-and I am not saying that that is improper; self-interest is quite helpful here, self-interest which, however, may overwhelm public interest on some occasions-there may be considerable substance to some of the concerns which industry has put to us. Further, there have been other inputs of significance as well. My colleague Senator Puplick has referred to some of these. The Business Regulation Review Unit has had some input. Senator Puplick has pointed out the statements made by that unit in its information paper No. 13 of March 1989 on therapeutic goods regulation in which it expressed some quite serious concerns about the course the Government proposes to take and about the regulation which is involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, Senator Puplick has drawn attention to significant input, that is, input from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which had some input into this area in 1988. Its report No. 295, entitled Therapeutic Goods: A Review of the Therapeutic Goods Evaluation and Testing Program, made some quite significant criticisms and laid down some standards by which we should be operating. Although they have been referred to by Senator Puplick, I will mention them again. The Public Accounts Committee said that charges should be performance related, not merely income generating. We have no guarantee from the Government that that is what is proposed. The Public Accounts Committee determined and reported that fees should be fair. Industry does not believe that they are fair; the Government must justify them. The Public Accounts Committee recommended that under no circumstances should there be cross-subsidisation by one category of goods in respect of another. We have no guarantee that that is the current situation. Finally, the Public Accounts Committee reported that fees for inclusion of goods already on the market should not be substantial. These are significant criticisms by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. We do not prejudge this matter, but we do want to get it right. I have indicated already that the Committee on which I serve is a strong supporter of the establishment of a national register; but we do not want a bad register, we want one that is right. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate has already discussed the principle of referring Bills to committees for examination and report. We have already passed certain motions in the Senate so that from the beginning of 1990 that will be happening more and more. The Senate has accepted the principle of the reference of Bills to committees and, as I say, has now gone some way towards giving effect to measures to have reference of Bills to committees for detailed examination become more frequent. The Senate has referred Bills to committees often in the past, generally with benefit to the Bills, benefit to the Senate and benefit to the country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that we do not lose sight of the time frame within which we must work. On the one hand, Senator Coulter has mentioned to us that he thinks the time frame is urgent because he believes that there may be an election coming. Senator Coulter may be right on this matter. On the other hand, however, the scheme which we are considering for a national register has been germinating for a long time. It is actually worth getting it right before we put it in place. It is worth ironing out the wrinkles now, not asking us to pass something and hope that we can get it right later. A committee reference is an appropriate way to go about doing this. I serve on the committee to which reference is proposed. That committee actually has fixed up two matters for the Government in the past year, and we can fix this one up as well. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Minister for Local Government (Senator Reynolds), first, that there was the question of the allocation of licences for fishing for southern bluefin tuna. Honourable senators may say that that is a small matter; it was not a small matter for the southern bluefin tuna fisherman. My cousin, Senator Michael Baume, is in the chamber. He will remember that on the south coast of New South Wales it was a major problem, but the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology was able to get an answer which was acceptable to government and the industry and that matter was fixed; it was a negotiated solution. Second, there was an inquiry concerned with the Government proposal to deregulate the sugar industry. I remind the Minister that that is a matter of some importance to her State. It was proposed that we should deregulate the sugar industry and allow the importation of sugar, ending a 70-year-old embargo-a matter of great political sensitivity and a matter which caused a lot of fear in the industry. After consulting across the industry the Senate Committee was able to make suggestions to government which were adopted, so far with success, so far without any pain to the industry. Again, change had been implemented without any of the detriment to the industry which we had been led to expect might occur. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Committee has a record of taking references like this, in completing them, and making a success of them. I think that the Senate Committee could make a good job of examining this proposal for a register of therapeutic goods. The Committee could work expeditiously, and we could have the task done by the reporting time set out in Senator Puplick's motion. It would involve a bit of hurry up, but that is all right; it would be well worth the effort. If the Senate is serious about submitting legislation to Senate committees for examination, then this is one appropriate piece of legislation for such examination. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be apparent from the history of the matter that I and my Party are not ipso facto opposed to the proposal that the Government has brought forward. Members of the Liberal Party were on the committee which supported the principle back in 1981. The history of that earlier Senate committee work makes it crystal clear that we are not opposed ipso facto, but we do want to get it right. We do want to discover and correct any wrinkles or faults. We want to respond to the concerns of industry which have come in now, as my colleague Senator Puplick has said, from a number of organisations, most of whose members have spoken to me as well. I do not want to accept or reject their concerns, I do not want to accept or reject the bland assertions of government at this stage. I want to hear from those who will have to live with the legislation. I want to hear from those whose lives, livelihoods and businesses it will affect. I want to hear from those members of the public who think they have an interest. As it has done before, the Senate Committee can then fix the matter up. This is what such references are all about. This is why we can do it in this case. It is to be hoped that the Senate will agree to the reference. It follows that I am speaking to support very strongly the amendment which has been moved by my colleague Senator Puplick to the motion for the second reading and to indicate that I will support also the course of action which he has proposed for this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak briefly on only one aspect of two of the Bills before us-that is, the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Therapeutic Goods Bills-as they have affected directly constituents of mine in Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn, first of all, to the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). Clause 31 of this Bill inserts a new section which will empower the Minister to formulate a statement of the rights and responsibilities to be enjoyed and met by residents of approved nursing homes. Such a charter for residents of nursing homes is indeed needed. We had access to a draft charter in a report recently tabled in the Senate entitled A Guide to Residents' Rights in Nursing Homes and Hostels. The charter here had 20 components, all of which are admirable. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to draw the Senate's attention to the first two of these clauses-first, that residents in nursing homes should have the right to be treated and accepted as an individual by those in the same facility and, secondly, that they should have the right to maintain personal independence, personal choice and personal responsibility for all actions, including a recognition that some actions may involve an element of risk which the resident accepts, and which should not be used to prevent or restrict those actions. In short, the charter in this particular report lays down the rights of residents in nursing homes to dignity, proper care and attention. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently in Western Australia some nursing homes have been under investigation because of the complaints that have been made. It has been shown that these nursing homes did not have the best interests of their residents at heart in some of their activities. I will not detail the complaints here in the Senate; they have been detailed widely in the press in Western Australia. In short, the main complaints were of over-sedation , patients not being involved correctly with decision making on their behalf, and not being given dignity or being treated with the kindness and care that they deserved. In addition, there have been some atrocious cases of the most appalling neglect. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I would particularly like to raise in the Senate today is that when staff in those nursing homes made complaints they were dismissed in some cases and then placed on a black list; that is, they were unable to obtain employment in the nursing home industry afterwards. I drew this matter to the attention of the Senate recently in an adjournment speech. Through that speech, I also drew the matter to the attention of the Minister for Community Services and Health, Dr Blewett. I commend Dr Blewett for addressing that issue. In a response, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government believes the majority of nursing home owners, care managers and staff provide the best possible qualify of life for residents. However, the Government wishes to ensure that all elderly people enjoy the best possible quality of life and has embarked on a vigorous campaign of dealing with these homes which persistently and seriously undermine the qualify of life for their residents. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I am most concerned at Senator Jenkins' report of the blacklisting of the staff member who chose to speak out about the abuse and neglect occurring in nursing homes. The Department of Community Services and Health and, I am sure, State government bodies offer confidential investigation of complaints to avoid the unfortunate scapegoating of those who speak out. </PARA>
<PARA> I call on the nursing home associations in Western Australia to come clean on the allegations that this staff member has been passed over for employment because she blew the whistle on what has been proven to be a scandalous situation. </PARA>
<PARA>That matter is currently being addressed. It is essential that it is properly addressed. If residents in nursing homes are not being treated properly and if a staff member working in one of those homes chooses to speak out, it is essential that that person is not blacklisted in this way. What is more likely to happen-and what I believe has happened on a number of occasions-is that a person, especially a breadwinner, will be afraid to speak out. So the charter is needed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats question whether it is adequate for the charter to be drawn up by the Minister alone. We would certainly prefer the charter to be debated in the Parliament and, if necessary, adjusted by the Parliament. There needs to be a full public debate, including an input by our electors, by residents in nursing homes, their relatives, friends and trusted advocates and by people in the nursing home industry. This is too important a matter to be subject to a list of regulations which would no doubt be drawn up by bureaucrats in the Minister's Department-well-meaning bureaucrats, I am sure, who could not have access to the responses that we in the Parliament can have access to. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem with having such a charter set into regulations would be that it would come into law immediately the regulations were tabled-that is, before public and open scrutiny had taken place. The regulations, like all regulations, could only be allowed or disallowed, so no adjustment to them is possible. There are obvious problems in disallowing regulations which have already come into law. As I said before, it would not be possible to have a full scrutiny of all the developmental stages of the regulations. In short, the Australian Democrats are in full support of the charter but we believe that it must be set up properly and openly. Therefore, we will be supporting the Opposition's amendments in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The second aspect of this legislative package which I wish to address is therapeutic goods with particular regard to the registration of therapeutic agents and National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) decisions. It is a well-known fact that drugs have different effects of varying degrees on different people. One man's meat can well be another man's poison in this regard and this has been shown to be so. It is all the more important, therefore, that adverse reactions be tabled and examined. It is also important that this be mandatory. Unfortunately, as I understand it, unless a special case is made, this is definitely not the case at present. </PARA>
<PARA> I have raised before in this place the issue of the drug Depo-Medrol, which is the brand name of methylprednisolone acetate sterile aqueous suspension. This drug is administered mostly into the joints of muscles and adverse reactions which some patients have endured have been listed in the pharmacopoeia of information put out by drug companies. The pharmacopoeia shows that Depo-Medrol is normally administered into joints, specifically knees, ankles, shoulders, elbows and wrists, and also into muscles. The appropriate dosage is listed and the publication quite clearly states:</PARA>
<PARA>Joints not suitable for injection are those that are automatically inaccessible such as the spinal joints and those like the sacroiliac joints that are devoid of synovial space. </PARA>
<PARA>Nonetheless, some doctors, as a last resort-and, unfortunately, not always as a last resort-have used the drug epidurally and, in some cases, the results have been disastrous for the people concerned, who have been left very much worse off than they were before. This matter has concerned me greatly as more than 100 people have contacted my office with regard to this matter. I have spoken face to face with some 30 people who have suffered dramatic adverse effects from the administration of Depo-Medrol epidurally. I have written to the manufacturer, Upjohn Pty Ltd. Upjohn wrote back and said that the information given with the product under the heading `Warnings' states:</PARA>
<PARA> Depo-Medrol is not recommended for intrathecal administration. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the heading `Adverse Reactions' the following comment is made:</PARA>
<PARA>Arachnoiditis has been reported following intrathecal administration. </PARA>
<PARA>In the same letter, the Managing Director of Upjohn states:</PARA>
<PARA>We do not include epi- or extra-dural administration as a recommended route of administration in our product information . . . We have no plans at this time to apply for registration of epi- or extra-dural administration because to do so would require the design and conduct of expensive clinical trials. </PARA>
<PARA>That letter was dated 27 October 1987. As a result of the matters that I brought forward with regard to some of the results of the administration of the drug Depo-Medrol by the epidural route, the Western Australian Minister for Health, Mr Keith Wilson, and the State Commissioner for Health, Dr Bruce Armstrong, have proposed and, in fact, have set out the following actions:</PARA>
<PARA> A letter is to be sent by the Health Department to all registered medical practitioners in Western Australia outlining the facts regarding epidural use of Depo-Medrol and drawing attention, specifically, to the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee's decision and the manufacturer's recommendation regarding use. </PARA>
<PARA> It will highlight the need for provision of information to enable patients to make an informed decision in regard to the use of epidural Depo-Medrol. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Health and Medical Research Council is being requested to sponsor a controlled clinical test of the efficacy of epidural Depo-Medrol. The Federal Minister for Health, Dr Neal Blewett has also been requested to support the study. </PARA>
<PARA> Relevant professional groups are to be asked to develop a protocol for the administration of Depo-Medrol as an interim measure until such time as the issue is fully resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> An independent investigation is to be undertaken of cases of reported adverse effects of Depo-Medrol use that have been brought to the Health Department's attention. </PARA>
<PARA>As I understand it, the committee investigating the adverse effects is now up and running; it is already taking evidence. I have used this particular case as an example of what I believe should be done in cases where there is any possibility of adverse reactions by patients to the particular use of a particular drug. I certainly commend the Western Australian Minister for Health and the Western Australian Health Commissioner for having taken these steps. Matters such as these are crucially important with regard to the registration of therapeutic agents and to decisions made by the NHMRC. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are discussing a trilogy of Bills in a cognate debate, the first of which is not related to the second two. The first Bill, the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, covers several areas and two portfolios. The other Bills being discussed are the Therapeutic Goods Bill 1989 and the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Bill 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I first read these Bills I was reminded of the story of the young chap who was working in a pram factory in Germany before the Second World War. He met a nice young girl one day and they got on very well. They got married and in due course were going to have a baby. He thought it would be very nice to give his wife a present of a pram so he went to the front of the factory and asked whether he could buy a pram. He was told that there was no way of buying a pram there. He thought about it and at the end of every day's work he took home a part that was manufactured in each section of the factory. When he had all the parts he assembled them in his lounge room. When he put them together he found that he did not have a pram at all; he had a machine gun. That shows that somebody knew what was going on, although he did not. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has presented many of its recent Bills in a way that is quite attractive, with aims, objects and principles with which nobody could really disagree, but when it comes to the machinery by which the Bills are to be administered we are being asked to buy a pig in a poke. There have been many problems in this respect. I cite, for example, the introduction of the vocational register for general practitioners. The regulations for that had to be referred to a committee and brought back to the Senate for approval. The legislation by which the Government is dismantling disability services is creating consternation in the industry, mainly because people do not know what is going on. The same applies to the legislation with respect to therapeutic goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody could argue with the principles on which the Government is operating to bring in the therapeutic goods legislation, but we do not know the means by which it is to be administered. That is why there is so much consternation in that industry. The position is similar with respect to nursing homes. We need to examine the machinery by which the Bill is to be administered. Part 5 of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) deals with the health aspects of the legislation and there are nine elements in it, most of which are purely machinery matters, but two of which are of particular concern. One is the new definition of a proprietor of a pathology services clinic. The Opposition wants to know what the Government wants to achieve by having one person responsible for the provision of those services, for the staffing and the provision of equipment. We would like that clarified. Perhaps that has been clarified since I first read the Bill; if so, I have not heard of it. The other element concerns the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, which has been discussed this morning, and I will not repeat the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent years, the administration of health in Australia has been dismantled. Medicare, for example, has been hived off. In order to qualify for Medicare benefits, one must be actually sick. Medicare does not deal with, say, preventive medicine in any way. Preventive care has been hived off to the Better Health Commission, Worksafe Australia and such institutions. Quarantine, which was originally the only responsibility of the Federal Government, is not part of Medicare. Medicare itself has become a much more restricted service and is becoming more restricted as we go on. Nursing care for the aged has also been hived off. Care for the disabled, hostels and domiciliary care have been compartmentalised so that we have a different organisation from that which we had previously. </PARA>
<PARA> If a business makes some error in administration, only the people in that business are badly affected, but if a government makes some major administrative blunder the whole community is affected. For example, in past years the flow of patients was from their own homes into nursing homes, hostels or institutions for the disabled and then to hospitals. That was the way the funding was organised. The care of people in their own homes was recognised as being a low cost operation and the care of people in hospitals as a high cost operation. The Government is now reversing the flow of patients; it is getting people out of hospitals into nursing homes and hostels and then out of those institutions back into their own homes. It has taken the Government quite a while to realise that that is the right way to go. I am rather pleased that it has at last found out that it is the right way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was a young doctor there were not the big nursing home institutions that we have today. Nursing homes were places where two or three nursing sisters got together, bought an old, rambling house, and looked after upwards of a dozen people in it. It was a most congenial arrangement because the residents were near relatives and friends, visiting was easy and parking was easy. Their children could visit and grandchildren could call in after school. They could be taken for drives if they were well enough. They could be taken to church and taken shopping. There was a good relationship between those little nursing homes and the service clubs in the area, like Lions and Rotary, and it did not even seem to matter much what was wrong with the patients. Most older people suffer from arthritis, strokes or cancer, and they just have to be looked after. They are very happy if they are looked after, nursed properly and fed properly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government then came along and said, `We are here to help you'. That structure was dismantled. The first thing the Government did was declare such nursing homes to be fire traps. To my knowledge, there has never been a fire in one of those little homes in Australia. I do not think there has been a fire in a private nursing home in Australia. It is only in the government-funded nursing homes that there have been fires. Nevertheless, all the little nursing homes were closed down and the bigger institutions came into being and were subsidised by government. All kinds of specialists appeared. Specialist therapists, including speech therapists, physiotherapists and nursing aids appeared. A whole industry grew up simply because of the way in which the Government was funding nursing care. People felt as if they were neglecting their patients if they did not put them in these institutions where they could have so-called proper treatment and expert care. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has now realised the error of its ways and is using financial coercion to reverse the flow of people simply because the policies followed by successive governments, not just the Labor Government, resulted in many inappropriate admissions to nursing homes. Many of the people who qualified for care in nursing homes should not have been in nursing homes, but the hospitals were anxious to get rid of their extended stay patients by putting them in nursing homes. The nursing homes wanted to increase their turnover and they had to get people into hostels and back into their own homes. So although the Government is now following the right program, it did not properly consult the industry. Here are all these people who thought that they were doing the right thing. The nursing homes had been inspected, licensed and audited and had every other kind of infiltration, I suppose one would call it, by the Government into their business and the patients' business, and now they are being virtually dismantled, the patients are being put back into their own homes and the Government is going to concentrate on providing adequate care at home. That is the right track, but what I complain about is the lack of consultation with the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is not prepared simply to let go of the whole thing. It is introducing agreements, charters and contracts which have been virtually kept secret from the people who are going to have to operate the businesses. Presumably, the content of the agreements, charters and contracts is to be left in the hands of the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett). The Opposition wants these instruments laid before both Houses of the Parliament so that they can be amended if necessary. It may not be necessary to amend them, but it is only right that the Parliament and the people should have access to instruments that are going to be the nuts and bolts of the administration of the nursing homes themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Also contained in the legislation is the provision of inspectors and bovver boys who will be going around the nursing homes with access to all the staff and patients, be able to command the production of document and look at all the equipment. Nobody argues that somebody has to do this, but the Government has not defined in any precise way at all what all these different inspectors and monitors are going to be doing. For example, I always thought that community visitors were the friend of the friendless in nursing homes. A community visitor could be allocated to go and see people who required a friend and perhaps get them out of their problem. But it now appears that a community visitor will have equal authority with all the other monitors and inspectors who will be introduced for the administration of nursing homes. The Opposition wishes to have some clarification of just what is involved in that.</PARA>
<PARA> I think that one of the major problems with bringing in legislation of this nature is that the Government starts off by having some sort of an inquiry, however inadequate, and usually only with one portion of the industry-in this case the patients-and then brings in legislation that is directed towards rectifying problems in that area but does not pay any attention to the proprietors, operators and staff of nursing homes, who all have rights too. </PARA>
<PARA> If patients' rights are brought in-this was dealt with very adequately today by Senator Coulter-patients' rights will vary depending on their testimentary capacity which, in turn, will depend on the illness they have got. That is a lot more complicated area than people think. It is not only patients who have rights, and I think that the neglect to consult with proprietors, operators and staff has led to a lot of the consternation that exists in the industry at the moment. These Government monitoring teams are already in the field inspecting various nursing homes, and grave inconsistencies have been found in their reports. This will be another area which will cause more than a few problems. In addition, the agreements, charters and rights have already been found to interfere with the professional duty of the doctors and nurses who look after patients. </PARA>
<PARA> When a situation like that exists where the Government is bringing down an edict to say, `Here are the patients' rights, and this is what has got to happen', one finds that this is an infringement on the professional duty of the profession and there is then a major problem. I think the Government is faced with this problem now and should pay a lot of attention to that. So we are insisting that these charters, agreements and contracts be tabled in both Houses and debated. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the Therapeutic Goods Bill. I have already mentioned that our objection to that Bill is that, although it is a Bill which nobody can argue with and which everybody supports, it contains no regulations under which people in the industry can operate with some certainty. That was adequately dealt with by Senator Peter Baume. I do not want to repeat all of his arguments. I think it is a simple case where the Government ought to agree that this matter, like all the ones I mentioned, also be sent off for proper examination by a Senate committee. I understand the worry that perhaps there is going to be an election that will interfere with the process but, nevertheless, the Senate has an on going job. The composition of the Senate does not alter until 30 June next year. Whether there is an election or not, a matter of importance such as this where we are wanting to have some degree of certainty about our therahpeutic goods, the quality of the goods, the quality of the advertising, and the coordination of the role of the States and the Federal Government in the administration of those matters should be attended to by the Senate. It is for those reasons that I support the position that has been put today by honourable senators from the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak briefly today on just one of the package of three Bills that we are debating cognately, namely, the Therapeutic Goods Bill 1989, and I speak in strong support of the second reading amendment moved by my colleague Senator Puplick, on behalf of the Opposition, which essentially requires that the Senate refer the Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology for inquiry and report by the first sitting day in March 1990 on a wide range of the technical issues which, although technical issues, have very important implications in relation to the Government's proposals. I make the basic purpose of the legislation clear at the outset, as other speakers on the Opposition side have done, including the shadow Minister for Health, Mr Peter Shack, in the House of Representatives when this Bill was debated on 26 October, who said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In principle, both the Opposition and the therapeutic goods industry support the broad objectives of the Therapeutic Goods Bill. There are a number of obvious advantages to the community and the therapeutic goods industry in having a unified system of controls over therapeutic products and their advertising. There is no argument about the value of ensuring the quality, safety and efficacy of therapeutic goods and the need to protect the public interest in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the basic purpose of this legislation is to establish and maintain a national system of controls relating to the quality, safety and efficacy of therapeutic goods for export and for consumption within Australia. There are a number of reasons why we believe that this Bill, whilst we are supportive of it in principle, should be referred for detailed examination to an appropriate committee, and in this case we recommend the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. We share a range of concerns expressed by the industry in relation to the Bills-the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, Therapeutic Goods Bill 1989 and the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Bill 1989-and, very importantly, in relation to the regulations which underpin the Therapeutic Goods Bill. The content of the Bill is very much a motherhood type of statement. It is a very general Bill. The real essence of the substance of the Bill is to be contained in the regulations. As I understand it, some draft regulations have been prepared but at the same time many proposed changes have been foreshadowed to those draft regulations following consultation with industry-but, I stress, inadequate consultation in the eyes of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a very wide-ranging industry. The Bill covers a huge variety of goods. One estimate is that up to 40,000 products are covered by this Bill, and that is probably a conservative estimate. The Australian Dental Association, for example, in representations to me-because it is concerned that all dental products will be encompassed by the Bill-made the point that in that industry alone there are about 30,000 separate products. So the range of products that is to be caught by the Bill as a whole, when one considers the full definition of therapeutic goods, is enormous. </PARA>
<PARA> It is understandable in some ways, therefore, that the consultations with the therapeutic goods industries and manufacturers of the products that have been caught by the Bill have been less than adequate, certainly in the eyes of the industry. From the representations that I and, I know, many of my colleagues have received, I would certainly support the view that those consultations have been inadequate. It is a basic problem, if this Parliament is to debate legislation which has a great impact throughout the community, not just on the consumers but also on the manufacturers of therapeutic goods, and particularly when we see this industry as having considerable potential for export, that the regulations, rather than the substance of the Bill that we are now debating, will determine the success or otherwise of the proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> At least one of the major advantages of having these matters referred for consideration to a parliamentary committee is that-certainly I would have thought it would have to be a requirement-the regulations would be available for debate and consideration by that committee. </PARA>
<PARA> So I want to make it clear that we are not opposed to the Bill per se. We support the proposition in principle, but we believe that it is such an important Bill that if we take the extra time to get it right-and the time that has not yet been granted-the advantages in the long term will make up for any temporary delay in implementing the Bill. The Opposition amendment puts a time limit on the committee of the first sitting day in March 1990 to report on it. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst there are agreements from many quarters about the desirability of having a national system for therapeutic goods controls, it is not universal. As I understand it, in my own State of Victoria, the Victorian Government has indicated its intention to retain its own registration system, at least until well into 1990. That in itself raises very important questions about the prospect of duplication, overlapping and outright confusion arising from a situation where one may have two systems, State and Federal, operating for the same industry at the one time. I hope that the Minister, in summing up this debate, and when we get to the committee stage of the debate, will be able to tell us about the Victorian situation and its implications in terms of the timing and the application of the Federal Bill when it is enacted. </PARA>
<PARA> Various other issues are of concern. For example, the role of the National Health and Medical Research Council will be very important. But it should be borne in mind that the NHMRC exists pursuant to order-in-Council and, as such, it lacks the accountability that applies to many other organisations, certainly the accountability to Parliament. It is not required to justify its decisions in the same way as are many other government or public bodies. There are few, if any, workable avenues of appeal against its recommendations, yet the recommendations and advisings of the National Health and Medical Research Council will be a very important input into the actual operation of the new proposed controls. So that is another matter that requires considerable investigation and careful consideration by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole question of the extent to which the detail of regulation and control proposed in the Bills is necessary also requires consideration. We should never forget the fact that, whilst controls may be desirable for certain reasons, they always have a cost. The regulatory burden imposed on business in Australia-not just through this Bill but through the whole gamut of regulation that we have progressively applied to industry, business and commercial activity in Australia over many years-is one of the major reasons, I believe, why business is struggling in Australia to be competitive and productive in the way that we all want it to be. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industries Assistance Commission inquiry in 1987 into medical and scientific equipment raised considerable questions about the desirability of the proposals that are now in this Bill so far as the principle is concerned. It pointed very much to the question of the costs involved in a national system of regulation and control along the lines of that now being envisaged, as did the Business Regulation Review Unit earlier this year. So important government bodies have expressed concern about the cost elements involved in proposals of the nature now envisaged in the Therapeutic Goods Bill. I hope that an investigation by an appropriate parliamentary committee into the Bill and its details will take that into account as well. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think we ought to be taking it for granted that all the regulations and regulatory measures proposed in the Bill, and presumably in the regulations as will be drafted and promulgated, should be taken as necessary without careful consideration by the Parliament. It is about time that we started looking at reducing the amount of regulation and control over industry and productive activity in Australia and not increasing it, unless there are very good reasons for doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> The range of representations that I and, I know, many of my colleagues have had on this Bill has been very wide indeed-much wider than one normally gets on legislation of this nature. I have had representations from the Australian Dental Association, the Association of Professional Homeopaths, from the Herbalists Association, certainly of Victoria and, I think, of other States as well and from individual companies engaged in these parts of the therapeutic goods industries or wider-all of which boil down to saying that the Bill is very detailed. To some extent it snuck up on the industry without it being able to encompass the magnitude of the implications, despite the fact that discussions on the matter have been proceeding on and off for a lengthy period-running into years. Because it is so detailed and so broad there are many associations and individual companies, most of which are small businesses, who have found it impossible to catch up with what is proposed. They have had difficulties, despite the fact that they are part of the industry, as also, and I believe understandably, have many members of parliament. It is for these reasons, along with the others I have mentioned, that I believe it is very important indeed that this Bill be referred, as the Opposition is proposing, to a Senate committee for investigation and early report. </PARA>
<PARA> The best course of action, I think, is to wait until all of the implications and unanswered objections to this legislation are resolved. That is not going to lead to the creation of any new vacuum. There is an existing system in place and we should not forget that. There are important gaps in it and that is of course why the legislation is being proposed, but it is a system which, whilst not perfect, has persisted for a long time now without any major problems arising. Another few months is not going to hurt at all in that context. On the contrary, it will give the Government more time to get things right, and that is something we would all welcome. Over the last few years we have seen far too much of governments rushing in with hastily and sloppily prepared legislation, without adequate consultation with those people who will be affected by it, whether they be consumers, producers or what have you. </PARA>
<PARA> It is one of the major indictments I would have of the activities of the Hawke Government over recent years. The quality of its legislative proposals, when it comes to their drafting and the subsequent necessity to change them in this Parliament because it has got it wrong the first time, has been one of the hallmarks of this Government. Let us give the Government a chance to get it right this time on its own behalf and, more importantly, on behalf of the people who will be affected by the legislation. The extra time spent in doing that will in the long run save time as well as prevent unnecessary upheaval and cost to both the industry and the users of the therapeutic goods. </PARA>
<PARA> I very strongly support the amendment proposed by the Opposition that the Therapeutic Goods Bill 1989, whilst being supported in principle, be referred for detailed consideration of its underpinning and that we have another look at it early next year, by which stage the Senate standing committee to which it would be referred would have reported back. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the general intent of the Therapeutic Goods Bill 1989 in that its objective is to ensure the quality, safety and effectiveness of therapeutic goods on the Australian market from the point of supply by means of standard national uniform legislation. This Bill is something of a motherhood Bill and I doubt that any responsible person could criticise its broad concept. I am, however, concerned about aspects of its application and implementation. It will apply to the manufacture and supply of a great range of products, including pharmaceutical drugs, dietary supplements, health foods, herbal and homeopathic products and a variety of others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before the Senate can assess the legislation, there are two other necessary components that require examination. Firstly, there are the regulations that are an important component of the Bill's implementation. I understand that in the development of the regulations there have been consultations between departmental officers and representatives of a number of groups to be affected by the Therapeutic Goods Bill, for example, the National Nutritional Foods Association Inc. and the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association. I do not know whether the regulations have been completed or whether any member of the Senate has seen them. If they are not completed or available for consideration, I would like to know when they will be available because I believe they are very important. While I have some concern that this legislative proposal should come before us without the supplementary detail of the regulations, I do not perceive that as being the major impediment to the implementation of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> If a national uniform standard is to apply, there should be no conflicting or additional standards applying at the State or Territory level. I am aware that all departments of health have supported the introduction of a national uniform system, but where are the complementary legislative packages from the States and Territories? It is essential that all States and Territories have complementary legislation ready to be implemented at the same time as a national system is to commence, otherwise there will be an extension of the present problem of having to comply with a range of differing requirements in various States. There could even be the ridiculous situation of having to comply in one State with differing State and national requirements for manufacturing and packaging. </PARA>
<PARA> Some States can be sluggish in surrendering aspects of what they deem expressions of States rights; some could be unwilling to discard their own regulations in favour of those of another State. In regard to the latter, I doubt whether anyone here could guarantee that New South Wales would discard its own regulations and guidelines in order to comply with those under which Victoria operates. Operating with a dual system of standards can only increase costs, not once but twice or more, as State changes could be introduced piecemeal. These costs will not be absorbed by the manufacturer or supplier but will be passed on to the consumer. A national uniform system should not be implemented until such time as States and Territories can demonstrate more than goodwill and good intentions. As I stated before, there must be complementary legislation ready to be implemented at the same time as any national system is to commence. </PARA>
<PARA> I have only one comment to make on the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Bill 1989. If there are to be fees and charges, it should be possible to demonstrate some return for these proposed charges. As there are already extended and unacceptable delays in evaluation and approval times for pharmaceutical products, how can the imposition of fees and charges guarantee a reduction in these delays? Part of the current problem is the lack of staff to carry out the evaluation. If the number of applications for evaluation and listing is to be increased greatly, which must be the case when this Bill is applied to the great number of additional products that will come under the definition of `therapeutic', will there be sufficient staff available for appointment even to keep pace with the applications, let alone reduce the processing time?</PARA>
<PARA> I question that there will be a demonstrable reduction in evaluation and approval times, but that questioning is minor compared to my prime concern in regard to the possible introduction of a national uniform standard without complementary State and Territory legislation ready to be implemented at the same time. To pass these two items of legislation before the regulations have been drawn up and before there is complementary legislation at the State level can lead only to confusion. It would be disappointing if, for want of a little more time and deliberation, the very sound proposal to introduce national uniform standards for therapeutic goods were to become cumbersome, unsatisfactory and unworkable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Government I support the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, the Therapeutic Goods Bill 1989 and the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Bill 1989 although at the moment I am not as fully briefed as I might be to deal with the various matters that have been raised in the course of this very interesting second reading debate. As far as the Therapeutic Goods Bill is concerned, in general the Government is trying to achieve a situation where there is in place a clear national strategy, a system of controls relating to the quality, safety and efficacy of therapeutic goods that are supplied in Australia, wherever they are produced, or are to be exported from Australia. I believe that this attempt to get such common standards in place has the support of all senators in this chamber, of industry, and particularly of the consumers or users of therapeutic goods. These therapeutic goods are absolutely essential in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Nevertheless, we do not know precisely the range of products available within the Australian community because many products can enter our marketplace without prior recording or scrutiny. We know that they play a major beneficial role in modifying the impacts and outcomes of illnesses and contribute greatly to the quality of life which individuals now enjoy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this situation it has been thought useful to bring this legislation before the chamber after many months of arduous discussion with industry and consumer groups. The reason I am a little hesitant about dealing fully and comprehensively with this Bill is that I learned from Senator Coulter only a short while ago that he wishes to place some amendments before the chamber for its consideration. No doubt that matter could come to the Committee if the Bill passes the second reading stage. That is the prior question. I have undertaken to examine over the lunch break the amendments to be moved by Senator Coulter on behalf of the Australian Democrats in order to ascertain their scope and purpose and whether they are sufficiently compatible with the purpose of the Bill. </PARA>

However, I understand that Senator Coulter wants some indication of the Government's stance in relation to the amendments which he has circulated before he finally makes up his mind whether further discussions are required within a committee of the Senate. That is what will occur over the lunch break.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is certainly no disrespect to the Senate to say that this matter has been sufficiently canvassed over many months-virtually years-to allow this chamber to come to a decision. There is certainly no attempt to short-circuit or undermine the usual deliberations and lengthy considerations of these matters which properly constitute the review task of the Senate; but the discussions have taken place, as I say, over a long period and, in our view, this package of therapeutic goods Bills could and should be supported by the chamber.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce to the Confederation of Australian Industry (CAI) and Westpac Banking Corporation survey of industrial trends for the December quarter 1989. In particular, I draw the attention of the Minister to the findings of the survey: firstly, business expectations have fallen sharply and a slowdown in manufacturing is under way; secondly, not one manufacturer surveyed predicts an improvement in the general business climate; thirdly, manufacturers predict a marked decline in production in the March quarter 1990; fourthly, manufacturing investment is slowing down and investment plans have been revised down markedly; fifthly, employment is expected to decline dramatically over the next three months; and, sixthly, export deliveries will stabilise at low levels. Does the Minister agree that these results presage a serious downturn in the manufacturing sector? Is the anticipated production slump part of this Government's economic strategy? Can he explain how a downturn in manufacturing investment and production, and no anticipated increase in exports, even from low levels, will provide a basis for sustainable recovery?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the CAI-Westpac survey. That survey and others are predicting a slowdown in activity. In so far as the investment part of Senator Chaney's question is concerned, all information available to the Government suggests that investment anticipations are still higher than the Budget projections which, as I recall them, were for a 6 per cent real increase in investment. The figures have come down from a very abnormal high to something in the order of 9 or 10 per cent real anticipated increase in investment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In so far as the slowing of the economy is concerned, the Government does not see that there is any evidence available which suggests strongly that the economy is heading for a crash landing-if I can put it in those terms-as distinct from a softer landing. The September quarter national accounts show that the economy slowed in that quarter broadly in line with Budget anticipations. As I have said, the anticipations in respect of investment are still quite buoyant compared with what they have been historically. The latest labour force statistics show continued strength in employment but, as I said to the Senate the other day, that figure has always lagged behind other aspects of business activity and I do not think too high a reliance can be placed on that. The Government's strategy has been designed to reduce demand from unsustainable levels and various arms of policy have been tightened for that purpose. In so far as export anticipations are concerned, the Government believes that export activity will improve as domestic demand slackens. While the CAI survey might suggest a degree of gloom about that, the Government believes that that will nonetheless happen.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a supplementary question, Mr President. I note the Minister's fairly optimistic response to the rather gloomy report put out by the CAI and Westpac and his reliance in the earlier part of his answer on the investment figures. Is the Minister concerned that the same report suggests that capital expenditure during 1989 was to replace existing capacity-61 per cent of respondents said that the capital investment about which the Minister is so pleased, as I am, was merely to replace existing capacity-and that this trend would continue in the next 12 months? Is the Minister concerned that this means that there is not as much new capacity being brought on stream as the raw figures might have indicated?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even before the survey referred to in Senator Chaney's question, the issue of whether investment is being directed to new capacity or replacement capacity has been a difficult one to gauge. There have been many different views about that. In the CAI-Westpac survey, 38 per cent of firms said that their investment plans would be aimed principally at adding new capacity. As I recall it, 62 per cent of firms said that their investment would be to replace current capacity. Even though the effect of that is not nearly as significant as investment for new capacity, it does have an effect on the overall efficiency of the economy and of firms.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, but a current machine replaced by a new, higher technology machine will have an influence on the capacity of that firm, although it may not be described as `new capacity'-it is changed technology and so on. Looking at the figures, the evidence is uncertain in respect of an answer to this question. I have had the Bureau of Industry Economics working on the issue. Its conclusions-and I hesitate to use the word-are generally comforting in the sense that it comes down with the view, based on surveys of some 200 firms, as I recall it, that a lot of investment is going into new capacity. There is an enormous amount of anecdotal evidence-starting with firms such as Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd or ICI Australia Ltd, which are big firms, and moving down to smaller firms-about increasing capacity by new investment. I cannot give a categorical answer to the question. On the balance of information which I have, I would err on the side of saying that the investment is, by and large, leading to an increase in capacity and that is certainly supported by my observations of industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Chaney in his earlier question asked me about investment intentions. Some firms have announced investments. For example, one major firm which announced a $350m investment has reduced that in the current circumstances to a $200m investment this year. A bit of that is happening in terms of retracting prior announcements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of claims being made by a variety of people who have been conned by these so-called agents into paying large fees for a very minimal service. I stress at the outset that my Department treats all applications in the same way. No special privileges are given to applications that are lodged by agents. The fact is that applications are assessed on the merits of their individual case, not on the relative aesthetics of the way in which their applications are presented or any so-called special influence that agents may claim to have. I will give some examples of the cases brought to my attention recently. I will not mention the individual names of the agents at this stage, but let this be a clear warning to others that the next time I hear of such cases I may not hesitate to name the individuals in this chamber. In one instance a solicitor charged $2,000 simply to lodge an application for a further entry permit. The normal departmental fee for this type of application is $50.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take that excellent suggestion on board. In another case an agent charged $6,000 for services to a client. Those services included lodgment of an application for resident status and a further application for temporary entry residence after the initial one failed. The fact that the applications were compiled into a glossy, spiral-bound folder and submitted by the agent had no effect on the result. The applications were rejected in both instances. Finally, an agent who claimed to have a friend in the Department asked for payment of $5,000 up-front to take the case of a sponsor of an applicant whose original application had been refused. He had been considered by the Immigration Review Panel and finally had been subject to a personal appeal to me. The application, which was rejected, had the support of a member of parliament in all these processes. To my knowledge, the applicant has fortunately not taken up the offer by the agent. These types of people prey on the vulnerability of potential residents by using unsubstantiated claims about their ability to influence a decision, and they are making a fortune in the process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should also stress, however, that there is a number of reputable agents and firms who provide genuine assistance in the form of advice to clients. The impending changes to the migration legislation, which come into effect on 19 December this year, appear to have provoked a concerted effort on the part of some of the unscrupulous types to make the most of any uncertainty that people have. In recognition of this problem, the new migration legislation contains a provision under which agents can be prosecuted for claiming they have special influence. In any event, they must provide an itemised statement of their accounts. At this stage the principal advice that I would offer to any people contemplating the use of a migration agent would be to go to the nearest office of my Department and check out the reality of the situation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the great majority of Canberra residents, I share the view that Rosemary Follett had done an excellent job in leading the ACT, even if it was from the position of leader of a minority government. She had worked hard, as had her Ministers, in the interests of the ACT. That is in stark contrast to the alliance which has now taken over, which could not even find a proper excuse for a no-confidence motion. I am asked whether the Government would examine the need for a new election. To do that, we need first to look at what power we would have to do it; and, secondly, to look at whether a situation which calls for the exercise of that power exists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Section 16 of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act refers to a procedure whereby the Governor-General may dissolve the Assembly. He can do so if either of two things are occurring: one, if the Assembly is incapable of effectively performing its functions; or, secondly, if the Assembly is conducting its affairs in a grossly improper manner. If the Assembly were to be dissolved in that way, a commissioner would be appointed with powers in the Executive and an election would have to be held between 36 and 90 days afterwards. Of course, the Commonwealth Minister responsible would have to table the reasons for the decision in both Houses of Parliament. So we must look at whether the Assembly is incapable of effectively performing its functions or whether it is conducting its affairs in a grossly improper manner.</PARA>
<PARA> If one is searching for stability in the ACT the early indications are not all that promising. The Residents Rally and the Liberals have been at odds with each other on God knows how many issues, fluoridation being just one. Other issues are how to run the health care system and how to run the education system. The Liberal Party was elected on the ultimate pro-development platform-`We will let them build anywhere'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At least the prospect of Senator Puplick getting there remains remote. If we are looking at how this Assembly can perform, we should note that, during the Budget negotiations, Mr Duby of the No Self Government Party, to whom Senator Aulich earlier referred, called for $90m in additional expenditure while the Liberals called for expenditure cuts. No justification of any substance was given for the no confidence motion. The Australian Financial Review of 6 December said it all. It said of this new alliance that it was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . a joke masquerading as a government . . . a curious amalgam of political philosophies held together by no more than petty opportunism.</PARA>
<PARA>These people have elevated hypocrisy to new heights. The Residents Rally is led by a gentleman called Bernard Collaery. After the last election he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The very fact that we are here is because we reject the concept of party-political machines, so we won't form a coalition with Liberal and Labor. They will have to come down to us and find a community base.</PARA>
<PARA>The Liberals had no difficulty in coming down. As far as this coalition is concerned with the No Self Government Party, Mr Duby had this to say in his election material:</PARA>
<PARA>You can stop self-government. Don't be fooled. You can say no. Life under the new pretend parliament will be very different from the one you have now.</PARA>
<PARA>It did not take him long, however, in looking at the pretend parliament, to decide that the office was not all that much of a pretence. It gave access to the extra salary and the car.

I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel another question in relation to Jervis Bay. I preface my question by noting that a Defence Department review of alternative sites to which naval facilities in Sydney could be located is now under way. Therefore, I ask the Minister: How, and by whom, is the study of alternatives being conducted? Given that there is strong scepticism among environment groups about yet another study of relocation options being done within the Defence Department, will the Minister open up the review to comprehensive public input?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A month or so ago the Minister, Mr Simmons, directed the Department of Defence to look at alternative sites for the relocation of the fleet base. In looking at what sort of a team would do that, I think the Department of Defence has come up with a team which will more than cope with the task. The review team is drawn from the headquarters of the Australian Defence Force and the Facilities and Property Division of the Department. It is being oversighted by a major-general equivalent level steering group. The review team will conduct its study both by making use of the previous reports and information and by the commissioning of any further studies and data collection as it considers necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In initiating the review in the first place, Mr Simmons stressed that he wanted to avoid any bias that could be suggested by anybody in trying to come up with a predetermined outcome. To reinforce that view it is intended that interested groups will have an opportunity to make submissions to the review team. The officers and officials who were involved in the review were not responsible for the naval studies which concluded that Jervis Bay was the most suitable site. So they do not have any previous pride of authorship to protect. The officials from the Department of Defence Facilities and Property Division have, naturally enough, been involved in developing planned relocation in accordance with those guidelines, but they were not responsible for any of the original decision making.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as the fourth part of Senator Coulter's question is concerned, I think he misunderstands the nature of the environmental impact statement (EIS) and of the previous decision made to look at the possibility of sending the fleet to Jervis Bay. It was never the case that the future of the bombing range at Beecroft Peninsula should be determined on the basis of whether the fleet went there. The continued use of Beecroft Peninsula has never been conditional on the outcome of the EIS, and that position remains.</PARA>
<PARA> I have discussed the matter of Beecroft Peninsula in this chamber a number of times. The Government is of the view that it can, and should, remain as a bombing range. It has been well managed by the Navy and we do not believe that there needs to be any change to that arrangement. So there will not be any examination of that question in any proposed review.</PARA>

Therefore, if I am correct in how I read the Minister's reply, he has not answered the part of my question dealing with the opening up of the review to comprehensive public input.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the objections my Department raised with Navy in looking at the direction of the EIS was that it lacked information in the study of alternative sites. As I indicated earlier in Question Time in answer to Senator Newman, I have to discuss with Mr Beazley and Mr Simmons how we might adjust the EIS process and still achieve the result of testing the armaments depot question. As part of that process it may be the case that we continue with a consideration of alternatives there, and obviously, if we did, that would be opened up to full public scrutiny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no possibility that at the end of the day the public can be kept away from the process of looking at where a fleet base would be relocated. One would imagine that there are not too many places on the coastline of Australia-particularly on the east coast-where there would not be some objections from somebody about its relocation. So there are two possibilities for public involvement in the review: in the way that I have indicated, or in the EIS, depending upon how we wish to keep it going.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A major objective of the Customs Service is to upgrade the effectiveness of narcotics interception. There are all sorts of views about whether that can best be done by better intelligence or by massive manpower increases. Senator Jones is quite correct; Customs has reported a significant increase of 46 per cent in successful drug interceptions in 1988-89. This increase has been across all drug categories except heroin. However, I should point out that the amount of heroin seized has increased by 161 per cent over the previous year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The focus for Customs narcotics interception is the use of contraband enforcement teams and their application of risk management principles. These teams concentrate on drug enforcement activities through the identification and control of high risk areas at the Customs barrier. There is a greater reliance by Customs on activities such as the gathering of intelligence on persons involved in illicit drug activities, and closer cooperative links with other law enforcement organisations and non-government organisations involved in international trade. These methods have helped improve the success rate to which I referred and it is expected that these improvements will continue. I add that the training of Customs staff in a wide range of drug enforcement disciplines will continue to be a major priority for the Service.</PARA>
<PARA> In the absence of any national estimates of the totality of drug trends, Customs and other enforcement agencies are not in a position to estimate their effectiveness in terms of drug availability or abuse. All the Customs Service can say is that there has been this increasing performance in the detection of drug offences and drug interception. It is very difficult to quantify what the success rate is compared with the total drug market. I believe that the figures I have quoted provide encouraging support for the strategies and risk assessment systems employed by the Australian Customs Service which have been referred to on numerous occasions in the Senate in relation to questions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will provide an answer to that. The goal of the Government and of BHP for improving the company's international competitiveness through improved efficiency and greater productivity has been achieved with dramatic effect, according to the Australian Financial Review article. That is right. The honourable senator asked whether we had been able to compare the position of this country's steel industry with that existing before the plan. I am able to confirm that there have been significant improvements in both the current situation and our expectations for the future.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, the rest of the world has not been standing still, but Senator Stone and his National Party colleagues in Queensland have stood still, if anybody has, and I will come back to that in a minute. At the time of the severe downturn in 1982-83 the steel plan was introduced to encourage rationalisation and modernisation in the industry. It certainly helped to create a favourable environment for industry development and delivered only limited financial assistance to the industry through a system of bounties on the production of certain iron and steel goods. The total bounties payable under the plan amounted to approximately $150m. There has been a significant decline in industrial disputation at BHP steel plants. A much better environment has been created which is now reflected in industrial agreements providing for productivity improvements, job security, training programs and job and award restructuring. The capital expenditure of BHP for the period March 1983 to December 1988 was $1.8 billion, That figure has now been lifted by the announcement by BHP that, by the end of the year 1990-91, there will be a further $850m, approximately, expended on the steel industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of another very important issue which Senator Stone asked me about by way of interjection, I simply say that the productivity of BHP has increased from below 200 tonnes per employee when this Government came into office and introduced the steel plan, to where it is now approaching 400 tonnes per employee, and BHP anticipates that by the end of the calendar year 1990 that figure will have reached 500 tonnes of raw steel per employee in a year. There are only two areas in the world at the present time where that productivity level is exceeded, and they are Japan and some areas of the steel industry in the United States of America. BHP now claims to be producing the cheapest steel of its kind in the world, and the current investment commitments will make for a large performance in respect of exports by BHP. It is already of the order of 20 per cent and increasing, and as each year passes and these new investments are commissioned, that export capacity will increase.</PARA>
<PARA> I was at Whyalla the other day, opening a new steel making facility at Port Kembla. That, and other plants which are coming on stream, will increase the steel making capacity to 7.85 million tonnes per annum. The honourable senator who asked the question-Senator Childs-is from New South Wales, and will know that many of the projects which I have referred to are in New South Wales. They will have an obvious economic flow-on effect for the people of that State.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7I4">Senator MAGUIRE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Treasurer. The question relates to the taxation of lump sums paid out by employers for unused long service leave. I ask: Where a taxpayer who is still working dies and that person's employer pays out a lump sum on account of unused long service leave, is that lump sum then liable to income tax? Is the income tax then payable much earlier than it would have been had the person lived longer? If so, does this mean that the Australian personal income tax is a form of death duty? Finally, has the Minister received representations complaining about this aspect of the Australian income tax system?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4312" SPEAKER="Walsh Sen The Hon P.A." NAMEID="TJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This question contains four parts. I will answer them in sequence. The first one is: is a lump sum payable subject to income tax? The answer is yes. Under section 26ad of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which was introduced in 1978 when Mr Howard was Treasurer and Senator Stone, incidentally, was the Deputy Secretary to the Treasury, the post-August 1978 element of any lump sum is typically taxed more heavily than the pre-August 1978 element. The main point in this context is that the taxation of such a lump sum has long been a feature of the Australian tax system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second part of the question is: is the tax payment brought forward by the death of a person? The answer to that is yes because had the person lived, the tax liability on accruing long service leave could have been deferred for a very long period, possibly right up to retirement. Because of section 26ad the accrued long service leave entitlement is taxed as soon as possible after the death of the individual. The third part of the question is: Does this mean that the personal income tax is a form of death duty? I think the answer to that has to be unequivocally no because we are talking about a tax on income. The tax is levied on a receipts basis rather than as the income is accrued. Exactly the same principle is, of course, applied to capital gains tax. Yesterday Senator Stone tried to argue that this meant that capital gains tax was `incontrovertibly' a form of death duty. Senator Stone said:</PARA>
<PARA>This is a fact that the Government continues to deny but it is incontrovertibly true-it is a form of death duty.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Stone was referring to the capital gains tax. That is a completely false definition for a number of reasons, one of which is that death duties are applied to an estate whether or not there has been a capital gain in the estate. A capital gains tax is applicable only if there has been a real capital gain. I have already given another reason why the capital gains tax is not a death duty.</PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, I suggest that, if one accepts Senator Stone's specious assertions-his arguments about the capital gains tax being a form of death duty-the speculative gains tax, in circumstances where an estate or a piece of property is sold because the three or four people who may inherit it cannot agree on any continuing arrangement and it therefore has to be sold, is also a form of death duty. I do not accept Senator Stone's argument, nor does the Government. I believe that, had anybody put to Senator Stone, when he was Deputy Secretary to the Treasury, when he was a rigorous Treasury officer instead of a politician in the National Party of Australia, the type of argument that he put in the Senate yesterday, it would have been dismissed as sophistry, casuistry, or even the rantings of a mere meretricious player.</PARA>

Is the Minister aware that under the National Agenda for Women grants program applicant organisations or individuals, to be eligible for a grant, must support the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women? Why must an Australian women's organisation, which is applying directly to the Federal Government for funding, be subject to an international convention? If an organisation under its own constitution supports the concept of equality of opportunity for women but believes many of the articles of the convention to be ambiguously worded and unattainable, why are those applicants denied funding through this grants system?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator REYNOLDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that Senator McGauran cannot be very familiar with the National Agenda for Women grants program. As far as I am aware it is unheard of for women's organisations not to support the National Agenda for Women. Australian women's organisations are very pleased that the Government has implemented the National Agenda for Women and they welcome the opportunity to apply for grants under this program. As to Senator McGauran's specific question as to what would happen if an organisation came forward and said it did not agree with the National Agenda for Women grants program but it was seeking funding under that program, obviously the Office of the Status of Women would have to deal with that particular problem when it arose. I am not aware of any such organisation. If Senator McGauran knows of an organisation that is in the strange position of applying for money when it does not even uphold the philosophy and principles of the program under which it is applying, I would be interested to have a look at the specific example.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The underlying point of the National Agenda for Women grants program is that it gives women's organisations the opportunity to read the agenda and to look at how they can make the agenda relevant in their particular sphere of interest and concern. It may be in relation to employment, health, education, domestic violence, portrayal of women in the media, child-care, housing-the full range of issues included in the National Agenda for Women. I am sorry if I do not sound particularly helpful in relation to the question asked by Senator McGauran but it seems to me that it would be quite contradictory for an organisation that does not uphold the need for recognition of the National Agenda for Women to apply for a grant. If Senator McGauran has a specific case to refer to me I would be happy to look at it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. It refers to the November Australian Bureau of Statistics unemployment rates which showed about a 9 per cent rate for Tasmania compared with 6 per cent nationally. Do these figures indicate that Tasmania's geographical, economic and/or political circumstances are now less conducive to employment than those of other States or do the figures show that the Federal Government's fiscal policies, including high interest rates, have a more dramatic influence on smaller businesses in smaller States? If it is the former, could the Minister detail to the Senate the factors which have contributed to Tasmania's significantly higher unemployment rate and indicate whether one of these factors has been the effect on tourism of the airlines dispute?</PARA></TALK.START>

I conceded in the Senate on a number of occasions a few weeks ago that the airline dispute had had a very detrimental effect on Tasmania, as it has on other remote parts of the Commonwealth, compared with the major cities on the mainland; that is certainly true. I certainly would not concede that fiscal policies and, indeed, monetary policies had had a differential impact on Tasmania from anywhere else in the Commonwealth. In so far as Senator Harradine refers to fiscal policies, I must say that there have always been demands from Tasmanian governments to this Government and the previous Government, the Fraser Government, for Commonwealth appropriations to support industry activities in Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not well versed in the particular case which Senator Chaney refers to, though I did see a press clipping which passed over my desk some time during the course of the morning. The journalist concerned was sent to prison for contempt of court-I tried to grasp what the report said-for a seven-day period. It seemed to be a statutory period rather than a period set simply by the court. I am not quite clear whether the Parliament has also set a particular term rather than an indefinite term until the contempt is purged. It seemed to be a definite seven-day term after which, when it expires, the journalist will be free to leave. I do not have the full details, but obviously very grave questions are raised which are very difficult to judge as to the balance between the legitimate interest of the community and pursuing those who have committed crimes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would have thought it was of grave concern to the Senate, which has taken a particular interest in privacy matters, that those who have committed the crime of releasing information on citizens from Commonwealth departments should not be able to be prosecuted because evidence which would otherwise be forthcoming is said to be in some way immune from being called in a particular prosecution. If those in this chamber are really interested in the pursuit of those who have committed crimes which involve a breach of privacy, I would have thought they would have leant to the side of those who say that any evidence which is available and which could be called ought to be made available for the jury, the judge or the magistrate to make a judgment as to whether the crime is proved beyond reasonable doubt.</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless there are very complex issues involved, and I am sure that the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, which would be the appropriate forum, may wish to take this matter up because quite clearly it is not a matter simply, or even mainly, of interest to the Commonwealth, but would be a matter of concern to all jurisdictions.

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> These statements are not correct. The report referred to was not a Federal Government report but was prepared by a working party of the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council (AHMAC). The report is an internal AHMAC document which remains confidential until AHMAC has made a formal decision to release it.</PARA>
<PARA> The report was considered by AHMAC on 20 October 1989. Public release of the report was not considered.</PARA>
<PARA> Claims of this nature have been made in the past and rest largely on comparisons with overseas countries and the relatively low proportion of cancer patients in Australia who receive radiation therapy (35% in Australia compared with 45-55% in comparable countries overseas).</PARA>
<PARA> In considering the working party's report however AHMAC was not prepared to endorse any particular referral rate.</PARA>
<PARA> AHMAC's decision recognises that there is no evidence to suggest that Australian referral rates should be the same as other countries and in particular that there is no evidence that survival rates of cancer patients in Australia are worse than elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA> The AHMAC working party report also makes it clear that any apparent shortage of equipment is only one of many factors influencing the availability of, and demand for, radiotherapy. Geographical factors, shortage of radiation oncologists and therapeutic radiographers and limited knowledge of the usage of radiotherapy by referring doctors are all important factors.</PARA>
<PARA> Claims that there are Australians who would benefit from radiotherapy but who do not have access because of lack of facilities are not supported by information presented to AHMAC by the working party:</PARA>
<PARA>a survey conducted by the working party in December 1988 found there were no significant waiting lists for radiotherapy services;</PARA>
<PARA>this would indicate that those cancer patients not receiving radiotherapy services are being treated by other modalities and are not being disadvantaged in any way.</PARA>
<PARA> The majority of radiotherapy services are provided in the public sector and the provision of radiotherapy services is essentially a matter for the states.</PARA>
<PARA> In responding to the AHMAC Report most states indicated that they have addressed the needs for radiotherapy services to 1995 and have developed, or are currently developing, strategic plans for staff and equipment levels which are generally in line with the recommendations of the working party.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has also made $50m available under the Hospital Enhancement Program to be matched by states to provide $75m in both 1989-90 and 1990-91 to enable states to improve the capital equipment in public hospitals. This follows a similar program, the Teaching Hospitals Capital Equipment Program, between 1985-86 and 1987-88 under which the Commonwealth provided $150m to assist states with capital acquisition. States determine their own priorities for capital expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA> Funding for radiotherapy treatment has been available for many years through medial benefits for services to private patients. In February 1988 the Commonwealth extended its financial support to cover computerised radiotherapy planning services for private patients.</PARA>

<PARA> Discussions are currently under way between the Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health and the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists (RACR) over the expansion of private sector radiation oncology. Subject to the state authorities confirming that the private proposals are consistent with overall state plans, the Government is likely to support such expansion if States agree.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 23 November, Senator Haines asked a question regarding the wife's pension. I also have an answer to that. I seek leave to incorporate the answer in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Wife's Pension was introduced in 1942 to provide income support for women not qualified for a pension in their own right who were married to age pensioners. It was introduced in recognition of the difficulties faced by families who were trying to survive on one single rate pension generally because the woman was slightly too young to qualify for pension herself. Because women usually marry men older than they are, this situation was, and still is, very common.</PARA>
<PARA>Wife's Pension is also paid to women married to invalid pensioners who are not qualified for pension in their own right. This issue is not raised by Senator Haines.</PARA>
<PARA>At the time when wife's pension was introduced, most married women were outside the work force. Although this is no longer the case, current wife's pensioners who are married to age pensioners are generally in their late fifties and belong to a generation of women who often did not return to work after raising their children. Many of these women have had little or no recent work force experience. Because of this and because of their age, it could be seen as harsh and unreasonable to expect these women to support themselves through employment.</PARA>
<PARA> Men who are married to age pensioners but who are not entitled to pension in their own right cannot receive a pension as a dependent spouse. However, if they are providing personal care or constant supervision to a severely disabled age or invalid pensioner, they must be entitled to carers pension, which is paid at the same rate and with the same entitlements to concessions as other social security pensions. Many husbands who are caring for disabled age pensioner wives are currently receiving carers pension. In fact, about two-thirds of current carers pensioners are men.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has given some consideration to the issue of the different entitlements of men and women married to pensioners and believes that it would be inappropriate to extend pension to men solely on the basis of their marital status. Wife's pension is paid in recognition of the special difficulties historically faced by women-particularly this generation of older women-in supporting themselves in the work force. Historically, men have faced no such difficulties, while the special situation of men and women with responsibility for the care of a severely disabled relative or other pensioner has been recognised by carers pension.</PARA>
<PARA> This Government also recognises that the best route for people to escape from poverty is generally through employment. It does not wish to encourage premature departure from the work force by those in employment. Extending wife's pension to a spouses pension would therefore create a new anomaly rather than resolve an existing one, especially in view of the availability of age pension to women at age sixty.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that an amount of $12.5m in this allocation is made up of moneys available for new services for which no specific appropriation has been made in the Budget. The $12.5m is for the Department of Transport and Communications as payments to cover charges waived by the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation because of the pilots strike, dispute, or whatever one wants to call it. The fact is that at a time when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said `there is no dispute'-that is, for the month of November-$12.5m of taxpayers' funds went to make up the airline charges waived by the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation. So much for the lack of a dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that this is the cutting edge of where this dispute is directly costing taxpayers in an identifiable way. But on top of the $12.5m, which follows just a couple of million the month before and a million or so the month before that, there are the hidden costs to the taxpayers of Australia-apart from the clear losses and disasters facing so many small businesses and other industries dependent on travel-such as the hidden subsidy of something like $60m that the defence forces have been providing to the airlines by supplying aircraft during this time of non-dispute. That is apart from the amount of money they are getting back. It is a monumentally understated amount of money as against the costs of operating the services that the airlines have been required to pay the defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> There has also been the massive cost to both the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation in terms of lost revenue as a result of the enormous diminution in travelling numbers. I understand that that loss overall makes up about $19m a month. The extraordinary thing about the $12.5m that is now being paid out of taxpayers' funds is that it will keep on being paid so long as the airlines keep suffering losses by not standing down employees under the terms of the deal done with the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the airlines keep claiming that their services have been massively restored, that one can get flights and so on, I have seen no indication from this Government or from the airlines about when this subsidy, involving the waiving of payments to the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation, is expected to stop. If the airlines have got themselves so much in order and have their schedules back so effectively that they can do without Royal Australia Air Force support-and I am told that will be the case from the fifteenth of this month-why are they still facing this problem of paying people who would otherwise have been stood down? How long will this subsidy keep on being paid? Will it keep up at the $12.5m a month level? I believe that the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh), who has authorised these payments, has an obligation to tell the Senate just how long this steady drain of taxpayers' money will continue, particularly as we are assured by the Prime Minister that there is no dispute. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The annual report of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (HLIC) reveals, amongst other things, the impact on ordinary Australians of huge housing interest rates. Page 7 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The average loan insured by the HLIC over all States increased in size from $53,754 in 1987-88 to $64,308 in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA>If we apply the new 17 per cent interest rate on that, it means that for the average insured loan throughout Australia, a homeseeker would have to be in a position to pay an interest Bill of $11,032 a year-that is, $212 a week in interest alone-before he starts repaying the principal of the loan at all. To do that under the rules of almost every lending institution, one would need a salary of something like $850 a week or $42,500 a year as a minimum. That is way above-something like 50 per cent above-the average weekly earnings. In other words, these figures reinforce the view that the average Australian has been priced out of owning his or her own home because of these enormous interest rates that this Government has used as its only effective economic weapon. As I have said here before, the Government by using interest rates as a way of dampening down the economy is doing no more than pouring cold water over the proper aspirations of Australians to own their own homes. The report of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation also notes that 1988-89 was a boom year. It paid $5.8m in claims, which is a very small amount compared with $32.2m paid in claims over the previous two years. </PARA>
<PARA> The HLIC now faces a problem that will face and is facing many home owners now-that is, the massive fall in the value of their homes because of this Government's reliance on high interest rates. What is happening now-and it will be reflected in the accounts of the HLIC next year-is that people are being forced out of their homes. People will owe more and more on a home that is worth less and less. This Government has put the squeeze on the home owners of Australia by its single-minded, pig-headed approach to high interest rates which it is using instead of any of the great range of fiscal measures that it should use but refuses to do so despite continual recommendations by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> This report simply outlines and indicates the sorts of problems that Australian home seekers are now facing. Quite frankly, a person cannot afford to buy an average house now unless, as I said, he is earning something like $42,500 a year. The situation is even worse in New South Wales and Victoria. The report reveals that three-quarters of all loans in New South Wales and Victoria total above $50,000. In fact, something like 95 per cent of all loans in the Australian Capital Territory total more than $50,000. So the figure I have given really understates the real impact of the Government's high interest rate policies on New South Wales and Victoria. I trust that those people who are having to meet those high mortgage payments will let the Government know at the coming election just how responsible they hold the Government for this deliberate and disastrous policy. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The annual report of Australian Airlines Ltd is very revealing. It quite properly details the very successful efforts that the company has made in returning a group operating profit before tax of $108.49m, an increase of 63 per cent over the preceding year. But the rest of the Chairman's report is little more than a plaintive cry for help. It is quite clear from the anguished tones in which Mr Ted Harris expresses himself that this airline will find itself in very serious difficulties in the not too distant future unless the Government is finally prepared to bite the bullet and allow it to have access to alternative forms of capital fund raising. Mr Harris is a longstanding mate of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and maybe that is one of the reasons Mr Hawke was prepared tentatively to put his head above the barricades some months ago. Even that archconservative in every respect, Mr Willis, was prepared to put his hand up for a short while. I think he even went on the Sunday program saying that perhaps there was some sort of mickey mouse way-no doubt strongly disapproved of by Senator Walsh-in which shares could be issued that would be an indirect method of fund raising that could not be strictly construed as privatisation and therefore might buy off the left. But no, the fact is it would not even wear that. As a result, Australian Airlines is being allowed to bleed to death. </PARA>
<PARA> Look at the sort of big bucket that Mr Harris tips over the Government. On page 10 of the annual report Mr Harris states:</PARA>
<PARA> In our 1987-88 Report I affirmed that the Board unanimously supported the principal recommendations of the Advisory Group. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Being a mate of the Prime Minister, per se, is not a criminal offence. I readily concede that. We are concerned about what level of influence he might have and the extent to which the Prime Minister is in any way interested in accommodating the crying needs of this airline. Mr Harris says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>There has been some progress in meeting the requirements set out in that Report but there are some major questions which are unresolved, particularly those of future capital injections and the removal of constraints. </PARA>
<PARA> Resolutions of these issues are critical to the future progress of the Airline. The Government, as owner of the Airline, must either support it as a commercial operation, able to compete on level ground-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, instead of a level playing field, I suppose-</PARA>
<PARA>with its private enterprise competitors, or it should sell the business to private operators . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is in pretty stark terms. Mr Harris is saying no more or less than we all know-than blind Freddy knows, than Senator Walsh knows or than Senator Gareth Evans knew when he put out his government business enterprise discussion papers-namely, that these government business enterprises could not continue to operate successfully unless they had the same access to capital as their private sector competitors. We are now almost two years on since those sorts of high ringing statements were made. This is yet another example of the Government's total failure to grasp the realities of micro-economic reform, of it pandering to those in the trade union movement and the left wing of Caucus who simply will not allow any rational approach to the subject. As a result, once this pilots dispute is over we will see a very crippled airline that will be taken to the cleaners by the Prime Minister's even bigger and better mate, Sir Peter. There is no doubt at all that this airline will come a very bad second. Mr Harris rightly says:</PARA>
<PARA>To do nothing-</PARA>
<PARA>which is precisely the policy that has operated to date-</PARA>
<PARA>or to introduce ad hoc measures that do not properly address the capital injection and constraints issues, may put at risk a valuable public asset. </PARA>
<PARA>He could not have put it in starker terms, but I am sure that he will be ignored in the same way as Jim Leslie was ignored for several years as Chairman of Qantas Airways Ltd when he was prepared to say publicly that he thought privatisation was the only way to go. No doubt Mr Strong had privately made the same sorts of recommendations before he gave the game away some months back. He had achieved a fantastic performance in turning the airline around to the point where it was the No. 1 leader in the field, but it is now going backwards fast. The principal reason for that is set out in the Chairman's report in very plain and unequivocal language. Once again, we will see absolutely nothing done because the Government is driven by pre-election imperatives to do nothing to alienate any of those who might in normal circumstances be overridden. But, because we are in the run-up to the election, their views will prevail. So much for micro-economic reform. So much for a good government-owned airline. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support what Senator Alston has said. In particular, I want to draw attention to some of the warning signs given in the annual report of Australian Airlines Ltd about its future. On page 10 of the report, the Chairman notes:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In the period 1 January to 30 June, 1989-</PARA>
<PARA>in other words, before the non-existent strike took place; at least non-existent in the mind of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)-</PARA>
<PARA>there was a marked slowdown, particularly in the leisure market. In that period we carried 600,000 less passengers than in the first half of the financial year. It was a clear reflection of some of the problems facing the tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA>It is worth noting that Australian Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia are facing deregulation next year in the context not only of the disruption caused by this strike but also of the clear problems facing the tourism industry in Australia. The impact of the dispute is clearly indicated in the report as being very serious. In referring to the impact the dispute has had on the financial results in the first few months of the new financial year, the Chairman said:</PARA>
<PARA> The losses are substantial and the dispute has had a number of repercussive effects. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Chief Executive's report, Mr Strong says:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of great regret that following this period of growth and success the Airline has been plunged into the worst industrial upheaval in its history with the tragic pilots' dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the real problem:</PARA>
<PARA>Although the effects will remain for many years, the challenge for the Airline will be to rebuild the spirit and commitment on which market leadership was achieved. </PARA>
<PARA>The problem of the effects of the dispute lasting for many years in the context of a massive re-equipment program undertaken by Australian Airlines should cause us a great deal of concern. That re-equipment program is outlined on page 17 of the report. This is the context in which we are facing deregulation in October 1990. It is no wonder that Australian Airlines is looking forward to that situation with some trepidation. On page 19, it says:</PARA>
<PARA> Deregulation has been the subject of protracted public debate in the ten years since the United States took similar action over its domestic aviation industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian community has high expectations of the benefits it sees flowing from a free market. </PARA>
<PARA>The coalition in particular has high expectations, particularly in terms of increased and improved services to the users of airline facilities, apart from the prospect of cheaper fares. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Cheaper fares without over-restrictive conditions, better schedules with no parallel departure times and a wider choice of airlines are among the commonly held perceptions of the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Time will tell whether these expectations are realised. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, Australian Airlines is pouring a little cold water over those expectations because it is going to be in the firing line. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> But what is certain is that the experience of the U.S. will not be duplicated in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The U.S. was the first and largest country to embrace deregulation; lessons learned there will not be ignored in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Poorly-conceived airline operations are unlikely to find speculative financial support. Investors will be better advised, with the experience of the U.S. to draw on, and will assess far more carefully any new airline's prospects for an adequate return on those investments. So, although there will be increased competition, a plethora of new airlines is unlikely. </PARA>
<PARA> Deregulation poses some considerable challenges for Australian Airlines. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt about that. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> These will be faced with a determination to prove that our customer-orientated, market-driven approach will bring long-term success and profitability. </PARA>
<PARA>What is evident from the report is not simply that Australian Airlines faces a problem only as a result of a strike, only as a result of deregulation or only as a result of falling tourist dollars; it faces a problem on almost every front against a background of massive re-equipment. As I said, the airline industry throughout Australia is in for a lively time next year, judging from this report. </PARA>

<PARA> It as a matter of great regret that following this period of growth and success, the Airline has been plunged into the worst industrial upheaval in its history with the tragic pilots' dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>In my view, Australian Airlines could have contributed to solving that dispute some time ago. The list of directors is not without some significance in view of their responsibilities and powers and the divorcing of those responsibilities and powers from the direction of the Government, particularly the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Some time ago I asked Senator Button whether he would ask the Prime Minister to draw together the Australian-owned airline, Australian Airlines Ltd, and the Australian Federation of Air Pilots for the purpose of discovering what common ground there was to see whether there could be a resolution through negotiation and discussion of the dispute. I was advised by Senator Button that the Government had no powers, no responsibilities, no unique relationship with Australian Airlines and no authority to give such directions to it. A matter of days later, when the courts found in favour of the airlines in respect of the matter of costs to be awarded against the pilots, the Prime Minister found himself in a very difficult political situation. He said that financial penalties under common law were not his cup of tea and that he would be seeking to persuade the airlines that they ought not continue to execute the judgment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He had previously urged them to go to court and had said the Government would give its full approval-whatever that means from a government that has claimed it has no authority. When the judgment was made and the machinations started to take place and the convulsions started to forment within the parliamentary party and the unions, the Prime Minister said that it was not his cup of tea and that he would deal with it; he would speak to the airlines. This is the same Prime Minister who was not able to talk the airlines into sitting in the same room with the pilots to discuss the issue. In no time, Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines had retreated, and it seems highly probable that there will be no execution or pursuit of the judgment made by the court. All this time the Government has had a capacity to talk to Australian Airlines, to tell it to get together with the pilots and solve the dispute, yet it has claimed it has no such power. But the moment it suited the Government to exercise that power it did so in a naked display.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the minute or so left to me, I say that while it goes without saying that I do not approve under any circumstances of the conduct of the pilots in this dispute, it is a matter of some regret that I again have to record what I consider to be the dishonest and immoral conduct of the airlines. From day one they have misled the public about the number of pilots who have signed up. They have misled the public about the period the dispute was likely to take. Ansett in particular misled the public in terms of the number of flights available. The airlines have misled the public and their treatment of passengers, particularly those who have made advance payment bookings, has been absolutely deplorable. On a daily basis, members of Parliament are circulated with Ansett's daily program, which is blatantly dishonest. For instance, last Friday nine flights from Brisbane were cancelled. Flights out of Perth are regularly cancelled. Nevertheless, Ansett holds up its schedule and says that it is back in business, all it well and all is normal. I agree with Mr J. A. Strong's statement that the pilots dispute is of a tragic nature. Sadly, the truth for all Australians is that it may not have been avoided but it certainly could have been resolved a lot more quickly than appears to be the case. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>In doing so, I declare my interest as a fully paid-up member of Friends of the ABC, an organisation which needs all the friends it can get. When looking at this report, we should begin with that section which refers to the services provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). We can see that the Corporation has a broad responsibility to the people of Australia through its television services, Radio Australia, its symphony orchestras and its marketing arm, in particular, the ABC shops. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that the national broadcaster ought to be able to set a standard by which all other radio and television in this country is judged. Unfortunately, our ABC is caught in a time warp of inefficiency, underfunding, expensive duplication and poorly utilised resources and is therefore unable to live up to that ideal. When one sees the breadth of resources that it has to provide, that is certainly a problem. Australian taxpayers have funded the ABC to the tune of $450m in the last Budget, but we still have problems. As regards that funding, on page 5 of the report reference is made to the fact that, although there was the 1988 guarantee under Minister Gareth Evans, that guarantee appears to have some shaky base. I reiterate that the Democrats believe that the stability of guaranteed funding is critical to the ABC's ability to provide its services fully and efficiently, because if it has to undertake that annual scrabble its really is not possible for it to get on with the job that it needs to do. The job of the ABC has seen some changes this year-they are outlined in the annual report-and I point particularly to the increased services in country and regional areas which have been put under a cloud by the possible instability in the funding promised by the Government in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The separation of the parliamentary broadcasts, for which the Australian Democrats have been calling for some time, is an advance. It is also a bit of an embarrassment when a constituent rings up and says, `Where do I find the Parliament on the radio?' when we ourselves have difficulty in finding it. However, we believe that the regular programming of the ABC was detrimentally affected by parliamentary broadcasts, but it is important that regular programming continues. </PARA>
<PARA> Some aspects of programs with Australian content provide us with concern-77.8 per cent of documentaries are imported productions; 82.6 per cent of serials are imported; 92.8 per cent of feature films are imported; and 98.7 per cent of situation comedies are imported. On the other side of the ledger, very high Australian content is coming to us through the ABC-and here I am referring to television-by way of documentaries, children's programs, news and current affairs. In those areas there is a total of 53.9 per cent of Australian programming. But as I say, there is a concern in those areas-particularly as the domestic production industry involves writers, directors, make-up artists, cameramen, actors, lighting technicians, sound technicians and so on-that we would be better served by a much higher level of Australian content. Of course, this problem does extend through to the network television area. </PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned about the situation of Radio Australia, that it is not being transmitted effectively. It is Australia's shopfront to the world. We are concerned that there is a sorting out of the situation in Melbourne and Sydney where new headquarters are being built. I point out that, while there is a picture of the Sydney headquarters on page 9 of the report, we have to go to page 52 to see a picture of the Melbourne headquarters. I urge honourable senators not to miss it. I am pleased that the radio audience has increased. I do not think it is valid to criticise the ABC for a ratings chase. We congratulate the ABC where its audience share is increasing, because we believe that, in essence, it is the goal of the Corporation to provide services across a wide range. We encourage the Government to continue to provide stability of funding so that the organisation can continue to provide services with security and stability. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>Austudy has been very laxly administered by this Government, and the Auditor-General's report No. 24 dramatises once again the enormous scope for yet further improvement after two years of making Austudy `less worse', if I can use that expression. This report indicates that something like $40m potential overpayments a year are made to tertiary students alone which could be resolved. I draw heavily on bits of this report to outline the sorts of problems that have existed in Austudy. The report says that the early administration of the Austudy program was unsatisfactory in many respects, especially in relation to the control of fraud and overpayments and in the management of staff and computing resources. The report outlines that these shortcomings, which are largely acknowledged by the Department of Employment, Education and Training, have been addressed by concerted action taken over the last two years, and it is acknowledged that this action will no doubt result in a substantial reduction in the risk of fraud and overpayment and the more efficient use of staff and computing resources. But the point is that the Department, according to the Auditor-General, also acknowledges that there is considerable scope for further improving the administration of the Austudy program particularly by reducing workload peaks, improving the functionality of the ESAS computer system and the improved program planning and performance monitoring. The Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) also identified several areas where urgent management attention was required to rectify continuing shortcomings, in particular, in verifying the continuing eligibility of students receiving assistance and in recovering outstanding overpayments. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Recoveries administration was the single most neglected area of the Austudy scheme having been virtually completely ignored in the overhaul of procedures for application processing and pre-payment verification checks. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Additional verification checking and compliance surveys, particularly the sample survey which indicated potential overpayments of at least $40m p.a. to Tertiary students alone, has identified large numbers of overpayments and increased the urgency of the need for management attention. </PARA>
<PARA>The Department has agreed with the ANAO's findings and recommendations and has advised of a range of measures that it plans to introduce in 1990 and later years to further improve the administration of the program. That is all very well. We are grateful that the Auditor-General has pointed out how this program has involved ludicrous opportunities for fraud and loss to the taxpayer and that something has been done about it, but the big problem that emerges is one of general principle, and the Auditor-General points out very strongly, quite frankly, that this program, like other programs, was started without any coherent recognition of the need to have proper structures in place to make certain that fraud did not become rampant. I think it is important that this Senate, and the Government in particular, recognise the problems that emerge when a half-baked program is introduced without this kind of protection. The Auditor-General says that the Department did advise the Government that a longer lead-time was required for Austudy implementation. In other words, the Government was warned by the Department that it was not ready to handle this matter in an effective and reasonable way that did not involve the potential for huge losses of public money, of taxpayers' money. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>The implementation timetable approved by the Government was too short to allow adequate system testing and user training and led to some key features not being functional when ESAS commenced operations . . . the imbalance concerned the lack of effective controls to minimise the risk of overpayments which had continued under Austudy from the previous student assistance schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>The report went on:</PARA>
<PARA>This imbalance was most marked in 1987 when almost total emphasis was placed on getting applicants on pay as quickly as possible in the face of severe system failures and existing verification checking was severely curtailed. </PARA>
<PARA>All students will no doubt have been overjoyed that the major concentration was on trying to pay new applicants, but the taxpayers of Australia may not share that view. The multimillions of dollars that appear to have been lost in fraud are a matter of major concern. The long term principle that the Auditor-General pointed out is this:</PARA>
<PARA>The need to assess fully the administrative implications of major new policy proposals and to act effectively to implement them cannot be understated. But instances where this has not happened come to notice in other organisations. For example, similar inadequacies in the management of new systems and programs were found and acknowledged in the early administration of the taxation concessions and grants for industry research and development schemes (efficiency audit report tabled in May 1989). Departments need to evaluate new systems and programs to ensure that management controls and accountability issues are fully addressed before they are implemented. The lack of effective management controls itself generates counter behaviour among beneficiaries by encouraging active fraud or passive non-compliance with the conditions of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>Some indication of the effect of applicants' perceptions of the effectiveness, or lack of effectiveness of controls may possibly be drawn from the significant drop in the growth of tertiary Austudy applications experienced in 1989, when much stricter prepayment verification checks were introduced, compared with the previous year. Enrolments in full time tertiary courses at 31 March 1989 were about 8 per cent above corresponding enrolments at 30 April 1988 but applications for tertiary Austudy received by the beginning of April 1989 were only just over one per cent higher than they were in 1988. The Auditor-General concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>Departmental program objectives and performance standards need to reflect a balance between ensuring prompt delivery of the benefits and minimising the risks of mis-payment. An appropriate balance is not struck if applicants receive benefits before they have provided reasonable proof of eligibility or if benefits are unduly delayed by an over-emphasis on control. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the sort of Auditor-General's report one tends to expect when this Government is administering-I use the word `administering' fairly loosely-programs which involve the handling and the handing out of public money. This Government is so busy buying votes that it does not see as being high on its priorities the requirements the Auditor-General has pointed out of making certain that the taxpayers' money is protected and that these grants do not go to people who are not entitled to them. As Chairman of the Waste Watch Committee, I saw this Government deliberately handing out money far and wide, on ludicrous pretexts in many instances, to try to buy votes from interested groups. I commend the Auditor-General for drawing the attention of the Parliament and the Government to the fact that this Government, not in this single instance but as a general rule-in many instances, the Auditor-General says-has not been sufficiently concerned with the protection of the public purse when it has been handing out the taxpayers' money. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for lunch we were discussing the possible response by the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology to the Therapeutic Goods Bill. At that stage some amendments had been circulated by Senator Coulter on behalf of the Australian Democrats. The Government has had the opportunity to consider those amendments and, in consultation with Senator Coulter, has agreed to several of them, not agreed to one or two others, and has modified the wording of one or two others. This has enabled the Bill to be improved in a way acceptable both to the Government and to the Democrats. I believe that it has led Senator Coulter to conclude that he can support the passage of the Therapeutic Goods Bill at the second reading stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2)-particular interest has focused on the residential aged care provisions-honourable senators will be well aware that the main section of the legislation relates to the rights of residents in homes for the aged. It is pleasing that the Opposition agrees with the principle of residents' rights, particularly where the Commonwealth is a funder to the residents in their homes. I understand that the shadow Minister for community services and aged care, Mr Braithwaite, has indicated that he does not disagree with the principle that there should be charters and contracts. He is on record as supporting these measures within the aged care industry. But I believe that it is important that the Parliament move further than an expression of support for the general principles and start the process of the statutory enabling and empowering of those charters and the arrangements that flow under the charter of rights and responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understood it, during the second reading debate Senator Coulter and Senator Jenkins both expressed the view that the charter would come into effect in April 1990, March or whenever and therefore would have a life of its own before the Senate or, perhaps, the other place-but more likely the Senate-had an opportunity to disallow the charter if it found that it was unacceptable in the main or even in one small part. I would like to make two points. The first is that I do not think that the chambers, particularly the Senate, would underestimate the very great power that this actually reposes in the Senate chamber. The fact is that it can destroy, undermine or completely sabotage the whole project of writing a charter because, if one part is not acceptable to the Opposition and the Democrats, the whole scheme, the whole project, collapses. Therefore, it is a very real incentive for the Government to get it right and to make sure that the charter fulfils the expectations of the residents of aged persons homes, those who provide this service in the community, the Government, the Opposition and the Democrats-and the Independents, for that matter. It is a very powerful incentive for the Government to get the charter right. I believe that this tremendous power of the Senate to disallow the whole of the charter by way of disallowing the regulation, which is the way it is proposed to be brought into force under this legislation, is a very important power that should not be underestimated.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I believe that Senator Jenkins and Senator Coulter are incorrect in their projection of a situation where the charter could be devised by the Government over the next few weeks or early in the new year, published by way of regulation and then, as Senator Coulter said, because of the exigencies of elections and so on, which we cannot quite foretell, it might be some time before this chamber reconvened and thus a sitting day appropriate for the disallowance. The Bill provides that the commencement of the charter provisions is 1 July 1990. This allows, I believe, sufficient time for the Parliament to scrutinise it prior to the commencement. That factor is an important one. I picked it up on the car radio listening to Senator Coulter this morning. I believe it gives time to consider the elements of the charter in the early part of next year. Mr Acting Deputy President, I am virtually foreshadowing some of the arguments I would put at the committee stage and perhaps you are quite rightly indicating to me that I should get on with a second reading response. These were points brought up by Senator Coulter in the second reading debate and I just wish to rebut that timetable which led to his indicating greater sympathy for the Opposition's approach that the charter should be subject to affirmative resolution by both Houses of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter also made a point that for persons suffering from Alzheimer's disease the issue of rights and responsibilities is less clear. For example, he talked about wandering dementia patients. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, it is not envisaged that a person suffering from such a disease would enter into an agreement with the proprietor. A person, generally a relative, being either a guardian or person holding power of attorney, could enter into the agreement with the proprietor on behalf of the resident. Where such persons have no guardian or person with power of attorney, they will be protected by an obligation on the proprietor to comply with the notice in writing made by the Minister and consistent with the terms in the agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Sheil expressed a concern about the level of ministerial discretion in relation to the charter and the agreement. I understand that the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) over many weeks and months has given extensive commitments to consumers, the industry and the staff of nursing homes to consult on the draft charter and agreement. Further consultations will be conducted in the new year as the drafts are developed, based on the first round of consultations. All groups are aware of this staged process of development and have indicated their willingness to contribute to ensuring that the rights of older Australians in residential aged care are protected. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Sheil also commented on the community visitors to nursing homes and hostel residents and their role. He has sought clarification of that role, as I think Senator Boswell has. Community visitors will not be employees of the Commonwealth and they will not be expected to monitor standards of care in any formal sense. Their primary focus will be one of providing friendship and companionship to those elderly people in nursing homes and hostels who might not otherwise have visitors. However, community visitors would be encouraged to refer any major issues coming to their attention to the appropriate channels. In some instances this could be to the management of the home, at other times to advocacy services or perhaps to the complaints service. The Commonwealth has other established appropriate means of monitoring the standards of care gazetted under section 45d of the National Health Act. Other parts of the legislation deal with the operation of a complaints service and standards monitoring teams. This is not meant to be an identity, by any means, of the functions of the two. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Sheil also made a number of nostalgic references to the good old days before there were standards of care and before the Hawke Government's reform strategy for the aged care area. Senator Sheil cited, by way of example of bureaucratic interference, enforcement of fire controls which closed down old dwellings that had been used as nursing homes. Perhaps the chamber should be reminded of several recent tragic events. In nursing homes in southern Sydney and northern Sydney there were a number of deaths in fires. I have not got the dates of those fires but they were within the last three or four years. I think that was an ill-chosen example that Senator Sheil nostalgically referred to in relation to the very necessary fire controls which are appropriate to ensure the safety of persons in these homes for the aged. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 is a very important piece of legislation. I understand that the Privacy Commissioner, in regard to matters which are of importance to residents, has been given a copy of the Bill and has given the following advice. After considering the proposed amendments in the light of further briefing from staff he regards the draft amendments as generally acceptable and has actually recommended several steps which might be taken by the Department in relation to implementation of various aspects of the residents' rights provision, and these will be taken up. </PARA>
<PARA> All in all, there has been a lot of consultation with many organisations. I could list them but it would be tedious to do so. There have been consultations with other bodies, such as the Privacy Commissioner. I believe the legislation before the chamber is a complete and adequate response to the very real needs and concerns that have been recognised in a tripartisan way as being very legitimate concerns and needs. There have been differences, of course, as to the particular method by which these matters might be brought into legislative effect and they are the subject of some amendments to be moved by Senator Boswell at the committee stage. I thank those honourable senators who have indicated that they find the Bill, in principle, a very useful addition to the legislative framework within which we as an Australian community provide the very necessary security and good care for those aged persons in residential care. </PARA>

<PARA> (b) the places of Senators have not become vacant under section 13 of the Constitution; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) a dissolution or expiration of the House of Representatives has not occurred, between the approval of one House and the approval of the other House.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>These amendments to the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 will ensure that the charter of residents' rights and responsibilities and the agreement to be entered into between the resident and the management of a hostel under the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954 come back to both Houses of Parliament for scrutiny, debate, amendment if necessary and then approval by both Houses. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) stands, the Minister is empowered to formulate, by instrument, a statement of rights and responsibilities. The charter would then be disallowable-that is, it could only be accepted or rejected in full by both Houses of Parliament. We believe that the charter must come back to Parliament for scrutiny, debate, amendment if necessary, and approval-thus protecting and safeguarding the democratic rights of the people to express their opinion through their elected representatives in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. It will also have the effect of forcing the Government to consult meaningfully with all sectors of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> As regards the agreement between proprietor and resident, as the Bill stands, this is subject to ministerial discretion and not even subject to regulation. Again, we believe that it should come back to the Parliament for debate and amendment if necessary, and then approval. </PARA>
<PARA> We move these amendments because we have little faith, based on his past record, in the consultation process of the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett). The Opposition believes that it is the responsibility of the Minister to report back to Parliament and not hide himself behind regulations and the bureaucracy. If there is no hidden agenda in this legislation, this should be the normal course to be followed. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, our amendments have the support of the Australian Nursing Homes Association (ANHA) and the Australian Affiliation of Voluntary Care Associations (AAVCA). The Government recognises the ANHA and the AAVCA as the peak bodies representing the nursing homes and hostel industry. More importantly, they even have the support of the Australian Democrats. Indeed, they were represented on the steering committee for the report Residents' Rights in Nursing Homes and Hostels. These are the organisations nominated by the Government to participate on behalf of providers in the detailed discussions and negotiations on the charter and agreement with the Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health. The ANHA and the AAVCA believe that the charter and agreement must come back to Parliament for scrutiny, debate, amendment if necessary, and approval-thus protecting and safeguarding the democratic rights of the people to express their opinion through their elected representatives in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments also have the support of numerous other organisations representing the aged and the industry-the National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals, Geriaction, the Association of Self-help Organisations, and groups and nursing associations representing nurses throughout the country. We are discussing the quality of the care or our aged. We are talking about the rights of an individual to be absorbed into a higher quality of care. We believe that our amendments will ensure that. </PARA>
<PARA> We want it to be perfectly clear that we agree with the principles of the charter and the agreement. We believe that if the Minister is genuine in his concern for the aged and maintaining that quality of care, he should consult as widely as possible if the charter and agreement are to be the vehicles to show that concern and provide the quality. These amendments not only force that consultation process, but also they provide the parliamentary approval. As I said, the Minister should welcome the process of consultation and approval that we have laid down. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to pick up briefly several remarks which the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) made a few moments ago in summarising the second reading stage of the debate. I accept what he said in relation to the start-up date. I therefore, in a sense, withdraw what I said about the possibility of the charter coming into force before it would be possible for the Parliament to review it. The other point that the Minister made in relation to the charter being allowed or disallowed in toto, and therefore this chamber having a very powerful ability to impose its will, is a politically naive interpretation of that process. As everybody who has spoken in this debate has said, all honourable senators are in favour of the principle of the charter and the protection of patients' rights. None of us would want to be put in the invidious position of having to disallow the charter in toto if there were just one small but perhaps very important part of it which was found to be unsatisfactory. It is for those reasons that the Australian Democrats support the Opposition's amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister's point in relation to Alzheimer's disease seemed to indicate that he has a somewhat unsatisfactory understanding of the nature of the disease, which is a slowly progressive mental deterioration. It is not a question of entering into one form of negotiation with a patient or the patient's representative. The form of negotiation will change over time as the condition of the patient deteriorates. The disease is also marked by long periods when the disease appears to be relatively quiescent: the patient's condition may not deteriorate and then, over a relatively short period, the patient's condition can deteriorate quite markedly, descend to a new plateau and maintain itself there. Each of those stages will be marked by a different relationship between the patient and the nursing staff and between such a patient and another patient. Recognising that this is an incredibly complex situation, we think it is appropriate that the actual form of the charter should come back to the Parliament for very close scrutiny so that as well as it can be got right it will be got right and we will not be left in a situation where we must accept or reject the whole charter in toto without the ability to discriminate one part from another. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already indicated some of the arguments that the Government would wish to put in relation to this series of amendments advanced by the Opposition and supported by the Australian Democrats. Basically, it is important to distinguish the personality of the Minister from the process in which we are engaged. I think Senator Boswell expressed some scepticism about the propriety of the way in which the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) might engage in the consultations which will be necessary as a prelude to the formulation of the charter and perhaps questioned his sincerity in relation to his concern for the aged.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Boswell might have been on the edge of that. Nevertheless, it is important that we formulate the legislation in a way which will be equally apt whoever the Minister happens to be from time to time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a genuine difference between the Government and the Opposition as to whether making the charter by way of regulation, and thus subject to disallowance, is the preferable parliamentary way to go rather than trying to bring the charter into both Houses of the Parliament and seeking its affirmation by a positive and affirmative resolution of each House which would allow for amendment of any clause or clauses in it. I think there is a difference as to methodology. Both methods are an attempt to assert what I think Senator Boswell is trying to achieve; namely, that the elected representatives of the people have a real say in the way in which the charter is finally promulgated and, therefore, effective in so far as the agreements, for example, have to be consistent with the charter. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps Senator Coulter accused me of being naive. However, I have been a member of this chamber for 11 years and I believe that the power of disallowance is a very powerful weapon which, if properly threatened, if you like, by an Opposition and a Democrat coalition on a particular matter, can lead to and will lead to-it must, if the charter is to be achieved-the sort of consultation which will ensure that the concerns about any clause are dealt with prior to the expiry of, I think, 15 sitting days from the promulgation of the charter by way of regulation. So there is simply a difference between us as to the methodology for asserting Parliament's control over this process. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have indicated, under this legislation the charter and any subsequent or consequent agreements depend on its terms and consistent with it cannot come into operation until 1 July 1990. This, once again, indicated good faith on the part of the Government in the sense that nothing will be rushed and sought to be put into effect in a way which either does not allow for sufficient consultation or somehow, given election contingencies next year, would prevent this Parliament from asserting its proper role-particularly this chamber, as a chamber of review-for a long period. That would not be the case; there would be sufficient time. For that reason I believe that the present formula used in this legislation-that is, that the charter be a disallowable instrument and that the agreements referred to be consistent with the charter-ought to be agreed to by the chamber. That is an appropriate and adequate way to go. I therefore urge the Committee to reject Senator Boswell's series of amendments numbered 1 to 10. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments apply to approved operators in relation to approved nursing homes. We propose that the principles that the Minister is enabled by this legislation to lay down in respect of approved operators be brought before each House of Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the formulation of the principles and that they be subject to approval by both Houses. If the Minister does not proceed to the formulation of principles and allows the bureaucracy to act, we may well find ourselves in a situation similar to what is happening with the implementation of the Disability Services Act, where the bureaucracy formulates the guidelines and can alter them at whim. We believe it is the responsibility of the Minister to report back to the Parliament and not to hide himself behind regulations and the bureaucracy. </PARA>

For the Opposition to express a concern that the Minister might act in the absence of the principles and indeed neglect to provide principles is rather an extreme view of the possibilities of the situation.

<PARA>Our amendments would delete the provision whereby a community visitor may inform an officer of the Department or the proprietor of the relevant nursing home of any matter relating to the provision of nursing home care that comes to the notice of the person including matters brought to the person's notice by a patient. The community visitors to be given all reasonable facilities and assistance in order that they may perform the purposes for which they are appointed under the legislation are not designated in this Bill. No-one knows who they will be or whether they will have a capacity of concern and compassion in entering the home and meeting the residents. Under this legislation, they are given the power to judge the quality of care received by people in nursing homes. This provision in the Bill is especially worrying. </PARA>
<PARA> It was our understanding that community visitors were to be the people with an interest in aged care, acting in a volunteer capacity, visiting the friendless and those without families in nursing homes and helping them out with small tasks and small worries. The report Residents' Rights in Nursing Homes and Hostels in proposing such visitors at no time suggested they would report on the quality of care. There is no suggestion in the Bill as to who will be designated and who they will be. Will they be appointed because of their social justice attitudes or their professional and nursing care qualifications? If it is the latter, there are already sufficient teams in place to monitor the quality of care and the rights of residents. The standard monitoring teams do that job. We do not believe that they should be able to check or report on the provision of nursing home care. Our amendments would have the effect of deleting this provision. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Boswell's concerns and misgivings about the role of community visitors are rather overdrawn. It is intended that community visitors-even as Mr Braithwaite in the other place used the term-be able to be friends of the friendless; be available to those people who unfortunately do not have either family or some network of caring friends to provide the friendship and companionship, which is obviously very important to their psychological well-being, to their sense of human dignity and a sense of being part of the community. That is not always the case in these sorts of nursing homes. One can be surrounded by people but feel lonely and isolated. The idea, obviously, is that a community visitor will be the primary person to provide that friendship and companionship so essential to the well-being, dignity and sheer enjoyment of life for those persons in the situation I have described.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> They are certainly not employees of the Commonwealth and, as I say, their relationship is not to the Commonwealth as an employee; their relationship is very definitely to the aged person or persons with whom they develop this companionship. Their role is certainly not to become a substitute for those formal bodies which monitor the provision of adequate and quality nursing home care or care to the aged, the frail or the infirm. Nevertheless, one can easily envisage situations where a community visitor is informed by a patient in a nursing home that there is some aspect of the provision of care which is causing a problem. It might simply be a draughty condition, a very hard mattress, or a lack of warmth in the room. </PARA>
<PARA> I know Senator Boswell is not suggesting that the community visitor could not pass that concern on. In fact, I think he said that the community visitor would be able to deal with the `small worries' of a patient, which as we know in that sort of situation, can become an obsessive concern which can destroy altogether the quality of life of the aged person who is subjected to, not mistreatment necessarily, but an inadequacy or an unintentional indifference to a particular concern which is perhaps peculiar to that person and which does not fall within the general regime of treatment that is provided, in a good way, to the patients as a whole, as a community. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems appropriate that it should be made clear in the legislation that the community visitor is empowered to pass on such a concern, and it really is designed to achieve no more than that. The proposed subsection states:</PARA>
<PARA>A person who is a community visitor may inform an officer of the Department of the proprietor of the relevant nursing home of any matter relating to the provision of nursing home care in the nursing home that comes to the notice of the person, including matters brought to the person's notice by a patient. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is sheer commonsense that somebody who is a confidante of an elderly person, and who has the confidence and trust of that elderly person, may in fact be very well placed to help-let us put it positively, not negatively-the proprietor of the nursing home to perceive some inadequacy in the provision of care which is causing hardship, concern or distress to an elderly person who is not quite sure of how, whether, or with what consequences, he or she might approach the providers of that care. If they have confidence and trust in a community visitor, perhaps they will express their concern, which can then be passed on further. Nine times out of ten, I am quite sure that the proprietor of the nursing home would be happy to accommodate and deal with that problem if it is brought to his or her attention. </PARA>
<PARA> I quite agree with Senator Boswell-I do not have the explanatory memorandum with me, and I am not sure what is said about this in the second reading speech-that it should be made clear that there is no intention to try to provide a substitute for, or a double-up on, the monitoring teams or the complaints teams. We are trying to provide a sympathetic ear for a frail or aged person. Let us hope that the suggestions that come out of that companionship between the community visitor and the old person lead to the provision of better care. I am sure it would suit the proprietors and fulfil their hopes in providing a service that that can be done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Amendment 16, in particular, is an amendment which could be read both ways, as the Minister has indicated. In view of the fact that these visitors will have some official status-despite what the Minister says, they will be paid a fee and selected and trained in a certain way-they will have some standing. I accept what the Minister has said in relation to the friendship which such a visitor would have with patients. I also accept that in most instances they would be passing on relatively trivial matters in terms of the overall activity of the nursing home, although they may not be trivial in terms of the comfort of the individual patient.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Given that the community visitors can report in the way indicated by the unamended clause, what is the status, not of the visitor but of the reports which the visitor may make? Is it envisaged that those reports could be used in some way which was not really intended, in order to improve the quality of delivery of care to the individual patient? The visitor is visiting the individual patient. Is it in any way envisaged that these reports could become part of a dossier in relation to the assessment of the nursing home overall? I think that is the sort of thing that is worrying Senator Boswell. These people are in no sense competent to make those sorts of judgments. Perhaps we can resolve this matter now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised-and I think it is consistent with what I have said, that no community visitor can substitute himself or herself for the monitoring or complaints teams-that in fact the sorts of matters that they will pass on will be simply in terms of advice and concerns. They will not form part of the assessment which could determine the renewal, I suppose, of the authority of the proprietors to continue to operate the nursing home concerned. I agree with Senator Boswell: they are not qualified to make a formal assessment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps I could undertake that in the papers which accompany the appointment of a community visitor, that division of function and the non-identification with the complaints and monitoring teams be made very clear, so that there is a very clear statement in the selection and appointment of the community visitor that honourable senators' conerns in that respect are not well founded and that the complaints do not form part of any formal assessment of the operation of the nursing home. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tate has given us an assurance of what he believes will happen. But with the best will in the world, Senator Tate is unable to give that assurance if the legislation spells out something different. The legislation states very clearly:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>A person who is a community visitor referred to in paragraph (6) (cg) may inform an officer of the Department or the proprietor of the relevant nursing home of any matter relating to the provision of nursing home care in the nursing home that comes to the notice of the person, including matters brought to the person's notice by a patient. </PARA>
<PARA>We do not want to be dogmatic about that and say that the visitor should not convey some concerns to a proprietor. What we are saying very clearly is that there are already teams doing this job. These teams have the relevant qualifications and are trained to perform these duties. We do not know who these community visitors will be. They may be merely people who have a community concern but who have no qualifications. It is not spelt out in the legislation. We are concerned, and I think Senator Coulter also expressed concern, that these people may not be qualified. They may think they see things that are really not there and report those not only to the proprietor but also to the Department. We believe this could get out of hand. That is why I believe that our amendment is the correct way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> There are State and Federal monitoring teams who do the job. The Government is now duplicating their role with a person who may not have any qualifications. That person may be simply a nice woman or man who has a few hours to spare and who feels that she or he wants to perform a community duty. We are concerned about any lack of qualifications by such persons. I am sure that the Minister can see the dangers, as can Senator Coulter. I ask that this amendment be accepted by the Senate. </PARA>

The argument really swings on the status of any report which that visitor may make, and whether that report-as I think Senator Tate was beginning to pick up-can be made as part of the judgment of the nursing home as such.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would be prepared to accept an undertaking from the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) that clause 26 remains in the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, but that any reports which are made, are made only with respect to the better treatment and management of that individual patient. They do not, and cannot, form-as I think Senator Tate was moving on to say, and this should be spelt out in the agreement with the visitor-part of the assessment of the nursing home. The status of the reports or information that might be passed on to officers of the Department of Community Services and Health, proprietors and so on-but, particularly, the officers of the Department-is, I think, the point that is worrying Senator Boswell. The problem can be overcome by such an undertaking from the Minister.</PARA>

It is more important from Senator Coulter's point of view, and from Senator Boswell's point of view-I think he is putting forward these matters in good faith-that administrative devices be created to ensure that the reports do not attain the sort of status that they would have if they were the reports of a complaints or standards monitoring committee.

<PARA>As this Bill stands, the Minister is empowered to formulate by instrument a statement of rights and responsibilities. The charter would then be a disallowable instrument. It could be accepted or rejected in full by both Houses of parliament. We believe that the charter must come back to parliament for scrutiny, debate, amendment if necessary, and approval, thus protecting and safeguarding the democratic rights of the people to express their opinion through their elected representatives in the Parliament. It will also have the effect of forcing the Government to consult meaningfully with all sectors of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I stress that the Opposition agrees with the thrust of this legislation as far as residents' rights are concerned but we move these amendments because we have little faith-based on the record of the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples)-in the consultation process. It is the Minister's responsibility to report back to Parliament and for Parliament to have the right to ensure that the final version of both the agreement and the charter is in the interests of all the aged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a sense of deja vu here. We have just had the argument on the charter in relation to hostels. These amendments relate to nursing homes. Senator Boswell has made much the same points with much the same emphasis. In my response I need to emphasise once again that I believe that it is unjust to caricature the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) in the way that has been attempted: as a person who has not shown by way of evidence of consultation up to this point that he is likely to engage in the sort of consultation which will lead to a satisfactory formulation of the rights and responsibilities to be set out in this charter. I believe that the Minister will consult.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The tremendous power of disallowance which is vested in this chamber will ensure that the charter which is finally devised and put into the form of a disallowable instrument will be the product of such consultation so that there is no danger of the Opposition and the Australian Democrats finding fault with some part of it and scuttling the whole project or exercise. The Government could not live with that any more than could the Opposition or the Democrats. We must have a charter. It is a common aim and goal. That is the enterprise that we are engaged in. As was indicated in the second reading debate speeches it is a goal sought to be achieved in common by all in this chamber. Sharing that in common, with the process of consultation and with the parliamentary means of supervision which I have indicated, I am sure that we can be confident that the present structure of the Bill will enable a charter to be formulated which would satisfy all those concerns which have been expressed. However, I understand that a different form of parliamentary supervision is commending itself to the Opposition and to the Democrats so that an affirmative resolution of both Houses of the Parliament would be required to allow amendment of parts of articles of this charter. I understand that that will be the result of the vote. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to state quite firmly that this was not devised as a means of subverting the role of the elected representatives of the people as the persons who would finally determine the structure of this charter. I can assure the Committee that whichever method is chosen by the Committee, and then vindicated by the Senate, very full consultation will take place over the late Summer-Autumn period next year so that on 1 July 1990 we will be in a position finally to have formulated a charter of rights and responsibilities which will ensure the proper care of those who are residents of our various hostels and nursing homes around Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister is quite correct when he uses the term `deja vu' because the wording in this clause is precisely the same as that which we debated earlier in clause 4 in relation to the charter and the rights as set out there. For those same reasons we will be supporting the Opposition on these amendments. Surely the Minister must see that where we are strongly in favour of a charter, it would be extremely difficult for us to put ourselves in the position of rejecting a charter brought about by way of a regulation, a disallowable instrument, because clearly we would be laying ourselves open to a charge that we were opposing the charter-which we would not be; we would simply be concerned about one particular aspect of the charter. That becomes a very powerful reason why we are supporting the Opposition in this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Minister contrariwise is in any way concerned about the goodwill of either the Opposition or the Democrats in this matter, that goodwill will become very evident when the charter is dealt with in full and in detail by both Houses of Parliament. I can assure the Minister that we are committed to the charter very much in the form of drafts which we have already seen. But we very strongly argue for the processes which have been introduced by the Opposition-processes which will allow the charter to be properly looked at in detail, clause by clause, section by section. Hopefully, we will get a charter which is as good as one can possibly get in this very difficult area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise to the Committee for the delay, which has been occasioned by my late instructions to the draftsmen about proposing an amendment to clause 2. Nevertheless, the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) and Senator Coulter will certainly understand the purport of the amendment. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Page 1, clause 2, lines 6 and 7, leave out the clause, insert the following clause;</PARA>
<PARA>Commencement</PARA>
<PARA> ``2. This Act commences on the day after the day on which a House of the Parliament approves regulations made under this Act in the same form as they are approved by the other House, provided that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) not more than 90 days have elapsed; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the places of Senators have not become vacant under section 13 of the Constitution; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) a dissolution or expiration of the House of Representatives has not occurred, between the approval of one House and the approval of the other House.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a procedural device in relation to the commencement date of the Therapeutic Goods Act. It will provide that the Act will not come into effect until the date on which both Houses of Parliament have approved the regulations to be made under the Act. We have had considerable debate during the course of today on the whole thrust of the Therapeutic Goods Bill. In some respects, the primary criticism has been that the Bill cannot be effectively judged in the absence of the regulations which will be necessary to give effect to all of the provisions in relation to the licence, manufacture, sale, export, import and certification of prescribed therapeutic goods. </PARA>
<PARA> When we dealt with questions such as the vocational register of general practitioners, honourable senators will recall, the Senate took some steps basically to ensure that a Bill which the Senate had otherwise agreed to should not come into effect until such a time as the Parliament had been able to examine the regulations and, by substantive motion, both Houses of Parliament had either approved or, as in the case of section 10 of the vocational register legislation, until the Senate, by resolution, had approved the regulations. We then saw the regulations. It was only after the Senate passed a positive motion endorsing those regulations that that section of the Act, which had previously been passed, was able to come into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a device to ensure that the regulations which are required to be made and which give effect to the substance of this legislation shall be made publicly available and that the whole thrust, the whole regime, which is dependent upon those regulations shall not come into effect until such time as both Houses of Parliament, according to the formula set out in this amendment, have approved the regulations. So this is not a matter of catch-as-catch-can, when regulations become available, having a mechanism for disallowance. In fact, it is a requirement that, if the Act is to be passed, the Governor-General is to assent to it, and it does not come into effect until the regulations have been produced, presented to the Parliament and approved by the Parliament. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Jenkins will recall that this morning, during the debate on the legislation, I raised with Senator Ray the fact that a device had been eventually decided upon, in terms of a parliamentary committee looking at immigration regulations, and that this was a first step in getting to a situation in which the Parliament is not constantly asked to pass important pieces of legislation which depend upon having regulations, which regulations have to be taken sight unseen. That is a principle which we are determined to put forward for the Parliament to consider. Honourable senators all round this chamber, including Senator Dunn in her contribution and Senator Coulter in his contribution, made the point about the necessity for the Parliament to have some capacity to see regulations and about the disallowability of regulations in whole and in part. This is a device which now asks those honourable senators who have made so much of this matter to give their adherence to the principle which they have stated is close to their hearts. As a test of integrity, we invite them to now stand by that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not believe that there would be any interference in the operative dates of the legislation, that is, the appropriate operative dates in March and the appropriate operative dates in June or July when the fees matter, which is dealt with separately, comes into effect because quite simply, if the Government is anxious to have these matters dealt with, it will produce the regulations. Presumably, there are draft regulations around somewhere in somebody's bottom drawer at the moment, unless we are really being conned by the Government and its advisers. It would not be beyond the wit of the Government to produce these regulations at an early stage and to introduce them into both Houses. If the Parliament is to meet in February, the Government will undoubtedly be able to steamroller them through the House of Representatives in about two minutes flat. It will then present them to the Senate. The Senate will be able to decide whether, in fact, the regulations are adequate and satisfactory. If it finds them to be so, it will pass a resolution saying as much. The legislation will then come into effect. If it finds them unsatisfactory, we will at least have achieved the fundamental aim of the Bill being there in principle but the regulations being properly presented to the Senate for its scrutiny and adjudication. I commend the Opposition amendment to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not yet got the exact terms of the amendment, but I think I understand what Senator Puplick is proposing. The amendment brings about a situation which the Senate needs to consider fairly carefully, that is, whether the traditional way in which this chamber deals with regulations is to be maintained or whether we have, in relation to one or two Bills or whatever it might be from time to time, particularly near the end of the session, a completely new regime introduced whereby regulations are to be effective only when affirmed by one or both Houses of the Parliament. This is a completely different approach which obviously would require a considerable rethink, I would imagine, of the role of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. Quite clearly, the aim of that Committee is, in accordance with the various criteria which it brings to a consideration of regulations, to provide advice to this chamber as to whether a disallowance of the regulations might be appropriate. That is only one aspect of this, if not novel, certainly unusual approach to the parliamentary consideration of regulations which Senator Puplick puts forward.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That may be so, Senator Bishop, but perhaps it is the sort of matter which could well merit, in its own right, consideration by the chamber as to the way in which we, as a whole, deal with regulations. It is the traditional way of dealing with regulations which has served the Parliament and Australia for 80 or 90 years, although I do not want to simply rest on the fact that something has happened for a long time and therefore conclude that it is a good process or methodology. Nevertheless the fact is that that particular mechanism for reviewing regulations has proved to be an effective one and, as a result of the very excellent scrutiny that has been brought to bear by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee of this chamber, has not been able to be abused by those governments or executives which would either try to go outside the parameters or enabling clauses of the legislation, or use the power even within the boundaries of the conferred capacities or powers in a way which interfered, undermined or in some way dealt a blow to the traditional rights and liberties of the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In other words, we do have a mechanism in place which has been well tried and tested whereby enabling legislation is passed by this Parliament. It is then the case that regulations are made under the legislation and, according to the criteria of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, those regulations are put under expert scrutiny not exclusively by the Committee but by any interested senator responding either to the lobbying of a particular group which is concerned or to his or her own assessment of any particular part or even the whole of the regulations that are published. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we have already a reasonable way by which this chamber can deal with regulations. It is a very powerful way. Quite clearly, once again, if a part of these regulations proves absolutely unacceptable to the Opposition or to the Australian Democrats the regulations fall because they would be disallowed by the chamber and that would mean that the whole scheme could not operate, could not be effective, and not come into operation in a way which achieved the purposes which this Parliament has indicated ought to be achieved by the passage of the second reading of this Bill. I think it would obviously then fall to the Government to try to accommodate those concerns in order to have a set of regulations which, as a whole, implemented the will of this Parliament and of this chamber-that is, the effect of the disallowance capacity in this chamber to make sure that everything which the Government proposes by way of implementation of this particular Bill has the support of the chamber. Unless everything in the regulations made under this Bill has the support of this chamber, they will be disallowed and the Bill will not achieve its purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Committee to reject this particular amendment moved by Senator Puplick and to maintain the usual method of assessing the way in which the regulations will help achieve the objectives to which we have given our assent in the second reading debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a paradox in this situation that now faces us; that is, the many important aspects of this legislation have been effectively moved to the regulatory part of the legislation and therefore the legislation, at least to the extent that the regulations are involved, cannot become effective until the regulations are passed. Yet the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) says that he objects to the method of dealing with those regulations as outlined by the Opposition's amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have not been in this place for long enough to say, but I certainly have a feeling that traditionally regulations used to be a far less important part of the totality of an Act of parliament than they are today. It seems to me, increasingly, that we are seeing more Bills of a very general enabling kind in which the guts of what is to be done is being moved more towards regulations. Therefore, it avoids the very close and detailed scrutiny of the Parliament. It is not sufficient for the Minister to say that the Senate or the House of Representatives can disallow the regulations. As we have said repeatedly this afternoon in this debate, we only have the right to allow or disallow in toto and not to make these fine discriminations. </PARA>
<PARA> Several amendments which I will be moving later on have the effect of enabling certain things to happen within regulations. One advantage of proceeding with the Opposition's amendment is that at least we would be able to see the clauses, which I will seek to have inserted, effectively being used in the regulations before the legislation took effect. If we pass this Bill, the Act, as it will then be, cannot really operate effectively until the regulations are in place because they form a very substantial part of the overall legislation. I have difficulty, therefore, in seeing why the Minister protests so strongly against the Opposition's amendment. The Minister has also said that this is the way that things have been done ever since Federation. He immediately qualified that remark by saying that that does not become a powerful reasons why one should continue to do things in the same way. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only say that long before I came into this place I found the process of not being able to deal with regulations clause by clause very unsatisfactory when lobbying members of parliament on a whole range of issues. Moreover, the process by which a set of regulations can come into effect before the Parliament has the option of disallowing also is very unsatisfactory from my point of view. It would seem to me that perhaps this whole mechanism is ripe for reassessment, and perhaps we should be proceeding more often along the lines that have been outlines by Senator Puplick in this amendment. For that reason, and bearing in mind the amendments which I will shortly be moving in relation to the application of the regulations, we will support the Opposition's amendment to this clause. </PARA>

It seems to me that if the Opposition were minded to get support for the rejection of the regulations when they come forward in the normal way, the same frustration of the purposes of this Bill could be achieved. If the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) is presaging an early election and the likelihood that the Parliament will not be sitting and, therefore, the Government intends to introduce the regulations at a time when we would not be able to disallow them, that is another thing. But in the normal course of events, I do not see when I read through the words that, necessarily, the passage of this amendment need delay in any excessive way the implementation of this legislation. If Senator Tate wants to run through in some detail as to how it can effectively frustrate the implementation of this legislation, I would be very happy to listen.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The short answer is that under the disallowance procedure, these matters would have been dealt with by this chamber within 15 sitting days of the resumption of parliament-let us say, on 20 February next year, if that were the case. The whole matter would then be disposed of one way or the other. We would know where we stood at the end of those 15 days. Under Senator Puplick's proposal, there is no such urgency, no such deadline, no such looming expiry of the power of the chamber to deal with the matter. That means, as I said, that we would not have that hanging over the chamber as a spur to the fullest consideration of the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know why Senator Bishop says it is rubbish. Obviously, that formula of 15 sitting days was placed in the disallowance procedure to get the Senate to deal with the matter with a sense of urgency. Otherwise, there could be a very considerable frustration of the legislation. If one looks at Senator Puplick's amendment, one can see that that is not the case. As I said, I believe that we all know that at some time in the next autumn session of parliament-if it resumes-an election will be called. In that case, if the matter has not been dealt with to the stage of approval by either House, it cannot be dealt with in terms of Senator Puplick's commencement process and therefore, the whole legislation collapses and cannot commence.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Coulter is quite correct in the understanding that he has of the Opposition's amendment. He is also correct in the interjection that he made during the Minister's last reply that this matter is in the hands of the Government. The formula which is provided says that if the Government wishes to come to the Parliament some time on the first sitting day of next year and present the regulations, and move a formal motion that the matter be approved forthwith, unless the Opposition and the Australian Democrats combine to defer or to defeat such a motion, the motion would be passed on that first day. Given the way in which the House of Representatives operates at the moment, undoubtedly it will be passed by the House of Representatives on the same day with a minimum amount of fuss. Rather than having a situation in which the matter would be potentially defeated on the fact that, say, the regulations had been made and tabled some time in January or February and a senator gave notice on the first sitting day in February for their disallowance, there would then be the 15 sitting day period. If, in fact, they were not dealt with they would fall to the ground anyway under our procedures because the disallowance not having been disposed of, the regulations are taken to have failed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So this is a device which allows the Government the capacity to avoid the 15 sitting day problem as far as that is concerned. It facilitates and assists the Government in bringing forward the regulations on the first day of sitting. If the regulations are not found to be wanting by the Senate, the Senate would pass the motion because it would be anxious to see put into effect a Bill which has been supported in principle by all sides of this chamber. In fact, Senator Coulter is quite correct in saying that this matter is in the hands of the Government. The amendment does not defeat the operation of the Bill in the way in which the Minister is trying to make out. Senator Coulter is quite correct in his understanding and I thank him for the support which he has given to the Opposition amendment. </PARA>

<PARA>On the face of it, that would allow the export of therapeutic goods to another country when those goods were not in conformity with the standards which would be applicable in this country. The Secretary has the power to allow that export. This concerned the Australian Democrats for reasons which I outlined during the second reading debate. In discussing the matter, departmental officers pointed out that circumstances might arise in which, for example, there could be an urgent request for a vaccine, say, dealing with a patient with rabies in Malaya when Australia had a sample of rabies vaccine which did not conform with the Australian standard but which may be the only source of treatment for that patient. Consequently, the amendment that was originally circulated has been further amended and now reads, `Except with the consent of the Secretary and in exceptional circumstances . . .'. It is thus made quite clear that only under very exceptional circumstances and with the consent in writing of the Secretary goods not in conformity with the Australian standard could be exported. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clause 14 (3) has been proposed for amendment in two different versions by the Australian Democrats. The first, a circulated amendment, proposed to remove entirely the role of the Secretary in giving any sort of consent and would have provided a blanket prohibition that `a person must not export therapeutic goods'. There was then some discussion. The Government's position was `Except with the consent of the Secretary, a person must not export therapeutic goods'. There is now a sort of halfway measure: `Except in exceptional circumstances and with the consent in writing of the Secretary, a person must not export therapeutic goods'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I regret to say that in some respects the Opposition would have found it easier to live with the first Democrats' formulation because we would have known that there was a distinct prohibition one way or the other or with the Government's unqualified, `except with the consent in writing of the Secretary', leaving it effectively to the discretion of the Secretary without requiring the Secretary to establish what are or are not exceptional circumstances. I take it that it is the Secretary who must be satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances. That is why I was anxious to get the exact wording understood. It is not a matter of `Where the Secretary is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances'; it is `Except in exceptional circumstances and with the consent of the Secretary'. Who is to determine the exceptional circumstances? It is not as though the Secretary determines that there are exceptional circumstances. This is not a vague concoction of words about something which is warm and fuzzy; it is a piece of legislation subject to the interpretation of the courts. There is an `and' in this clause. So we have a clause that says, `Except in exceptional circumstances and with the consent of the Secretary'. To me, the two things are in fact capable of being judged by different people. Who is to judge whether there are exceptional circumstances?</PARA>
<PARA> Hypothesising for a moment, I wish to take action to prohibit the export of a particular therapeutic good. The Secretary has consented in writing, but I challenge that through some Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act or court procedure and say, `I challenge that there were at the time or there are at the time exceptional circumstances, and I ask you, the court, to make a judgment about this because I wish to take some action or some action ought to be taken to prohibit the export of the therapeutic good in question'. I do not contest that there is a consent in writing from the Secretary; I contest that there are exceptional circumstances. Had the amendment said, `Where the Secretary is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances' or, `The Secretary shall not consent in writing unless he or she is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances', which would simply have been a matter of the Secretary signing some document to say that he was of the opinion that there were exceptional circumstances and that his discretion, therefore, had been exercised accordingly, then I would have been somewhat more mollified. But the fact is that we now have two tests on foot-the presence of exceptional circumstances and the consent in writing of the Secretary-one test being a matter of fact and the other test being a matter of opinion, whereas previously there was only a question of fact to be determined, which was that a person must not export therapeutic goods from Australia, et cetera, with which I would have been satisfied. Because of those difficulties that I see with the way in which this is constructed, the Opposition will not support the amendment. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME><ELECTORATE>(South Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(5.43)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Puplick is nothing if not perceptive in drawing a distinction between those two clauses and, moreover, in recognising that the first amendment that we were minded to put was to the effect that there should be a total prohibition of the export of non-conforming therapeutic goods, a position which is probably more easily defensible. But in discussing this with officers of the Department of Community Services and Health, they pointed out that there may be very occasional and rare circumstances where an agent is available in Australia which does not conform and which may be sought perhaps to save the life of somebody in another country. Under those very exceptional circumstances, it would be a pity if the Secretary, the person responsible, were not in a position to provide a mechanism whereby that particular therapeutic agent could be exported and used. It was made quite clear that those circumstances would indeed be very exceptional. In introducing this amendment, I gave one such circumstance where we may have a vaccine in this country which, indeed, may never be used in this country because the disease may not be here. The particular batch might be the only batch we have. The batch might be below standard and, therefore, not conform. Nonetheless, it may be the only therapeutic agent available, and I certainly would not seek to prevent the export of such an agent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Going to the matter raised by Senator Puplick that two tests are required, that is done very deliberately, of course, because it is a check on the Secretary by way of a potential court appeal that the Secretary has not willy-nilly, wilfully, wantonly or in any other respect given permission for the export of such non-conforming goods. So while Senator Puplick is correct in saying that consent in writing is an objective test which can be seen by the courts, nonetheless, the Secretary, in giving that consent, takes into account that other clause `in exceptional circumstances' or `except in exceptional circumstances' and will be guided by the fact that he could be challenged before the courts in relation to the export of a non-conforming therapeutic good. It is precisely for those reasons that the amendment was not written the other way around, in which case the whole matter would simply be dependent on the Secretary, and it is appropriate that we cling to the principle that goods which do not conform to Australian standards should not be exported but, if they are to be exported at all, should be exported only under those very exceptional circumstances which would be rare and unusual. The wording is, therefore, quite appropriate to meet those unusual circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I am trying to grasp this particular amendment proposed by Senator Coulter, I agree with both honourable senators that two tests seem to be involved. Indeed, Senator Coulter has quite deliberately tried to remove the judgment of whether there are exceptional circumstances from the Secretary and made it a separate test within the clause which really places an obligation upon a person. So I do not think it is quite true to say that it is the Secretary that must take into account whether there are exceptional circumstances; it is a person who must take that into account in order to escape the penalty. I guess that it would be part of the prosecution of the offence that the prosecution would have to show that there were no exceptional circumstances or, I suppose, at least, that the matter was lying probably within the knowledge of the accused person. It might well be up to the accused person to show that there were exceptional circumstances, but quite clearly all the Secretary has to do is sign a document. Additionally, there have to be exceptional circumstances, and it is only if there are exceptional circumstances that the export is lawful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So in that situation I can understand that there are two tests. I wanted to clarify that, indeed, the person who might be subject to the penalty will bear the responsibility of at least making it a live issue, bearing in mind the evidential burden of proof, that there were exceptional circumstances; and then it would be up to the prosecution to show that there were no exceptional circumstances. But, as I say, I am caught a little bit on the hop here. However, I do believe that there are two different elements and the responsibility for ensuring that both are fulfilled fall on, firstly, the Secretary and, secondly, a person who wishes to export. </PARA>
<PARA> With that sort of attempted understanding, I believe I understand what Senator Coulter is trying to achieve, and that is that this export of therapeutic goods which do not conform with the required standard, the applicable standard, is extremely rare and should occur only in the most extraordinary circumstances. I understand what he has sought to achieve, and I think that the Government can accept that particular amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief. The Minister for Justice is quite right in saying that he has been caught on the hop. We have all been caught on the hop by not having had the opportunity to take all this through, but that happens in the committee stage, and I do not object to that, in exactly the same way that I had to produce my own amendment expeditiously. I believe that what the Minister has said is correct. There will be on the person a reverse onus of proof which, if that matter had been examined by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, undoubtedly would have caused that Committee to report to the Senate about a reverse onus of proof. Matters would have been consequently addressed. The Minister is also correct in saying that we understand what Senator Coulter is attempting to do. We just think that the exact words of the device may lead to more problems than is immediately apparent on the face of it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise to the Committee, but other preoccupations have prevented my entering this debate thus far. However, in respect of this clause I have just noticed something that takes my attention. I also apologise to the Minister for not giving him notice of this question, which has just occurred to me. I refer to the provisions of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations which relate to abortifacients. Do the provisions of the legislation currently before us in any way affect or impinge upon the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For example, under those regulations, the abortion drug RU486 is a prohibited import into Australia unless it receives the approval of the Secretary and, under the Secretary's signature, the Secretary has indicated that this would be a matter for reference to the Minister and that it would require the Minister's consideration prior to the Secretary's giving his approval or otherwise. As this is a matter of great controversy and a matter about which I have received certain assurances, I would like to know whether this legislation in any way affects the current provisions of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations and the current provisions relating to the import or export of abortion drugs, or abortifacients. </PARA>

In other words, if the Secretary were to declare that a particular good or a particular device was not a good or device for the purposes of this Act, that would solve Senator Harradine's problem. However, I am not in the business of attempting to solve Senator Harradine's problem. That is the Minister's responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (3) page 36, after subclause 59 (2), add the following subclause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(3) No licence fees or inspection fees are to apply to non-profit public hospital supply units.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The situation that this amendment deals with is one which may well apply in a number of States. Certainly, I am aware of it applying in Tasmania, where the bulk dispensing of a number of prescriptions is carried out in a central dispensary, so that dispensary is in fact manufacturing larger than just one-off quantities of prescribed materials. These prescriptions are in the nature of extemporaneous prescriptions which are used by a number of patients and therefore it is more convenient for the dispensary to manufacture them in bulk. It is a cost saving measure by the hospitals which clearly should not be subject to a licence fee or inspection fee. </PARA>
<PARA> It is possible that in a number of other circumstances hospitals or groups of public hospitals may manufacture such things as dressings and the like and therefore would be manufacturing therapeutic goods. Again this would be a cost saving measure, something that could easily be carried out within the individual hospital, but for various reasons it has been found more convenient to do it in bulk. Again these activities, while they involve manufacturing therapeutic goods in the strict sense of the word, should not be subject to licence fees or inspection fees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two points arise in relation to the words `non-profit public hospital supply units'. Why should this be confined to public hospital supply units? The questions are whether this is a non-profit supply unit, whether it is a public hospital which is supposed to be non-profit, what is the situation of private hospitals, whether they are profitable or not profitable, and why should there be any degree of discrimination against supply units which supply therapeutic goods to both public and private hospitals?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would have no difficulty at all if the amendment were `no licence fees or inspection fees are to apply to hospital supply units' but the qualification which is now introduced-non-profit public-causes me considerable concern. Some people are in private hospitals because they have paid the necessary insurance premiums, because they are taken there in an emergency or, most importantly, because they choose to be there. The question of whether a unit which supplies therapeutic goods should find itself subject to the payment of a licence fee or an inspection fee if it supplies private hospitals but exempt from payment of that fee if it supplies non-profit public hospitals is a discrimination that the Opposition is not prepared to countenance. Therefore, we will not be in a position to support Senator Coulter's amendment-not because we object to the removal of the licence fee or the inspection fee for those particular units but because of the discrimination which is introduced as to why those units should be exempt only if they are supplying non-profit public hospitals. To that extent we are not prepared to accept that form of discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter may not have intended to discriminate in that fashion but the Senate is entitled to know whether both Senator Coulter and, more to the point, Senator Tate are now saying that supply units which relate to the provision of goods and services to private hospitals are to be discriminated against. In particular, I want to hear what Senator Tate has to say. Senator Coulter may have a position on this. People in the private hospital sector are entitled to know whether Senator Tate and his Government are deliberately exempting some suppliers from fees and charges and deliberately imposing them on others. People in the private hospital sector are entitled to know what the Hawke Government's view is about the discrimination between public and private hospital suppliers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Proposed clause 59 (3) of the Therapeutic Goods Bill 1989 was attempting to give an advantage to-if you like, to discriminate in favour of-non-profit hospital supply units. Certainly I would be quite happy to take out the word `public'. I believe that the discrimination between public and private is not intended, was not important and was not really the thought that lay behind the drafting of this clause. The clause was intended to help hospital supply units which acted in a public or charitable context rather than in a profit-making context. I would certainly be happy if Senator Coulter were to delete the word `public' so that proposed subclause 59 (3) were to read:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quite happy with that. I will be interested to know whether Senator Puplick knows of any hospitals that fall into the category which he has outlined. I am certainly not aware of any but that is not to say they do not exist. The intention of the amendment is to cover the manufacturing of things which, in a one-off situation, say, in a pharmacy or single hospital, would not come under this legislation but, because of the arrangements to cut costs-the amalgamation of, say, a number of prescriptions into a bulk supply-become a manufacturing operation. If that is the intention I see no reason why that operation should then be caught up within this legislation. I am very happy to delete the word `public' if that meets Senator Puplick's objection so that it reads `apply to non-profit hospital supply units'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are now halfway there. The question now is why should the amendment apply only to non-profit hospitals. I would be grateful if the Minister for Justice could advise why a supply unit which supplies therapeutic goods to a hospital which makes a profit will be subject to licence fees whereas a supply unit which supplies therapeutic goods to a hospital which does not run at a profit, or runs at a loss, is exempt from the fee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To delete that further qualifier would simply create such an enormous loophole right in the midst of the legislation that it would be impossible to stick with the rest of it at all. We must draw a line somewhere. Clearly a profit oriented hospital could begin by dispensing on a small scale and legitimately for its own use in the way that I have indicated with bulk manufacture. Clearly if it became profitable it would move on and could operate in a much bigger way. To remove those words, it seems to me, would put such a hole in the legislation that it would be quite impossible to continue with the rest of it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So in other words, a unit operating as part of a hospital which makes a profit, which is big enough to supply goods to a non-profit hospital, pays the fee. Although the beneficiary could otherwise be the non-profit hospital, the fact that the supply unit is within a hospital which is a profit-making organisation means that it becomes subject to the licence fee, the cost of which presumably it passes on to its other customers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect, Mr Chairman, I think this is part of the difficulty of taking a lot of these things on the run. The Minister is obviously acquiescent in the Democrat amendment. It has been negotiated between the Democrats and the Minister or the Minister's advisers, or the Minister in the other place or his advisers. We are to have a situation in which a hospital which runs efficiently and perhaps makes a profit-heavens above, one would hope that that is not yet a cardinal sin-is to be subject to these penalties of licence fee or inspection fee whereas the non-profit or loss-making hospital is encouraged to remain in that status in order to avoid payment of the fee. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand where the balance of numbers lies in this matter. However, I think this is an unnecessary discrimination. It seems to me that there should be no reason why, if we are to have this exception, it should not simply be that no licence fee or inspection fee is to apply to hospital supply units. It seems to me that that is what we ought to be seeking to achieve. We ought to be seeking to achieve support for the hospital system. Whether they are public, private, profit-making or non-profit-making is not relevant to the question that the licence or inspection fee should not apply to hospital supply units. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw Senator Puplick's attention to an amendment which we intend to move to the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Bill in which we have attempted to pick up the matter which he raised. Although the amendment was not drafted with this object in mind, clearly it would cover this circumstance. The amendment seeks to insert the following subclause:</PARA></TALK.START>

In those circumstances, there is the option for a hospital producing a low volume for its own internal use to attract a very low charge or no charge at all. If that organisation were to move on from that, clearly it could not use the provisions as a loophole and continue under the guise of being a hospital-providing unit, to be free of licence fees or inspection fees. I ask Senator Puplick to look at the other amendment because it seems to me that it could cover the very circumstance that seems to be worrying him.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not think that I needed to supplement the answer given by Senator Coulter, whose amendment this is and to which, I must admit, I have agreed on behalf of the Government, with the further amendment, which he has agreed to, to delete the word `public'. It is not a question of a penalty being imposed on a profit-making hospital or a hospital unit designed to make a profit. It is a question of a proper licence or inspection fee being imposed but being waived in a case where a hospital supply unit is not set up or designed to achieve a surplus of revenue over its operating costs. That, I guess, is the understandable basis for Senator Coulter's proposal; that those organisations which are not set up in a way which is designed to achieve a surplus should be able to have the benefit of a waiver whereas those which are designed to achieve a profit can take into account their own fee structure-in other words, the fees they charge those who use their services-and the licence or inspection fees in trying to achieve a surplus of a particular magnitude.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is getting absolutely Gilbertian. Earlier in the day Senator Coulter spoke about a paradox and I was reminded about a song regarding a most ingenious paradox in The Pirates of Penzance. I am now reminded of the song in The Mikado which goes along the lines, `You are right and I am right and all is right', et cetera. The fact is that Senator Coulter clearly intended one thing and the Minister clearly intended what he now describes as the `norm' to be something else, and undoubtedly for the purposes of the Acts Interpretation Act the courts will find themselves absolutely bemused at reading the debate in order to try to ascertain precisely what the Parliament might or might not have meant with regard to all of this. Since explanatory memoranda are always written in a particular fashion, I ask Senator Tate to tell us what financial impact the Government expects as a result of this licence waiver arrangement and how many hospital supply units he thinks there are.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to correct the implication of what Senator Puplick has said. This wording was not intended for particular purposes in relation to the explanation I just gave. It was intended for certain purposes and the words clearly would apply to a certain range of things. I outlined in my second reading speech the situation in Tasmania where a number of hospitals had come together and established a central supply for the purposes of pharmaceutical manufacturing. Clearly that situation obtains over a reasonable number of public hospitals in Australia, both with respect to pharmaceuticals and, I would suspect, with respect to sterile supplies of a number of other therapeutic goods.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In drawing up the words, quite clearly one has to be careful that one does not make the terms too wide or, indeed, exclude those very things that one wants to include. The explanation that I gave earlier was simply intended to indicate that, quite apart from the intention, the words, as far as I can see, would apply to the single hospital. Whether there are single hospitals in that situation, or how many hospitals there are, I am not aware. But I would have thought that the numbers were not all that large and I would have thought that the question of fees would be largely irrelevant because this is a new piece of legislation which imposes fees for something which formerly did not attract fees. The fact that those particular operations in public hospitals continue to attract no fees does not have any implications in terms of the Budget at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am unable to answer Senator Puplick's question as regards to the number of hospital supply units. I am advised that the licence fee would be in the region of $3,500 and the inspection fee would be in the region of $3,000 per year. That gives Senator Puplick some idea of the amounts of money that would be involved. I do not know how many times one would need to multiply those amounts to get the exact financial impact, but it is quite clear that it would not be a huge amount of money within the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Page 40, after subclause 63 (3), insert the following new subclause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(3a) The regulations must provide for the waiving of fees or charges in cases where turnover of goods is less than 1000 units a year.''. </PARA>
<PARA>When the original raft of amendments was circulated by Senator Coulter, the Opposition parties had a look at them as best we were able within the resources and confines of time available to us. There were originally five amendments proposed by Senator Coulter, the fifth of which was in exactly the terms which I have just read out-to insert a new subclause (3a) into clause 63, reading:</PARA>
<PARA>The regulations must provide for the waiving of fees or charges in cases where turnover of goods is less than 1000 units a year. </PARA>
<PARA>The chamber may recall that during the second reading debate Senator Coulter made particular reference to the impact which a system of fees and charges would have in relation to smaller operations and producers of goods of a particularly specialised nature where the number of goods produced might not be large. I do not want to anticipate the brief comments which will be made in relation to the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Bill to which Senator Coulter will be moving a proposed amendment dealing with the turnover of goods of low volume and low value. I will come to that in due course, because it really should read low volume or low value. </PARA>
<PARA> The essence of this argument is that the Opposition, when looking at the proposed amendments of the Australian Democrats, found them attractive. I had some consultation with my colleague Mr Shack from Western Australia who, as you will know, Mr Temporary Chairman, is the shadow Minister for health. We were attracted to this Democrat amendment which was then amendment No. 5. It disappeared as part of the raft and package in the negotiations which took place between the Democrats and the Government at an earlier stage today. We believe that the regulations should provide for the waiving of fees and charges in cases where turnover of goods is less than 1,000 units a year, because of the high-tech, low volumes, particularly for start-up companies which I am concerned with, and I know Senator Coulter is concerned with as they featured during his remarks in this debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The clause was withdrawn not for any sinister motive or double dealing but simply to shift it into the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Bill, and we will be dealing with that amendment in a moment. I wish to deal with the words in this amendment which are different from those in the other amendment. I will pick this up as Senator Puplick has already moved this amendment. There was a problem with the figure of 1,000 units or less in that, first of all, the figure is arbitrary and, secondly, the value of those units may, indeed, be quite high. One might have quite a small production run but a very high value and, clearly, in that situation a fee could be chargeable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situation which that amendment sought to address, and which is now addressed in the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Bill, is the one in which the profit flowing from the sale of those goods would be low because the volume of the goods would be low and the value of the goods would be low, hence, the words which have been carried over into this other amendment. I am advised that the more appropriate place for this amendment is in the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Bill and that is the reason it has been shifted. I seek the assurance of the Minister that that is the appropriate place to achieve this end. I think, from what Senator Puplick has said, that we are all agreed that it is desirable that those companies which produce a range of items of low volume, or those start-up companies which have not yet become very profitable, should be provided with a system under the regulations whereby the charges can be waived or kept to a very low level. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is more attracted to Senator Coulter's formulation of what various senators around the Committee have in mind. If one looks to a production figure of less than 1,000 units, quite clearly one could have, for example, 900 pacemakers being produced in a particular manufacturing facility worth $3,000 or $3,500 each. Obviously that would be quite a substantial business. It is probably for that reason that Senator Coulter decided to abandon the figure of up to 1,000 units and to go for a more flexible description which allows us to give the relief which everyone considers would be useful and desirable but which does not allow, by some sort of artificial simple counting, for those organsations or manufacturing units which can well afford to pay not to pay. There is no reason why they should not be subject to the normal requirements of payment under the Act.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is precisely for the reason that Senator Tate has just indicated that the Opposition is attracted to this idea of 1,000 units. The example of pacemakers is perhaps the most useful that Senator Tate could have given in terms of bolstering the case which the Opposition wishes to put forward. The likelihood of Australia's being competitive in international markets in goods which are of low value is much smaller than the competitive advantage that we will have in goods that are of a similar value to units such as pacemakers. It is unlikely that we will have an export advantage in goods which are not only of low value but also of low volume.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of low value when we are in the marketplace competing against manufacturers who have advantages of proximity to international markets, who do not have the transport, communications and shipping difficulties that this country still faces but who have the advantages of comparative labour costs, the very area in which we are likely to have advantage is for goods which have some value such as the range of pacemakers, the production of Nucleus Ltd and various others, which we ought specifically to be seeking to encourage. It was for that reason that we were attracted to the proposition to move away from the test of low value-whatever that means. What does low value mean? What is low? How low is low before the Government decides that a product will be tax exempt? How long is a piece of string? How low is low: as low as the promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) about children living in poverty? Is that how low the value has to get before it becomes a test?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh has to determine these things ultimately, I guess. The Department of Finance eventually will determine what is low value in Senator Walsh's terms. Goodness me, the idea of asking somebody who would make one of the central figures of A Christmas Carol appear as a munificent benefactor of the human race to determine what is to be low value in terms of these regulations is a nonsense. It was for that purpose that we were attracted to Senator Coulter's original proposition of an objective test. One thousand units is 1,000 units. Even Senator Walsh can count. Even Senator Tate who does not pretend to be an economic literate can count to a thousand. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was very properly raised with me that, as a result of the amendment which the Committee has made to clause 2-namely, in relation to a commencement date of the operations of the Therapeutic Goods Bill-there may have been the need for some consequential amendment to be made. As a result of the passage of clause 2, the Act would not come into effect until regulations had been approved, but regulations may or may not have been able to be made under an act because the Act had not, in fact, come into effect. Potentially we had a logical difficulty there about making regulations under an Act which itself had to wait before it came into effect for certain things to occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, through the courtesy of the Clerk, my attention has been drawn to section 4 of part 2 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 which is headed `Exercise of certain powers between passing and commencing of Act'. Having looked at that, it appears to me that the potential difficulties, which were originally brought to our attention about the operations of the regulation making process as a result of the insertion of clause 2 in the Bill, do not need to be addressed. I had, again by courtesy of the Clerk, an amendment drawn which would have provided:</PARA>
<PARA>`For the purposes of section 2, regulations may be made before the commencement of this Act as if this Act were in force, but do not come into effect on a day earlier than the day on which the Act commences. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that that is not necessary. Therefore, I will not be pursuing that amendment because I believe that the provisions of section 4 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 adequately provide for that situation. I believe, therefore, that further amendment to clause 63 is not necessary. </PARA>

I am persuaded by the honourable senator-and he is relying on the Clerk, who apparently has made an examination of this matter over the last several hours-that the Acts Interpretation Act covers the situation and permits the regulations to be made. That would allow the Act to come into force if those regulations are approved. I am a little anxious. I do not know whether we should ask Senator Puplick to surrender his piece of paper. I might adopt his amendment and, out of an abundance of caution, insert it in the statute anyway. If it is surplus to requirements, it cannot do any harm.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Chairman. Very simply, the Opposition's view and my view is that the principle of establishing a unified national system of control over the quality, safety and efficacy of therapeutic products is supported by both the Liberal and national parties and the industry. That is not to say, however, that the Bill as it has come forward, with regulations being a substantial part of the enactment, is in any way satisfactory to the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed, Mr Tickner went to great lengths while addressing the laudable nature of the Bill which is replacing the 1966 Act to say that the Public Accounts Committee was the foundation of the replacement Bill. Quite frankly, that is a patent misrepresentation, in that the Public Accounts Committee strives at all times to arrive at a report to which all members of the Committee can put their names. Mr Tickner and I, in the course of the debate on the report, were at opposite ends of the spectrum; it is a wonder the debate was not heard in another State. For him to allege that somehow I would support his view of the interpretation of the Act as underpinning the worthwhileness of the replacement legislation, the Bill we are presently debating, is totally and utterly misleading. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations were couched in such language as to accommodate the vastly differing points of view within the Public Accounts Committee, which, as I said, strives to bring in a unanimous report. Mr Tickner's views and mine were as diverse then as they are now. Again, I place on record my singular exception to the number of times in which he invokes my name and that of Mr Ruddock-though Mr Ruddock can speak for himself. I find his comments both offensive and angering. We simply came together with a view that there should be a unified national system of control. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Senator BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Chairman. In the previous Therapeutic Goods Act, there was a clear power for the Commonwealth to enforce legislation concerning pharmaceutical goods and there was clearly no distinct power for the Commonwealth to deal with devices. Indeed, the manner in which the replacement Bill is drafted is such that there is reliance on the corporation's power. I suspect that, whereas the 1966 Act relied on the powers as described here, the law of the Commonwealth relating to the provision of pharmaceutical and repatriation benefits for pharmaceutical evaluation and all the things that flow from that, the bringing in of regulations in the way that the Bill contemplates is really waiting for a ruling from the High Court to see whether or not the Commonwealth has the power to deal with devices. For that reason, devices are not dealt with in this Bill as they were in the 1966 Bill: they relied on the Customs power to deal with imported goods. It is important to remember, in saying that the Public Accounts Committee recommended that there be fresh legislation and that the old Act be repealed, that that is in no way to say that the people who subscribed their names to that report were giving some blessing to the Bill presently before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Several clauses in the Public Accounts Committee report required consultation with the States and that there be no cross-subsidisation for any of the categories likely to occur in the regulations. Use was to be made of comparable overseas valuations, and there was nothing to suggest that the manner in which the Commonwealth had operated in creating five categories of devices under the old Act was in fact unsatisfactory. Other speakers in this debate have pointed out that the charges which are going to be imposed via the regulations and by the subsequent Bill will indeed impede our export industries. Those have been adequately dealt with. The important thing is that Mr Tickner tried to say that the Public Accounts Committee report underpinned every aspect of the Bill before us and I chose to make my remarks concerning the repeal of the old Bill. In doing so I am drawing the Committee's attention to the question of whether the Commonwealth will ultimately have power to enact the legislation which it wishes to so do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats have one amendment only, the substance of which has been adequately canvassed already by Senator Puplick in the debate which followed the amendment we moved to the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. The amendment seeks merely to keep to zero level those charges which might be levelled against persons whose turnover of therapeutic goods is of low volume and low value. A moment ago Senator Puplick raised the point that it should be `or' rather than `and'. I think it probably has been adequately covered, but I reiterate that the intention here is to keep to zero level charges for those organisations whose turnover of goods is of a low volume and the goods they produce are of low value.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have accepted the argument that was put to me by the Government officers in relation to some goods which might be manufactured in very small volume, but each of those goods might be of very high value. Pacemakers, for instance, surely have to meet the highest standards. Factory inspection and quality assurance in relation to goods in those areas is absolutely vital. I believe that the word `and' linking those two conditions is appropriate. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> Page 2, after subclause 5 (2), had at the end of the clause, the following subclause. </PARA>
<PARA> `(3) the regulations shall provide that annual charges in respect of the registration or listing of therapeutic goods are not payable by persons whose turnover of those goods is of low volume and low value.''. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME><ELECTORATE>(New South Wales)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(8.47)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek the Minister's clarification on a couple of matters in relation to this amendment. The first is the question of whether the term `persons' is understood by the Minister to mean, legally, a corporation or company or manufacturing operation. Can he give me an assurance that that is the meaning of the word `persons'? I also ask him to address his mind to the question of turnover-`whose turnover of those goods is low volume and low value'. Does that mean production, does it mean sales, or does it mean a particular type of sale? For example, if I produce 10,000 units but sell only five, what is the basis of the decision as to whether that is low volume? Is it the number that I sell or the number that I produce?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, what is the definition of the term `turnover'? Thirdly, does the Minister give an undertaking that in the regulations the term `low' will not be used, but rather that there will be a quantifiable figure, that is, x number of units, or x value in dollars terms? Or does the Minister rely simply upon the fact that somehow this will be left to the discretion of some regulatory, departmental secretary or Commissioner of Taxation?</PARA>
<PARA> By way of illustration of the confusion that can arise in these matters, I draw the attention of honourable senators to the fact that on a number of occasions Senator Coulter said that the intention of this amendment was to keep the charges low. In fact, the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that there are no charges at all. The amendment says `are not payable'. If by `low' we mean zero in the sense that Senator Coulter has used that terminology this evening, I think great comfort will be given to those who have persuaded Senator Coulter to move away from the objective test of 1,000 units to some vague formulation of low volume and low value. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, does the Minister accept as a matter of principle that there may well be an operation where the volume produced may be low but the value may be significant? In other words, we might have an operation that produces, let us say, for the sake of argument, a computerised axial tomography (CAT) scanner-something with which you are intimately familiar, Mr Temporary Chairman. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to know that it obviously worked-at least I presume that it did. If the person referred to produces only one or two of these items per year, the value of the items is considerably higher than might be anticipated, and certainly would not come within the term `low value'. Is the Government happy with the prospect that a company which may produce only a limited number of items but of considerable value should not obtain the benefit of the zero charges because the items must have both low value and low volume?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The word `person' when it appears in Commonwealth legislation is governed by the Acts Interpretation Act. I do not have that statute in front of me but, as I recall it, a person includes a body politic, a body corporate or an individual. That is the span of the meaning of the word `person' when it appears in legislation unless there is some indication to the contrary, which there is not in this case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the question of turnover, I think anyone running a business would understand that term to mean and refer to the sale of items concerned rather than their production or manufacture. The term is very commonly used in commerce to indicate that-although I do not know what the derivation is-the product is turned into something of different value, namely, the price that one obtains for that particular good or item. That is only a guess but, nevertheless, the word `turnover' is a term of commerce rather than manufacture and, I think, refers to trading or sale of the items concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the word `low' is concerned, it is quite clear that we are discussing an enabling provision which indicates that regulations must be made. It is the nature of regulations that more precision be given to those terms. As I understand it, that will be attempted. Of course, as we all know, those regulations will be brought before the Senate-indeed, to the other place also-for its consideration, when the attempt to give more precision can be examined. No doubt it will be the subject of lobbying by interested persons. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the combination of low volume and high value, I think it is the clear meaning of the subclause that that combination might occur. The `and' is deliberate. As Senator Coulter was saying, it is cumulative rather than disjunctive. It is not an `or'; it is an `and'. In that situation it could well be that only a small number of high value items turned over. However, depending on the way in which the regulations are drawn, the annual charges would not be waived; in other words, they would be payable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make only one point in reply to the Minister. Clause 3 of the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Bill states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 is incorporated, and is to be read as one, with this Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, one looks to the Therapeutic Goods Bill for questions of guidance about what these things mean. Clause 6 of the Therapeutic Goods Bill states:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) This Act applies to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) things done by . . . corporations; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) things done by . . . natural persons or corporations in so far as those things are done . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The clause then specifies a number of matters. This formula in clause 6 of the Therapeutic Goods Bill derives from the interest which the Commonwealth has in extending its regulatory powers by reference to the corporations legislation. The question which I have raised in relation to the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Bill concerns the definition of the term `persons'. It seems to me that if the proposed Therapeutic Goods Act, which is to be read as one with the proposed Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Act, goes out of its way to make separate and special reference to the difference between corporations, natural persons or corporations, and other entities, in order to obtain the benefit which it is believed should be obtained by passage of this amendment to the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Bill, the proper construction would have been to use the same terminology-namely, corporations or natural persons. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think that that is necessary because clause 6 of the Therapeutic Goods Bill attempts to construct a constitutional link between the activities which are governed by the Bill-`things done by or in relation to'. In other words, the Bill in its various clauses deals with certain activities which do not normally fall within the purview of the constitutional power of the Parliament. To relate them to the constitutional power of the Parliament they have to be in relation to corporations-of course, that invokes the corporations power-or in relation to natural persons or corporations in so far as those things are done in the course of, or in preparation for, trade or commerce between Australia and a place outside Australia, among the States, between a State and a Territory or between two Territories; or under a law of the Commonwealth relating to the provision of pharmaceutical or repatriation benefits; or in relation to the Commonwealth or in relation to an authority of the Commonwealth. Quite clearly, paragraphs 6 (1) (a) and (b) attempt to link the actions that are sought to be governed by the Statute with those heads of power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is different when one turns to Senator Coulter's amendment because he is taking advantage, quite properly, of the Acts Interpretation Act. I am certain that where `persons' is used there unadorned, the Acts Interpretation Act would allow one to read that as covering bodies politic, bodies corporate and individuals. I do not think that there is any contradiction between the two, and there is no need for Senator Coulter to redraw the subclause which he has offered for the Committee's consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make it clear that because the Senate has agreed to the Opposition amendment to clause 2 of the Therapeutic Goods Bill, we will not be dividing on the third reading of this Bill. If the Senate had not agreed to our amendment regarding the question of the commencement arrangements for this Bill, we would have opposed the Bill on the third reading. I have sought to make it clear throughout the debate that we did not object to the principle of the Bill, and that we did not object to the attempt to establish the national regulation of the control of therapeutic goods, but that we objected to methodology and, in particular, to the open-ended commitment to regulations which, in our view, were not subject to a proper degree of parliamentary scrutiny. If that situation had persisted, we would have resisted the Bill on its third reading. The passage of the Opposition amendment, which provides that the Act shall only come into effect once both Houses of the Parliament have, by resolution, approved the regulations which can now be made under this Act, satisfies our most basic concerns about the legislation, and therefore we do not oppose the third reading of the two therapeutic goods Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was one item which bears very heavily on the Therapeutic Goods Bill, which is a matter that I raised in my speech at the second reading stage but which could not be handled by way of any amendment. I ask the Senate's permission to seek an assurance from the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) in relation to the role of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) in relation to the review of a number of items which will come under this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I pointed out in my speech during the second reading debate that the NHMRC committees are composed very largely of volunteers who meet regularly. Sometimes items are submitted for review and cannot be dealt with for at least six months-sometimes as long as a year. That process is unsatisfactory. Moreover, the NHMRC is not a statutory body. Therefore, the processes by which it will deal with matters which come before it under this legislation will not automatically be open to review so that those placing material before the committees can be assured that the matters have been properly considered and the judgments fairly drawn. I seek the assurance of the Minister that the role of the NHMRC under this legislation-and, indeed, more broadly-will be reviewed with a view to making the NHMRC more of a full time statutory body whose processes are open to full and open scrutiny. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I am a little reluctant to get involved in a committee stage response during a third reading debate. Nevertheless, I will satisfy Senator Coulter, who has been helpful at times in the passage of this package of legislation, by saying that the National Health and Medical Research Council has been devised so that its personnel are not full time. I suppose that is because the sort of expertise which it draws on is thought to be usefully gathered from those institutions of medical and scientific research and practice where people have practical experience of matters which they then bring to the deliberations of the National Health and Medical Research Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As for Senator Coulter's more general question concerning who keeps an eye on the decision making process of the National Health and Medical Research Council to ensure that it is open and able to be properly assessed-I know Senator Harradine has a very real interest in this-the Administrative Review Council is conducting a review of that decision making process. I certainly invite Senator Coulter to make a submission to the Administrative Review Council, drawing on his concerns and, perhaps, misgivings about this particular instance. It may well be that his contribution to the review being undertaken by the Administrative Review Council will be helpful in the formation of its conclusions and recommendations. The Administrative Review Council is looking at the overall question to which Senator Coulter adverted, and I believe it is best in those hands. The Government and, as I understand it, Senator Coulter and other senators will be interested to see the results of that review. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The seven Bills the Senate is debating are the States Grant (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2), the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2), the Student Assistance Amendment Bill (No. 2), the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Bill, the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill, the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Bill and the University of Canberra Bill. The Opposition supports all seven of them. One Bill will be adjourned until next week, but I expect the other six will be passed later this evening or in the morning. The Liberal and National parties have announced their education policies. We have made public our sound and constructive approach to schools, technical and further education (TAFE) and higher education. It is on the basis of those policies and our Economic Action Plan that we have confidence in saying that the Bills before the Senate tonight are fully consistent with those announced policies and so have our support. Three of the Bills are in the usual form for this time of year, providing annual funding to schools, TAFE and higher education, together with supplementation to account for inflation in respect of grants that have already been made. The three funding Bills provide $5.6 billion in assistance to education. Another Bill strengthens anti-fraud measures in student assistance schemes, with an estimated saving of $5m. The Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill 1989 proposes to increase overseas student charges between 8 per cent to 10 per cent in the format which has been used for many years. The Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Bill 1989 draws together $112m a year for the next three years to provide supplementation assistance for Aboriginal education programs. The final Bill in the package, the University of Canberra Bill 1989, establishes the University of Canberra. It is an important and innovative measure, one which I have called for over at least the last year and which the Opposition welcomes. As an amendment to the second reading motion, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of motion, add: ``, but the Senate is of the opinion that the Government should be condemned for the turmoil caused to Australia's higher education system by the Government's use of financial blackmail, centralised control, bureaucratic administration and other heavy-handed tactics to implement its ill-conceived education policies''. </PARA>
<PARA>I move that amendment to the motion before the Senate to make it abundantly clear that the Opposition, while supporting these seven Bills, does not support the way in which the Government and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) have let down and failed Australia in the administration of policies concerning schools, technical and further education and higher education. The only remedy to this situation, which I will come to later, will be in March or May next year when the people of Australia will have an opportunity to vote in a new Liberal-National Party government. </PARA>
<PARA> I will deal with each of the seven Bills in turn. The States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 provides $2,212m for schools in the 1990 calendar year. It also provides supplementation with respect to the current year to bring grants to a total of $2,055m. The Bill also provides for a rural hostels program. It is easy for the Opposition to be cynical about this measure. Of course, we support it because we have urged greater educational assistance for children in country areas. The Government announced a $600m rural education program about six months ago. It turned out that all of the hundreds of millions of dollars, bar $2m only, was money that had already been determined for various programs. This was just the 8 per cent element that relates to the population in rural areas. The Government decided to launch a rural education initiative which was merely 8 per cent of everything that it provides for the whole country on the ground that 8 per cent of Australians live in country areas. The only new element was $2m-$1m this year and $1m next year-for a rural hostels program. I give the Government full praise for that puny, but welcome, initiative. This is the legislation that provides a framework for that $2m to be spent. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before us also extends eligibility for the English as a second language (ESL) program to students in the first year of primary school who may have arrived in Australia 18 months preceding that enrolment. It is also a welcome initiative. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which was provided in answer to my question asked in the Estimates hearings setting out ESL funding over recent years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The table shows that there has not been a return to the 1986 peak level of funding for English as a second language programs. The Opposition has been very critical of the Government for its huge cuts in English as a second language programs in 1987. Whilst there was some scrabbling together of additional moneys to meet the public outcry and the outcry of the Opposition, even today, and even in projection for 1990, ESL programs will be underfunded compared to any of the years in the first half of the 1980s. All of these measures are supported by the Opposition; they are sensible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take the opportunity to note that the Opposition months ago published its own schools policy. Only the brief time available for this debate restricts me in emphasising the particular strengths of the Opposition's policy with regard to schools. When we come into government next year, our implementing this policy will at least maintain, but generally increase, resources to individual schools, will abolish the barriers erected by the Labor Ministers Ryan and Dawkins to hinder the establishment of new schools, and will promote excellence, equity and choice for all Australian children and their families. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989. The funding has already been passed for the 1989-91 triennium, and the $2,856m provided in this Bill is for the 1992 calendar year, in accord with the rolling triennium funding arrangements. This includes $34m for the additional 4,000 enrolments in the intakes to be increased in 1992; an additional $56m for capital works to bring 1992 funds up to the same real value as capital funding for 1991; and $13m cost supplementation for the years 1990 and 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides that the Australian Research Council programs now incorporated into this Bill on a rolling triennium basis will have an additional $34m in 1990, $53m in 1991, and $62m in 1992. These additional research grants were announced in the science and research statement of the Government in May of this year. The Government's decisions in this area are not controversial. The Opposition supports all of them, as we have made the very firm commitment that in higher education funding all that is in this Bill and the present Act, with regard to the present triennium and the year 1992, in addition, will be maintained at least by the Opposition when it is in government. </PARA>
<PARA> Incidentally, I note that in this legislation some 72 higher education institutions are listed to receive financial support. After two years of Mr Dawkins pressuring institutions to amalgamate, it is ironical to note that there are quite so many higher education institutions in this country. If one had been listening only to Minister Dawkins, one might have thought that there would be only 35 institutions. Thankfully, the rhetoric of this Government to amalgamate for the sake of it, despite the want of any educational or financial advantage, has not swayed the councils of our higher education institutions. I believe that up to this point there have been amalgamations only where there is educational merit for them and where there are genuine long-term financial savings. Certainly, the Opposition will not persist with the pressure for amalgamation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two significant observations about higher education over the last seven years of the Hawke Labor Government that I would like to make. The first is that funding from the Commonwealth per student in higher education has decreased in real terms every single year of the Hawke Labor Government. In every one of the last seven years there has been a decrease in the funding per student. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table given in answer to my question at the Estimates Committee about this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again, I thank the Senate. These tables show the extent of unmet demand for each State. They bear out my summary that 10 per cent of applicants all round Australia are turned away from our 72 higher education institutions because of the policies of this Government. They will not be turned away by bureaucratic fiat under a Liberal-National Party government as all institutions will be given the right to abolish the ceilings on enrolments and to enrol whatever numbers of students, on whatever grounds, they see fit. The only answer to the inadequacies that I have mentioned is a change of government from the last seven years and the refreshing approaches of the higher education policies announced by the Liberal and National parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will refer to two particular new mechanisms which will refresh higher education in this country. Firstly, institutions will be given genuine autonomy by us. This will mean an end to the last seven years of centralising, standardising and uniformity from Canberra. Let me refer to the 15 year period from 1972 to 1987. In recent times I have often described them as `the Karmel years'. I have the very highest respect for Professor Peter Karmel who has contributed more to education in this country than any other. The years from 1972 to 1987 were very much led by his decisions and reforms. A certain number of goals were set and achieved by both the Labor and Liberal governments. That period of consolidation has been achieved. On the basis of the 15 Karmel years, we can now put aside the two years of Dawkins-the overcentralising and interference with the higher education institutions of Australia-and move on in a refreshing way to a genuine autonomy in these institutions. Councils will be councils again and will not just deal with bicycle sheds; vice-chancellors will be vice-chancellors again. In this context I am really referring to the 1950s and 1960s, when councils were councils and vice-chancellors were vice-chancellors. With this increased autonomy and, indeed, a genuine sense of constructive competition between institutions around Australia, I believe that there will be positive incentives for those institutions to manage their own program delivery with efficiency and effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> The second new mechanism that will be implemented by our policy will remove the Canberra imposed ceiling on student enrolments. Censorship of enrolments will go. We guarantee the number of student places provided by current legislation, including the extra 4,000 places for 1992 provided for in this Bill. But in addition to those guaranteed funded places in higher education, institutions will be free to enrol any additional numbers on whatever basis they see fit. Unmet demand will be genuinely tested for the first time in 20 years by our flexible approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, with regard to higher education funding, I wish to refer to the higher education contribution scheme (HECS) which many people know as the graduate tax. HECS was introduced for the first year of operation this year by the Hawke Labor Government following the report of the Committee on Higher Education Funding, the Wran report, and the decision of Mr Dawkins. Under a Liberal-National Party government, the HECS will be abolished. After coming into government in March or May next year we can expect the new approach-that is a post-HECS approach-to take effect from 1 January 1991. We are abolishing the HECS for two reasons. We want to ensure that the student payment goes directly and fully to the education institution where the student is enrolled. We will stop student money going to the government trust fund. We want to get government right out of the relationship altogether. The Australian Taxation Office will no longer be involved when we abolish the HECS. The second reason is that we want to lower the financial burden on all students by decreasing the student contribution from the $1,800 tax under Labor to a $1,200 tuition fee under the Opposition. Since the $1,200 amount was announced two months ago in the Opposition's Economic Action Plan and tax statement of October, some students have asked questions to clarify the positive advantages for students in our positive and reformed approach. I will explain some aspects for the first time. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard two tables that set out the explanation I am about to give. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first table concerns Labor's higher education contribution scheme. The second table shows the Liberal-National Party tuition fee alternative to the HECS. The first table shows that the $1,800 amount, which is the tax liability accrued for all higher education students, bar very few, rises with inflation year by year to $1,882 next year, to $1,969 in 1991, to $2,060 in 1992 and to $2,155 in 1993. The tax liability, for example, at the end of the 1993 year will be three times the final amount of $2,155 for a three-year undergraduate course. The actual liability grows as the years go by in the same way as the new liability of any year of study grows. So a student under Labor at the end of a three-year course undertaken in 1991, 1992 and 1993, will have a tax liability of $6,465 at Christmas time 1993. The table also shows that with the 15 per cent discount for the up-front payment, the amounts in successive years will be $1,530 this year rising to $1,832 in 1993. If a student paid up front in each of the three years 1991, 1992 and 1993, the total amount paid would be $5,257. That is the cost of a three-year degree under Labor. The student contributes approximately $5,250-$6,500.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In comparison, let us turn to the Liberal-National Party tuition fee alternative. Students will fall into three groups. The first group is one-quarter of all students who will be totally exempt from all tuition fees; so 85,000 higher education students in Australia will pay zero for their higher education enrolment. That is a $6,000-odd advantage for them. The second group is another one-quarter of all students and they will pay $1,200 a year, which is $3,600 total. Under HECS they would have had to pay $5,257, so this quarter of all students will have an advantage of $1,657. The third group, that one-half of all students who will be neither exempt nor able to pay up front, will presumably take on loans which would be government-guaranteed loans so that no student would ever be denied enrolment in higher education for the want of the money to pay. Here we have to have a calculation for the interest that may be accrued during the years of study on the basis of $600 being paid each semester for the three years-six payments of $600 each. Any bank or finance company will have an interest ready reckoner that will show a student what the interest accruing in that sequence of instalment payments will be. </PARA>
<PARA> The conclusion is that that half of the students of Australia who undertake the three-year course in 1991, 1992 and 1993 will have a tuition fee liability of less than $4,550 compared with $6,465 under HECS. Under the Opposition scheme, the advantage to the student is $1,915. I note that that figure is worked out on an interest rate of 15 per cent, so if that rate falls below 15 per cent by the time the scheme begins students will have an even better advantage. In a rule of thumb way, when Christmas 1993 arrives, under the coalition approach students will be at least $2,000 better off than under the higher education contribution scheme of the Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a table which was provided in response to a question I asked during consideration of the Estimates and which shows the 14,299 exemptions operating this year under HECS for postgraduate students. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The table makes it abundantly clear that under HECS there is this year a total of fewer than 19,000 exemptions; that is, fewer than 19,000 of all of our higher education students do not pay for their tuition. There are only two groups of exemptions-the 4,000 for the professional development of teachers and the 14,299 set out in the table for all others who are all postgraduate students. In great contrast to this 19,000, the Opposition will have exemptions for 85,000 who will pay zero for tuition. This greatly increased number of exemptions will be ample to provide for these sorts of groups of people. All current categories of exemptions will be able to continue. Many thousands more post-graduate students will be able to become exempt. All honours year and other fourth year graduate diploma students will be able to become exempt. All fourth, fifth and sixth year students undertaking courses of longer than three years again will be able to be exempt. Finally, and especially, many thousands of students in financial need will be able to be exempt. All the categories that I have mentioned will be able to be exempt together, because the 85,000 will cater for such numbers. The final decisions will be determined by the education institutions themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>

According to decisions already announced in the TAFE 1990 Commonwealth programs and priorities statement, $329m is appropriated and the Opposition fully supports the Bill. Time in this debate precludes my debating now the current issues concerning TAFE, but I draw attention to the T.A.F.E. Policy of the Opposition, a sound and constructive policy which the Opposition has published and which is widely distributed. This is the policy which will be implemented on our return to government next year. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth Bill before us is the Student Assistance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, which relates to the Austudy scheme and postgraduate awards. The objective of the Bill is the prevention of fraud and the recovery of overpayments. This Bill extends existing Austudy provisions to the non-legislated schemes-that is, assistance for isolated children, Abstudy and Aboriginal overseas study awards. It is a sensible extension of the anti-fraud measures that are already in place for Austudy and the Opposition fully supports the scheme. The Bill also enables the charging of interest on debts after a three-month grace period which will essentially act as a deterrent for the accrual of debts. (Extension of time granted) I thank the Senate. We have seven Bills before us and I was conscious from the beginning that I might take 40 to 45 minutes in presenting the Opposition's case on them. The Bill before us also renumbers the clauses, given the very many amendments that have been passed by the Parliament over the last 16 years. The impact of this measure is some $5m, estimated to be recovered over the next two years. Only $100,000 is expected to be raised in terms of any interest payments. So it is small and reinforces the view that this measure is essentially a deterrent. </PARA>
<PARA> Essentially, my point on this Bill is that this measure should have been taken 10 years ago. It should have been taken in any of the years of the Hawke Government and, in fact, in some years of the preceding Government. These are the sorts of reforms which have been the outcome of program budgeting and the requirement, not least from the Senate Estimates committee system, that the departments of government apply to themselves a program evaluation. I can only commend the Estimates committee system and the Department for eventually achieving such a degree of program evaluation as to put in place the kinds of measures that we see in the Bill that is before us. The Senate should take a bow and the Department, to some extent, should take a bow as well-but 10 years too late. The Opposition, in government, will completely review Austudy. We will follow up the quite scandalous reports from the Auditor-General and others in regard to the level of fraud that has taken place in the student assistance programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Bill 1989 provides $236m over the next three years. That is about $112m a year. It is to promote educational equality in access, in participation and in outcomes. It sounds like affirmative action, and technically there would be some controversy about that in this chamber, but certainly there is no-one I know of in the Senate who would not want to see an improvement in educational outcomes, access and participation, whether by students or by staff in educational institutions. So the Opposition supports the objectives of this Bill and very genuinely supports the outcomes that we all hope will flow from it. There are some dangers in the Bill. It gives inordinate power to the Minister to determine to whom he gives contracts-whether they are States, educational institutions or even persons involved in education. I am sure that we will seek to monitor what the incoming government's Minister will do with regard to this money. In many respects this Bill reappropriates money that has already been voted by other legislation. Certainly that is the case for the first half-year of operation. It sets out for the remaining 2 1/2 years moneys that will be in succeeding Budgets. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say to those within the Government who are propagandising from time to time that there is nothing in the Opposition's policy which would take away a dollar from any of these programs. The cuts in Aboriginal affairs, along with the cuts in many departments, that have been announced by the Opposition all affect bureaucracy and not programs. This Bill not only will be supported in this chamber tonight but also will be supported in operation by the Opposition in government. </PARA>
<PARA> The next Bill before us is the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill 1989. It raises overseas student charges by 8 to 10 per cent. I do not have time to reflect upon the Bill, except to say that the Minister gave a firm undertaking 12 months ago to provide in legislation for the ability to pay the overseas student charge in two instalments. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the Minister's letter to me of 7 December-only last Thursday-with regard to this undertaking. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Senator Teague</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the letter I wrote to you on 13 December 1988 about payment of the overseas student charge (OSC) by instalments. I undertook that payment by instalments would be introduced in 1990, when additional resources and new administrative and computer systems were expected to be available to deal with the considerable extra administrative burden that instalment payments will impose on my Department. </PARA>
<PARA>My Department has already arranged administratively for payment to be made in instalments by students whose payments were found to be in arrears because the OSC liability had only recently come to my Department's notice. Most of these students are temporary residents or their dependants. These students have been permitted to pay the arrears by instalments, but have been required to pay the OSC for a course taken in 1989 in one payment. </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, it appears that only OSC liabilities in arrears can be paid by instalments under administrative arrangements. The Attorney-General's Department advises that, because of the particular wording of the relevant provisions in the OSC legislation, current OSC liabilities cannot be discharged by instalments. The legislation must therefore be amended if payment by instalments is to be permitted. </PARA>
<PARA>By the time that advice was received, it was too late to have the appropriate legislative amendments drafted and passed by both Houses of Parliament in the 1989 Budget sittings. I therefore propose to have a Bill prepared for introduction to the Parliament in the Autumn sittings. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will amend the OSC legislation to permit the OSC for a full academic year to be paid in 2 instalments, one instalment to be payable for each semester in the academic year. </PARA>

<PARA> The final Bill before us, the seventh Bill, is the University of Canberra Bill 1989. Following the White Paper on higher education of July 1988 it was clear that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) was intent to effect many amalgamations in institutions around Australia. One was here in Canberra. In December last year he introduced a Bill to amalgamate the Australian National University (ANU) with the Canberra College of Advanced Education (CCAE) and the Canberra Institute of the Arts, the three higher educational institutions in this city. In December this was opposed, not least by myself, by the Opposition and the Australian Democrats, so the legislation did not see any progress. </PARA>
<PARA> Shortly thereafter the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly was formed, and one of its first acts was to set up an inquiry into higher education in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). Amongst other things, the inquiry reached three conclusions. Firstly, it agreed with the Opposition and the Democrats that there should be no amalgamation of institutions. Secondly, it agreed with the proposal that a number of us had been making-that the Canberra College of Advanced Education should become the University of Canberra. Thirdly, it recommended that the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly itself should enact the legislation to set up that university. Clearly Mr Dawkins has been defeated in his earlier proposal and has agreed to the first two of these three conclusions, and so we have the Bill that is before us now. The amalgamation is over in Canberra and the Canberra College will become the University of Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> This has the full support of the Opposition. Indeed, we have called for it for many months now. The ANU will remain uniquely undisturbed as the national university in Australia and the University of Canberra will be equivalent to universities in the States which are set up by State legislation. From next month the University of Canberra will have a particular responsibility to serve the people of the city of Canberra and the surrounding region, including parts of New South Wales. The Opposition not only supports the Bill but will, on coming to government, enable a transition whereby the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly will be enabled to pass legislation of its own making that will responsibly maintain continuity with the Bill before us, but such that the legislation will be Australian Capital Territory legislation on a similar basis to other higher education institution legislation in the States. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few minutes that remain to me let me make a few observations about this Bill. Firstly, the sponsorship by Monash University is welcome. I am reassured that there will be genuine and constructive input, and not a censorious or authoritarian approach, from the representatives of Monash in the upgrading of aspects of the new University of Canberra. However, I am not convinced that the partnership between Monash and the University of Canberra should run merely for three years. Rather, it is sensible to envisage a period of seven years. I say this chiefly to deny that three years should be the general standard around Australia for sponsorships of this kind. Currently sponsorships are operating or being explored in the Northern Territory, Queensland and Victoria. To me seven years would seem to be a much more likely standard when moving into the doctor of philosophy programs and establishing research infrastructure. I am conscious that the University of Canberra has already moved a considerable way down this path and is in a relatively strong position. So some period between three and seven years may be appropriate in this case. I am a great supporter of the achievements of the Canberra College of Advanced Education. I was one of those who first called for it to become the University of Canberra. I am totally confident that with the sponsorship of Monash it will soon make a transition to being one of the great universities in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> My second observation is that the Opposition, on its initial reading of the first draft of the legislation, urged amendments. I am happy to say that the Minister agreed to our suggestions. One was to increase from two to three the number of Council members nominated by the ACT Minister in circumstances that are now outlined in the Bill as passed by the House of Representatives. A second was to clarify the qualification requirements of members of the Council. I would call those the Senator Peter Baume amendments because they were inspired by his reflections on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Council qualifications and were seen by us to be as much demanded of any such University of Canberra Council members as of ATSIC Council members. The Minister agreed to the amendments and they are in the Bill as presented to the Senate. What I was most concerned about in the former of the two amendments was to maintain the principle that a clear majority of Council members were neither in the employ of the university nor students of the university; therefore, outside members could more objectively be in the majority on the Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The urgency of the legislation is keenly felt by the Opposition. We will not move any subsequent amendments in order to ensure that there is no possible barrier to this legislation being passed over the next 24 hours and the University of Canberra beginning from 1 January 1990. Accordingly, I am not taking up the luxury of any further amendments, such as our strong endorsement of the principle of voluntary student unionism which was an amendment moved in the House of Representatives by my colleagues. Every Opposition member supports that principle. If conditions were otherwise we would move an amendment in the Senate. The reason for my not doing so at the committee stage is only to ensure that the university begins on 1 January next year. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by referring again to my second reading amendment which I moved on behalf of the Opposition. Whilst the Opposition supports all seven Bills before us, it does not commend the Minister, Mr Dawkins, and the Hawke Labor Government because of their mismanagement of education not only in higher education but also in schools and TAFE institutions. The only remedy, next March or May, will be the election of a Liberal-National party government to implement the policies which will be for the good of all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA> We are in a difficult situation with only half an hour in which to consider the legislation. I hope that the Opposition will give me the reciprocal right, as we donated to the Opposition, of additional time in which to debate the entire number of Bills before us. I do not intend to deal with the issues which I will pick up at the committee stage. But I will comment on each of the Bills and look at some of their specific aspects relating to education in the 1990s. I would like to hone in on one point in the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2); that is, adult literacy. At this stage I do not want to make too many comments about the structure of the allocations from the Commonwealth Government. It is an unfortunate fact of life that we in Australia spend a great deal of our time criticising the people who are doing the work in our schools. Garth Boomer, when speaking about our literacy standards, made the following statement in 1987, which I totally endorse:</PARA>
<PARA>Credit must go to our teachers who kept on educating with precious little community praise and often in the face of uninformed, unfair and mischievous attacks from sections of the media. </PARA>
<PARA>I add to that: quite a number of politicians. We have had-and this has gone on for a number of years-the most uninformed attack on teachers and their ability to deal with a whole range of matters in our schools. </PARA>

I remember on one occasion my Leader being asked whether we were upset by the very large number of ex-teachers in the Parliament. Her comment bears repeating. She said, `We're not worried about the number of ex-teachers in the Parliament; what we are worried about is the large number of ex-learners'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Literacy was highlighted in the last couple of weeks by a number of international experts visiting Australia for a conference on literacy. Having looked at the very large number of education systems existing throughout the world, they made a judgment that Australian teachers were the best qualified and the most adept at taking up new initiatives and putting them into practice in a practical way in the classroom structure. That was indeed praise for the people who are doing the work. We have had this extraordinary welter of uninformed criticism of the people at the workface. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has been doing remarkably well in this area. Our literacy rate is very high, particularly our adult literacy rate. A large number of people in our community are assisting in teaching those adults who do not have the capacity to operate in a functionally literate way within our community. They are doing it not in a paid capacity but by their thousands in an unpaid capacity. They are assisting those people back into the work force and back into productive life. Many people engage in those types of educational activities. There are many in the classroom to whom hardly any attention is paid when the door closes. There are many outside the classroom who help on a one-to-one basis in the promotion of literacy within our community, who never receive any thanks and who, at the end of the day, only ever receive carping criticism of the most uninformed kind from a whole series of self-appointed critics who have never in fact darkened the classroom door or who, when they were probably last there, managed to fail their English exams in any event. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Bill that we have before us is the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989. I want to point to a very real problem that I do not think has been alluded to by many people in the debates that have gone around concerning the higher education contribution scheme. One would not have gathered from Senator Teague's contribution that the Opposition actually voted for that scheme, and that that is in fact why it is in place. Also one would not have gathered that the Australian Labor Party, coming into office with a pledge never to introduce such a scheme, managed to do precisely the opposite and put in place a tax on students, which it had pledged not to do. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of what will actually happen to that tax, I would like honourable senators to consider for a moment the actual ongoing context with regard to it. I take an example. This year, students earning less than $22,000 were not required to make any repayments towards their debt. Those earning between $22,000 and $25,000 paid 1 per cent towards repayment on their debt. Those earning between $25,000 and $35,000 paid 2 per cent and those earning $35,000 paid 3 per cent. As an example, let us take an economics graduate with an income of $23,000 who would, in his or her first year of employment, be required to make a payment of $230 towards the total tax liability which, for a three-year course, is likely to be about $5,500. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, as honourable senators know, having passed the legislation, those outstanding debts will be adjusted by an index calculated to match real terms. In dollar value, a total debt which is eventually repaid will be larger than the initial debt. That is a circumstance that I think many Australians are very familiar with from taking out a home loan, whereby their repayments are less than the interest that is in fact added to their debt each month. </PARA>
<PARA> Those students in the upper income brackets, who presumably endear themselves to the Australian Labor Party, will end up paying off their higher education contribution scheme debt very rapidly indeed. Those who are even more wealthy and who can afford the up-front fees will in fact get a discount. As an example, let us take those people on a lower income who are not able to afford those types of exercises. Firstly, in the example of the economics student, his or her first year's repayment of $230 will not, in fact, match the real increase in debt. For example, if we used a 7.5 per cent inflator, we would end up with $412.50 as the amount that the person would have to repay for that particular year. I think that honourable senators will realise, having spoken to so many--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, for coming to my rescue. I have raised a point that has been raised by a large number of organisations. I refer to the example that has been raised by those organisations supporting nurses in this country. Of course, nurse education is now in higher education institutions. In looking at the type of repayments for nurses, one will also find a similar situation, whereby the debt that they incur will in fact increase more each year than the amount they will be repaying. So, they will be in a recurring increasing debt context. That may seem fine to Senator Walsh-I did not pick up his interjections-but I am quite sure that to those people who have to pay that debt, and pay it continually, it is not fine. In fact, it will be in the type of context that former Senator Ryan, when she was the Minister in charge of education, pointed to as quite clearly disadvantaging those people on low incomes who would normally be expected to be supporters of the Australian Labor Party, when they remembered their origins.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point I want to raise is exemptions for postgraduate students. This is an extremely difficult situation because the Government issued only 19,000 exemptions for all postgraduate students last year. We know that many institutions have made a variety of arrangements which make the situation very difficult, and I will give some examples. Many institutions have claimed exemptions for staff who are undertaking postgraduate studies. I am not decrying that and saying they should not do it, but it leaves out a large number of people. Typical students who hardly ever complete their postgraduate studies at the end of an academic year-they tend to do so throughout an academic year-also take away a large percentage of the useful, available exemptions. </PARA>
<PARA> Many institutions have made a policy decision not to provide any exemptions for those people undertaking masters degrees by course-work. Many parttime students have found that this is the only means by which they are able to undertake masters degrees. There are so many anomalies creeping into this area of exemptions that I hope the Government has at least some intention of addressing these problems, and addressing them in a real and concrete way by allowing those people undertaking postgraduate studies in this country to be exempt from that charge. It makes eminent sense. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer the Government-if it needs any argument with regard to this matter-to the last years of the Fraser Government when the conservatives attempted to introduce fees for second and higher degrees. The Australian Labor Party, in opposition at that time, argued violently against this on the grounds that it is an absurd proposition that, having paid out $14,000 to $15,000 for a graduate-in today's terms it is well over $30,000-the Government was then quite happy to say, `We are going to cut those people out; we are not going to support them going on to second and higher degrees'. At that time the Labor Party saw the absurdity of the situation but, unfortunately, at this time sees that it might be a useful device to ingratiate itself with the rich and thick in this society. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to turn now to the third of the seven Bills before us, that is, the Student Assistance Amendment Bill (No. 2). The Australian Democrats have very strongly supported the provision of assistance to students. I listened with a degree of admiration to Senator Teague, who was able to turn a policy which will gut student assistance into a paeon of praise and suggest that somehow or other that policy would help students. What Senator Teague does not seem to be aware of is that within the last 18 months, as far as the operation of the student assistance scheme is concerned, there is no fat left. There are not any rorts going on. What is happening in terms of the squeeze being put on student assistance is that people who should be assisted are being forced out, and are not getting the assistance they are due. This Australian Labor Party Government cut out $60m in one hit alone from the student assistance scheme, yet the Opposition says it will be able to clean out another $30m. For Senator Teague's information, there is not $30m available. He intends to take $30m from those people who do not have it and force them out of higher education. Under the Opposition policies we are well on the way to what I have just mentioned-a policy for the rich and the thick. </PARA>
<PARA> In this country we need a reasonable student assistance scheme. We need everybody who has the ability and the capacity to undertake higher education to be provided with that opportunity. The reason for that is very simple and it should appeal to Senator Walsh. Every economic study that has been undertaken, both in Australia and especially in the United States of America, has come to one inescapable, fundamental conclusion: a dollar invested in higher education is easily the best investment that can be made in any area within an industrialised, advanced, technological society. There is now no debate about that fact. A dollar put into higher education is a better investment than a dollar put into mining, digging up or putting down yet another railway line, chopping down yet another rainforest or undertaking any other type of activity that is said to be development. </PARA>
<PARA> One would have thought that we might have learnt merely by looking at the example of those countries that have invested in the intelligence, imagination and creativity of their own people. In Australia we have this rather quaint notion that we will be able to achieve Senator Button's utopia of a technologically advanced society by, somehow or other, not investing in our own people. A way of achieving that is to import everybody with skills and not bother with our own citizens. That is the only way to overcome the problem. If we are to have our own citizens employed in this utopia set out by Senator Button in his various plans for development, we will actually have to pay. There is no other way. We will have to put money into higher education and we will have to put money towards funding those people who have the capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> Strange as it may seem to the Government and to the Opposition, there is not yet any study that I know of which suggests that intelligence is distributed in exactly the same manner as income. In fact, my understanding is that they are not even casually related. Intelligence, in fact, is quite independent of parental income. It is a pity that we manage to impose upon the data a very strong correlation between the two. How do we manage that? We do so by saying that we will provide funds for the benefit of those with income and wealth and that we will penalise those with intelligence but without income and wealth. We can do that but we will not be developing in any reasonable, rational and economic way if we continue down that track. As Senator Haines has said on a number of occasions recently in speeches to various groups, by putting that amount of money into higher education, we will not even be meeting the level of investment that goes into those countries which we seek to emulate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walsh invites me to have a look at West Germany. The fascinating thing about Senator Walsh is that the only figures on education he ever looks at are those which are paid out by the centralised body. He has never looked at the States in Germany. He has never looked at the input from private industry in Germany or Japan. Those countries spend a larger proportion of gross domestic product on education than we do. Senator Walsh cannot controvert that because he knows it to be true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is an extraordinary circumstance. The Government floats around figures with regard to the Budget but, of course, it never floats around figures with regard to the way the country dedicates itself to its educational task. Australia has not done that. Australian private industry expects every dollar to come from the public sector. It never believes that the private sector has to put its hand into its pocket. It believes that it has a god-given right to pick up a graduate for nothing. It says to the taxpayer, `Go out there and educate this person through to the end of a law degree and then I, the private sector, will take that person and use that person to create a profit for my firm without any responsibility and without contributing a dollar on my part'. In fact, this Government at one stage actually toyed with the idea of putting a levy on the private sector for educational purposes. It only toyed with it; it did not do it. That is the type of government we have, a so-called Labor government that will not bite the bullet on those types of necessary reforms so that the private sector will pay its fair share. In West Germany, which Senator Walsh invites me to discuss, and in Japan, which he does not invite me to discuss, we know that the private sector pays its fair share. That is the difference. Those countries see education as being necessary. In this country, very few do. Unfortunately, the circumstances are such that we are unable to meet the expectations and the necessary elements with regard to our citizens' educational future. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make only one comment on Senator Teague's contribution to the discussion of the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Bill, that is, he obviously has not seen what has gone on in the last few weeks in New South Wales with regard to technical and further education (TAFE) institutions. The New South Wales Liberal Government has, in fact, cut the TAFE exemption quotas from 140,000 to 70,000. I found it extraordinary that the Minister could wave around a piece of paper purporting to be a policy with regard to TAFE, knowing that the only Liberal State Government in this country has just cut in half the exemption quotas for TAFE. That, to my mind, really took the cake this evening. I do not feel that I need to say any more about that circumstance. The circumstances are such that the Liberal Party of Australia, with regard to its policy, has condemned itself by its own words. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the Australian Labor Party's policy in this area has also been appalling. In fact, it has not provided and, in this Bill, still is intent on not providing a range of educational opportunities that should be available to those people who wish to undertake TAFE studies. Again, I find this odd, given the Labor Party's professed interest in the type of people who might go to TAFE colleges. We know that a very large number of those people, for want, for example, of places in TAFE colleges, have had to go to private business colleges. In the committee stage, I want to raise some items with regard to that. </PARA>
<PARA> Over 12 months ago we had a debate here on precisely this item. It was interesting that the Australian Labor Party was trying to cut out support to those business colleges. When I pointed out that the vast majority of people in private business colleges are women, that the overwhelming majority are from state schools, and that the overwhelming majority have not completed any years of formal education-if they had, of course, they would have been supported 100 per cent by the state-Dawkins, to his credit, finally backed off. </PARA>

I think it is interesting that the Labor Party again has not seen that the types of people its educational policies are affecting are those who might normally be said to be its supporters. Having so much lost touch with its own base, it is quite happy to devastate the educational opportunities of those young women from state schools and working class backgrounds who are completely unable to find a place in TAFE for secretarial studies and who have to pay sums that they cannot afford to get some chance for a job within the economy of this so-called lucky country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to turn now to the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill. Here again, we have been battling both the Government and the Opposition on this matter. I think it is extraordinary that the merchandising mentality that has overtaken the Australian Labor Party with regard to education has probably overwhelmed all its humanitarian and other basic philosophical approaches to education and the usefulness of education as an element in our approach to other countries. Treating education, as the Government is now doing, as a purely exportable product is to ignore the human side of our very effective and efficient educational system. The export of Australian education should be used not only to enhance the quality of life in education in overseas countries but also to enhance our reputation in those countries as a friend and as a neighbour. However, as I mentioned when we had a discussion in this chamber a few days ago on the foreign affairs document on regional security, this Government, as a matter of friendship, sent a warship around the countries of South East Asia at enormous expense, and yet refused to provide educational scholarships for their poorer citizens. Those are the types of decisions and priorities this Government has. In that document it pats itself on the back about the waltzings of our warships in and out of various ports of South East Asia and sees in some way a weapon of war as our token of friendship and support. It may come as a rude shock to the Government to find that other countries, and particularly their people, do not in any way see that as a token of friendship; in fact, they see very clearly that Australia has decided that the friendship with those countries is expendable when it comes to assisting with a fundamental element that they are looking for, that is, providing top quality educational opportunities. It seems that the short term rewards for extra funds for the institutions have replaced the many, varied and often intangible long term rewards which have always been associated in this country with overseas students. I think it is a pity that this Government has decided to ditch all of those things on the pyre of its so-called economic rationality. </PARA>
<PARA> Phillip Jones in the Current Affairs Bulletin back in July this year argued-I must say that I fully agree-that not only is the Australian education system relaxed about monitoring the progress of individual visiting students, but also there is a reluctance to monitor the progress and effect of our educational relationships with the Asian and Pacific countries involved. Australia still seems in need of a policy. At present it seems to be a case of `take the money and run'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Child Support Agency was established over a year ago, its prime purpose being to collect child maintenance, to enforce maintenance orders and to ensure that payment is made to custodial parents. The purpose was to see that maintenance was made available for the support of children, as it should be, from each parent. It was expected that there would be some teething problems, as with any new organisation, and that it would take some time to settle down. Many complaints were received early on when the Agency was established about the slowness in processing payments. For some time delays of six to eight weeks were common and many were longer. What is disturbing-and this is the reason I am raising this matter tonight-is that there has been no sign of improvement in this time. In many respects, I suggest, the situation is even worse. There is a steady stream of complaints about the tardiness and inefficiency of the Child Support Agency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problem is that when payees attempt to find out from the Agency what is happening, why they are not being paid, they just cannot get anywhere. Phone calls are not returned and it is virtually impossible to talk to the same officer twice or to speak to the same officer one spoke to the last time one rang. I have seen a constituent recently whose ex-husband is paying maintenance to the Agency for his children's benefit, but the maintenance is not being passed on to his former wife. I will refer to that in more detail later. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to give some other examples. A constituent of mine last year who had to wait until January to receive moneys which had been paid to her in November had to go without that income at Christmas. One can imagine the impact that that had upon her and her children. After all, we are talking about people who are dependent on this money to run their households. The same constituent's maintenance order included a provision that the maintenance was to be adjusted each year in line with the consumer price index (CPI). When it was not indexed she inquired at the Agency about the increase that was due. It told her that she would have to calculate it herself. She had to ring the Australian Bureau of Statistics to get the CPI figures. The Child Support Agency either could not or would not calculate the figure for her. That was in October last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Only last week I had a call from a constituent who indicated that absolutely nothing has improved. Her CPI increase, which was due to take effect in the November payment of this year, has not arrived. The Child Support Agency, notwithstanding the fact that it is part of the Australian Taxation Office, has done nothing to calculate the new figure. Her ex-husband, who is paying his maintenance to the Agency, continues to receive rude and threatening letters from it alleging that he has failed to pay when in fact he has. Her ex-husband makes the payments personally at the Tax Office and has frequently had to demand a receipt for the money he has paid in. Originally he was told that the Agency did not give receipts, but he has finally managed to be able to get them, which is just as well now that he is being accused of not having paid the maintenance. If he had not insisted upon the receipts we can imagine how it would treat him now. </PARA>
<PARA> Another constituent I have seen recently formerly received her maintenance through the Collector of Maintenance but subsequently agreed or arranged to have her payments transferred to the Child Support Agency. She thought, from the publicity about what the Agency would do, that this was a reasonable course to take and the right thing to do. The father of her children mistakenly continued to send a number of cheques to the Collector of Maintenance and, fortunately, the Collector forwarded them to the Agency. The client is now battling to recover the moneys rightfully intended for the support of the child of the former marriage. In addition, the Agency is in the process of commencing automatic withholdings from the father's salary. This woman has been told that if she is lucky she will get the November payment in January. Mr President, I am keeping these stories short, but I hope that you can comprehend from what I am telling you the difficulties that many people are experiencing. How this woman is expected to manage without that income over the Christmas and school holiday period one can only imagine. </PARA>
<PARA> Another constituent who contacted me a short time ago said that the Agency had totally failed in its attempts to obtain maintenance from her ex-husband. The Agency officer she spoke to said that a summons had been served on 12 April but that there was a 28-day statutory period for her ex-husband to reply to this. That period expired in May and in August of this year she was still regularly ringing the Agency and found out, as it happened, that nothing more had been done. My office contacted the Agency and was met with a range of explanations over a period, ranging from `The court has changed its forms' and `The details of the summons have not been entered into the CSA's computer' to `The person handling the matter has not learnt the job yet, and anyway it is none of this lady's business once a summons has been served because the debt is then due to the Commonwealth'. </PARA>
<PARA> Just a few weeks ago the lady again rang my office to say that no further progress had been made even though she knew of and had advised the Agency of her ex-husband's whereabouts and his employment details. She was being forced to sell her home because she could no longer cope with the mortgage repayments when the money was not coming through to her. I am aware of many other cases, but I leave it at that for some of the anecdotes. </PARA>
<PARA> A mother of two whose ex-husband pays his maintenance to the Agency while receiving it through the Collector of Maintenance received it regularly, but while it was being paid through the Collector the ex-husband paid more than was due under the order and that surplus money was transferred to the Agency. Her ex-husband continues to meet his maintenance liability and has asked the Agency to pay the credit to his former wife for the children because he wants them to have the money; he expects them to have the money; but the Agency will not part with it. It will not say what has happened to the credit. The Agency has also claimed that this woman is receiving what it calls `out of agency' payments. She has not received such payments, she tells me, and the Agency has not been able to prove that she has. The money intended for the children and paid by the former husband is somewhere and it is not going to the woman for the benefit of the children. They certainly do not have it. </PARA>
<PARA> My office has made numerous inquiries on behalf of clients and the assistance received does not hearten me. Calls are not returned. Frequently I am told that the computers are down and that officers are `not on the floor', whatever that really means. Many officers are unwilling to identify themselves and so it becomes very difficult indeed to achieve continuity. I remind you, Mr President, that there is not an office in Canberra that people can contact. They have to go through the Sydney office which makes it very impersonal indeed. The Agency was set up in the middle of last year. I think all of us recognised that there would be a few difficulties in getting it going, but it should be functioning well by now. </PARA>
<PARA> It could be said that all I have done is give a string of anecdotes, but I have been selective in those that I have referred to, and there are many more. The fact is that although the Agency might be working in improving life in some respects, many people whose arrangements were satisfactory previously are now suffering by not receiving the money that their children need. Either there are an inadequate number of people for the work that the Agency has to undertake or those people have been inadequately trained. It is not acceptable that people should have to wait six weeks for money which has been paid by a father for the support of his children. </PARA>
<PARA> I also raise this because I do not get the same sorts of complaints and the same problems being raised with respect to other Commonwealth agencies in Canberra. In this case, there are no means of appeal, whereas there are forms of appeal with respect to other agencies. I find other agencies here helpful, but people who have difficulties getting through to the Child Support Agency have nowhere else to go. I neglected to show this letter to the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh), who is at the table, but I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the letter written to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) by the last woman I referred to setting out the story which really explains it quite well. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Sir</PARA>
<PARA>I seek your assistance in having a serious problem rectified. </PARA>
<PARA>Following my divorce from .............. a maintenance order was made by the Family Court for my children ............ and ............ (ref: C.128 of 1984). The order was for $90 per week and it specified that collection of payment would be the responsibility of the office of the Collector of Maintenance in the Magistrates Court. ........ turned 18 in August 1987 but she was still a full time student and continued to pay $90 per week until June 1988. The Collector of Maintenance informed me by letter (copy attached) that, because I should not have been paid for ........ after she turned 18, they would recover the overpayment by not paying for .......... The decision was apparently made after consultation with my ex-husband, ......... This change occurred in July 1988 when I was still providing some support for ......... who had commenced an APS Traineeship. I received $60 per week for the period 14.6.88 to 12.7.88, then $30 per week as from 20.7.88 although ....... did not turn 18 until April 1989, when the order would have varied for her automatically. I did not pursue the matter because ........ commenced full-time employment after her year as a trainee, as a permanent officer in the Australian Taxation Office about July 1988, nearly 10 months before she turned 18. This, as I have already stated, was not an officially approved variation to the maintenance order as no application was made to the Court to have the order varied. </PARA>
<PARA>Payments (at $30 per week) ceased from the Collector of Maintenance on 15.11.88 when the Child Support Agency took over payment of maintenance. I was informed (by way of a copy of a letter sent to ......... that there was a credit of over $400 in his account (ref: J97 Office of the Collector of Maintenance), I have misplaced my copy of this letter. </PARA>
<PARA>..... commenced payments to the Child Support Agency by way of direct transfer from his salary as soon as he was requested to do so after collection was taken over in November 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>I have made numerous inquiries, both to the Hotline of Child Support (008 112442) and the office in Canberra, but I have been unable to gain satisfaction from either of these sources regarding the correct amount of payments and, in particular, what happened to the credit which was transferred from the Collector of Maintenance. I would have expected that any surplus remaining after his current commitment, would have been returned to .......... as he is apparently paying the amount requested by the Child Support Agency on a regular basis. However, you will see from information I will give later in this letter, that the money should be paid to me. </PARA>
<PARA> The first payment I received from the Child Support Agency was credited to my savings account with the Commonwealth Bank, the same account to which Family Allowance is paid for I have received the following payments:</PARA>
<PARA>$85.71...04/01/89</PARA>

<PARA>$130.45...05/07/89</PARA>
<PARA>$130.45...02/08/89</PARA>
<PARA>I am concerned about the following matters and I seek your assistance to have them clarified. </PARA>
<PARA>Letters from the Department of Social Security (ref no. 201 232 919 L) have stated that I have received direct payments (out-of-agency payments) as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 260.89 (see letter 27/02/89)</PARA>
<PARA> 130.43 (see letter 01/05/89)</PARA>
<PARA> 391.32</PARA>
<PARA>I do not have a letter relating to the payment of $260.89 on 05/04/89, but this payment was presumably also calculated on the basis that I had received a `direct payment' of about $130 for March. I would like to know the total amount I have been presumed to have received in `direct payments', and I would be even more interested to know who made the payments and to what account. I have certainly not received them. ........... Was under the impression that I had. Perhaps this is an accounting practice which allows the Child Support Agency's books to `balance' or is it a way of overcoming the fact that the Court Order was illegally altered? No variation of the order was, to my knowledge, approved and I did not know that the clerical staff at the Office of the Collector of Maintenance were in a position to alter the amount of maintenance without the consent of the Court. It would appear that ........... was willing to continue to pay for .......... after her 18th birthday because he was aware that she was not yet in full-time employment and the money I received from him was being passed on to her. </PARA>
<PARA>I have discussed these matters at length by phone with officers of the Child Support Agency and I can only say that I have been thoroughly dissatisfied with the explanations. I also discussed the matter with .......... and he was equally frustrated. It was suggested that I could elect not to take advantage of the Child Support services and arrange payment of maintenance directly from .......... This would possibly overcome some of their problems, but I am reluctant to take such a step until I can at least receive some answers to my questions. </PARA>
<PARA>Helene turned 18 on 22 April 1989 so it would seem that time has allowed one problem to be overcome. However, it still does not provide an answer to the matters concerning. </PARA>
<PARA> 1. The `direct payments' which were supposed to have been made to me;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The whereabouts of the credit balance transferred from the Office of the Collector of Maintenance in November;</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The legality of the action taken by that office in June 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>Although I appreciate that some minor problems could have reasonably occurred when collection of maintenance moneys was taken over by another agency, I cannot accept that it has been impossible to have the problems sorted out after a period of over 9 months. As a result of the change-over I am worse off by $394.90 partly because money is now paid to me on a monthly basis after is collected from . At $30 per week, I would have received $1,560 for the financial year July 1988 to June 1989. In fact, I received $360 from the office of the Collector of Maintenance and $815.10 from the Child Support Agency-a total of $1,175.10 which is $384.90 short of the amount I should have received for ......... only. </PARA>
<PARA>The Office of the Collector of Maintenance made regular fortnightly payments direct to me. .......... would have been paying money to that office in the same way that he does now to the Child Support Agency. There were never any delays with payment and the only hiccup occurred in July 1987 when the amount was suddenly reduced from $90 to $30 per week. </PARA>
<PARA>You will appreciate that the financial demands of supporting children and providing a home for them have increased, partly as a result of the current economic situation. My mortgage repayments have increased dramatically over the past months and I am trying to continue to satisfy the children's needs under more difficult circumstances. There has been a recent increase in the amount which I receive by way of family allowance for .......... and .......... has endeavoured to provide financial assistance to .......... and .......... when he is able. </PARA>
<PARA>I have discussed the contents of this letter with ..... and he told me that he did not wish to have the credit balance from the Collector of Maintenance returned to him. He has discussed this with the Child Support Agency and he was under the impression that the money had been paid to me. It had been suggested to him that if he were prepared to sign a letter of authority, the money could be directed to me by way of a gift or out-of-agency payment. </PARA>
<PARA>When I last contacted ......., he said that he would like the money to be paid either to me or direct to ....... to offset any of her future needs if he should, for any reason, be unable to continue to provide the amount of support which he now gives. </PARA>
<PARA>I would expect that the sum of money involved should also have accrued some interest whilst being held by the Child Support Agency-at least equivalent to what it would have accrued had it been paid to me or ....... 9 months ago. </PARA>
<PARA>I would appreciate your assistance in having these matters resolved as soon as possible. </PARA>

<PARA> The document read as follows</PARA>
<PARA>6 November, 1989</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir</PARA>
<PARA> Further to my conversation with an officer of your Department on 2 November, 1989, (on 008 11 2442 at 3.45 p.m.), I am enclosing copies of correspondence which I forwarded to the Minister for Social Security on 29.8.89. I am also enclosing a copy of the reply I received. (Letter dated 26 Sept., 1989). </PARA>
<PARA> I was assured by the person to whom I spoke on 2 November that this matter could probably be sorted out quite quickly by persons in your office. I certainly hope that this is the case as you will notice that it took the office of the Minister for Social Security almost a month to acknowledge my letter and I have still not received a proper reply after a further six weeks.</PARA>
<PARA> The only change which has been made since I wrote to the Minister for Social Security is that the amount of maintenance which I had been receiving from the Child Support Agency, through the Department of Social Security has been halved as from 1.11.89. I was informed of this fact by letter from the Department of Social Security. (See enclosed copy of the letter dated 30 October, 1989). A few days after I received this letter, I received another identical letter. You will see that there was no reference made to an ``out-of-agency'' payment although such a reference had been made in some of the previous correspondence. </PARA>
<PARA> From information which I was given by your office when I phoned on 2 November, it would appear that this elusive ``out-of-agency'' payment has been responsible for the reduction. I can only repeat that at no time since the Child Support Agency took over the function of collection of maintenance have I ever received a payment for maintenance other than that which was credited to my account in the Commonwealth Bank by the Department of Social Security. Details of these payments are given on page 2 of my letter to the Minister for Social Security 29 August, 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Whereas I appreciate that your office can only act upon information received, and you have told me that the last correspondence you have on record is dated 1.12.88, it is difficult for me to accept that it would take so long (twelve months) for my case to be sorted out. I first rang the Hotline number in late 1988, shortly after I received advice that the Taxation Department would be taking over the collection of maintenance. It would appear that there is no record of this call, or the advice given to me at that time. Nor does it appear that there is any record of any other conversations which I had with people answering the Hotline or those answering my calls to the office in Canberra. I have spoken on a number of occasions to a ......... in the Canberra office. My most recent call would have been some time before I decided to write to the Minister for Social Security. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some remarks this evening about the case of Mr Alex Watson, the Australian Olympic athlete who, I believe, has been shabbily treated by the sports authorities in this country and who, I believe, deserves a better go from both the sports authorities and sports Ministers in this country. Mr Watson is not only an outstanding Australian athlete but also a fine young man who has been denied natural justice and has not been represented adequately by those sporting bodies and organisations in Australia who have the primary obligation to do so and whose primary obligation, indeed, should be to safeguard the interests of Australian athletes rather than to serve any other cause, including the promotion of national Olympic bids or the individual ambitions of sports administrators for higher and better activities of higher and better positions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Watson was born in 1957. He is a young athlete. He has an outstanding academic record including a degree from the University of Technology in Sydney. He spent part of his scholarship time at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas. He has always been an outstanding sportsman excelling in rugby, cross-country running and basketball. He is perhaps best known as a participant in the sport of the modern pentathlon. Between 1982 and 1988 he has always been ranked in the world top 16 and, indeed, in 1986 in the world top 10. He has been placed frequently in the one-day champion of champions competition. In fact, in 1982 and 1986 he finished with a very high ranking in those competitions. He has been actively involved in sports promotional activities on a professional basis for a large number of years and has been an active campaigner against the use of drugs in sport. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts of the particular incidents which brought Mr Watson to a prominence which he would not have sought occurred on 19 September 1988 during the pentathlon competition in the Seoul Olympic Games and in particular on that day when the fencing competition occurred. As a result of random drug testing, Mr Watson was found to have a particular prescribed level of caffeine in his system. He has asserted from the very first day that during the events of the pentathlon competition his total consumption of caffeine derived from taking approximately 14 cups of coffee and a couple of cans of Coca-Cola on that particular day. I should add that there has never been any prohibition on the drinking of coffee or coca cola at the Olympic games and, indeed, those substances are provided to athletes. At no stage has Mr Watson ever qualified or resiled from that particular statement. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the random testing, it was found that he had a concentration of 14 milligrams of caffeine per litre in his system. It is perhaps to be noted that the official limit set by the International Olympic Committee for the Seoul Olympic Games was 12 milligrams. It is interesting that in Los Angeles four years earlier that limit had been 15 milligrams. So within the international Olympic community there has been a variation of the prescribed limits as far as caffeine is concerned. It is not in dispute, and I do not put it into dispute, that the concentration in his system was found to be greater than that actually prescribed in the rules set down for the conduct of the Olympic Games in that year. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Watson's contention is that he reached that concentration only by drinking coffee and Coca-Cola and that the tests failed adequately to take this into account. The first question-in fact perhaps the only question-which arises in that respect is whether that story is believable. The scientific evidence is overwhelming that that is the case. I want to refer to some of that scientific information. Professor Ted Maslen, the head of the Crystallography Centre at the University of Western Australia and one of the world's most experienced and respected authorities on caffeine and on sports medicine, indicated in a letter addressed to the National Secretary of the Australian Modern Pentathlon Union in October 1988 his belief that Watson's story was credible. He said, for instance, in that letter:</PARA>
<PARA> I am therefore convinced that a flaw in the caffeine concentration test is the most reasonable explanation for what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA>He indicated his belief that the International Olympic Committee's failure to issue additional data on Watson's urine analysis strongly suggested that it did not have the information which was necessary to make the sort of judgments which it did. Indeed, in a further paper of Professor Maslen's dated 10 November 1988 he makes the point:</PARA>
<PARA>Because of this-</PARA>
<PARA>and here he is referring to the concentration of caffeine which occurs as a result of dehydration in athletes-</PARA>
<PARA>care is required in assessing caffeine intake from the unmetabolized residue in the urine of dehydrated athletes. In the absence of information on the state of the urine an analyst might well overestimate that intake by a factor of ten. Large errors could occur in particular cases. </PARA>
<PARA>In a letter which Professor Maslen was good enough to send to me he attached a letter dated 28 November 1988 which he had sent to the Drug Control and Teaching Centre at King's College London in which he draws attention to the fact that he has had experience for more than 30 years with distance running and other athletic endurance events. He says in that letter:</PARA>
<PARA> Anomalous urine is excreted from time to time by athletes dehydrated by endurance events other than running. </PARA>
<PARA>Again that simply goes to demonstrate the plausibility of Watson's story about that particular cause of the concentration of caffeine in his system which was found. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Maslen is not alone. Dr Ken Donald, Queensland's Deputy Director-General of Health and Medical Services and the author of a book on drugs in sport called The Doping Game, was also the chairman of the drug testing committee for the Brisbane Commonwealth Games. He has made similar comments. For example, in the 25 November 1988 issue of the Observer Fortnightly it is reported:</PARA>
<PARA>Alex Watson may have been innocent of caffeine doping. He may have been caught by a rule which has no valid scientific basis. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the view of Dr Ken Donald . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to quote Dr Donald as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> The level that has been set for caffeine has not been backed up by properly conducted scientific experimentation which has been published and which is freely available for the community and the courts to look at. </PARA>
<PARA>So there I have a second authority to draw on. Professor Vincent Marks of the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Surrey makes this point in a letter dated 27 April 1989:</PARA>
<PARA>I therefore question without very much more information the propriety of assuming that caffeine in the urine at a concentration of 14.2 micrograms per millilitre (i.e. 14.2 micrograms a litre) is indicative of deliberate caffeine overdosage with a view to cheating at sport. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a third authority that I could draw on. Fourthly, Professor Burkett, the Head of the Department of Pharmacology at Flinders University, who is a world authority on caffeine concentration through his nine years of research, believes that the Olympics tests are flawed in not accounting for individual variations in caffeine metabolism and has indicated that he believes it to be perfectly possible for an athlete in such conditions-and they are the conditions known about Watson's state of health and dehydration after the fencing event at the time at which testing took place-to reach such a concentration of the amount of caffeine which has actually been established in this case. I also draw attention to the comments of another distinguished scientist from the Flinders Medical Centre, Dr J. D. Miners, Senior Lecturer in Clinical Pharmacology. In a letter of 15 November 1988, he made precisely the same comment. At the end of a detailed paper, he writes:</PARA>
<PARA>I wish to reiterate my misgivings about the use of urinary caffeine concentration by Sports Authorities. Many factors influence the concentration of caffeine in urine and, in general, the urinary caffeine concentration is a very poor index of caffeine dose. </PARA>
<PARA>I could go on in some considerable detail with other comments from scientific authorities. But perhaps I should make a final point by referring to the interim report of the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts entitled Drugs in Sport. At page 117 the Committee says:</PARA>
<PARA>Evidence was received by the Committee arguing that the caffeine level recorded by Mr Alex Watson at the Seoul Games of 14.25 micrograms/ml could have been reached by the regular consumption of coffee during the day's competition. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate Committee in no way qualifies or disputes that as a statement of the scientifically possible situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The question is not whether in fact that is exactly what occurred on that particular day; the question is whether in fact Watson's story is believable. It is credible on the basis, I believe, of the scientific evidence which one can adduce. Under those circumstances, it seems to me that the benefit of the doubt must go to Mr Watson in exactly the same way as the benefit of the doubt should always go to those who have an accusation made against them. In these matters the burden of proof does not lie on them to prove their innocence but upon the prosecuting or accusatory authorities to make out their case. </PARA>
<PARA> In the first instance, there is clear scientific evidence which says that Watson's story is believable. Secondly, there is the issue of Watson's own character. It is well established that over many years he has worked for the promotion of sport in Australia and for the campaign against the use and misuse of drugs in sport and, as such, his character ought to be weighed in the balance. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, and perhaps of almost equal weight in this matter, is the support which he has received consistently from a Mr Willy Grut, who is the most senior official of the International Pentathlon Union and has been responsible basically for the international control and supervision of the sport. Mr Grut has consistently indicated his support for and belief in Alex Watson and his story and claims. He has never wavered in that commitment. I believe that somebody of that international eminence, who is dedicated and committed to his sport, should be taken very seriously. Mr Grut is the honorary secretary of the UIPMB, which is the primary body responsible for the international control of pentathlon events, and that factor should not be ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> Next there is the fact that the Australian Olympic Federation has become quite ambivalent on this matter. On 11 May 1989 the Federation put out a press statement dealing with the appeal that Watson had made to the AOF Executive Board. The Board, which was considering imposing a life ban on Mr Watson as a result of his suspension from the Games in Seoul, looked at the various matters and decided that it would not impose a life ban on him. In fact, it imposed a ban on him for, I think, only two years. It was apparent that the Committee had decided that there were certain factors which it should take into account, and indeed Mr Watson is eligible for selection for the 1992 Barcelona Games. The fact that a life ban is reduced to a ban of two years must raise in the minds of people the clear spectre of the Australian Olympic Federation not being prepared to back its original judgment in this matter, believing that other factors have come into play and that a two-year ban is the correct penalty to be imposed. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that Alex Watson has not had natural justice in this matter. It is perhaps unusual to think about sportsmen and participants being entitled to the protection of the courts and of the legal systems to secure natural justice, so I have been through and looked at cases where sporting matters have come before the courts of law. I have looked at the case of Robert Gray and the Canadian Track and Field Association, heard in the Supreme Court of Ontario in 1986; the case of Jeffrey Michels and the United States Olympic Committee, heard in the Seventh Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals in 1984; the case of Sandra Gasser against various United Kingdom sporting authorities, heard in the High Court of Justice Chancery Division in 1988; and, perhaps most immediately on this question, the case of Paul Quirke and the Bord Luthchleas Heireann, which is the national body responsible for sport in the Republic of Ireland, heard in the High Court in Ireland before Mr Justice Barr in March 1988. His Honour in that case, reviewing the rights of persons to be heard, said, and I quote from the judgment:</PARA>
<PARA> The second factor which is crucial to this case is that it is fundamental to the concept of natural justice that no man shall be condemned unheard. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to deal with a suspension imposed on an athlete by the Irish Board, which was a substantial penalty for an alleged failure to comply with the rules of that body, but held that the body had not given the person concerned the opportunity to speak adequately in his own defence and therefore ordered, by judicial authority, that the suspension be lifted. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Watson has sought to have his case heard by an international sporting appeals body-namely, the International Court of Arbitration for Sport based in Switzerland. He made this application which was determined in September this year. The International Court of Arbitration for Sport simply declined to hear Mr Watson, without giving any reasons for its decision. I believe it is quite outrageous that a court which does not agree to hear a person, particularly when such an arbitral tribunal has been set up for the purpose of listening to these matters, makes a decision that it will not hear the person concerned and does so without giving any reasons why that should be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> It is surprising that, despite all of the vicissitudes which Mr Watson has had to endure, he nevertheless continues to have an unqualified dedication to the promotion of this sport in Australia. He is now the principal person in Australia responsible for organising the 1991 Ladies World Titles in the pentathlon competition and the 1990 Australian Cup series. Indeed, he is organising Australian Institute of Sport camps for elite athletes. I have copies of correspondence here from Watson to the Sports Development Officer of the Australian Sports Commission and correspondence between him and the Manager of the New South Wales Academy of Sport for which Mr Watson is responsible for booking facilities and for organising competitions which are to take place, and correspondence in which Mr Watson is in communication with the Australian Institute of Sport, which is happy to give him assistance with the organisation of the international competitions in 1990 and 1991 to which I have referred. There is no doubt that Australian sporting authorities, whether they be the Institute, people in New South Wales or people in the Sports Commission, are perfectly happy to deal with him and perfectly prepared to accept his bona fides. </PARA>
<PARA> This case has come to the attention of editorial writers. The Sydney Morning Herald editorial of 27 September 1988 describes this case as one which:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . goes to the heart of what the International Olympic Committee is supposed to be about. </PARA>
<PARA>The editorial then discusses the lack of support given by Australian sporting authorities to Mr Watson. In relation to accusations that have been made it states:</PARA>
<PARA>Because of this the first reaction of the Australian representatives on the IOC . . . has been disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, I echo those sentiments. The editorial concludes:</PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the accusations-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the accusations that Mr Watson is not getting a fair hearing-</PARA>
<PARA>have the backing of Mr Willy Grut, the secretary-general of the international body that controls pentathlon sport, and an extremely credible official, gives added weight to the need for the IOC to be punctilious about clearing the matter up. This can be done by treating the accusations seriously and setting up an inquiry that can deal with them effectively. What must not happen is that the accusations be left untested, or that the weight and prestige of the IOC be used to intimidate people seeking to open the matter up. If the IOC behaves in this way, it will have failed its Olympic Games test. </PARA>
<PARA>It is also regrettable that the Federal Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, has declined invitations made to him, including invitations made by me during Senate Estimates hearings, to take the matter up and to pursue it at his level. This contrasts very sharply with the fact that Mr Bob Rowland Smith, the Minister for Sport and Recreation in New South Wales, has done everything possible to assist Watson to have his case heard and properly determined in international tribunals and indeed within the confines of both the Australian Olympic Federation and the International Olympic Committee. One is entitled to ask whether the desire of Australian sporting officials to avoid controversy, to seek promotion of their own cause in the international sporting movement or, indeed, to advance the cause of the Olympic Games bid for Melbourne or anywhere else is getting in the way of exercising their clear responsibility to act on behalf of an Australian athlete, who the evidence suggests has a credible case that he has been badly dealt with and shabbily treated. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, by the time this matter is resolved, Watson may well have served out his suspension and therefore will not be under any enduring suspension or problems. That reminded Senator Collins somewhat of the case of Lindy Chamberlain. It was reported in the Canberra Times on 1 December 1988 that:</PARA>
<PARA>After hearing evidence at a Senate inquiry from Alex Watson, the Australian pentathlete who failed a drug test in Seoul, Senator Bob Collins (NT, ALP) said the inquiry was `almost a rerun' of the Morling inquiry into the Chamberlain case, where `pools of blood turned into caramel milkshakes' because of apparent difficulties with scientific evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that the point that is being made there is an interesting one. The point is simply that, regardless of the fact that by September next Mr Watson will have served out his ban, he nevertheless remains a person whose character has been stained and whose reputation has been left qualified. I believe it is his right to have his name entirely cleared. It is his right to go forward in his sporting career, which presumably does not have many years to run, and to go forward in his professional career and in his career in the promotion of sport and campaigning against the use of drugs in sport. He is entitled, as a matter of simple, natural justice, to go forward with his name cleared. </PARA>
<PARA> The book of Proverbs, as you would well know, Mr President, in verse one, chapter 22, says, `a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches'. It seems to me that the protection of Alex Watson's name is important, not only for him personally, but for people who believe in the integrity of Australian sport and who believe in the provision of natural justice for people who stand wrongly accused. At the end of the day it may well be that there will be dispute about the precise meaning of any scientific test of this sort. But that can only be properly said and determined if one really believes that every opportunity has been provided for this young man to have his name cleared and that he has had the support to which he is entitled from Australian sporting officials, authorities and Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that he has had that support. I believe he is deserving of that support. He certainly has it as far as I am concerned and I hope that, regardless of when this matter is finally determined, whether it is this side or the other of the end of Mr Watson's two-year ban, he will emerge with his name unsullied and his reputation intact. I think he deserves great credit for having been prepared to pursue this matter to the length and at the personal, emotional and financial cost that he has. I wish him the very best in his endeavours. </PARA>
