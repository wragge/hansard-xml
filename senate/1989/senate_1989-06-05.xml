<PARA> That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on 31 May 1989, of the Honourable Malcolm Fox Scott, a Senator for the State of Western Australia from 1950 to 1971, and a Minister of the Crown from 1968 to 1969, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to the members of his family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>Malcolm Scott was born in Western Australia in 1911. He was a Liberal senator for the State of Western Australia from 1950 to 1971 and Minister for Customs and Excise in the Gorton Government from 28 February 1968 to 12 November 1969. During his time in the Senate, Malcolm Scott served on various parliamentary committees including the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Senate Select Committee on Road Safety and the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. He also served on various delegations. He was Government Whip in the Senate from 8 March 1966 to 28 February 1968. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to entering Federal Parliament Malcolm Scott was a farmer. Malcolm Scott was a hardworking and respected member of the Senate. I did not personally know him but I recall his period as Minister for Customs and as chairman of some committees. On behalf of the Government, I extend to his family our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Western Australia-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Leader of the Opposition)</ROLE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition I wish to support the motion which has been moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) and to support his words about the late Malcolm Scott. Malcolm Scott was a farmer before he came to Parliament and a man who had wide interests. In that sense, I suppose, he was the 1950 to 1970 equivalent of Senator Panizza, in that he had extensive interests in mining and agriculture and brought the value of that experience into this place. He was for many years the Leader of the Senate team in Western Australia and, as the Leader of the Government has said, was ultimately a Minister in the Gorton Government, when he had the job of being Minister for Customs and Excise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That was a period not without its difficulties for the then Senator Scott, because the issue of censorship was as sensitive then as it has been on subsequent occasions, and Senator Scott had his moments in the chamber in defending his own very firm views on the matter of censorship. But I suspect there will be many people in Australia who would wish, with the value of hindsight, that his view of censorship might have been given a little more credit in the intervening 20 or so years. Senator Scott was described by the Chief Censor, with whom my colleague Senator Durack had dealings, as the only Minister who ever gave clear directions which would guide the Censor. The clarity of his direction comes out in an interview which Senator Scott gave to the Sydney Morning Herald in 1969 during that period, when he made it clear that he wished to make sure that `filthy trash' was not imported into the country. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I just don't believe in showing the sex act on the screen. I never have, and I'll stand by that. I'll stand by that. </PARA>
<PARA>That ceased, of course, to be a very fashionable view, but I think many people would wish in retrospect that Senator Scott's view had prevailed. When Senator Scott left the Senate he had a number of things to say which I think all of us wish we could say at the same point. Having been in the Senate for more than 20 years, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> In the time that I have been here it has been very heartening to see the growth that has taken place in Australia and the improvement of conditions for all people who live in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>For a politician to be able to say that at the end of his career is a splendid thing. In the more difficult days that Australia faces now, those senators who leave this place will not necessarily be able to say the same thing at the time of the next election. But Senator Scott, at the end of his 20 years, was able to say that, and I do not believe that anyone would doubt that that was true. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>I go out of this chamber knowing that the Senate has improved tremendously since we became senators 20 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is a point of some significance that the Senate in the late 1960s and early 1970s was going through a period of great renaissance, and all senators at that time, including Senator Scott, were entitled to take some pleasure from it. He thanked Senator Murphy, who was then the Leader of the Labor Party and the Leader of the Opposition in this place, for his comments at that time. I thought it would be interesting to see what Senator Murphy had to say of him. On the date of Senator Scott's retirement, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . I and my colleagues, and I think the whole chamber, take him to be a man of unimpeachable integrity. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a very worthy comment to have made about a senator at the end of his career. I wish on behalf of the Opposition to say to the family of the late Malcolm Scott that we remember his contribution to this place with respect and affection and we extend our sympathy to them at this sad time of his death. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I support Senator Button's condolence motion and extend my Party's sympathy to the family of the late Senator Scott. Indeed, I endorse Senator Chaney's comments a moment ago that something we should all strive for is to be able to say, as Senator Scott did at the end of his 20-year term, that the country had been improved and people were better off as a result of the changes made during our period in this place. Perhaps it is a little unfortunate that senators these days do not ever get the opportunity to look forward to a 20-year career in this place, politics having become somewhat more volatile. Nevertheless, I hope that all of us share that concern for the country that Senator Scott indicated that he did. We offer our sympathy and condolences to his family.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Senate assembled in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate that the Government is about to introduce into the Senate, legislation changing health insurance. These changes will increase the cost of health insurance to members of employee based funds and will do nothing to help the elderly, as is being claimed. Big public funds will increase their surpluses by taking money from more efficient funds. People will be forced back onto Medicare, which will not help to maintain private health insurance.</PARA>

<PARA> Although the Communist Government of Vietnam has recently proclaimed a policy of openness and although greater difficulties have been created for Vietnamese boat people after their arrival on the shores of neighbouring countries in South East Asia, the flow of Vietnamese refugees has shown no signs of abating.</PARA>
<PARA> At the Kuala Lumpur conference on Indo-Chinese refugees last February, it was provisionally decided that plans will be made for resettlement of those who arrived at transit camps in South-East Asia prior to the cut-off dates (June 1988 for Hong Kong and 14 March 1989 for South-East Asia), except for the cases of unaccompanied minors, which will be considered at a subsequent date. For those reaching the same shores after the cut-off date, their resettlement is subjected to strict screening procedures. Those, whose refugee status is acknowledged, will be accepted for resettlement, but those who are not considered as genuine refugees, will be placed in transit camps awaiting repatriation. Concrete measures will be taken at a conference on Indo-Chinese refugees to be held on June 13-14 in Geneva.</PARA>
<PARA> We the undersigned Australian citizens, respectfully request the governments of Australia and other countries as well as international organisations which will be represented at the forthcoming conference to:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. expedite plans for resettlement at the earliest possible date of 65,000 Indo-Chinese refugees who arrived in camps throughout South East Asia prior to the cut-off date.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. accept for resettlement all unaccompanied minors, who arrived in camps before the cut-off date.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. accept for resettlement for those unaccompanied minors, who arrived in camps after the cut-off date and came under the following categories:</PARA>
<PARA> orphans having no relatives inside and outside Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA> orphans whose relatives are living overseas and are prepared to sponsor them.</PARA>
<PARA> children whose parents are still in Vietnam and are being discriminated against and persecuted by the Communists regime (e.g., former South Vietnamese army officers, public servants, etc.)</PARA>
<PARA> 4. establish screening procedures in such a way as to ensure impartiality and fairness.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. guarantee a minimum standard of living (including the right to education and medical care, the right to follow religious practices, as well as the right to communicate with friend and relatives elsewhere) to those unqualified for the refugee status and awaiting repatriation.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. establish practical and effective supervisory bodies to ensure that those who are repatriated to Vietnam will not face persecution and revenge by the Communist regime.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. publicise as widely as possible all decisions reached at Geneva so that the people of Vietnam are made aware of the difficulties they would encounter if they should leave Vietnam.</PARA>

<PARA>Canberra ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> At its meeting on 13 April 1989 the Committee considered the Passport Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1989 No. 39, tabled in the Senate on 5 April 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee notes that new regulation 5 (1) provides that applications for Australian passports and other travel documents and for certain endorsements and renewals `'shall be in accordance with a form approved by the Minister''. </PARA>
<PARA> It is understood that such forms approved by the Minister will not only not be subject to disallowance by the Parliament but apparently will not even be tabled. The Committee also notes there are no criteria for the Minister to guide him or her in the exercise of the power. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee asks whether it would be possible to amend the Regulations to provide for tabling and disallowance of the forms. The Committee considers the Passport Regulations deal with a very important area of personal rights and in such cases the Committee believes in the most extensive Parliamentary scrutiny possible. The necessary drafting amendments to deem the forms disallowable instruments would not be complex. </PARA>

<PARA>Senate Standing Committee</PARA>
<PARA>Regulations and Ordinances</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Bob,</PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for your letter dated 24 April 1989 in which you asked whether the Passports Regulations could be amended to provide for the tabling and disallowing of applications for Australian passports and other travel documents for certain endorsements and renewals. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be possible for the Regulations to be amended to provide for the tabling and disallowing of passport application forms and associated forms. I feel however, that such a course of action would be undesirable for a number of reasons which I outline below. </PARA>
<PARA> At least half of the details appearing on the form are for the guidance and information of the public when applying for a passport. These details include the fee for issuing a passport, the location of the various passports offices, the passport information telephone number and other procedures to be followed when applying. Many of these details could be subject to change and in any event are matters of fact which do not require parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> Applicants are requested to provide the information that will appear in the personal particulars page of the passport, i.e. full name, date and place of birth, sex and two specimen signatures, one of which is inserted in the passport and the other to provide a backup if the passport is inadvertently spoiled during processing. Some supporting information is also requested to establish the applicant's bona fides. This information includes evidence of Australian citizenship and a certificate of proof of identity. In the case of minors, written consent of both natural parents is also required and is in accordance with the provisions of the Passports Act. The form also asks for details of who is to be contacted in the case of an emergency. This is a desirable and indeed a sensible feature as the Consular Section of my Department often has to contact relatives or friends in Australia when travellers fall sick or are injured whilst overseas. These details do not infringe on personal rights of applicants and would not appear to be matters with which the Committee would wish to concern itself. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be helpful if the Committee understands that around three million application forms are printed each year (in three printings of one million each) and there are smaller printings of the other ancillary forms. At each printing, minor amendments are incorporated and one printing (in July each year) includes the updated fees for passport issue. These fees increase each July by the percentage increase of the Consumer Price Index as at the end of March. There could be a delay in the issue of the new forms if they were to be subject to scrutiny, with the consequential issue of out of date information to the public until a new form was agreed upon. My Department cannot start processing the new forms until at least mid-April when the March quarter Consumer Price Index figures are published. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee may also be interested to know that 772972 passports were issued in 1987 and for the period January to April 1989, 280056 have been issued. If issues remain at the current level the anticipated total issue for 1989 will be 840168, an increase of 9 per cent over 1988. While the ratio of applications printed, to passports actually issued, is high, my Department's experience has been that a large number of applicants do not read the form carefully with a relatively high error rate resulting. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge the need for parliamentary scrutiny of the Passport Regulations but suggest that the passport application forms are merely for administrative purposes and not designed nor intended to intrude on applicants' personal rights and as such no criteria to guide the Minister are necessary. The design of the form currently in circulation was arrived at after a firm of consultants suggested improvements and it has seen widespread approval by the public. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe therefore, that the referral of the passport application form to the Committee for scrutiny and possible disallowance by the parliament is necessary. I am however, enclosing a copy of the current form for your information. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and, not surprisingly, relates to the slaughter in Beijing at the weekend by the Government of China, through its army, of hundreds if not thousands of innocent, unarmed men, women and children who had been demonstrating in the capital for greater freedom and democracy. As all Australians would denounce this awful violence and want the Australian Government to do all within its power to press the Chinese authorities to end the carnage, I ask: Has the Australian Ambassador been recalled for consultations as a minimum of diplomatic protest; and if not, why not? Has the Government initiated any action in the major human rights fora of the world to bring international pressure to bear on China at least to accept the right of the Chinese people to demonstrate without fear of attack from that country's military forces? Has the Government consulted its major Western allies with a view to coordinating a response to this wanton violence which has the capacity to escalate into a conflict with major international consequences?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government's response to the weekend's tragic events in China has been a strong one. It has been conveyed this morning by me to the Chinese Ambassador to Australia, Mr Zhang Zai. I will indicate to the Senate what I told him because I think it will show the force of our reaction which, I believe, stands for the views of the Australian people. I told him that the Australian Government was deeply distressed at the appalling and tragic events which have taken place in Beijing over the last 48 hours: we profoundly deplore what can only be described as the brutally excessive use of force against peaceful demonstrators which has resulted in a massive death and injury toll. I told him that in the view of the Australian Government the violent suppression of what has been manifestly a peaceful demonstration involves issues of fundamental human rights, and Australia deplores human rights violations of this kind wherever they occur; throughout past weeks the Australian Government has consistently expressed the hope that the impasse between the Chinese Government and the demonstrators could be resolved in a non-violent manner consistent with fundamental human rights; we had admired the restraint that had been demonstrated by the Government until the weekend; and we have been shocked at the extent to which that restraint has now been abandoned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I said further to the Ambassador that the Australian Government very strongly urged the Chinese authorities to appreciate the damage that had already been done to China's reputation and standing in the world and to now once again exercise that restraint so as to avoid further bloodshed. I further advised the Ambassador, at the request of the Prime Minister, that in the circumstances Mr Hawke's planned visit to China in October will not now go ahead. I further advised the Ambassador formally that, as the Prime Minister had already indicated publicly yesterday, the planned goodwill visit to Shanghai by the Australian ship the HMAS Parramatta, scheduled for this week, will not now take place. I also advised the Ambassador that the Australian Government believed, in the circumstances, that it would be inappropriate to proceed with the visit scheduled to commence this coming weekend of the 19-person delegation from the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade and the Foreign Finance Administration, which visit was designed to discuss concessional finance for development projects in China.</PARA>
<PARA> I indicate, just to conclude the record, that the Ambassador was also given a copy of the advice to Australian travellers issued by my Department yesterday recommending, in view of the developments over the past two days, that all travel to China be postponed. I told him that we sought the assurance of the Chinese Government that the safety of Australian diplomatic and consular personnel and other long term residents, particularly students and visitors to China, would be guaranteed. I indicated finally that the Australian Government had welcomed the policies of reform and openness which have brought evident benefits to China and to the rest of the world, including Australia, and we hoped that, through restraint, stability might be restored swiftly to enable these important reform processes to be maintained and strengthened, creating the conditions for continuing close and productive relations between our two countries.</PARA>
<PARA> I think it will be appreciated from the text, in effect, of what was conveyed to the Chinese Ambassador that Australia's reaction has been, as I have said, a strong one. It is certainly no less strong than that of any other country in the world, and considerably stronger than that of a number of others.</PARA>
<PARA> We have not as yet addressed the question of recalling the Australian Ambassador to China. We prefer to hope that in the light of the very strong reactions that have now been received in Beijing from around the world, including from ourselves, the Chinese Government will come to its senses and there will be a return to more acceptable conduct in that country. At the moment the Ambassador is doing an extraordinarily important and delicate job extraordinarily well. In particular, he is looking after the interests of the very large number of Australians presently in China and in Beijing in respect of whom, although to our knowledge they are all presently safe, obvious difficulties arise about how to ensure their continued safety in what are very fluid and difficult circumstances. In those circumstances we believe, at least for the present, that Australia's interests are better served by the Ambassador staying there, particularly given the strength of the reaction and the other steps that we have taken to put beyond doubt Australia's strong feelings in this respect. The normal reason why one recalls an ambassador is to make an appropriately symbolic gesture of discontent or distaste for a course of events. If one can express that in other ways the point can be made very effectively.</PARA>
<PARA> As to instituting action in other human rights forums, that is a question that can be addressed in the period ahead. It has not been addressed at this stage, but I repeat that we regard what has happened as involving fundamental human rights violations. The suppression by violence of peaceful dissent and peaceful demonstrations is not something that can be regarded as a country's internal affair. These days it is very much the proper currency of international discourse and international focus and attention by the kind of agencies to which Senator Hill refers. Finally, Senator Hill asked me whether there had been any action with other major powers to develop some coordinated response to this. At present there has not been any such action. The appropriateness or otherwise of that is something we will address in the period ahead.</PARA>

In particular, there was the 10 cities satellite linked conference that attracted more than 8,000 participants.

I believe that, as a result, it is still rather too early to be talking about initiatives in our bilateral relationship.

President Khameini's term expires in August, when he will step down and there will be elections for a new President. A constitutional commission has been looking at changes which would considerably enhance the position of the President and perhaps ultimately produce a system which is more recognisable in terms of institutions with which we are familiar elsewhere in the world. The Speaker of the Iranian Parliament, Mr Rafsanjani, is considered to be a front-runner for that position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All I can say about all this is that we hope that there will be a peaceful transition of power which will result in peace and prosperity for the Iranian people.

We enjoy sound bilateral relations with Iran. We hope that those links will continue to develop in this new phase of Iran's history.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence. I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that today, Monday, 5 June, has been declared World Environment Day and that this declaration is intended to be part of an ongoing commitment to environmental issues. In the light of this, is the Minister aware of increasing public pressure to declare the Jervis Bay area, including the Beecroft Peninsula, a national park? Given this, did the Minister consult the Jerringa Aboriginal population of the Beecroft Peninsula before arranging the military exercise called Tasmanlink? What was the result of any consultations? If none were made, why not? Did the Minister give his permission for land regarded as sacred by the Jerringa people to be bombarded? If he did, on what grounds did he give permission? If he did not, who did give permission, and why? In any event, will the Minister immediately order the cessation of bombardment of the Beecroft Peninsula in order to mark World Environment Day? What further steps will the Minister take to conserve this area, which is sacred to Aboriginal people and which is regarded as a unique part of Australia's natural environment?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that there has been some pressure in recent times for at least some areas around Jervis Bay, including the Beecroft Peninsula, to be declared a national park, although this has not yet occurred. I think the heart of the question is about consultation with the local Aboriginal people. My understanding is that a management plan exists for the peninsula and that that plan was drawn up in consultation with the local Aboriginal people. I am informed that the Department of Defence believes that it is acting within the terms of the management plan which was negotiated with the Aboriginal people and, on that basis, did not consult them specifically about this exercise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next question was: Did the Minister give his permission for land regarded as sacred to be bombarded? Firing is to be limited to the impact area using man-made structures as targets, and that has been the practice for many years. In terms of whether that attacks specific sacred sites, a study is in progress to provide some detailed information on what sites there may be of interest to Aboriginal people in the area, and this will take into account any necessary revision of the management plan to which I referred earlier. In terms of ordering the cessation of the bombardment, the Department of Defence does not consider that the bombardment is likely to cause any significant environmental impact, given the number of times the area has been subjected to bombardment over the years. That environmental assessment was carried out by the Department of Defence and my Department will be asking for a copy of it so that we can have a look at it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Did the Minister see an article entitled `Money, Credit and the Demand for Debt' in the May 1989 issue of the Reserve Bank Bulletin? Did that article note that the debt to equity ratio of stock exchange listed Australian businesses has risen from around 45 per cent in the early 1980s to about 100 per cent now? Is the Minister concerned about this development, and does the Government expect the debt to equity ratio to continue to increase?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not read the whole article, but I have looked at the various statistics presented in it. The article does note that in the course of the 1980s Australian business came to rely much more heavily on debt finance as opposed to equity finance. I am certainly concerned about that development, and I have been for a long time. Among other things, it means that business is more unstable and more vulnerable to swings in the business cycle. It is also not unrelated-indeed, it is probably quite strongly related-to the build-up of the Australian private sector's international indebtedness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whether it is reasonable to expect the trend of the 1980s to continue into the 1990s depends on what the causes of the 1980s trend were. They include the old-fashioned double taxation of dividends. Under that system there was a clear incentive for equity to be replaced by debt. We have got rid of double taxation with the imputation system. The Government moved to that remedy in July 1987, but that still left a problem if the source of the debt financing was a body not paying tax. Under those circumstances the interest payment was completely tax-free, not taxed at any point.</PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, dividends were subject to one layer of taxation instead of the previous two. Therefore, superannuation funds still faced a massive incentive to provide finance via debt instruments rather than company shares. In response to that, in the May 1988 economic statement, the Government moved to bring superannuation funds into the imputation system and the level playing field.</PARA>
<PARA> For reasons similar to the treatment of interest payments being tax deductable in the hands of the payer but not taxable in the hands of an exempt body which was receiving the interest, as against equity which was taxed once or which is now taxed only in the hands of a company, the still existing arrangements which the Government moved to correct in May 1988 favour investment in foreign equities as against Australian equities, investment in real estate or speculation instead of equity in businesses engaged in productive activities-factories, mines and so on-and also provide incentives to superannuation funds to engage in joint ventures instead of company shares; that is, in the process bypassing the corporate taxation point and eroding the corporate tax base-an erosion, were that position allowed to remain unaltered, which would probably proceed at an accelerating rate.</PARA>

I have received a letter from Ian Causley, which one imagines is this effort to reopen negotiations. It is in part a reply to the balanced proposition that the Commonwealth has put to the State of New South Wales to resolve the issues outstanding over the Harris-Daishawa Pty Ltd woodchip export licence. Senator Childs's question was: Has there been any indication that there is a considered response from the State of New South Wales? Let me quote the following from the third paragraph of the letter to me from Ian Causley:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Resource availability has always been the crucial issue, as you correctly identify.</PARA>
<PARA>Thank you, Ian Causley. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>I have not reviewed the analysis prepared by your Department in great detail, as the conclusions agree generally . . .</PARA>
<PARA>with the conclusions of ours. I wish that the Minister, even after all this time, would review in great detail the proposition that the Commonwealth has put because, as I have said, the Commonwealth has been motivated on two fronts over this matter. I cite them not necessarily in ranking order; they rank equally. For the sake of convenience of presentation, the first is whether or not there is sufficient resource available in our proposition to maintain full employment in the sawlog industry in the south-east, and by virtue of doing that-based on the integrated logging practices in that area-to maintain the supply of material for the woodchip operation. In the first case we have said, all through this matter, that our calculations provide that there are. Initially Ian Causley contested that view and said that they did not. If he studies our detailed proposition further he will not only be of the opinion that they in fact do meet the requirements of the sawlog industry, but also know from the sawlog industry itself, from spokesmen from some of the sawlog companies, that they find our calculations adequate to meet their needs for the 12 months of the biological study that we would be conducting. Not only have they said that to me, but they said it, as representatives of the sawlog industry, to the Prime Minister last Thursday afternoon when they met him following a demonstration here.</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate would also know that this Government quite rightly has environmental obligations, and those obligations are to protect as much of the National Estate as possible, and that we have done. The proposal we have put enables logging in less than 10 per cent of the National Estate, with over 91 per cent to be studied by a balanced team of scientists to come up with recommendations of what we should regard as the principal properties of the National Estate for that other 91 per cent of the area. The third leg of our proposition has been to encourage and in fact involve the New South Wales Government and Harris-Daishawa directly in a plantation strategy, so that in the future we are not always in the situation of arguing whether a diminishing resource should go to industry or to the environment, but that we expand the resource base so that both can live side by side.</PARA>
<PARA> Minister Causley has indicated in his own words: `I have not reviewed the analysis prepared by your Department . . .'. I wish he would. If he did, he would find that it meets the very thing we have said it does, and that is the view of the sawlog industry. The week before last I went with the Timber Workers Union of New South Wales and addressed shop stewards from all of the sawlog companies in the south-east at a mass meeting of Harris-Daishawa workers and, subject to confirmation that is now available, they have also endorsed the proposition. So we have a situation in which the sawlog industry acknowledges that our calculations are right, the workers whose jobs and livelihoods are affected by those calculations endorse the proposition we have put, and Ian Causley is still not saying that he has studied this adequately. As soon as I can, I will be seeking a meeting with Minister Causley to resolve this matter. But I suggest that before I reach the discussion table, he take note of what the industry and the unions have said about the proposition we have put and that he move to adopt that proposition and stop trying to engage in a political point scoring battle, which is about the only thing he has ever tried to engage in in his public utterances. I ask as well that the environmental movement recognise the soundness of the propositions we have put and come in behind those too. I think that would properly isolate Minister Causley.</PARA>

Can the Minister inform the Senate how many Australian taxpayers paid tax under the new capital gains tax provisions in respect of the 1986-87 financial year?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Taxation Office publication Taxation Statistics 1986-87 was published last week and shows the figures in Table 25. That table shows that in that year just over 21,000 Australians paid tax under the new capital gains tax provisions. The total number of taxpayers in that year was 8.3 million. So one taxpayer in 400 pays capital gains tax. Of total capital gains tax collected, more than 65 per cent was paid by people with incomes above $50,000, and nearly 80 per cent was collected from people with taxable incomes above $35,000. I ask the Senate to bear in mind that those figures are for 1986-87; they are now two years old. So it is very clear that any move to abolish or dilute the capital gains tax would benefit only a tiny proportion of taxpayers-one in 400-and that the tax is skewed very heavily in favour of high income earners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If capital gains tax were to be abolished or diluted, the revenue would have to be raised somewhere else. Of course, if a government were to follow the irresponsible fiscal policies and the irresponsible example set by the last coalition Government, that revenue loss would be offset by letting the deficit blow out. However, if the responsible course were chosen instead, the rates of tax on middle and low income Australians would have to be increased. The major beneficiaries of the abolition or serious dilution of the capital gains tax, as proposed by the Opposition the last time it said something publicly about this, would be those people who organise shonky rearrangements of company shareholdings, such as the Federal President of the Liberal Party.</PARA>

I know that my colleague has such an abundance of talent and skill that he will probably have all senators home by Wednesday of next week. I know that will be no problem at all. I still think that is the plan. It is true, at least from the Government point of view, that we would prefer to process some of the legislation this week. We are well behind on that. But in terms of the running of this chamber-and we have never been able to master this-we are still finding it difficult to allocate time fairly and equitably between government and non-government business. Even within the area of non-government business, senators would have noticed a decline in ministerial statements. That is not because the Government is reluctant to have ministerial statements; it is just that they are debated at such length in this chamber as to absorb too much time. We seriously tried to address this with the Senate Standing Committee on Procedure but we obviously have no consensus in this chamber to bring about a more evenly balanced distribution of debating time to important subjects.

<PARA> Many of these reports have been based on information contained in the latest bankruptcy annual report, which was tabled quite recently. However, since that report, and even preceding that, a number of figures have been released for periods since the financial year 1987-88. Those figures indicate that progressively over the last nine months from July 1988 there has been a substantial decrease in the number of bankruptcies. For instance, for the March quarter 1989 there has been a decrease of 20.9 per cent in bankruptcies and administration orders, a decrease of 40 per cent in part 10 deeds and compositions, and a decrease of 22.8 per cent in the combined figures for all bankruptcies and insolvencies. This is the third consecutive quarter to show a decline in new bankruptcies and part 10 arrangements. In fact, for the nine-month period from July 1988 to March 1989 there has been a decrease in all bankruptcies and part 10 arrangements of 14.7 per cent. Far from the latest personal bankruptcies going up, there has been a very clear and consistent decline over the last nine months.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am aware of certain concern expressed by members of the Chilean community in Australia. That does not surprise me. For the most part, they have been fed a whole variety of stories, none of which has been true. There has never been a question of Mr Buschmann being deported to Chile. He is no longer a citizen of Chile; he has refugee status and resident status in Sweden. Therefore, my Department's attitude to Mr Buschmann is that if he were to be deported from this country it would be to Sweden. It has been a deliberate policy of Mr Buschmann's supporters to mix together all those issues in order to get an emotional response from the Chilean community. I think they have been sorely and badly advised in this particular matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to Senator Jenkins's second question, yes, undertakings were given to Mr Buschmann on the Friday that if he came in he would not be detained. Prior to that we issued several invitations and several appointments were broken. That undertaking was kept. May I say that the undertaking that he would not be detained is not unusual. In most cases where visa breaches occur, we much prefer to give the person concerned an opportunity to leave the country voluntarily. In most cases, this method obtains. After all, it is even cheaper: if we do not deport them we do not have to pay for their air fares. So it is normal in these circumstances. That occurred on the Friday. On the Saturday when Mr Buschmann was asked to come in, no such guarantee was given. Indeed, my officers were asked, `Will you guarantee he will not be detained?'. My officers continually said, `No, we won't give any such guarantee. We require Mr Buschmann to come in on the Saturday morning'. So, the answer to question No. 2 is yes and then no.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to question Nos 3, 4 and 5, I have had no advice, no contact in any way, with the Chilean Government. No doubt, maybe the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or the Attorney-General's Department has but certainly my Department has not. We are acting purely on immigration matters and what we regard as a breach of immigration matters. I might also add that I have had no contact from any multinationals putting pressure on me. I can only describe the garbage put out by Mr Buschmann's supporters-I now have three of them on the public record saying that this Government is acting to deport Mr Buschmann because of pressure from multinational companies-is not only outrageous but also untrue and deliberately deceptive. They are playing on the susceptibilities of some of Mr Buschmann's more innocent supporters.</PARA>
<PARA> In question No. 6 Senator Jenkins asked whether Mr Buschmann would be sent back to Sweden. The matter still is at least peripherally in the Federal Court inasmuch as there is a temporary injunction, but it is my Department's intention to deport Mr Buschmann-and to deport him to Sweden. As I say, he was given an opportunity to leave voluntarily; he did not avail himself of that as many other people do in similar circumstances. His supporters insisted that he continue part of his tour; that he go to Adelaide for a concert, et cetera. It is hardly likely that my Department will grant permission to someone who is already in two direct breaches of his visa conditions to continue to breach them.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the final question-again, there has been a lot of misleading information about this-the timing, the travel route and the privacy of the arrangements regarding Mr Buschmann's departure are subject and will be subject to negotiation with Mr Buschmann. As he is a refugee, I would always seek that, when he leaves the country, by which route he leaves the country and the secrecy of that be handled in such a way as not to make him vulnerable to any other activity against him so that he can have safe passage through to Sweden. That has been our position from day one and it remains it today. We have no intention of placing Mr Buschmann in a situation where his life may be endangered or he cannot travel back to Sweden, where he has refugee status. I think that that answers the seven points to the honourable senator's question. I do not comment on Mr Buschmann's political leanings. My colleague Senator Evans has done so in a press release last Friday. Personally, I endorse all those remarks.</PARA>

What the Government proposes is that superannuation funds which invest in foreign equities will, firstly, pay the tax which is due in the foreign country and, secondly, pay tax again in Australia on the dividends when they are returned to Australia, but that superannuation funds that invest in Australian enterprises not pay tax on the dividends. What the Opposition proposes is to get rid of that principle-that is, of encouraging Australian superannuation funds to invest in Australian equities-by relieving superannuation funds of the tax they would otherwise have to pay on dividend income received from foreign investment. In other words, what Senator Bishop-I presume in crass ignorance-moved and had this chamber carry last Thursday night was a proposal to encourage Australian superannuation funds to invest in foreign equities instead of Australian equities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot remember off the top of my head. The ultimate revenues gained or lost depend on a number of other things. For example, if superannuation funds are provided with incentives to provide debt financing instruments instead of equity financing instruments, the interest received escapes taxation altogether. With equity financing instruments it does not; it is taxed in the hands of the company. The Government's proposals allow the benefit of that tax already paid by the company to be claimed by the superannuation fund. The Opposition would have that incentive-that is, for equity instead of debt financing-removed. Under its proposition there would be no taxing point whatsoever for debt financing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition's amendments would also favour superannuation fund investment in central business district property, other real estate, and speculative real estate activity, instead of investment in productive Australian businesses. It would also encourage superannuation funds to become joint venturers instead of shareholders in companies, which would thereby escape any taxing point whatsoever and in the process erode the corporate taxation base, probably at an accelerating rate. It does not surprise me that the Opposition is putting this proposal up because, after all, it is taking its orders from John Elliott. It surprises me that the Australian Democrats can, without any apparent embarrassment, support that set of propositions, thereby repudiating their six-year-old rhetoric.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 31 May 1989 Senator Knowles asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, a question relating to the administration of the Child Support Agency. As the answer runs to about 3 1/2 pages, I seek leave to have the answer incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>It is unclear precisely what Senator Knowles was referring to. The Registrar of Child Support-who is the Commissioner for Taxation and is responsible for the administration of the Child Support Act-has provided information in relation to two categories of case that may fall within the bounds of Senator Knowles's question. The first relates to the number of cases in which the Agency in attempting to contact a parent liable to pay maintenance has contacted the wrong person. The Registrar advises that there have been three such cases. Of course in each case the recipient of the notice from the CSA has had a statutory right to object to the notice. The Registrar has advised me that in each of these three cases the notice advised the recipient that that right was available.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Knowles referred to there being hundreds of incorrect notices in Western Australia. She was probably referring to cases where the Agency has registered liabilities arising under court orders made since 1 June 1988 even though the custodial parent has made no application to the Agency. I dealt with these cases in an answer to a question from Senator Giles on 23 May. The crucial points are:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) these notices were not incorrect-they correctly notified recipients of liabilities that existed under the Child Support Act;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) however, these notices were incomplete-they did not notify non pensioner custodial parents that they have an unqualified right to opt out of Agency collection;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the Agency has modified its procedures to make sure that in these cases non pensioner payees are advised of their rights to opt out;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) the primary cause for the problem in these cases is not the actions of the Agency-it is the failure of the parties to comply with their legal obligation to advise the Agency of the making of a maintenance order or the registering of an agreement:</PARA>
<PARA> This obligation applies to everybody who gets a maintenance order or agreement;</PARA>
<PARA> It is clear many lawyers are, even after a year of operation of the Agency, failing to advise their clients of this obligation.</PARA>
<PARA>The Registrar has advised me that there were about 400 cases registered without applications from custodial parents before the change of procedures designed to make sure people are aware of their right to opt out of Agency collection.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Knowles referred to what she called `misuse of the tax file number.' The Child Support Registrar has advised me that the tax file number is the standard identifier used in the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). The Child Support Agency is part of the ATO and use of the tax file number by the CSA is perfectly valid. There is no question of misuse of the tax file number by the CSA. For too long in Australia we have had a maintenance system which has been effectively voluntary. Custodians and their children have been left to rely on pension-at great cost to themselves, their children and the public. To address this the Child Support Act was passed by this Parliament unanimously. The Parliament there expressly directed the Tax Office to administer that Act to achieve two objectives. I quote from the Act:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) that children receive from their parents the financial support that the parents are liable to provide; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) that periodic amounts payable by non-custodial parents towards the maintenance of their children are paid on a regular and timely basis.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me repeat: the Registrar advises that there have been three cases in a year where a notice has gone to the wrong person: three out of over 22,000 cases. In each of those cases the recipient of the notice had a statutory right to object to the registration of a liability against him or her and I am advised, was advised of that right. That is a record of administration which is squarely within the objects and principles of the Child Support Act.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The article which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald of 5 June 1989 written by Greg Roberts and headed `Anger over threat of renewed sand-mining' is one of the most slovenly, inaccurate and mendacious pieces of second-rate journalism which I have seen for a long time. Mr Roberts telephoned me at home on Sunday afternoon last to ask me a series of questions, most of them hypothetical, about possible future resource development proposals. The first point to be made is that I told Roberts that I would not be drawn into giving definitive answers or concluded views on purely hypothetical propositions, a point which is certainly not made in the slovenly report now printed. The device of saying that I `refused to rule out' something is rather a tawdry, dishonest trick, just as much so as failing to make the point that I refused to rule out the continuation of an export ban on Fraser Island mineral sands. It is a trick frequently used to elevate hypothetical situations into apparently real ones. It is an old technique resorted to by the dishonest and second-rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of Fraser Island, I made the following points: firstly, Fraser Island is unique and deserves protection; secondly, I personally supported the original Fraser Government actions in imposing a mineral sands export ban; and thirdly, any proposal for a renewal of mineral sands export activity would have to be considered by Cabinet and would be decided entirely on its merits, including, obviously, its environmental ones. At least the article notes my comment that it would not be possible to determine any outcome of such an application. It should be noted that the Commonwealth control in this area extends only to activities undertaken for export purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Roberts equally misrepresents my position in relation to logging in North Queensland. What Roberts asked me was whether we would be reviewing current prohibitions on activities in World Heritage listed areas. I responded by saying that all federally imposed conditions would be reviewed, this being consistent with the commitments in our printed policy. Again I stressed that such a review would not necessarily mean that things would be changed. That is one of the few accurate quotes in Roberts's article. At no stage did I specify any policy on `rain- forest logging' in the way which is portrayed later in the Roberts beat-up article. The whole of the Roberts article is slovenly in the way in which it presents a series of prognostications as to what may happen or what has not been ruled out as constituting anything more than a determination on the part of an incoming coalition government to treat all environmental and resource matters and their resolution entirely on the basis of merit. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate endorse the finding contained in paragraph 34 of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>In the statement made on behalf of the Committee to the Senate on 11 May, I indicated that the Committee would be tabling a report, as soon as possible after the Senate resumed in May, giving reasons for its finding, in relation to the matter referred to it on 8 December 1988, that Mr Greg Blood's action in asking Ms Sue Howland to leave his house on the day after she gave evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts on 30 November 1988 was not a contempt of the Senate, in that Mr Blood did not improperly interfere with, or inflict a penalty or injury upon, Ms Howland, on account of evidence she gave before the Standing Committee in relation to its inquiry into the use of drugs in sport. </PARA>
<PARA> Briefly, the Committee made the finding on the basis that Mr Blood was concerned about the escalation of a situation beyond his control, that he took the actions that he did in a state of stress, and was motivated by a desire to obtain relief from the stressful situation in which he found himself. Thus, the Committee has concluded that the intention necessary to establish an offence in this case did not exist. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee makes the point, however, that actions taken by persons in order to prevent information being produced, or to impose a penalty as a result of the production of that information, would seriously impede a committee's inquiry, and is of the view that they would amount to a serious contempt of the Senate deserving of serious censure and penalty. The Committee reiterates that in the circumstances of the present case the requisite intention has not been established and thus a finding has been made that no contempt has been committed. I commend the report to the Senate and seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I table a revised explanatory memorandum and seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill amends a number of Acts administered within the Attorney-General's portfolio. Some parts of the Bill contain minor amendments designed to correct or update existing legislation. Other parts of the Bill contain more significant amendments designed to implement new policy and ensure that existing legislation is able to deal effectively with sophisticated crime. </PARA>
<PARA> A detailed explanation of the provisions of the Bill is contained in the explanatory memorandum. I propose to address only the more significant aspects of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Crimes Act 1914</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains a number of amendments to the Crimes Act 1914. There are significant amendments dealing with computer crime and fines under the Act are to be substantially increased. The Bill also inserts a new part into the Crimes Act that will provide for a scheme that will permit old convictions for minor offences to be spent. </PARA>
<PARA>COMPUTER CRIME</PARA>
<PARA> The provisions in the Bill relating to computer offences follow, substantially, the recommendations of the committee reviewing Commonwealth criminal law chaired by the former Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Harry Gibbs. The committee was asked to report specifically on the need for new legislation in this area, and its report was presented and released last November and tabled in Parliament on 12 April 1989. The need for new legislation arises out of three main considerations. </PARA>
<PARA> The first is the possible vulnerability of information in computer systems, by comparison with paper records. Unauthorised access to paper files can be prevented by relatively simple security measures, and when such measures fail it is usually because an offence, or at least a breach of duty, has been committed by a person with authorised access. Not so with computer records, where access to restricted information by unauthorised persons can in many cases be obtained simply by ingenuity in overcoming technical barriers. Such access might be obtained from inside an organisation by persons prepared to exceed a limited access authority, or through the telephone communication system by external `hackers'. Vulnerability does not relate only to access. Computer information can be exposed to risk of damage, destruction or alteration from a large number of sources within or outside the computer-using organisation. Such conduct could have a variety of motives. It might be for gain, as in the case of traditional embezzlement; it might be a malicious desire to cause damage or create confusion or disruption in an organisation; or it might be simple unauthorised experimentation. All such conduct is socially undesirable and its consequences can be disastrous, as reports of damage from so-called computer viruses have shown. </PARA>
<PARA> The second consideration is the widespread and growing reliance of modern society on computer systems and communications systems that depend on computers. We need to foster confidence in the security and reliability of such systems not only from the point of view of governments and businesses that use them but from the point of view of individuals whose private information might be contained in them. </PARA>
<PARA> The third consideration is the need for the law to be relevant to modern technology. Our criminal law relating to forgery, uttering, fraud and false pretences was framed with people, pens and paper in mind. Now we have machines, magnetic memories and electronic impulses. How traditional offences can be applied in the setting of new technology can be very uncertain. We should not leave this situation to be tested in the trial courts and the appeal process when it is possible to create new offences directed at unauthorised and deliberate acts of misconduct done with, or aimed at, computers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill creates a series of offences involving either deliberate unauthorised access to data, or more serious offences where such access is gained and the offender either, gained that access with intent to defraud or, knew or ought reasonably to have known that the data was of a specified type which is considered particularly sensitive. It is not intended that the question whether the person ought reasonably to have known involve an objective test but rather that the court be able to have regard to all the circumstances surrounding the offence including the characteristics, knowledge, skills and attributes of the particular offender when determining this question. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments do not seek to cover computer crime generally. There is no need for such an approach as many situations can be more appropriately dealt with by State Laws and law enforcement authorities. Instead, the provisions in this Bill are directed at two classes of situation where Commonwealth provisions are either necessary or useful. </PARA>
<PARA> The first relates to the protection of Commonwealth computers and data in them. This is clearly a proper function of Commonwealth criminal law. The second kind of situation is where the misconduct (that is the unauthorised access, interference or damage) takes place by means of a Commonwealth facility, whether or not the victimised computer system is a Commonwealth one. We have here in mind particularly the telecom communication system through which all major computer networks, and many smaller systems, will be linked. One of the advantages of covering such situations by Commonwealth legislation is that a common offence will apply across all Australian jurisdictions-thus enabling a prosecution to be brought in the most convenient venue when the elements occur in two or more States or Territories. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not intended that this offence of computer misconduct through use of telecom and such facilities will displace any State or Territory offences that may also have been committed. One or other offence or both could be charged, subject to the usual rules against double jeopardy. It will of course, be a matter for each jurisdiction to decide whether to enact specific computer legislation, and two have already done so. </PARA>
<PARA> In accepting the Gibbs Committee's recommendation for new offences involving use of Commonwealth communications facilities the Government is taking account not only of possible frauds and other offences that might be committed across boundaries but the potential use of such facilities for `hacking' and for the deliberate causing of computer malfunctions through viruses or other means. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make it clear that these new offence provisions are intended to protect information while it is in a computer system. They are not intended to give that information a special character so that after it has been obtained from a computer special penalties attach to its unauthorised use. Thus the ordinary law about unauthorised disclosure would apply in relation to a third party receiving the information. No new offence is brought into existence in relation to a third party except where that party is an accessory to the computer-related misconduct. </PARA>
<PARA>PENALTY PROVISIONS</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill makes two general changes to the penalty provisions of the Crimes Act. First, it will increase the maximum fine that may be imposed for certain Commonwealth offences-that is for most offences in the Crimes Act and those other offences for which no fine is expressly specified. The relativities between imprisonment and maximum fines were last adjusted in 1982. When I speak of `relativities', I should stress that specified maximum fines are not to be regarded in any sense as substitutable for, or to be served instead of, the corresponding period of imprisonment. As the review committee points out, maximum fines should have regard to the worst kind of breach that is appropriate for a fine rather than imprisonment. Therefore it is not possible to equate a fine with a particular period of imprisonment, for example by having regard to weekly earnings. Also, periods of imprisonment in default of payment of a fine are a quite separate matter. The new scale will be given effect by a simplified formula in place of a table. Some examples of the effect of the increased maximum penalties are:</PARA>
<PARA> 6 months imprisonment-$3,000 fine instead of $1,000</PARA>
<PARA> 3 years imprisonment-$18,000 fine instead of $10,000</PARA>
<PARA> 20 years imprisonment-$120,000 fine instead of $20,000. </PARA>
<PARA> An offence punishable by a maximum of life imprisonment would become punishable by a fine of up to $200,000. </PARA>
<PARA> While the new relativities now provided for will be made generally applicable, through this Bill and future legislation directed to other offence provisions, the relativities will not be followed universally. Where a different relativity is justified as a matter of policy, special provision will be made for this. </PARA>
<PARA> In cases where a fine would be imposed on a corporation a multiplier of 5 will continue to be used. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, it is intended to follow the practice for new offences in recent years by providing in relation to the Crimes Act, and elsewhere where not otherwise specified, that a fine may be imposed additionally as well as alternatively to imprisonment. The aim of this approach is to make available to the court the greatest possible range of sentencing options within the limits of the maximum prison term and the maximum fine. For example it would be possible to impose a short or suspended prison term together with a fine. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the changes I have described are intended to be steps towards adoption of a more uniform and rational scheme of penalties for all Commonwealth offences. Further steps in that process will be taken in the light of recommendations to be made by the committee reviewing Commonwealth criminal law. </PARA>
<PARA>SPENT CONVICTIONS</PARA>
<PARA> The question of spent convictions has been the subject of a report by the Australian Law Reform Commission and extensive discussions in the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. Queensland has had legislation dealing with the rehabilitation of offenders since 1986 which is more limited in scope than the ALRC proposals. As an exercise in uniformity agreement was reached in SCAG that all jurisdictions would enact legislation dealing with spent convictions broadly along the lines of the Queensland model. </PARA>
<PARA> The spent convictions scheme is designed to give people a chance to live down a minor criminal conviction. Clearly it is in the best interests of society, and the person involved, that where the person has been convicted of a minor offence, has paid the penalty and subsequently been of good behaviour for an extended period then they should be protected from those who might discriminate against them. The scheme is rehabilitative and will contribute to the Government's efforts to reduce crime. The Government's perspective of the benefits of the scheme is supported by experience with similar schemes in operation in the United States, most European countries and Japan. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now briefly outline the details of the scheme. The legislation will prohibit disclosure of, or discrimination against a person on the basis of, a conviction for a minor offence where the person has been of good behaviour for 10 years after conviction. The scheme also allows a person to deny that he or she has a conviction where it is spent. This is necessary to ensure that the scheme is not undermined by the implication that a person who refuses to answer questions relating to the person's criminal history has a spent conviction. The same approach has been followed in the Queensland Act and the Western Australian scheme has the same result. A minor offence is one where an actual sentence of 30 months imprisonment or less was imposed. The prohibitions on disclosure and discrimination will apply generally to Commonwealth employment and in the non-self governing territories in respect of all convictions, Commonwealth, State and foreign. The prohibitions are a consequence of conviction of a Commonwealth offence and therefore will apply throughout Australia in respect of convictions for Commonwealth offences. </PARA>
<PARA> Having established a general rule, there will inevitably be circumstances to which that general rule should not apply. To this end the legislation provides a scheme of exemptions. Some of these are spelt out specifically in the legislation. Clearly a court or a prosecuting body should be able to take spent convictions into account when sentencing or deciding whether to prosecute. Certain types of employment require, for public policy reasons, full disclosure of any convictions. Persons employed in law enforcement and national security will therefore be exempt from the scheme and have to disclose spent convictions. In other types of employment certain convictions will always be relevant. An example of this is where a person has been convicted of a sexual offence involving children and seeks employment caring for children or as a teacher. In addition to these statutory exemptions it will also be open to Government to make regulations exempting persons, or classes of persons, from the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The mechanism contained in the legislation is that an application may be made to the privacy commissioner for exemption. The privacy commissioner will then make a recommendation to government on whether regulations should be made to exempt the applicant, or the class of which the applicant is a member. The Bill enables the provisions which empower the privacy commissioner to consider and recommend exemptions to operate immediately on royal assent. The spent convictions scheme itself will not, however, come into force until proclamation or, failing that, 12 months after royal assent. The privacy commissioner has indicated that he will be able to advertise for applications for exemption, consider any applications received and recommend any appropriate exemptions to the Minister to enable regulations to be made within the 12 month period. The Attorney-General has undertaken that the privacy commissioner will consult with opposition parties on proposed exemptions. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than create a range of offences to enforce the scheme the privacy commissioner will be given conciliation and civil remedies powers, similar to those conferred by the Privacy Act, to resolve breaches of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments will change the common law which provides that a pardon only relieves a person from the consequences of a conviction. If it is subsequently found that a person was wrongly convicted and a pardon is granted on that basis, justice requires that the person should be put in the same position as if he or she had never been convicted at all. </PARA>
<PARA>Customs Act 1901</PARA>
<PARA>In 1987 the Parliament passed legislation designed to strike at the heart of major organized crime by depriving persons involved of the proceeds of their criminal endeavours. That legislation, the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, was a major advance on existing legislation which dealt with the forfeiture of property and the imposition and recovery of pecuniary penalties such as Part XIII Division 3 of the Customs Act 1901. </PARA>
<PARA> Part XIII Division 3 of the Customs Act was inserted in 1979. It was stated during the second reading debate at the time that the objective of the legislation was to facilitate the imposition of ``a pecuniary penalty equivalent to the benefit derived from dealing in illicit drugs''. Section 243b therefore provided for the imposition of a pecuniary penalty, to be assessed in accordance with section 243c. Quite properly, section 243c provided that the court, when assessing the value of the benefit derived by a person from dealing with illicit drugs, could have regard to property acquired by reason of dealing in narcotics, that had been diverted by the dealer into the possession of a person other than the drug dealer. Most commonly, this might be property which is disguised as the property of a company controlled by the drug dealer. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is a striking flaw in the legislative scheme of Part XII Division 3 that, when it comes to satisfying the pecuniary penalty, no provision was made for applying that other property in satisfaction of the penalty. That defect was cured in the Proceeds of Crime Act by the ``effective control'' provision (section 9) and the power to lift the corporate veil (section 28). Part 5 of the Bill now before the House will remove this defect from the Customs Act by inserting new provisions modelled upon the provisions of the Proceeds Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 5 of the Bill makes a number of other amendments to Part XIII Division 3 of the Customs Act with a view to harmonising its provisions with those of the Proceeds Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983</PARA>
<PARA> Part 6 of the Bill proposes two amendments to the DPP Act. The first, confers a general power on the director to file an ex officio indictment other than for a prosecution under the War Crimes Act 1945. This general power will not be delegable and a related amendment ensures that the general ex officio power must be exercised personally by the director. This will put the Commonwealth DPP in the same position as his counterparts in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> The second enlarges the power of the director to give an indemnity. At present the Director may give a use indemnity which is an undertaking that evidence given by a person in specified Commonwealth proceedings will not be used in evidence against the person in any civil or criminal proceedings, other than proceedings for perjury. The Act is to be amended to provide for full use/derivative use indemnity. That is, the undertaking will extend to the use of evidence which is obtained as a direct or indirect result of the primary evidence given by the witness. This adopts a recommendation made by the Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its report on the National Crime Authority Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> A new power to give an indemnity against prosecution, to be known as a transactional indemnity, is also to be conferred upon the Director. Again, it is proposed that this power be exercised personally by the Director. </PARA>
<PARA>National Crime Authority Act</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for some fine tuning of the NCA Act. The inter-governmental committee on the National Crime Authority has recently concluded that there is a need to clearly establish the management responsibility of the chairman, while preserving the inquiry powers of other members. The Act is to be amended to make the Chairman responsible for the day-to-day management of the Authority with the power to make or delegate decisions in appropriate circumstances, give directions and undertake activities that are required to perform the functions of the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> Certain Commonwealth agencies which are currently subject to s.19a of the NCA Act, which provides certain bodies with a discretion to provide information to the Authority upon request, will be made subject to sections 28 and 29 which enable the Authority to require the furnishing of information or production of documents at hearings. These agencies are operating as financial or quasi-commercial enterprises in the private sector and will be accorded similar status under the Act to private organisations in those fields. This is consistent with the Government's policy with regard to Government business enterprises.

<PARA> That Government Business, Order of the Day No. 1 (Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 and related Bills) be postponed till a later hour of the day. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is requesting this postponement so as to give the Opposition time to prepare amendments to attempt to correct the chaos caused by its bungled amendments of last week. For almost 12 months since the Government announced this package and this policy-indeed, right until 9 May this year-there was no suggestion that the Opposition would oppose any of these Bills. Indeed, there was no suggestion in a sequence of statements and reports to the shadow Cabinet meeting on 6 May 1988, from the reported recommendation from Mr Connolly to the shadow Cabinet in June 1988 and the fact that industry representatives had advised the Government that Mr Connolly's office had told them the same thing during 1988 and, finally, from the Opposition's retirement income policy, that the Opposition would be opposing the policy then proposed by the Government. Quite the contrary-there was a sequence of statements indicating support. Mr Connolly's excuse for the eleventh hour change is that he did not have the legislation until this year, which is true. However, the principles were spelt out very clearly in the statement by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) of May last year-in particular, the principle which the Opposition is now amending which is that superannuation fund income would be taxed at a concessional rate and that tax liability could be wiped out by the receipt of a sufficient volume of franked dividends. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment which the Opposition has proposed destroys the logic and the symmetry of the package. There are a number of possibilities. The first is that the amendment was a cheap, cynical stunt designed to ingratiate the Opposition with some of the sleazier sections of the industry, not expecting, of course, that the Australian Democrats would support it. Secondly, in a biblical sense, it was a case of `Forgive them, for they know not what they do'. That is, the Opposition left the carriage of this matter to a lightweight member of the front bench who does not understand it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition certainly demonstrated its incompetence in this area by introducing an amendment last Thursday night although half the industry was left out of its ambit. It is that damage-that bungling incompetence-which the Opposition now seeks an opportunity to have time to correct. Incidentally for the record, Mr Connolly now admits that, having attempted on Friday to deny that half the industry was left out and having asserted that I owed the Parliament an explanation for not pointing out the defects in the amendment. May I say, in response to that, that I am always pointing out to the Opposition its mistakes, but it is either too malevolent or too stupid to take any notice. </PARA>
<PARA> Presumably, the amendments which the Opposition is trying to prepare are aimed at extending the exemptions, which it moved and had carried in the Senate on Thursday night, to pooled trusts and life offices. If that is the case, it will again reveal the Opposition's incompetence, because last Thursday night it voted against an amendment moved by Senator Haines to extend, for a limited period, exemption to pooled trusts. If the Opposition is to come back, seeking to extend the ambit of its amendment to pooled trusts, I hope it will also explain why it voted against the same amendment when it was moved by Senator Haines last Thursday night. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make three principal points concerning the policy issues covered by the Opposition's amendments. The amendments proposed by the Opposition, relative to the policy proposed by the Government, will have these effects--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose, thanks to Senator Bishop, that I was given the opportunity during Question Time to spell out the policy issues. So, I have referred to them in some detail already. I hope, firstly, that when the Opposition comes back with its amendments it manages to get them right in the sense that they will say what the Opposition wants them to say. That would be in marked contrast to what the Opposition did last time. Secondly, I put it to the Australian Democrats: how could they vote for an amendment which will favour investment by Australian superannuation funds in foreign companies instead of Australian companies; which favours debt instruments, instead of equity; which favours investment in central business districts and other real estate instead of investment in productive enterprise; and, above all, which would induce superannuation funds to go into joint ventures instead of taking corporate equity, thereby escaping any taxing point and eroding-probably at an accelerating rate-the corporate tax base? The Government's position on those amendments has been made perfectly clear and I trust we can at least deal with the legislation before we rise tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In seeking to postpone this debate, Senator Walsh has indulged in his usual vitriolic abuse as distinct from substance. It is interesting to point out that the Government has had 12 months in which to consider this legislation; senators have had only days to come to terms with it since its introduction into this place from the House of Representatives. It is interesting to note that the Government has tax drafting experts instructed by high level officers from the Australian Taxation Office to do this kind of work. It is not easy, and it is not getting any easier, with the complicated legislation which this Government chooses to bring in, to have amendments dealt with in a short, easy and accurate manner. It is interesting that in the lower House the same amendments were moved and, at no point, did the Government draw attention to the so-called technical deficiency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to ask Senator Walsh two questions: Firstly, when did the Government discover these impediments and when did Senator Walsh personally find out about them? Secondly, did he merely choose not to do anything about them until last Thursday night because it was a good, technical debating technique not to encourage good and honest debate but, in his usual cynical way, somehow to disrupt debate and not bring good legislation into this place? The Clerks of the Parliament have had to consult draftsmen for the simple reason that these areas are so complex and the Government so devious that there is an absolute need to use experts from outside this Parliament. I repeat: the Government has had high level expert officers in the Taxation Office to advise it, yet it could not pick up the so-called technical flaw until after 10 o'clock last Thursday evening. </PARA>
<PARA> It is just not good enough, Minister. It is not good enough for the Government to have 12 months in which to draft legislation and then, at the end of the session, to rush it through the House of Representatives and introduce it into the Senate. The Government thinks that it can bluff its way through. It was too smart by half by not bringing anybody's attention to the so-called flaw. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, the good Minister asked why it was that we did not support the Democrats' amendments last Thursday night. We did not do so for a good and reasonable reason. Very simply, Senator Walsh chose, in his remarks to the Democrats' amendments and our amendments, to raise a point that we could not authenticate. It could have been that the Minister was, in his wily way, introducing yet another red herring. We had no evidence with which to establish that what he said was in any way accurate. Because of the nature of the way in which the Minister deals with matters in this chamber, nobody can be blamed for believing that there might not be substance in his allegations about the technical flaw. Nor did we know at that stage, even if he were correct, whether the Democrats' amendments would address that so-called technical flaw. Accordingly, the decision was taken that we ought not support the Democrats' amendments, that they would be better dealt with if deliberate attention were given to them. That is the situation which we are in now and that is why the Minister is seeking to have the legislation dealt with at a different time. That is the one sensible decision which has come out of this debate so far.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats cannot see any point in delaying debate on this legislation. Delay will cause only additional problems for the industry. Our position has been, and still is, perfectly clear. We spoke to the Government last July about our concerns. I have taken on board Senator Walsh's oft repeated comments about debt versus equity, and he is certainly right in his interpretation of our concerns. But here we were faced with a situation where one principle that we supported, namely, encouraging Australian life and superannuation funds to invest in Australian companies rather than going offshore, was running slap into another concern, namely that, contrary to the comments of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) that nobody would be one cent worse off under this legislation, large numbers of people who had taken early retirement and rolled over their superannuation payouts into fixed interest funds would be several thousand dollars worse off over the next couple of years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We told the Government last July that, if we could quarantine those people, it would get its earnings tax on the other funds. We told the Government that in July; we told it that in August; we told it every month through until we rose in December, and we told it again this year. The Government broke off discussions last week, presumably because it thought that the Opposition would go to water, as it had already done on the health reinsurance fund and on the wheat legislation, to say nothing of voting against its own amendments on the privacy legislation last year. So I guess there was some justification for the Government not undertaking any discussions with the Australian Democrats with regard to ensuring that those people who had rolled over their generally small lump sum superannuation payments into fixed interest funds would not be disadvantaged. The fact is that by their very nature fixed interest funds are not in a position to take advantage of imputation and, therefore, the people who had invested in those funds would be worse off. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Government essentially is saying is that people will be disadvantaged for being safety conscious, for wanting their lump sums to be protected for their post-retirement income. It is no good the Government saying that those people should go into capital guaranteed funds. Many of those have a 40 per cent exposure to the share market. I can see no real reason for us to delay this legislation. Either there is a principle involved in not dealing harshly with people who put security first, or there is not. If there is, the Government will accept our amendments to quarantine those people aged 55 and over who have already put their lump sum payments into those funds. If the Government does that, that is the end of the matter. There will be no need to proceed with any amendment from the Opposition, regardless of its merit as far as drafting is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple matter that we are concerned about is that, if it is possible to give life and superannuation funds the incentive to invest in Australian companies instead of going offshore, while at the same time protecting the investment of those people who have chosen safety over risk and who, after early retirement, have put their funds into fixed interest funds, that is the way we should go. That is what this place and this Parliament are here for. It would certainly keep the Treasurer to his promise that nobody would be a dollar worse off. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to intervene in this debate in part because of the attack which the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, made upon the Opposition, which is wrong in fact and, in many respects, quite unfounded, but also because I want to place on the record a request to the Government that might enable us to deal with this complex and important legislation in a more orderly and satisfactory way. The problems that the Parliament faces at the moment and that are now faced by the life insurance industry and potentially by some citizens simply flow back to the Government's tendency to legislate by press release.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have here a complex set of proposals announced not by the introduction of legislation but by the issue of a statement by the Treasurer (Mr Keating), followed by about a year's delay before the details of those changes were put before the Parliament and hence before the Australian people and the industry. When the Treasurer made his statement in May 1988, it was immediately made clear by the Opposition that it had reservations about the Government's proposals. This is one of the points where Senator Walsh was inaccurate in what he said a few minutes ago. Within 48 hours of the Treasurer's statement, the honourable member for Bradfield, Mr Connolly, pointed out that, whilst the Treasurer had claimed that no-one would be worse off, in fact it was extremely likely that individual Australians would be worse off. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Connolly expanded on that in a speech that he made on 26 July 1988 at a seminar run by Price Waterhouse Urwick. The speech was released and I understand that it received some publicity. Mr Connolly pointed out that the Treasurer's statement that no-one would be worse off was not accurate and that the new taxation arrangements would fall heaviest on blue-collar workers, skilled tradesmen and small business people trying to provide for their retirement income. I remind the Minister that the important point that was made by Mr Connolly at that time was under the heading `Passage of Budget Bills' when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition parties have respected the right of government to pass through Parliament key elements of its Budget package. While we continue to support this principle, let there be no doubt that the Liberal and National parties would expect the appropriate superannuation legislation to meet the letter of the Treasurer's unambiguous commitment that `the new taxation measures would not reduce an individual end benefit pay-out by one cent'. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Connolly went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>If he is unable to meet this commitment, or make the necessary amendments to ensure that he does, the government has no right to expect that the Opposition will support automatically the easy passage of this legislation through the Parliament. We will not be a party to perpetrating a fraud on the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA>It has never been the Opposition's position that this was legislation that it was not entitled to amend. After it had taken the Government a year to produce this complex package of legislation, and after it had given the Opposition a few days in which to respond to it, the Opposition moved an amendment in the House of Representatives which made it clear that it was seeking to threaten only one of the four taxation elements of this package. </PARA>

If we are to deal with this complex legislation in a satisfactory way, it will require a bit of self-control on his part. The point is, as I think eventually Senator Walsh conceded in his response to the supplementary question put to him, that the Opposition amendments do not touch the major source of finance that flows from this legislation, the tax which is imposed on the payments which are made--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister intervenes `not in the short term'. The fact is that it is quite clear that the Minister and the Government would have estimates from the Treasury and from other officials as to how this alleged $1.4 billion, which will be raised by the superannuation package, is made up. It is the clear view of the Opposition that the amendment that we are moving touches a relatively small part of the revenue raised by these Bills. It would assist the public understanding of this legislation if, before the Bills come back for debate, the Minister were to make the facts clear instead of suggesting, as he did last Friday and which resulted in a lot of newspaper publicity, that the Opposition was in some way putting under threat a whole lot of things, including the taxation treatment of lump sum payments which have already been received since this legislation was announced, the deductability of superannuation payments which have been made in excess of $1,500 by the self-employed and so on. The Minister knows that the Opposition's amendments do not touch those matters. If the Minister was being honest in the matter he would have said, `If the Opposition succeeds in amending this relatively small part of the legislation-which we do not like because we say it destroys the symmetry of the legislation-we, the Government, will as a matter of pique refuse to pass the rest of the legislation'. This will impose terrible penalties on half a million Australians and will cause great administrative inconvenience to those life insurance companies which have geared up their operations in line with the announcements made by the Government in a statement over a year ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is approaching the Senate on the basis of putting political pressure on us not to do our duty. The Government says that the Senate should not be permitted to review this legislation or to make any suggestions because, if it does, the Government will take its bat and ball home and impose great hardship on a whole series of individuals in the community. That is an unworthy and stupid approach on the part of the Government. I hope that the Minister might reconsider it. The Opposition will insist on a proper consideration of its amendments in a cool and reasonable way so that a proper judgment on the public interest can be made and so that the public are able to make the same judgment. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to what Mr Connolly has said was an error in the amendment that was moved in the House of Representatives-an amendment which has been in the hands of the Government for some time and which, according to Senator Walsh in his interjection, he did not know about until last Thursday when the legislation was debated. This is very complex legislation. The Opposition has had amendments prepared by the parliamentary draftsman, Mr Geoff Harders. I am advised by Mr Connolly that Mr Harders's advice is that, due to the complexity of the Bills, he cannot guarantee that the amendments would withstand the most intense scrutiny and that it would take a week's work to give that sort of guarantee. I want to put on the public record the suggestion of Mr Harders that he and members of the Opposition should have access to the parliamentary draftsman who prepared the Bill and the instructing officer of the Australian Taxation Office for the purpose of preparing amendments which would ensure that the Opposition's intentions are effected. </PARA>
<PARA> It is notorious that under this Government tax legislation in this country has become virtually unintelligible. Tax accountants are unable to keep track of it. Lawyers find it difficult in the extreme to be sure that they are dealing with the law in any definite way because of its volume and complexity. The Government is indulging in pathetic and base games in this Parliament to ignore those very real difficulties and to make, as the Minister did last Friday, serious misrepresentations of what the Opposition was doing. I do not blame the media who misreported this issue. It is good that the Age newspaper at least managed to get behind the Minister's farrago and to report the matter accurately. I do not blame those journalists who reported it otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is beyond the comprehension of most tax lawyers and accountants. The Minister misrepresented the Opposition by suggesting that a lot of evil results would flow from the Opposition's amendment when, in fact, those evil results flow from the Government's decision, if taken, that an amendment to a relatively small part of this legislation would lead to the whole legislation being withheld-not by the Opposition but by the Government. That is what Senator Walsh withheld from the Australian people. It was not the linking of the Australian Democrats with the Opposition that would have this effect; it was the Government's pique in withholding this legislation. This legislation properly should be stood over so that a little more light and a little less heat can be placed on it. </PARA>
<PARA> Retirement incomes are of fundamental importance to everybody in Australia. There is intense interest in the community, not just among those who are nearly retired but also among those who are looking at a lifetime of work ahead of them, to know what the situation is with respect to their eventual retirement benefits. This Government is making superannuation somewhat less attractive by the additional revenue that it is taking out of the system and the additional taxes that it is imposing. It is doing this in a way which is proving to be complex and confusing for the industry and for superannuants. It is now expecting the Parliament to deal with those matters in a peremptory way and is then criticising the Opposition for the difficulties we face. It is a pathetic failure of responsibility on the part of the Government to legislate properly and to give this Parliament a chance to do its duty. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Walsh's demeanour during Question Time and during the debate this afternoon is an indication that it is not a matter of suggesting that Senator Bishop should not be dealing with this legislation on behalf of the Opposition. It is time that someone with a slightly calmer temperament, and a greater sense of the public interest than Senator Walsh appears to have today, was put in charge of this legislation. I never thought I would invite Senator Bolkus to assume these responsibilities, but I ask him to do so, since he is the Minister at the table, so that a Minister who is capable of being a little more rational and sensible in these matters can look after them. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a large legislative program. Senator Walsh, by his performance, has again led us to take more time than any of us would have wished to go through the procedure of having this legislation stood over for a time so that it can be dealt with properly. I formally repeat my request that, rather than engage in the sort of nonsense that we have seen in this chamber, the Minister should make available--</PARA>

We believe that a tiny proportion of that will be affected-somewhere between $20m and $120m, a large sum of money but very small in comparison to the $1.4 billion total-by the measures which the Opposition is supporting and for which, for a variety of reasons, we have gained the support of the Australian Democrats.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the telecommunications package of Bills, a very significant package but ultimately one that is very disappointing because it represents the outcome of high expectations created by this Government. The statement which the then Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Gareth Evans, delivered on 25 May 1988 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In describing the Government's third-term agenda, the Prime Minister has given greatest emphasis to micro-economic policy: the structural adjustment of key industries, and the relationships between them, with a view to establishing and sustaining longer term growth . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian telecommunications services industry is well placed to make a major contribution to these goals of efficiency and trade competitiveness in the information economy . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The second reading speech of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) is in like vein. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Government released a policy statement . . . was an integral part of the Government's third term micro-economic agenda, which emphasised the need to improve the efficiency of our economic infrastructure . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian telecommunications industry is of strategic importance to both the manufacturing and service sectors of the Australian economy. It is a key to export led growth. The importance of information industries in the world economy is growing. The world's telecommunications market is currently estimated at around $400 billion per annum, more than computing, pharmaceuticals or air travel. The Australian market is about 2.5 per cent of the world market or $10 billion. Australia's telecommunications industry must be established on a sound and efficient basis, so that it can adapt to changing technologies and user needs. This will contribute to Australia's ability to compete effectively in the rapidly growing world market. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of high rhetoric that accompanies this package. One might reasonably expect that the Government would have delivered the goods, but sadly that is not so. Perhaps the high watermark of rhetoric was delivered by the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, Mrs Kelly, who was reported in the Australian Financial Review of 15 May last as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> I think we are on the verge of revolutionising the telecommunications industry in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>If Mrs Kelly was talking about this package of Bills she was deluding herself; she was certainly not deluding the Australian community. The reality is that what will be in place once this package of Bills goes through is perhaps the most conservative and regulated telecommunications environment amongst developed countries in the Western world. One does not have to look just at New Zealand, which is probably the high water mark of deregulation. Indeed, one can understand the desperation that drives the Labor Government in that country to throw open the floodgates. But, if one looks around the world, one finds that the rest of the world is moving rapidly into a competitive environment whilst Australia is locked firmly into the monopoly mould. Japan, the United States of America and the United Kingdom all made strategic decisions at least five years ago to enter into a brave new world of competition, and they are reaping the rewards. Now we find that even the European Community, with 1992 in mind, is very much concerned to deregulate. It has decided that the monopoly presently available to the postal, telegraph and telephone utilities, PTTs, should be confined to switched voice, and should not include data and text. Indeed, the American situation since divestiture in 1984 has shown dramatic growth. There are now three long distance carriers competing frantically amongst themselves: American Telephone and Telegraph, with about 70 per cent of the market; MCI with about 10 per cent; and Sprint with about 8 to 10 per cent. They are all thriving, as indeed are the hundreds of local telecommunications companies and all 22 of the regional Bell operating companies. It is quite clear that Americans are reaping the benefits of those dramatic changes. The Business/Finance section of the International Herald Tribune of 23 May last, states:</PARA>
<PARA>Long distance is the growth industry of the 1990s, and we have only just begun to scratch the surface. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Deregulation brought in some five years ago, has seen the three leading American long distance telephone companies finding that business is booming. Rates for calls are steadily dropping and the demand is exploding for such services as toll-free 800 numbers-</PARA>
<PARA>that is 008 in our language-</PARA>
<PARA>computer data lines, facsimile transmission and international calling. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of long-distance transmissions in the United States, both domestic and international, has increased 46 per cent in the past five years. </PARA>
<PARA> The fibre-optic lines owned by the phone companies are being used by an increasing number of corporations and financial institutions to transmit huge amounts of data domestically and overseas. A five-minute day-time call from New York to Los Angeles costs $1.26, down from $2.70 five years ago. Facsimile machines are turning up everywhere. In two years, the number of these machines in the United States has doubled, to an estimated one million units. With rates down about 40 per cent since the break-up of the Bell system in 1984, residential customers are dialling outside their area codes more frequently than every before. Analysts predict that long-distance revenues, which reached $50 billion in 1988, are expected to approach $60 billion this year, up from $33 billion in 1984 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear that the explosion in the United States has not seen any deterioration in the financial situation of those companies operating in the long distance markets. Quite the contrary, there has been an enormous expansion of demand, which they are meeting. It is clear that competition in the United States has delivered significant benefits to the community. A duopoly in the United Kingdom has been in place for some five years. The result is that British Telecom (BT) still has about 95 per cent of the market, but Mercury as a niche marketer is increasing competition in the central business district of London and the major provincial cities. It is quite clear that Mercury will continue to expand and put pressure on BT, particularly to bring down its rates. Anyone who understands anything about contestable market theory will know that even the mere threat of the entry of a new carrier can often be sufficient to drive those rates down towards market levels. Japan similarly has four or five long distance carriers, all thriving despite the fact that NTT is by far the dominant carrier and occupies in excess of 95 per cent of the market. But again, its rates are being forced down by its smaller competitors. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at Europe and at the major industrialised countries of the Western world, we find that they are all in the process of liberalising their markets. Sweden and the United Kingdom are about to liberalise resale and shared use of circuits this month. Sweden already has a second cellular mobile phone service provider, a second international operator. Most other developed countries have at least two cellular mobile telephone service providers. What does Australia have? As a result of this package, Australia will have the greatest degree of formal protection ever provided to a dominant carrier. In many senses this package of legislation, particularly the Telecommunications Bill, can be described as the Telecom monopoly preservation package. The package does that. Whilst it purports to define the monopoly areas for the Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (OTC) and Aussat Pty Ltd, they are defined in terms which protect Telecom. That is the tragedy of this whole package, because Telecom does not need that protection. Telecom is a very aggressive and effective competitor. It is a lion locked in a cage of the Government's own making. If it were able to roam the competitive jungles, I have no doubt at all that it would thrive. But because this Government is driven by an unholy desire to pander to the left wing of the Australian Labor Party, the anti-privateers, those members of Caucus who live in rural areas and a whole range of nervous nellies, the end result is that it is not prepared to recognise the competitive advantages that every other country is increasingly acknowledging. </PARA>
<PARA> Where are we? In the world context we are in company with countries such as Turkey, Greece and Portugal, all of which are, in effect, developing countries, although in the European Community. They have penetration rates of about 50 per cent of households, whereas our rate is about 94 per cent. So those countries can perhaps be excused until such time as they get to the point where they have effectively household saturation. We were at that point perhaps as recently as 1970, but there has been an enormous change since that time. Particularly in the last 10 years there has been an explosion of telecommunication services and a rapid dismantling of protective barriers. But this Government chooses to put its head in the sand and ignore all of those developments. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a tragedy not just for the industry, not just for Telecom, but for the Australian community, because it is quite clear in my view that Telecom would prosper in a highly competitive environment. Telecom has a very good board, a very competent and capable chief executive officer, who has recently been reappointed, and it has a number of very senior people who would be able to take advantage of the enormous market opportunities which would open up if it were placed in a competitive environment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is really very disappointing to find that the sorts of specious arguments that are used to justify the retention and expansion of Telecom's monopoly derive from the so-called May statement of 1988, which I find internally inconsistent in its logic and in many ways perhaps so conservative as to be unbelievable. I will give a couple of examples, because it is the May statement which drives this Bill. Paragraph 3.7 states:</PARA>
<PARA> There are two fundamental considerations in determining appropriate boundaries to the monopoly areas. First, the infrastructure itself, or certain parts of it, may-</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the word `may'-</PARA>
<PARA>possess `natural monopoly' attributes as a result of pervasive economies of scale and scope. </PARA>
<PARA>Well, the natural monopoly argument is totally discredited in this area. It may have had some validity prior to the advent of optical fibre, but the reality is that no other country recognises the validity of the natural monopoly, and nor does the Australian Government or its advisers have the temerity to suggest that is does; it simply `may'. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> In these circumstances, any competing provision could lead to long-term inefficiency, in the form of excess capacity and the uneconomic duplication of facilities. In addition, relying on market forces to resolve infrastructure issues may have other undesirable outcomes . . . </PARA>
<PARA>3.8 Secondly, competitive provision of certain services may be inconsistent with the Government objective of maintaining and extending universal service, in the sense of ensuring broad access to telecommunications throughout the national territory and to all sections of the community. This inconsistency arises from the pursuit of universal access through a price structure that contains extensive cross-subsidies, both between and within services, that may not be sustainable in an unregulated commercial market. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a disgrace. In terms of logic and commonsense, the Government and its advisers do not have the courage even to make these assertions without pathetic qualifications. These are to be put as a collection of shibboleths to pander to those in the Government who are not game to bite the bullet. I do not include the Senator Walterses of this world in that category. It is quite clear with the statements that have been made, even by the very cautious and conservative Mr Willis, that he has now seen the light, that he has joined the bulk of the economic rationalists in the Cabinet who acknowledge not just the need but the imperative for competition to drive government business enterprises. That is the only way one can guarantee effective and efficient outcomes. One really has to ask why a document such as this is couched in such careful and cautious tones. Why are there all these caveats? They are there for political reasons only. </PARA>
<PARA> This document is riddled with justifications for preserving the monopoly based on the need to preserve Telecom's community service obligations. What is the cost of those community service obligations? Telecom's revenue last year exceeded $8 billion. Its profit was up 19 per cent, to $776.2m. Telecom will be flat out keeping that profit figure below $1 billion in the next few weeks. It only achieved that figure below $1 billion last year because of some pretty fancy accounting techniques which managed to turn depreciation on motor vehicles, plant and equipment the preceding year from $25m to a figure in excess of $350m. In other words, Telecom's profit figure last year should have been about $1.3 billion. Unless it manages to discover any more creative accounting approaches, it will be of that order this year. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking about a gigantic enterprise-whose staff is about three times the size of the Australian Army and which has operations about twice the size of the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd-somehow needing some protection from the rest of the world, the rest of the Australian community, and all those others who are desperate to get into the game. What is the cost of those community service obligations? We simply do not know. We know that in 1982 Davidson said that he could not get to the bottom of the figure and recommended that an accounting inquiry be conducted. Telecom did not want to take that hint so it was left to Ergas in 1987 to say that, similarly, he found it very difficult to get to the bottom of the figures. </PARA>
<PARA> So we limped on to the May statement which, of course, arose after nine months of intensive effort on the part of a task force consisting of a range of experts in the community, all of whom had very good credentials for making judgments about these matters. What did that task force then discover about the cost of community service obligations (CSOs)? This is what came out in the May statement, at paragraph 3.40:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not clear how much economic loss actually arises from the current pattern of cross-subsidisation . . . it is not possible to sufficiently disentangle separate service costs within Telecom's present management information and accounting system to enable a reliable calculation of the costs or levels of these cross-subsidies or to enable proper consideration of possible alternative service-delivery arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>Telecom's figure to the task force was $670m. The task force's official estimate was an alternative figure of $250m. What was the outcome? The May statement said that the Government would commission the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics to conduct its own survey, with the assistance of Telecom, and report to the Government by January of this year. It is now June and that report still has not been presented. I think that the Government is now finding itself in an intolerable position trying to defend its decision to keep the results of that survey private. I think it will now be forced to publish that figure. As a result, it is now desperately trying to inflate the figure. My suspicion is that the figure is something in the order of $200m, which would be consistent with the official finding referred to by the task force. It probably goes a long way to explaining why it has taken so long for the task force's report to surface at all. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to be taken into account in the corporate plan which Telecom will have to provide to the Minister in the not too distant future, it is very important indeed that he have that figure as well. It is even more important that he should follow the practice of Australian National, formerly the Australian National Railways, which publishes its corporate plan, of Sweden's Televerket, which publishes both its level of CSOs and its corporate plan. I hope that the Government will have the good sense to come clean on those items. Unless it does, it will be fuelling the inevitable conclusion that one must reach, that the cost of Telecom's CSOs and the level of cross-subsidies is pretty small beer-nowhere near sufficient to justify the range of monopoly protections contained in this package. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an absolute disgrace to find that the Caucus liaison committee, the anti-privateers, the Public Service unions and that whole clutch of conservatives on the other side of the chamber were able to succeed not only in protecting the basic network as a monopoly but also in going beyond that point so that non-core services such as public switched data services and public switched text and video are also getting protection. Why should public mobile telephone services be protected? The May statement is flat out justifying that. It is quite clear from the verbal contortions that the task force itself thought that that should be a competitive service. </PARA>
<PARA> Now Austel will have to review the situation but I do not have any confidence that that will emerge into competition in the near future. Looking at leased circuit services, again Sweden and the United Kingdom are prepared to allow competition in those areas, but they are heavily protected. Again there is no reason why integrated service digital network should be protected. Why on earth should public telephones be protected in this country? They can be provided by others quite simply and cheaply. A whole range of alternative cabinets and telephones can be made available. There can be minimum requirements for locations so that those who need telephones in particular areas, such as rural areas, can be assured of easy access. There is absolutely no reason at all why we need to have a monopoly on those services any more than on CT2s, or telepoints, when the Government eventually gets around to allowing them to proliferate. </PARA>
<PARA> We find here a very cautious and conservative document. We welcome the establishment of Austel. Austel has a whole range of charter obligations, but nowhere does one find an obligation to act in a pro-competitive manner. As far as this Government is concerned, Austel is about protecting the Telecom monopoly, defining the boundaries and making sure that no-one infringes them. I regard that as a very negative and inward looking approach. The first phone monopoly is another outrageous monopoly protected area. While the Government pays lip service to the need for a review by June of 1991, it is quite clear that, despite costs to the Australian consumer of the order of $250m, the unions will not have a bar of that being made open to competitive and enterprising technicians as occurs in many other countries. So we have a very heavily protected new environment, one that is at odds with the approach adopted in the rest of the world. We also find that there is a whole new system of licence arrangements for value added services, for private network services and customer cabling. Most of those are unnecessary. They are bureaucratic responses which are, in a sense, a self-justification. They provide the opportunity to raise fees on the time-honoured principle that where you see a service you tax it. They will then become self-fulfilling, perhaps even to the point where they start to raise revenue for the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The alternative approach would have been much simpler, cheaper and more effective-to give Austel the power to seek an injunction to restrain any potential infringement, to prosecute and to require that damages be paid if there is any infringement. But no, the alternative approach has been adopted where anyone seeking to vary a class licence has to get permission not only from Austel but effectively from Telecom because it has to be put in the picture at the outset. That raises very serious concerns about competition because it clearly puts Telecom in a position to become aware of any new developments or new technological devices. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have any confidence in the Chinese wall; I do not see any reason at all why Telecom should have that privileged position and premature access to information. Austel's charter, if it is allowed to operate in the way that the Government has promised and not in the way that the structural adjustment committee would like it to operate-and that is, by reducing its budget by the order of $1m and reducing its staff from 70 to 58-will still be swamped by a whole set of technical requirements. It will not be spending much time on policy issues. Even if it does, the Minister has power to give directions to absolutely emasculate it if it ever gets out of line. I have a great deal of confidence that Robin Davey, the Chairman designate of Austel, will bring a degree of intellectual rigour to the task of ensuring that Telecom does not get a free ride. But I fear the worst, particularly with Mr Willis. If there is any indication that Austel might be flexing its muscles or that Telecom might be brought back to the field, I fear that the Government will give directions to expand Telecom's community service obligations, as a specious justification, in the way that the Commission for the Future set out to do before it got kicked to death. I would hope that the Government will not give any such directions, but again I have no confidence that that will be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a series of subsidiary Bills which are also relevant to Telecom. There is one in relation to Australia Post which again simply expands the ambit of Australia Post's operations-the fines, the letter monopoly-in a way that I regard as unnecessary. It gives it opportunities to expand its services into couriers and mail houses, which are quite amply serviced by the private sector. Australia Post should be required to publish its CSOs. Indeed, Austel's obligations should extend to supervising Australia Post in due course. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of areas where the Government has simply come up with a whole new series of formulae designed to disguise the fact that this is a bureaucratic and anti-competitive solution to the need for change in the telecommunications industry. Consumer price index minus X, the price factor, may well be some degree of improvement on rate of return regulation, but at the end of the day it is not a free market answer. It does not do anything more than pay lip service to the need for competition. Indeed, the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) recently found that Telecom's total factor productivity over the last decade has been of the order of 5.4 per cent per annum. So it is quite clear that Telecom could have accommodated a `factor X' of at least 5 per cent. But no, the Government has again cosseted it from reality and competition by giving it a 4 per cent figure. </PARA>
<PARA> The IAC's draft report on international trade in services quotes, and presumably therefore endorses, the Australian Institute for Public Policy claim that the efficiency of Telecom is about 20 per cent below that of its Canadian counterpart and that $250m is a conservative estimate of the welfare cost of Telecom's pricing policies. It also mentions the fact that Telecom milks OTC quite unjustifiably to the tune of about $60m to $70m for charges that it levies supposedly for administration expenses, for billing OTC customers, when in fact the cost would be well below $10m. It does that by charging fees as the rate of either 21c or 31c a minute for the connection of long distance calls when they should not be charged at any more than the local call rate. </PARA>
<PARA> In passing, it is of interest that the Prices Surveillance Authority has today disallowed Australia Post's application for an increase and has deferred any further consideration of the matter for at least two months. I regard this package as worthy of deferral because it does not address any of the fundamental issues. It will not do anything to enhance Australia's competitiveness. It will not give Telecom the opportunity to get out there and compete on the world stage in the way that it is more than capable of doing. It will simply encourage Telecom to try to knock off Aussat wherever possible, to try to get into joint ventures to pre-empt competition in the private sector wherever possible and to go on justifying its whole range of indefensible monopoly areas on the specious basis of community service obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> The sooner the figure is out in the public domain the better, because we will then realise that, if necessary, Telecom could absorb that figure without any form of compensation. Even if it were to be provided with compensation, there are mechanisms that would be readily available to ensure that there was no reduction in services in rural areas or, indeed, no reduction in prices. That can be done simply by capturing those technological gains that are readily available and, hopefully, some of the productivity gains that this Government refuses to force on Telecom, particularly in the customer access network. </PARA>
<PARA> So at the end of the day what we have is a very disappointing response to a very dynamic environment. We have a recipe for conservatism and so-called efficiency at the expense of the real virtues of competition and a failure to come to grips with what is happening in the rest of the world. It is a politics driven solution to a very important business problem where costs are increasingly becoming important in export competition terms. All that we find here is a recipe for driving those costs up as much as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that the creation of Austel is about the only worthwhile outcome from this package. Austel's prospects of success are very much in the balance. I do not believe that it will get any sympathy or support from the Government if it tries to step out of line. At the end of the day, what we will find is a telecommunications industry that will be waiting for the day when there is a change of government when it and Telecom and the other carriers can truly enjoy the virtues of real competition. In regard to the Australian Telecommunications Corporations, Bill 1989, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate criticises the Government for its failure to specify or detail the exact nature or extent of the community services obligations of Telecom''. </PARA>
<PARA>In regard to the Telecommunications Bill 1989, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate notes:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the Government's failure to introduce meaningful deregulation of, and competition into, the Australian telecommunications industry; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) that while the monopolies proposed for the Telecommunications Carriers are based on the needs for cross subsidies to deliver on community service obligations:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the Government has nevertheless failed to specify or detail the exact nature or extent of the community service obligations of Telecom; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) no community service obligations are imposed on OTC or AUSSAT Pty Ltd so that there is no justification for OTC or AUSSAT remaining wholly in public ownership''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This package of telecommunications Bills has been promoted as one of the most significant reforms in Australian telecommunications since the formation of Telecom Australia in 1975. We all have our views on that. I suggest to the Senate that Senator Alston, on behalf of the Liberal-National coalition, would like to gut at least Telecom. The Government is simply after a few entrails by way of this package. On the other hand the Australian Democrats would like to see Telecom as a healthy, vitalised body and a major player in the telecommunications revolution which has already started in this information era.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Senate will be aware, the package arises from the Government's May 1988 statement called Australian Telecommunications Services: A New Framework, which was itself the product of a major review of telecommunications policy. I think it is worth paying some attention to that statement. In his foreword to the statement, the then Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Gareth Evans, noted the Government's emphasis on micro-economic policy reform-the structural readjustment of industry with a view to establishing and sustaining longer term growth. The statement emphasised goals of efficiency and competitiveness, balanced with the important social objectives associated with the central role of the telephone in the Australian community. More particularly, the policy articulated a number of objectives for its telecommunications policy. Those objectives were as follows: firstly, to ensure universal access to standard telephone services throughout Australia on an equitable basis and at affordable prices, in recognition of the social importance of these services; secondly, to maximise the efficiency of the publicly owned telecommunications enterprises, Telecom, the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC) and Aussat Pty Ltd, in meeting their objectives, including fulfilment of special community service obligations and the generation of appropriate returns on investment; thirdly, to ensure the highest possible levels of accountability and responsiveness to customer and community needs on the part of the telecommunications enterprises; fourthly, to provide the capacity to achieve optimal rates of expansion and modernisation of the telecommunications system, including the introduction of new and diverse services; fifthly, to enable all elements of the Australian telecommunications industry-manufacturing, services, information provision-to participate effectively in the rapidly growing Australian and world telecommunications markets; and, sixthly, to promote the development of other sectors of the economy through the commercial provision of a full range of modern telecommunications services at the lowest possible prices. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the statement's policy directives were implemented on 1 January this year, but major changes have really had to wait for translation into this legislation and, in particular, for the new administrative body, the Australian Telecommunications Authority, or Austel, to take over the present regulatory functions of Telecom. Upon the passage of the earlier legislation, the Australian Democrats went on record as being quite disturbed that the steps that were taken initially last year were taken without Austel being in place. We welcome this aspect of the legislation most warmly. I will have some more to say about that in a few moments. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one would argue that the implications of this package for both business and consumers, in what is a technologically complex and rapidly evolving industry, are quite enormous. In addition, the pressures emerging from each of these areas are in conflict in some respects and, as I said earlier, this is reflected in the postures adopted earlier by the different political parties in this place. The Government has deregulated as far as it dares at this stage. As we have heard in the past, and no doubt will hear again in the future, the Opposition wants to go much further down the deregulatory path-more and more so under the privatising hand of Senator Alston. The Australian Democrats want to ensure that this major public utility is recognised and protected as such and is structured in a way that efficiency is promoted and the interests of consumers and the general public are properly served. </PARA>
<PARA> While it is inevitable that no perfect solution can be found-and this package certainly needs clarification in a number of areas-the Democrats believe that the new regime will go a long way towards ensuring faster and clearer decision-making on new services and equal treatment for competing telecommunications service providers. Telecom's business competitors will no doubt take issue with that assessment on our behalf, but the operation of private networks and the ability to compete in value added services are extended under the deregulation in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point I would like to outline the key elements of the major Bill, the Telecommunications Bill, which are central to the whole package. They are: the establishment of the Australian Telecommunications Authority, Austel, as the telecommunications industry regulator, with both technical and economic regulatory functions; the definition of those telecommunications services which will, for reasons of network development and social objectives, be reserved to Telecom, OTC and Aussat; the creation of a streamlined licensing regime for other services which, combined with safeguards against discriminatory behaviour by the carriers, will allow free and fair competition in the provision of value added services and the efficient operation of approved private networks; the assurance of fair and open competition in the customer equipment market; and the provision of mechanisms to ensure that consumer interests are protected and the Government's social objectives achieved by the telecommunications industry. </PARA>
<PARA> From every point of view in that important range of measures the role of Austel is absolutely critical. As the new industry regulator outside the ambit of the carriers, Austel's operations will have a far-reaching impact on both the competition and consumer protection aspects of telecommunications in this country. We have a prospective chairman in Robin Davey. It is of concern to the Australian Democrats that the two further major appointments to be made in the two deputy chairmen must cover the full range of responsibilities, interests and expertise which will achieve all the policy directions outlined by the Government, particularly the consumer protection aspects about which we are so concerned. I will have a little more to say about that later. </PARA>
<PARA> Austel is expected to have about 70 people on its staff and will be closely involved in all aspects of the industry-from regulation, policing the monopoly rights of the big players to ensure that legitimate competition is not crushed, to setting standards for equipment to be attached to the communications network. One of Austel's prime roles-this is of particular concern to the Australian Democrats-is that of a consumer watchdog, monitoring and reporting on the performance of the carriers in their delivery of reserved services. Part of this role encompasses the administration of the Government's formula for price capping basic services to ensure that the average price of a basket of basic telecommunications services will fall in real terms. Effective price control is high on the agenda of the Australian Democrats' concerns, as it has been for the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations and others representing the interests of consumers. As this legislation is dealt with, we want to emphasise that Australia must avoid the problems which arose in Britain when its Oftel, the equivalent of Austel was set up and which took four years to correct. </PARA>
<PARA> Assurances were given in the May 1988 statement and I will be seeking specific comments from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade during the committee stage following last week's announcement of the formula. It has been a disappointment to some of us that we are looking at the price capping system with one basket comprising the formula. Given that the Government has made that decision, we believe that close scrutiny must be the order of the day. Voices from outside Austel will be heard where there is concern or if it looks as though we are getting into some of the problems which were experienced in the United Kingdom. If necessary, measures should be taken to redress the situation earlier than in the three-year time frame set. We do have the experience to guide us and we will be calling on the Government to use that experience and to ensure that we do not get into significant problems in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Austel also has the responsibility of reporting to government on Telecom's performance in meeting its community service obligations, including its responsibility to provide universal service and other socially necessary services, such as public telephones. It has been noted by more than one commentator that there is a growing realisation of the centrality of telecommunications in many aspects of social and economic life. This was acknowledged by the then Minister in his May 1988 statement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government is not the only government to have undertaken a major review of the communications sector, motivated by the very many new technological developments and the enormous potential for more. In fact, late last month I attended a Commission for the Future conference in Melbourne. It was quite clear from many of the presentations that public perceptions about this issue are quite extensive. At one presentation in particular verbal information was given to people at the workshop concerning the pilot stage of a very important research project which is currently being undertaken by Telecom. The presentation pointed out that public perceptions about the role of Telecom and, in particular, its community service obligations were really probably much further ahead of most politicians' perceptions of the public's view. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the public's view centres on a number of different areas; first of all on the technical components of the facilities which are involved. The public appears to believe that automatically universal access to local, subscriber trunk dialling (STD) and international subscriber dialling (ISD) facilities ought to be considered as part of the community service obligation. The public also expressed a very high consensus on the fact that itemisation of calls should be a basic component of a fair and efficient telephone service. As a parliamentarian, one of the most frequent complaints I receive, particularly in my role as communications spokesperson for the Democrats, is that itemisation of calls is not available. According to the brief information which we were given on a preliminary basis, this is an issue of high priority in the community. It is also interesting, though, to note in this context that itemisation appears to have been considered to be more important for STD calls than for ISD calls. This reflects something which was also reported on; that is, that as a service is diffused and more widely used in the community it then becomes considered more readily as a service to which there ought to be universal access. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area was the service component-people breaking down their approach to telecommunications services and simply saying that they require a fast and efficient service. I do not think that any politician is surprised at that. The third area was access. There seemed to be quite a high consensus of view that value added services of the kind which this legislation is designed to encourage, such as data transmission and so on, ought to be available to everybody who wants or needs it. The feeling in the general public seems to be that access to the newer types of service should be available, but on a user pays basis. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting-here I refer to a point I made a few moments ago-that as the service becomes more widely used it is apparent that it becomes more generally considered a basic service. Some examples given were some forms of data transmission and in particular the facsimile service. An increasing number of people believe that these sorts of services ought to be considered part of the basic service. It is important to note this in the context of this legislation. In fact, the more a service is widely diffused through the community the more it becomes considered something to which there ought to be universal access-in other words, part of Telecom's community service obligation. These findings are particularly significant because one of the points that the Australian Democrats wish to make most strongly about community service obligations is that we must do nothing in this legislation to prohibit the future possibility that any definition of community service obligations will be able to take account of the changing perceptions in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I interpolate some other comments that were made at the Commission for the Future workshop, which indeed brought together people from the academic sector, the political spectrum and so on in the telecommunications industry. It was said that in the whole consideration of community service obligations and in the context of this upcoming legislation we really need to think differently-from the Democrats' point of view that is a certainty-about these issues than we are, largely anyway, across the political spectrum at the moment. The point was made in general terms, in policy terms, by several people at the conference that-of course, we have just heard one speech by Senator Alston and we will hear one next by Senator Austin Lewis, which will confirm this view-we are in a reductionist era where we are limiting our views of many of these issues and community service obligations no less to the sort of economic side of the question. One speaker at the conference actually referred to that approach as silly. I suggest that it is in fact quite disastrous. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats say that to determine what ought to be the community service obligation of a public service provider such as Telecom we should establish first what kind of society we want and, in the case of telecommunications specifically, what kind of society we want in the area of telecommunications and information. We should then establish the economic ground rules and indeed establish the economy to provide that kind of society-not the other way around. As we in the Democrats have often said, and will continue to say-and I am delighted that another participant, although not a Democrat, at that conference said-we cannot and must not separate the social, economic and political aspects of issues such as these. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it disturbing that, particularly in the past few months and particularly this week here in this place, we have been going through a whole process of altering and, unfortunately we feel, moving towards the dismantling of public service organisations. If there is a change of government there is certainly no question of altering and dismantling public service instrumentalities and institutions-public community service bodies-in this country. What is being offered in their place? Senator Alston and his ilk, when referring to community service obligations made available through cross-subsidy up until now, tell us, `Let the organisation define how much it costs and then let the Government put it up front as a Budget item'-in other words, move away from the community service concept to a welfare service concept. They want the Government and Telecom to say how much it costs to serve country people, poor people, old people and deaf people and then put that figure up front as a welfare service every year as part of the political football of the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that we have to change our ways of thinking in this and a whole lot of other areas. We have to recognise the value of community service. In the case of this legislation specifically we must, as I said before, make sure that we take no action that will limit any possible interpretation or implementation of community service obligations of Telecom or any other public service organisation as the community at that time may wish to define it. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the sort of work that is coming out of the pilot project which Telecom has undertaken and which I have referred to briefly, it also seems that politicians need to open their eyes and ears a little more and listen to the public. If they did this they would not be trying to limit those definitions, as they are on both sides of the chamber, but most particularly the Opposition, thereby limiting the service available to all in the community. This is a matter of general concern to the Democrats. As I have said, in this place we are constantly talking about the need for these sorts of public services not to be sold off. The telecommunications industry is one that is burgeoning and one in which a great deal of money is to be made. There is nothing inherently wrong with that but we are saying that, as it develops and as that money is made, no-one in this community should be any less better served and everybody should be able to expect to be better served as time passes and as the telecommunications industry develops. </PARA>
<PARA> Going through my files on this issue I came across an article by Ian Davis in the Canberra Times of February last year. He talked about what happens when we let our community service infrastructure break down. Quite early in the article he states:</PARA>
<PARA> The roads of the British Empire-as of the Roman empire before it-were not simply well constructed public services . . . they were also a military asset.</PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on to point out what happens when public services, which are a vital part of any growing, well balanced economy, break down. It is interesting to note the ones that he refers to. Honourable senators should think of the list:</PARA>
<PARA>The breakdown in the sewerage system, which has led to the deterioration of Sydney's magnificent ocean beaches . . . the inability of telephone exchanges . . . to cope with demand for lines at times of peak demand-</PARA>
<PARA>This is the sort of problem we are trying to address in this legislation. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the progressive deterioration of agricultural land in the Murray River basin . . . the lack of an adequate airport in Sydney . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He then talks about the problems on the waterfront caused by inadequate facilities. He goes on to talk about Sydney's gas mains and so on. I make this point directly from the article. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . characteristic of the infrastructure of an economy is that it exists to support other economic or social activities rather than as an end in itself; that it has a relatively high initial capital cost; relatively long life; and should be managed and paid for on a long-term basis. </PARA>
<PARA>That sort of message is one that we really ought to recognise. We are talking about an investment in a public facility and a public utility which is there to serve the people, not there to serve the economy in the first instance. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to put on the record a comment made again last year by a former chief financial adviser to the Queensland Government, Sir Leo Hielscher. He spoke very strongly against the headlong rush into privatisation. I do so because of that rush, which is now being led from the front bench by Senator Alston and which, if it succeeds, inevitably will be to the detriment of the isolated and the less well-off in our community. Sir Leo said, inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . public bodies should be privatised only if they could better provide the services required. </PARA>
<PARA> And you have to remember that if you privatise a government instrumentality, you have to make it much more efficient and much more profitable to achieve an equivalent result . . . </PARA>
<PARA> As a private company, it will have to pay tax and then dividends, so it needs to make a lot more profit. </PARA>
<PARA>And so the article continued. Those are some of the points which, it appears, the Opposition is all too readily able to ignore. Those comments were made by a very longstanding public servant, having served a Queensland National Party government for many years. </PARA>
<PARA> It is significant that the Opposition's main complaint about the legislation is that it does not live up to the rhetoric contained in the May statement and even in some of the commentary, including the second reading speech of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray). Having looked closely at the legislation, we take considerable comfort from that fact. It is almost worth saying that it appears to those in the Australian Labor Party who are concerned, as are the Australian Democrats, about the issues of public and community service and access and equity in our democratic system, of which telecommunications is such an integral part, as too is the media-a battle which we have fought and been rolled on by the combined Government and Opposition-that rhetoric is all that has survived since the May statement. We take comfort from that. At the committee stage we will try to pin down some of those elements of the statements vis-a-vis those in the legislation in order to further comfort ourselves and others in the community who are concerned about possible deprivation, possible negative results of the legislation. In general terms, we believe that there has been sufficient movement since the 1988 May statement to introduce legislation, a package of which is before us today and which we have not felt moved to oppose. However, we do need some clarification at the committee stage of a number of areas, particularly the definitions of community service obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> We too have been critical, as have others in the community, about the very short time available for comment on the exposure draft of the legislation. While appreciating the process, only a few working days were available to us and others in the community who were concerned about the legislation. While the Government claims wide consultation, and to a degree can justify that claim, it is very important to note that only a relatively short period was allowed. However, since and during that time the Government took cognisance of a great many of the concerns of people in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats will not support the second reading attachments put forward by the Opposition, although probably we could do so. One of Senator Alston's second reading amendments asks the Senate to add the words:</PARA>
<PARA>but the Senate criticises the Government for its failure to specify or detail the exact nature of extent of the community services obligations of Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA>We could make a similar complaint, but we would be making it for the opposite reasons. Since it is not an infrequent occurrence for the Democrats to find themselves on the same side as the Opposition for all the wrong reasons, it is unnecessary for us to do so on this occasion because it would mean that I would have to reiterate all that I have said. If there is any need to seek more detail on the nature and extent of the community service obligations of Telecom, we will do so at the committee stage. However, we believe that, having looked at the whole package of legislation as well as at the Minister's statements in his second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum, in large measure we would not want to make that criticism. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I emphasise that that is very much dependent, as is the whole package, upon the workings of Austel, and that is very much dependent upon the appointments yet to be made at Austel. We believe that with appropriate appointments it will be a body able to advise government adequately. Government must take account of the community views which are coming through in research and publicly. In general terms, we support the passage of the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a package of Bills. Due to shortage of time it is necessary for us to consider Bills dealing with the industry, technology and commerce package and the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (SMEC) with the telecommunications package. I agree with Senator Powell's assessment of what is happening here-that from the coalition's point of view the Government is once again demonstrating that, while the rhetoric was there when the Government talked about what it would do in these areas, the legislation as produced in this Parliament does not live up to the rhetoric. I acknowledge that the Australian Democrats recognise that that is the point which we keep making about the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said repeatedly, the Government has failed to live up to the promise it made during the July 1987 election campaign that it would put down as a top priority for this nation-using the jargon of the time-micro-economic reform. However, what we are talking about is efficiency in government business enterprises, the introduction of competition into government business enterprises, and a reduction of regulations to enable private enterprises to compete adequately and, indeed, to enable public business enterprises to compete in a way which would keep down prices and provide a broad range of services for the people of Australia at reasonable prices instead of at regulated prices, which pushes prices up and lowers services. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government was full of rhetoric about that but the package of Bills which it has introduced does not live up to the rhetoric. Once again, the Government keeps talking about it. Over the weekend Mr Willis talked about the privatisation of Qantas Airways Ltd and Australian Airlines. That debate has been placed back into the public arena of the Australian Labor Party. But the Government has been talking about that for two years and has not acted. This parcel of legislation presented the Government with at least two opportunities on which to act in the privatisation field and one area in which it could have achieved substantial micro-economic reform. The first areas which presented opportunities for privatisation were in relation to the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) and SMEC. However, those opportunities were not picked up by the Government. Another area where there was a major opportunity to introduce competition and efficiency was in the legislation dealing with Telecom Australia. But, as I say, the Government has failed to perform. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn, firstly, to the Australian Industry Development Corporation. The Bill contains a number of minor amendments and introduces a corporate planning process; in other words, some way whereby the Government will try to direct the Australian Industry Development Corporation into appearing to be a private enterprise. There is only one way to make a business act like a private company-that is, to make it a private company. The Government is prepared to go 30 per cent of the way with the AIDC, but not the whole way. If the Government is prepared to consider privatising Qantas and Australian Airlines, why does it not consider privatising the AIDC? After all, the AIDC operates exclusively as a commercial enterprise and there is no essential public interest reason for maintaining Federal government ownership of the body. That is acknowledged on all sides of the debate, in both the public and the private areas. Senator Button has repeatedly acknowledged the need to privatise this body, yet all he can persuade his Party to do is to sell 30 per cent of its shares to the market. In due course the coalition parties will ask the Senate to resolve that the Government should sell the Australian Industry Development Corporation in its entirety to the private sector as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area in this package concerns the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. If we were to talk about this body as SMEC people would not hold it in the high regard in which they currently hold it, going back to the time when the Snowy Mountains scheme was built. But that scheme was completed a long time ago, and we are left with a body which is purely and simply a private consulting firm in the engineering field. There is no reason why it should remain in Commonwealth ownership. The Commonwealth has contributed capital of $16.6m to this body. At one stage it received some $3.3m back in dividends, but the Corporation lost money between 1983 and 1987. During that period it was necessary to inject a further $12m of taxpayers' funds into this body just to keep it going. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation shows a return of some sort of profitability but when one looks at its balance sheet for the year ended 30 June 1988 one sees that there are practically no provisions for any possible liabilities. There is some provision for insurance, but one wonders whether there are any risks in relation to creditors or actions for damages which may have arisen out of some of its work. There are no liability provisions there. On my assessment of the statement of profit and loss for that year it seems that the only reasons it made a profit were a net gain arising from a special review of projects-whatever that was all about-and an extraordinary item relating to the sale of some seven houses which then became part of its income, in other words, a conversion of capital into income. As a result of that it ended up with a minor profit at the end of the year. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a body which operates exclusively in the private sector. There is absolutely no reason for it to be in the public sector. The coalition's policy is to convert it to a private consulting firm and give SMEC's management and staff first option to purchase the Corporation. In due course, the Senate will be asked to resolve that that should happen. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the telecommunications package of Bills. Here is where one sees that the Government has really fallen down. This package was mooted in the early part of last year, in May 1988, as some marvellous new package which would introduce competition into the telecommunications field in Australia. When we finally saw the legislation only a couple of months ago we were quite staggered-I believe this was a wide perception around Australia-at how little competition was introduced and how much the measures were aimed to protect Telecom Australia. That is quite staggering because, after all, Telecom is, I think, the largest business in Australia. Its turnover this year will be in excess of $8 billion. It is bigger than the Department of Defence, the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd and the Coles-Myer group. Last year it had an announced profit of $776m but if we look at the extraordinary write-offs we would have to guess that its profit was in excess of $1 billion. Yet this Government is not prepared to allow Telecom to face genuine competition, except in a few very small areas. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be no competition for public pay telephones and no competition for the first telephone. If we think of the service on public pay telephones we can see why there ought to be competition in this area. Private enterprise ought to be able to set up public telephones in every garage and corner store and in stores open 24 hours a day. But, because this service is exclusively maintained in a monopoly for Telecom, all we can find are public telephones out in the street, usually wrecked by young people who seem to take delight in tearing these public pay phones to pieces. If there was an opportunity for public pay phones to be set up in a competitive area they could be located in places where they could be protected by people who would look after them because there was a profit in them. There is no competition for the installation of the first telephone. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we get to the areas where there are real opportunities for development during the 1990s. There is absolutely no competition allowed in the legislation for what are called public switched data services or public switched integrated service in digital networks. There is no competition for public switched text and video services, for leased circuit services or for public mobile telephone services. We ask why the Government is protecting Telecom from competition in these areas. It is a genuine question. What answer do we get? The Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, Mrs Ros Kelly, says it is all because of the need to provide community service obligations. One wonders what the community service obligations are that the Government is providing. According to a newspaper article:</PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Kelly said the community service obligation of Telecom was its main rationale for retaining its monopoly over the basic telecommunications network and some other profitable services. </PARA>
<PARA>So the main rationale for returning its monopoly is the need to provide a basic telecommunications network and to provide community service obligations. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> She said the entrenchment of monopoly areas in legislation would make it more difficult for the Opposition to privatise Telecom or the Overseas Telecommunications Commision (OTC), if it came to power. </PARA>
<PARA>That is one of the very significant things that the Government is doing. In this case it is trying to get in first and entrench these monopoly areas in legislation so that when the Liberal and National parties get into government we will have great difficulty in privatising Telecom or the Overseas Telecom- munications Commission (OTC), or taking whatever steps we want to take to introduce more competition for Telecom. I do not know why Mrs Kelly says that we would be privatising Telecom because that is not part of our policy. We would be introducing more competition into these areas, but the Minister was saying that she wanted to entrench the monopoly areas in the legislation in order to make our actions more difficult when we get into government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the community service obligations of Telecom. These obligations are much more fuzzy in this Bill than they were in the old legislation. In the old Bill there was a specific provision that the special needs for telecommunication services of Australian people who reside or carry on business outside the cities would be taken into account by Telecom. That provision is not in the current Bill. The current Bill has a much fuzzier definition of community service obligations. One wonders what Telecom intends to provide for community service obligations. For example, as recently as 15 May this year Telecom changed part of its community service obligations so that all Telecom cable to be installed to private homes which exceeds 30 metres in length would be subject to an additional installation charge of about $8 per metre. Previously, Telecom had been providing cable up to 300 metres in length, but when our then shadow Minister for communications, Mr John Sharp, asked Telecom for the reason for this change, Telecom said that the metropolitan city areas, which require only short lengths of cable, had been carrying the cost of country services so it had to reduce the cable length supplied under the standard charge. </PARA>
<PARA> Is that a community service obligation or not? We certainly do not know from this legislation. There is no definition set out in this legislation that would enable us to answer that question. It seems to us that Telecom is interpreting the definition of community service obligations as Telecom sees fit. One wonders whether Telecom's purpose is to change things before Austel is established-Austel being the regulatory body created by this telecommunications package which is before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> One needs a proper analysis of community service obligations before the monopolies become entrenched. One wonders why Telecom has been acting in certain ways before this legislation goes through, before Austel is created. For example, I have had representations that there should be a computer link between terminals at each community library around Australia. That is a very expensive operation. I wonder whether that should be a community service obligation. I have had representations that there should be hearing aid compatibility on public telephones. I wonder whether that should be a community service obligation. Without proper analysis we do not know what community service obligations Telecom is accepting, and we do not know what community service obligations Telecom should accept. Without proper analysis it is not possible to make a fair assessment of the extent of Telecom's community service obligations and, therefore, it is not possible to ascertain what is the cost of those obligations. If one follows it through logically, one arrives at the next step: how on earth can we ascertain what extent of monopoly powers has to be given to Telecom in order to enable it to provide these community service obligations? It seems to me that the Government and the Minister have failed to follow through the logical progression in order to establish the reason for their granting Telecom the monopoly powers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Telecommunications Bill defines and entrenches very broad monopolies for Telecom, OTC and Aussat, and it carefully protects those monopolies. Examination of the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the Telecommunications Bill would disclose what I have just said to be the truth. For example, the explanatory memorandum states that the Bill gives a clear definition of the carrier monopolies with Austel having the role of economic and technical regulation of the industry. We understand what is meant by the `regulation of the industry'. Regulation means government control or, in this case, Austel control, with a clear definition of the carrier monopolies. As if that were not bad enough, the explanatory memorandum goes on to acknowledge that all three carriers, Telecom, OTC and Aussat, have their monopolies confirmed by this legislation. The monopolies are confirmed and defined by this legislation, and Austel has the role of regulating those monopolies. And as if that were not enough-I am talking about Telecom, the biggest industry in Australia-the Bill goes on to establish a class licence mechanism which is specifically designed to ensure that people who move into this area, which the Government says it is opening up to competition, and who find that they are competing with Telecom will have to be involved in this class licence system and in an additional permit system to ensure that any competition is absolutely at a bare minimum and regulated by Austel absolutely and completely. </PARA>
<PARA> What on earth is the Government on about in introducing this sort of legislation and saying to the Parliament, `We are going to deregulate the telecommunications industry.'? Clearly, the Government is not deregulating the telecommunications industry. In any event there is no provision for OTC and Aussat to provide any community service obligations, so there is no backing for their monopolies which have been granted in this legislation. As I said, when one looks at the legislation the Government has introduced, one sees its defects. As a result, the coalition parties, as my colleague Senator Alston has already indicated, will be introducing a very substantial number of amendments which would promote competition as an object of the Act and a function of Austel, and would reduce the range of monopolies reserved for Telecom. The amendments would delete the class licence and permit systems. That might provide some genuine competition in this industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom would benefit from some competition in this industry. Telecom is a large, vibrant and viable enterprise with a large number of very able people working in it. If Telecom were given the opportunity to go out there and compete fairly on the market, I am sure it would do extraordinarily well. With competition, people working for Telecom would be able to see what others were coming up with in the private enterprise field and match them with other thoughts that Telecom officers might have. There would be genuine competition. But the legislation which this Government has introduced does not do any of those things. It simply entrenches the monopoly which already exists. It makes sure that when the Liberal and National parties get into government we will not be able to change that. It regulates the industry and the people who are trying desperately to enter into it. It controls it so that Telecom will be in a position to always maintain a monopoly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government could not even bring about a position where there would be some competition in the public mobile telephone service-the least little thing that the Government could have done. Because of the control which the unions exercise through the back bench Caucus committees of the Australian Labor Party, this Government is unable to introduce the sort of competition which it should have been introducing and the sort of competition which this country desperately needs. The point is that this country is desperately going down the drain. We are in a position where the country has to do something about becoming competitive, and using its own products instead of having to import. The way to do that is to introduce competition-that is what will bring about the sort of recovery this country needs. Here, with this legislation before the Senate today, was an opportunity to privatise SMEC and the AIDC, and introduce genuine competition and efficiency to Telecom. What has happened? This Government has failed on all three counts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon we are discussing in a cognate debate a number of Bills dealing with telecommunications and postal services, and also the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (Conversion into Public Company) Bill and the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill. It is the last two to which I shall address my remarks, Senator Powell having picked up the debate with respect to the several Bills dealing with telecommunications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The words which kept coming through in Senator Lewis's speech were competition, competition, competition. He seems to think that is the only way in which we will get a more efficient Australian industry. That ideological view is widely shared by the Opposition and by many members of the Government side. It happens to be a view which is not shared by the Australian Democrats. There is certainly a need for increased efficiency in a number of industries, but competition is not necessarily the way to go. That ideological commitment to competition and the operation of a free market very often is inimical to the provision of more comprehensive and better services to the public. One only needs to observe that, in the case of an industry which is spread through a number of competing sectors, there is a duplication of capital investment. As we have seen with the airline industry in the United States of America, often that competition leads to some of the participants going to the wall and enormous capital investments are simply lost. Of course, the Opposition may naively argue that those capital investments are lost by private investors, but it represents a failure by the citizens of a country to invest that capital more profitably and so benefit all the citizens of that country. It does not really matter too much where the money is lost; if it is lost it becomes a penalty against the whole community. </PARA>
<PARA> The two Bills to which I wish to direct my remarks, the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (Conversion into Public Company) Bill and the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill, in a sense represent two parts of the same process. The Government has sought to privatise the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC). It began that process some months ago with the privatisation of 30 per cent of the ownership of AIDC through the creation of a subsidiary company, and the floating of 30 per cent of shares in that company. The Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (SMEC) has not gone as far as that. This legislation before us proposes that the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation shall be turned into a wholly owned government company. Of course, one can read the writing on the wall; that is, it is a step down the road towards partial and then, perhaps, complete privatisation of SMEC. Interestingly, the next step for the AIDC will be that the subsidiary company will be permitted to float off further subsidiary companies, and those subsidiary companies will not be nearly as accountable to the Government as the parent company. Indeed, the auditing of the accounts of those subsidiary companies will no longer necessarily be a function of the Government audit process. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have indicated, one sees in these two Bills two parts of the same process. The AIDC has gone some way down the road. One can see that SMEC will be following down exactly the same road; it has not gone quite as far at the present time. It is difficult to understand that philosophy. It is one that is not shared by the Australian Democrats. As I have indicated, we are not ideologically committed to the idea that the operation of the free market necessarily serves the common good. In fact, there is abundant evidence that it does not, and I have spoken about that before. Nor are we committed to the idea that competition necessarily leads to a more efficient allocation of resources. Indeed, there are a number of examples which illustrate that point.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (Conversion into Public Company) Bill. As I have said, it intends to convert the Corporation to a public company but, in the first instance, a public company in which the Government will hold all the shares. The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) used a number of euphemisms in his second reading speech. This is something that stands out repeatedly in ministerial statements and speeches from this Government. When it does something it describes it as a reform. It talks about improving the performance of government business enterprises. It gives the impression that these changes will necessarily lead to improvement, although the sorts of improvements which might flow from the changes are not necessarily argued very cogently or very well. When one reads the Minister's speech, one finds that he is at pains to point out `the Corporation's outstanding international reputation for engineering excellence, particularly in the Asia Pacific region'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister himself says that the organisation has performed extremely well as regards the quality of its work. In his speech he says that it was ranked 62 in a 1988 world survey of international engineering consulting firms. I would have thought that, given the large number of engineering consulting firms there must be in the world, and given the size of Australia, coming No. 62 in a survey again indicates the very high standing of this organisation's work. The Minister refers to the Corporation `both as a winner of export awards and in assisting the development of the Australian engineering consulting industry through joint ventures and in gaining an overseas track record'. He is again drawing attention to the quality of the work being done and the standing in which that work is held by people in Australia, by the Australian consulting engineering industry in general and, through joint ventures, by overseas countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister is not in any way criticising the quality of the work which this organisation is carrying out. It seems to me that that in itself, in relation to a major engineering venture, is a very important consideration. Senator Lewis asserted simply that this organisation did not have a social function. I would have thought that the social impact of major engineering enterprises which significantly affect the environment and the quality of people's lives for a very long time into the future-one can think of projects like the Snowy Mountains scheme, which Senator Lewis mentioned-is indeed a very important consideration to be taken into account. The quality of that work is not necessarily improved by introducing competition, by exposing the company to free market forces or by privatisation. The Minister pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA> Since 1970 SMEC has completed 1,350 projects in 50 countries with a capital value of $4,500 million and has earned consulting fees of $294 million. </PARA>
<PARA>Picking up on the figures which Senator Lewis mentioned, the next paragraph in the Minister's speech pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA> It has received a capital contribution from the Commonwealth totalling $16.6 million while returning dividends to the Government totalling $3.3 million. In addition it has paid corporate taxes amounting to $11 million, as well as $7 million in State payroll and lands taxes and $1.3 million in local government taxes. </PARA>
<PARA>If one adds all those amounts together, one finds that there has been a net profit to Government of roughly $6m plus the consideration of $294m in total earnings-a not inconsiderable amount and, I would have thought, a very significant contribution to the Australian economy and to the standing of Australian engineering in world terms. The Minister also stated that it is anticipated that a substantial dividend will be forthcoming from the 1988-89 result. </PARA>
<PARA> So, clearly, we are dealing with a company which has already performed extremely well in terms of quality. It has been profitable and it has been engaged in a large number of ventures, both inside and outside Australia, of very significant social impact. Clearly, we need to be concerned about that sort of impact-there needs to be a much wider spectrum of analysis than simply looking at its economic returns directly to government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister then proceeded to talk about the planning and accountability of the new structure. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>New planning and accountability mechanisms include the provision by SMEC of a three-year rolling Corporate Plan. </PARA>
<PARA>This relates to the introduction on 4 November 1987 by the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) of the policy paper Guidelines for Statutory Authorities and Government Business Enterprises. Senator Walsh made some very interesting and relevant statements in his speech to the Senate on that date; they are very relevant to what Senator Lewis said. Senator Walsh said:</PARA>
<PARA>Assumptions that an enterprise will deliver services more efficiently if it is privately owned, or that private ownership is synonymous with competition, have no more validity than an assumption that because an enterprise is publicly owned its resources are necessarily being deployed in a manner which will maximise the public benefit. </PARA>
<PARA>I could not agree more with that statement that efficiency and service to the public are variables which do not necessarily bear on the question of who owns the company or to what extent the company is exposed to competition and market forces. Relevant to the other Bills with which we are dealing this evening, Senator Walsh went on to point to the provision of telephone services in this context. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Telephone services cannot be produced economically in an isolated community nor can the cost of such services be fully recovered from the recipients. An attempt to recover the full cost of such services to isolated communities would necessarily result in prices higher than the market will bear. The consequences of that would be continuously increasing average costs and therefore prices in response to continuously falling demand, and continuously falling demand in response to continuously increasing average costs and therefore prices. Eventually all services would be terminated outside those major population centres where average costs are within a range which the market will bear. Losses on services to these areas are currently covered by cross-subsidies at a cost to Telecom of some $500m per year. </PARA>
<PARA>I guess that that general consideration applies to a large number of government instrumentalities where one expects those instrumentalities to take into account in some measure the public good. The Australian Democrats certainly are concerned that all publicly owned enterprises should remain in public hands and should certainly take into account their service to the public good. </PARA>
<PARA> In his second reading speech on the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (Conversion into Public Company) Bill, the Minister stated that the share capital will be fixed at a maximum of $5,207,807-a remarkably accurately described figure which represents the capital contributed by the Commonwealth as at 30 June, less accumulated losses. The capital will be divided into $1 par shares with all shares to be held, at least initially, by the Commonwealth. The words `with all shares to be held, at least initially, by the Commonwealth' are very instructive. In that we see the direction of the Government's thinking. Clearly, the Government intends that further down the track this organisation will follow the path already taken by the AIDC-something which is presaged by statements by some Government Ministers in recent days with respect to Australian Airlines and Qantas Airways Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA> In the very next paragraph of the Minister's second reading speech one reads that there is the possibility of a scheme being considered in which the workers in SMEC would become shareholders. Of course, the Australian Democrats would have no ideological objection to such a proposal. But clearly, without some control on the further selling on of those shares, the door would be left open for the gradual takeover of this company by interests well beyond the workers within SMEC. We note with some concern, in view of the way in which this company is already on the road towards privatisation, that there is a provision in the Bill for the company's exemption from the Freedom of Information Act. While we have no objection to this in relation to sensitive information with respect to contracts which are being negotiated, quite clearly there would be other areas in which this organisation would be in possession of information that should really be in the public domain. </PARA>
<PARA> In reflecting back to the Guidelines for Statutory Authorities and Government Business Enterprises, I point out that the Minister for Finance is clearly looking towards guidelines of a financial nature only. In his speech on 4 November 1987, to which I referred earlier, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The precise structure of the target will depend on the nature of the enterprise concerned but, unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary, will take the form of a specified rate of return on the enterprise's assets . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He also stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The introduction of financial targets will require the development of appropriate accounting and reporting practices. </PARA>
<PARA>The whole tenor of his statement is in terms of the financial management, financial returns and the profitability of the organisation. We are concerned that a major engineering company would be necessarily involved in major impacts on the environment. Nowhere in the guidelines is any consideration given to the sorts of contracts that SMEC may or may not take up. Yesterday I was in the Cairns region of north Queensland. Again, I noted that the Tully millstream hydro-electric development scheme is still being considered. I understand this scheme is one in which SMEC may have an interest. It is extremely environmentally sensitive. The Government should exercise some continuing control over the impact on the environment of projects undertaken by such an organisation-after all, it is under government control at this time-not only with respect to its financial management but also with respect to the sorts of contracts that it accepts, rejects or seeks to modify. </PARA>
<PARA>  The last point I wish to make relates to the Industry Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 which seeks to allow the AIDC subsidiary, which was recently created and which is currently 70 per cent owned by government-30 per cent of the shares have been hived off to the public-to act as a commercial enterprise. The most significant aspect is that those sorts of subsidiaries may no longer be directly accountable to government. They may appoint their own auditor which, in many cases, probably would not be the Government auditor. This is quite unsatisfactory because the money involved is substantially a government investment. We are dealing with an organisation which until recently was totally within government control. It was created to encourage the development of particular sorts of industry and, in line with government policy, by implication, it was specifically not created to provide help to other sorts of industry. Yet it is moving further and further towards a totally market driven, competitive system and its accounts will not even be audited by the Government auditor. </PARA>
<PARA> We will move amendments to this legislation. The effect of those amendments will be that the accounts of subsidiary companies should be audited by the Auditor-General and those accounts will then come under close government scrutiny. We are doing this because we have no ideological confidence in the private audit system as expressed, apparently by implication, by the Government and certainly expressed, quite explicitly, by Senator Lewis a short time ago. We note the recent Four Corners program dealing with the Bond companies and the way in which audited accounts to the end of 1988 were apparently presented. As a consequence of the revelations which were made in that Four Corners program, I noted in a news item a month or so later that the Bond auditors were adjusting their annual statement, having regard to those claims which had been made in the earlier statement with respect to sales which were not genuine and which were, therefore, not properly listed in that annual report. When major companies behave in that way, I think there is a very good reason for the subsidiary company under the AIDC to remain within the area of the Government audit. For that reason we will move the amendments which were circulated about a week or so ago. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, we are concerned that in these two pieces of legislation we see yet again a move to privatise progressively government property and businesses. This is a process of selling off the farm. One can only sell it off once. We are not convinced that this will necessarily lead to improvements in economic efficiency or better service to the public. One can produce considerable evidence to the contrary. We are concerned that the Opposition is even more ideologically committed to this path and that the Government is merely setting up a situation which, should the Opposition ever gain government, will make it even easier for it to further privatise these important public properties. Both these organisations can serve a very important social role as well as an important commercial role. They have considerable impacts. They can at the moment be somewhat directed by Government policy. The Australian Democrats certainly believe that that situation should continue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;According to the second reading speech of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray):</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A central plank in the Government's micro-economic reform agenda for restructuring the public sector is that Government Business Enterprises (GBEs) should be as efficient as possible and responsive to consumers' needs. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> The Government sees the commercialisation of the GBEs as a necessary and fundamental pre-condition to improvements in efficiency. GBEs such as Telecom are being placed on a more commercial footing, bringing them more into line with private sector competitors, and subjecting them increasingly to the disciplines of the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA>That is all very well as far as it goes. However, it leaves many of those bodies in an intolerable and quite disgraceful halfway house where they are removed from the level of scrutiny to which, as government enterprises, they had been subject, particularly by way of Senate Estimates committees, and are put into a sort of no-man's land where, as corporations, they are not subject to the sort of scrutiny to which they should be subjected by this Parliament or to the sort of scrutiny to which they would be subjected if they had public shareholders. If this is the first step towards privatisation, let the privatisation come quickly so that the proper degree of responsibility can be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a real problem. When government business enterprises reach this halfway house, there is a massive added burden of responsibility on them to behave with propriety and to be responsible to somebody. We have already seen an unhealthy trend towards a reduction in that level of scrutiny. I am not necessarily blaming Telecom Australia on this occasion. I remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that when former Senator Gietzelt was Chairman of the Senate Estimates Committee which dealt with Telecom, some Committee members were particularly disappointed that we were not given the opportunity to ask the sorts of questions we believed we had every right to ask of Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA> It is on that issue that I now raise some very serious and scandalous matters. I believe there is a real prospect of both impropriety and illegality in the tender process under which a company called Compass Debt Collection Services Pty Ltd has recently been given the tender to collect Telecom bad debts in the metropolitan area of Sydney, and to endeavour to recover what had been written off as irrecoverable bad debts in the metropolitan and northern country areas of New South Wales. Telecom has a special responsibility, as a government monopoly, to be particularly careful about the manner in which it conducts its business. In this matter, it seems that there are links between Compass Debt Collection Services, which received this tender, and another successful tenderer for another and much larger debt collection tender. I wish to be assured-the Senate deserves to be assured-that these links do not indicate that one was behaving as a front for the other. It is of major concern to me. </PARA>
<PARA> These tenders relate to multi-millions of dollars. The Compass Debt Collection Services' tender relates to debts worth $4.8m. Commercial Debt Collection Services was the successful tenderer for a debt of around $19m. As I understand it, there is no concern within the debt collecting industry about Commercial Debt Collection Services winning that tender. I understand there was no suggestion of impropriety in that matter. There is real concern, however, within the debt collection industry and a degree of concern within the New South Wales Police Force, which is investigating this matter, about the successful tender by Compass Debt Collection Services. </PARA>
<PARA> Compass was awarded the Appendix A, Metropolitan North, and the Appendix E tender, Metropolitan and Country North previously irrecoverable debts, as a result of its submission of a tender document on 3 February 1989. It was awarded it on, I think, 3 May-at least, information was given to unsuccessful tenderers that Compass had won that tender on 3 May. However, under the laws of the State of New South Wales Compass Debt Collection Services Pty Ltd was precluded from lodging a tender as it did not hold a commercial agent's licence. It is said that one of the principals of the company held a licence of a kind. As I understand the law, the company is required to hold a licence. Obviously, the company also feels that it should because it made an application to the court in New South Wales for the licence on 6 April 1989, presumably when it was advised that it had been the successful tenderer. At that belated point it made an application to the court for a commercial debt collector's licence and, as I understand it, it was granted one only towards the end of last month. </PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales Police Department is now in the process of investigating whether a breach of the State law has taken place, whether charges should be laid, and naturally, as a consequence, whether the licence should be cancelled. I know of that for a variety of reasons, but mainly because I made inquiries of the New South Wales police to assure myself that Telecom was cooperating fully with the New South Wales police in their investigations. As I understand it, the New South Wales police made a request to see the tender document because they had been advised that Compass did not have a licence at the time tender documents closed. I am glad to say that after some toing-and-froing and some telephone calls to Telecom from me-I kept it advised of this matter-Telecom, being aware of my concerns, eventually provided the New South Wales police with a copy of the successful tender document so that the police could proceed with their investigations. I understand the reason why an organisation like Telecom must be careful in providing this kind of information, but I would have hoped that perhaps a more speedy response might have followed the request. </PARA>
<PARA> However, some other problems developed. I simply wonder why Compass-a company which was incorporated only on 1 February, two days before the tender closed, and having no track record or commercial standing-should be awarded a contract of this magnitude for the recovery of $4.8m in bad debts, which would probably involve a revenue collection of around $1m; at least, that is the forecast in the letter of information to other tenderers. I note that the company that received the biggest tender-and I have no complaint about that-the Metropolitan South tender for about $12m in bad debts, was Commercial Debt Collection Services, which has as its managing director Mr Terry Clee. However, I also understand that the principal of Compass Debt Collection Services, a Mr John Ludlow, is the holder of a commercial licence as a subagent to Mr Terry Clee. I understand that was the situation at the date of lodgment of the Telecom tenders. As I say, that information was given to me and I cannot vouch for it. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I understand-I have been assured that this is fact-that Mr Ludlow's previous business address was that of Commercial Debt Collection Services; in other words, it was Mr Terry Clee's address. This rival, who received another tender, had the same address as the successful tenderer for the large contract. I wonder why-and Telecom owes us an explanation-Compass Debt Collection Services has its office at 42 City Road, Chippendale, a property owned by someone called Chantelle Clee. I know that to be a fact because I received a fax from the South Sydney Council advising me of that fact. It says that the owner of 42 City Road, Chippendale, is Ms Chantelle Margaret Clee of 61 Drumalbyn Road, Bellevue Hill. If Compass Debt Collection Services is totally unrelated to Commercial Debt Collection Services, someone should tell us so. Otherwise it will be suggested that it is related. I am not necessarily making that suggestion. I am saying that there is a special need for us to find out so that we can be aware of whether Mr Clee, directly or indirectly, will end up having almost total control of the Telecom debt collection contracts in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like an assurance that no Telecom officers are involved in any way with Mr Terry Clee-that is, Telecom officers with a sufficiently senior role and an involvement in this matter. I was told by some people in the debt collecting industry that at least one senior Telecom officer is resigning to join Mr Clee's firm. I want to make sure that the tender process has not in spirit been breached by what could well be some kind of association and particularly the curious manner in which a company with no experience and no licence can magically get a substantial Telecom debt collection contract. I do not know what Telecom will chose to do about it. My inquiries of various firms in the industry have brought universal surprise-in fact, in some instances astonishment-that Compass won that tender. One of the companies said to me, `We were disappointed that we did not get the tender and we had never heard of the winner'. Another said to me, `We are extremely surprised we were not successful because Telecom told us we were the cheapest tenderer'. Another was sufficiently enraged to write me a letter about it, the detail of which I do not want to go into because it implies all sorts of impropriety. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some matters of further concern in this area, relating to whether or not an offence has been committed. It seems to be that the New South Wales law is very clear on this matter. I hope that Telecom would not, in knowledge of the law, set out to grant tenders to people who appear to have broken it. Part II of the Commercial Agents and Private Inquiry Agents Act in New South Wales says, in section 6-I shall just read the relevant sections:</PARA>
<PARA> 6. (1) Subject to this Act, no person shall</PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> (b) advertise, notify or state that he exercises or carries on or is willing to exercise or carry on; or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) in any way hold himself out to the public as ready to exercise or carry on,</PARA>
<PARA>the business or any of the functions-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) of a commercial agent, unless he is the holder of a commercial agent's license;</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Any person who contravenes or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this section shall be liable, in the case of a corporation, to a penalty not exceeding $5,000 and, in the case of an individual, to a penalty not exceeding $500 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both such penalty and imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason I mention that is that I think organisations such as Telecom have an obligation to ensure that when contracts of this nature are awarded they are not in breach of State law. If there is a risk that they may be, would it not be a good idea for Telecom to state in tender documents that the holding of the appropriate licence in such a situation, where a licence was required, should be a requirement of the tender?</PARA>
<PARA> However, I noticed that a requirement of the tender is that tenderers supply Telecom with evidence of their commercial standing. Compass had no commercial standing because it did not exist until two days before the tender. Another requirement is that partnerships in companies must submit proof of their proper registration. If that took place and Telecom was advised of the details of Compass's proof of proper registration, it would have seen that it had an enormous commercial history lasting two days! Another requirement is that companies provide the names of referees from three large commercial and/or government organisations for which they are currently carrying out debt collection work. How could Compass, with two days of commercial history, provide referees from three commercial and/or government organisations for which it is currently carrying out debt collection work? A tenderer has also to advise details of the present size of its operations in terms of staff numbers, structure and financial worth. </PARA>
<PARA> As I was saying, it seems to me that there is a special obligation on government monopolies to adopt the greatest propriety in this kind of matter. It seems to me that Telecom has let those standards slip. As I said, I have been having lengthy discussions with Telecom on the matter of providing material to the New South Wales police. I had suggested to the officer in Telecom to whom I have been talking over the last couple of weeks that if there were any people from Telecom he thought would like to contact me about the nature of this tender, about which I have great concerns, he should suggest that they give me a ring. To my knowledge I have received no contact. No attempt has been made by Telecom to contact me over my stated concerns to Telecom about the nature and the granting of this contract. I think it would have been a good idea had Telecom taken up my offer. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to raise another little matter, which emerges from the size of the bad debts revealed in the tender document, which I now have. One of the questions I wanted to ask Telecom at the Senate Estimates meetings, when we had Telecom's annual report before us, was why on earth bad debts of $54m written off in the 1987 accounts should have been cut to an extraordinarily low amount of $20.4m-a cut of 63 per cent in the accounts for the year to June 1988. Are less than half as many people now failing to pay their bills? Has something magic happened? Apparently not, judging by the tender documents. When I see in those documents the amount of bad debts that have been referred to debt collecting agencies before being written off, I find the total for New South Wales in the coming financial year is $29m. I then look at the recovery rates-the expected turnover figures for the companies involved-in the letter of advice and see that about $25m will remain outstanding after the expected recoveries have taken place. In New South Wales alone $25m of debt will remain outstanding in the coming financial year, suggesting that something like $75m in bad debts will be suffered by Telecom. How and why, then, were only $20m in bad debts written off in the 1988 accounts? In fact, the provision for bad and doubtful debts was increased slightly because of a reduction in the amount actually written off. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, a government monopoly has special obligations to report fully and properly. I think it is up to Telecom to explain to the Senate why, if the New South Wales figures for bad debts revealed in these tender documents are as large as they are, only $20m was written off last year. As I say, the Telecom people were not subjected to the sort of inquiry I would have liked to subject them to in the Senate Estimates hearings and I regret that, but I regret even more the whole manner in which this tendering procedure concerning bad debts has gone on. </PARA>
<PARA> I had no special brief for any of the people that I spoke to in the industry. I was alerted to this matter by one of the many companies which missed out on the tender, but all of them are cross about it. I suggest to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) that, if Telecom is unwilling to provide adequate responses, heavy pressure should be brought to bear upon it. As I said, it is all very well going down the track of creating these semi-independent organisations but, while they are in the position of being under the `control' of the Government, they must be absolutely fully responsible and answerable to this Parliament until they are in a situation where they are fully answerable to the public, which I hope would become their owner once they are privatised. They cannot be allowed to remain in this halfway house. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating cognately the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill 1989, the Australian Postal Corporation Bill 1989, the Telecommunications and Postal Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1989, the Telecommunications Bill 1989, and the Telecommunications (Application Fees) Bill 1989, and two other Bills. I want to summarise some of the changes that are incorporated in this series of Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First, a new legislative charter is established for the operations of Telecom Australia. This supposedly introduces greater competition into the telecommunications industry. It supposedly gives Telecom a new commercially oriented financial structure because it will be measured against competitors in the private sector and will have to pay all taxes and government charges. The legislation also establishes Austel as an independent regulator in the telecommunications industry. I will have more to say about that later. It also provides a new legislative charter for Australia Post, as well as Telecom, which supposedly gives it a new commercially oriented financial structure as well. Incidentally, apart from all of these things, the Bills require the development of so-called corporate plans for Telecom and Australia Post. Obviously all of those matters are intended to be indications of the change of direction of this Government towards a more commercial, competitive and deregulated approach for those very large commercial enterprises comprised by Telecom and Australia Post. </PARA>
<PARA> The first thing that we ought to observe about the package as a whole is that the proposed changes-especially those to the telecommunications industry-are supposed to be the central elements of the Government's micro-economic reform. We remember, following the last election in 1987, the commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) when he came weeping onto the television to tell us that the third term agenda of his Government would be to provide us with micro-economic reform. Of course, many people do not really know what that means. But, given the mess of our economy as a whole, it is fairly clear to increasing numbers of people that what is needed is a tough-minded government to take on issues such as the reform of the waterfront, of the airlines and of the telecommunications industry, to provide growth for the future and better economic performance on the part of those infrastructure elements of our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Back in 1987 what the Prime Minister meant to say was that these things which he had in mind were meant to make individual industries more efficient and, consequently, more able to cope with the demands and pressures of overseas competition-and, of course, more effectively to deliver cheaper services to the Australian community. Obviously that government rhetoric was nothing more than that, because about a year ago the Government introduced into the Parliament statements that showed that it had done very little at all in the area of micro-economic reform, especially in the area of telecommunications. We saw the much vaunted approach to so-called privatisation amount to nothing as a result of that. Yet only today we see that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) is suddenly raising this issue again in respect of the airlines. From what I hear of reports of those on the left of the Australian Labor Party who were interviewed on television tonight, apparently those attempts to reach reform in the airline industry are going to come to nothing as well. </PARA>
<PARA> We see some action with more and more voluminous reports being released in the waterfront and shipping industries. It is very little and far too late. In the area of taxation, the Government has fiddled around the edges to increase the overall tax burden, not reduce it, and to maintain the mix of tax disincentives which favours debt over savings. There has been no attempt to increase the pool of savings in the Australian community to develop our own economy and make us less vulnerable to having to borrow from overseas. In the area of education, 20,000 students still miss out on higher education places, despite being eligible. In the area of transportation, I have mentioned the airlines. Under current proposals, they will not be deregulated until 1990. The railways are heavily over-regulated and monopolised. Even one of the stars in the crown of the Government, and even the crown of Senator Button-the Business Regulation Review Unit-has not lived up to its potential and has not been seen to produce the kind of reform that we thought may have occurred a year or two ago. These reforms are vital to turn around the state of the Australian economy and to produce long-term answers to the problems which we, as a nation, are facing. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to telecommunications reform, the Government has failed to go nearly far enough to reform the telecommunications industry. All that it has done, when it all boils down, is rearrange the legislative and regulatory framework. There has been little, if any, reform at all. The Government has simply thrown aside the consumer oriented approach to telecommunications reform. It chooses to keep a monopoly for our telecommunications operators rather than look at what the market demands, at what the people of Australia want in terms of better service and new products, and to maintain its commitment to monopoly positions and, hence, lower customer service. It has been quite clear for many months now that the Government is simply captive to the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association. There is no foresight in the Government's approach to developing the huge potential of the telecommunications industry, to developing jobs and to reducing costs in this community. Even though we have this change, we are lagging behind the markets overseas, whereas we could and should be leading them in providing new job opportunities and high technology development. </PARA>
<PARA> Why does this legislation fail to deliver any of that kind of deregulation which the country is crying out for? Firstly, the legislation entrenches the very broad monopolies for Telecom, the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC) and Aussat. It does nothing to release them from those monopoly situations and expose them to private sector competition. In order to change the combination of the locks rather than undo the locks and free up the system, the Government has established two categories of telecommunications services, called reserved services and value added services. Reserved services are restricted to those carrier monopolies which we have just mentioned. There will be no competition in those areas at all, including public switched telephone services; public switched data services; public switched text and video services; public switched integrated services digital networks; leased circuit services; and public mobile telephone services. In other words, just about in every area where the ordinary person is touched on a day to day basis by his use of Telecom and other services, there will be no freeing up of Telecom's or the other carriers' monopolies. Under this arrangement even public telephones will be maintained as a Telecom monopoly. The resale of leased circuit services will be prohibited. A very small number of value added services will be allowed to engage in some competition. Although it cannot be denied that that will be of some assistance to the community, obviously it is a very minor part of what ought to have been done by this Government. Because of this exposure to such limited competition, these monopolies will retain their overregulation, overprotection and costliness-not to the Government, but to the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> I will contrast that with the policy of the Liberal and National parties. We would maintain a monopoly for only basic telecommunications services. In other words, subject to that limitation, all of the other areas that have been reserved will be opened to competition. The amendments that we will be moving later during the committee stage of the debate make those points clear. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has said, `We have to maintain these monopolies for the carriers because we have to provide a service to the community in an equal way and at a reasonable cost to all those in the community'. Yet we do not know how much those community service obligations (CSOs) cost the consumer. There has been no attempt by the Government to find out precisely what it does cost. The Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics has not yet reported on its findings on those matters although the report was due last January. How can we therefore have legislation which is supposed to be setting out the mix of competitive against monopoly services if we do not know the extent of these CSOs? That vital question is the core of this matter. What are the costs of our community service obligations through Telecom and the other carriers? Does anybody know? Telecom admitted some time ago that it was as little as $250m while the Government has been parading around some figures in the past as high as $800m. But who knows? What is the real figure? Until we know that figure, we will not be able to establish whether we are performing an inadequate service for the population of Australia by not adopting a more competitive structure for our telecommunications industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly) has been reported as saying that the Government intends entrenching the monopoly areas in legislation to make it even more difficult for the Opposition in government to implement the policy of deregulation that I have been talking about. What is the justification for that? The Opposition is presenting a policy which will deliver benefits to the whole Australian economy as well as the individual consumer and the Government is setting about establishing even more firmly the monopoly in favour of the carriers. Yet the Government would have the Parliament believe that it is somehow moving in the direction of freeing up the telecommunications industry. Obviously somebody is telling fibs or he does not understand what the Government is on about. It is probably neither, because most of this emanates from political pressure on the Government's own political structure. All of us know about that. </PARA>
<PARA> The position remains as simple as this: we will not get a more efficient and less costly telecommunications industry until there is deregulation, the area is opened up to competition and there is a fair approach on the part of Telecom to the provision of services rather than the arrogant monopoly approach it adopts at present. We have provided another number in the combination of the lock that has kept Telecom in its present structure by the establishment of Austel. The principle of the establishment of an independent regulator of the telecommunications industry is fine; it is certainly supported by the Liberal and National parties. The point is that as a result of this legislation Austel has been established all right, but all we have done is transfer all the regulatory forms which were previously held by Telecom into Austel so that instead Austel can do the bidding of Telecom. We have that kind of nonsense, which will merely restrict the future development of the telecommunications industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Minister's second reading speech we read that Austel will encourage the right environment for growth in the telecommunications industry. Obviously that is rubbish. I have just told honourable senators what the Minister has said. She has entrenched monopolies on the part of the carriers to ensure the Opposition policy of deregulation cannot be implemented. It is obviously a load of nonsense and the Australian Labor Party knows it. It knows that it is only carrying out a charade. Administering the regulatory framework through Austel will merely be seen as further entrenching that lack of competition. It has not been given a charter to actively pursue competition; it is just a toothless tiger where competition is concerned. On present indications it will turn out to be to the telecommunications industry nothing more than the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is to the broadcasting industry. Discretion is limited. Hence, we cannot see Austel becoming a truly independent regulator. Austel will be responsible to administer the licensing regime for competitive services but obviously it has been given no charter for further competition such as encouraging product innovation. </PARA>
<PARA> It will create a permit system, would honourable senators believe, for customer equipment, so that it can gain further regulation over the development of the telecommunications industry-another number in the combination of the lock to make sure that telecommunications stays locked up in the monopoly in which it currently operates. This system of permits is totally unnecessary. Obviously, it will not do anything to ensure the technical integrity of the telecommunications network but merely impose more bureaucracy on the growing and potentially beneficial telecommunications industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation also empowers the new body, Austel, to make decisions on various matters in response to applications from the industry or the carriers within a 30-day period. Here is the rub: if Austel has not responded within that 30-day period, then it is assumed to have refused the application. This is written into legislation that is supposed to be freeing up the telecommunications industry. But what happens if I come along with a constituent who has a new idea in telecommunications and who seeks a permit from Austel? He takes that application to Austel and says, `I want this permit within 30 days'. If Austel says nothing for that 30-day period, that means that application has been refused without any kind of hearing, without any kind of proper examination of the issues. We end up in a situation where quite obviously Austel again becomes the tool of the monopoly carriers. That is simply outrageous because it locks up that monopoly even tighter than it otherwise would have been. Obviously, as a result, industry will be penalised and the present level of inefficiency will be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that a number of other matters are of relevance. First, the legislation provides immunity from the common law liability for Australia Post, Telecom and OTC in relation to the supply of a monopoly service. If a service provided by each of those monopolies, is done negligently and has some third effect, there is no common law right to pursue those organisations in the courts for damages. That is certainly not the level playing field that we were led to believe was part of this new package. No government business enterprise should be immune from actions for negligence in the delivery of services and especially not monopoly services which, of course, those carriers have. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point is that the legislation will allow Telecom and Australia Post to carry on any business or activity that is capable of being conveniently carried on by the use of resources that are not immediately required in carrying out Telecom's principle or subsidiary function. Obviously, that offers opportunities for those organisations in monopoly situations to become involved in business where they can put the competition out of action. Such a provision is not warranted and we have an amendment to that effect. The Bill gives Telecom very wide powers to enter land relating to the inspection, installation and repairing of facilities. It is inappropriate for Telecom to be given the power to be able to enter people's land to inspect it and do what it wants to do when that is not related to the direct purpose of telecommunications. Obviously, that provision ought to be struck out. I hope that the Senate will support our amendment in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> A further piece of legislation gives Australia Post the power to develop and lease land and buildings not immediately required by it. That opens up the possibility of Australia Post becoming a land developer. Perhaps the Government has that kind of privatisation in mind, which may well be the way in which it rewards its trade unions for being compliant in other areas. Who knows? However, the point is that there is a prospect of the development of alternative competitive arrangements, given the monopolies already involved, and that could open up vast opportunities for such organisations in future against the true interests of the Australian private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I will quote from a document produced by the Australian Society of Accountants called Long Road to Reform-Privatisation and Corporatisation in Australia. Essentially, what we are talking about here is corporatisation, if you like, the developing of the concept of accountability. At page 2 of the document in the section entitled `The State of Play' the Society says:</PARA>
<PARA>Very few Australians would understand immediately that-</PARA>
<PARA>a person is quoted-</PARA>
<PARA>is getting at two quite political ideas, these being what distinguish arguments for privatisation and corporatisation from the more traditional critique of public sector performance. </PARA>
<PARA>This comes to the main point I want to bring up:</PARA>
<PARA>The first is that consumers can provide better information about the services they want through direct private transactions than governments can by attempting to guess their needs for them. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the essential argument in favour of deregulation, competition and privatisation. The second point mentioned is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . governments will lose sight of the original point of its interventions, and that the government institutions formed to achieve certain objectives will eventually serve the interests of those who provide services before those who are intended to receive them. </PARA>
<PARA>I think those two points summarise what these pieces of legislation are all about. We have here a government on the political hook, having declared after the 1987 election that it was interested in privatisation, corporatisation, deregulation and delivering micro-economic reform, which has now failed to meet that obligation through political pressures of an internal kind. It has turned to find a means by which it can present an image of doing something. It has done this through this set of legislation and earlier announcements. When we examine that legislation, as we have done in the last hour or two in the Senate, we find that it has done nothing to further improve the free competition in the telecommunications industry and to provide a means by which the industry can develop in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, this legislation merely locks up tighter the way in which monopoly services will be delivered by these organisations. Minister Kelly admits that. She says that this legislation entrenches further the monopoly positions of those carriers so that the Opposition, when in government, will not be able to unlock the doors to deregulate those industries. That is the point of this legislation. It is an attempt to fool the people that deregulation is occurring. What is occurring in effect and in essence is that the locks are being closed even tighter. The numbers on the combination will become more difficult to unscramble than they were before if this legislation is enacted. That is the essence of this legislation. That is why we are moving through our amendments to change the legislation so extensively. We seek the support of the Australian Democrats in achieving that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating eight Bills cognately. I intend to address my remarks mainly to the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (Conversion into Public Company) Bill 1989 and to briefly address the Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Amendment Bill 1989. The transition of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (SMEC) from a statutory corporation into a company incorporated under the Companies Act 1981 by virtue of proposed section 21 is a step in the right direction. It is made up of four main factors: firstly, the creation of share capital; secondly, the repeal of sections 41 and 42 of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Act 1970; thirdly, the transition of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation into a company; and, finally, the repeal of section 6 of the SMEC Act that established SMEC as a statutory corporation to take effect immediately it is registered as a company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is worth recounting a little bit of history about the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. It was established in 1970 but had been going since 1950. Honourable senators will recall that in 1949, within four or five years of the end of the war, a decision was made to proceed with what turned out to be the greatest construction that this country had ever seen. Since that time there have been constructions of equal or greater magnitude, but it was a massive project. As we did not have the necessary expertise in those days, it was necessary to form a coordinating group to oversee the construction of what turned out to be the Snowy Mountains scheme with its dams, tunnels and hydro-electric generation equipment. It was built primarily for irrigation and the secondary effect was that of producing hydro-electric power to cope with the peak requirements in both New South Wales and Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA> That is the background of the scheme. It did an incredibly good job. It became a training ground for engineers, for operators, and for people using large equipment such as large bulldozers that we had not seen in this country before and massive earthmoving equipment. From that training ground people moved into engineering consulting businesses. Many senior partners in engineering consultancy groups today have their origins in the Snowy Mountains Authority. It attracted people from all around the world. It was the beginning of our immigration program. Countless numbers of ethnic groups participated in the great Snowy Mountains scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1970 the Government of the day decided to form the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. The idea was to consolidate civil, electrical, mechanical, water resource development, power generation, transmission, irrigation, land development and road engineering expertise. All those great areas of expertise were coordinated under the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. Now, nineteen years later-something like 40 years from the day the decision was made to go ahead with the scheme-the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation is being converted into a company with public company status but with all the shares being held by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> My concern lies in not knowing how effective this move will be. This is a great organisation but there are equally important consulting engineers in other parts of Australia-I could name them, but by doing so I would be giving a commercial and I might offend those I left out-who have a worldwide reputation. There is no doubt that if we let the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation off the leash it could form partnerships with other groups without having to get the Minister's permission. I draw the attention of honourable senators to the latest Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation report 1987-88, where reference is made to directions to the Corporation issued by the Minister between October 1987 and December 1987, which was not a long period. One of the directions was not to join in the formation of partnerships and joint venture companies without the prior written approval of the Minister. It is unclear from this legislation and from the second reading speech whether the Minister can continue to give those directions, although I notice from the second reading speech that the Minister says that he will be free to continue to issue directions. We cannot have an organisation competing with larger projects, not just against our own consulting engineers but against consulting engineers from around the world, when it has to meet certain requirements. It does not make any sense. </PARA>
<PARA> I note also that it is stated in the second reading speech that the Corporation is not to enter into contracts which conflict with Government policies. How can we expect an organisation to meet this requirement? I say this for the benefit of Senator Coulter, who earlier today expressed concern about its conversion into a public company and its being a possible step down the road to partial or complete privatisation. Senator Coulter could not understand how the free market could, in fact, offer an organisation like this better opportunities. All I can say is that he must have no understanding at all as to how the market operates in this area. It is a competitive area. He argues that this organisation has a social function. Everyone in this field, in one way or another, has some sort of social function. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty I have, and I know members of the Government certainly have, is to ascertain just what the Government's real position is on this. Is it step one down the track to privatisation? If so, why does the Government not come out and say so? It would not be hard to sell, least of all to the people who work for the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation itself. They would love it. Let me give the House an idea of the conflicting remarks that have been made. In July 1985 the Prime Minister of this country, Mr Hawke, at the Nunawading by-election, had this to say about privatisation:</PARA>
<PARA>Privatisation is a one-off fire sale, a sale of the century, of your assets-assets of the people of Australia. They would transfer them into the hands of a privileged few, to the cost of every one of us. </PARA>
<PARA>He also said in the Parliament on 21 November 1985:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . anyone who thinks about the issue of privatisation knows . . . it would mean higher prices, higher costs, higher taxes and higher fares . . . It is quite clear that in South Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>there must have been an election on-</PARA>
<PARA>as in Australia as a whole, privatisation would be an expensive and disastrous experiment. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer, Mr Keating, is reported in Hansard on 23 May 1985 as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>No matter where one looks, whether at TAA or the other authorities, there is no case for the Opposition's argument in economics, except simply to indulge ideologically in a Thatcherite, vandalistic splurge to try and destroy these authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the enormity of Australia's structural rigidities in the face of balance of payments crises finally hit home and, with it, the realisation that micro-economic reform could not be postponed any longer. All of a sudden, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer changed their tune and did a 180-degree turn. I understand from Senator Evans that he has always held this view, and I congratulate him on it. I hope he is in the ascendancy right now. According to the Prime Minister, privatisation is now a matter of a reasonable and rational assessment of public sector priorities. He was reported in the Economist of 26 August 1987 as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The question should be not `why should we sell a given enterprise?' but: `why should we continue to tie up our resources in it?'</PARA>
<PARA>That is very sensible. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>Privatisation, they argued, would save the Commonwealth hundreds of millions in capital injections which would then be available for social programs and even tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA>Presumably, the social programs would be to try to hose down the antagonism and opposition of the Left of the Australian Labor Party (ALP). At a press conference on 27 April 1989, the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>Some assets may be used more efficiently outside the public sector. Sales of some assets would certainly relieve the Budget of ongoing subventions and, of course, all asset (sales) produce a capital appropriation to the Budget which either retires debt or slows down the build up of debt and hence, relieves the Budget of its very high public debt interest and commitment. </PARA>
<PARA>No wonder Australians are confused about the privatisation issue. Should they believe what the Prime Minister and the Treasurer told them about the perils of privatisation in 1985, or should they accept the new version about its benefits which the Prime Minister and the Treasurer now preach in 1988-89?</PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal-National Party Opposition, on the other hand, has consistently promoted the idea of privatising government enterprises since 1984. A Federal coalition government would raise between $5 billion and $10 billion in revenue from the sale of Commonwealth assets. The funds from those assets would be used to reduce our burgeoning national debt which, as we all know, is reaching crisis proportions. The Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation was one of the instrumentalities that we indicated we intended to privatise on taking over government. The others have been spelt out by my colleague Senator Alston. They include: Australian Airlines-I will come to that again in a minute; Qantas Airways Ltd; the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation; Medibank Private; 49 per cent of the Overseas Telecommunications Commission; and the Commonwealth Bank. Employees will be encouraged to have a stake in their industry through share purchasing schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent days this issue has been raised by Mr Willis. Yesterday he put privatisation firmly back on the ALP's agenda by expressing a personal preference for full sales of the two Government owned airlines, Qantas and Australian Airlines. He made these remarks on the Ten Network's Face to Face program. He said that even if the Government sold an entire enterprise, it would retain some control through a kind of golden share which would enable it to limit the degree of foreign ownership or the size of any one holding of the enterprise. Of course, this is part of the Opposition's policy platform on privatisation. It is a system that was used in sensitive, strategic areas in Great Britain when that country went into its privatisation mode. The Prime Minister yesterday-the very day on which Mr Willis made those remarks-supported him by saying, `I thought Mr Willis put the issues very fairly and directly'. However, in today's newspapers one of the leaders of the Left, Senator Childs, said that privatisation was akin to selling the family farm. </PARA>
<PARA> There is great dissension within the Government on this perfectly sane way of approaching the problems in our country today. I also note that Mr Peter Milton of the Victorian Labor Left stated that the issue was fairly divisive. He said that it is a great mistake to float this sort of idea in this way. It is patently obvious that an issue such as this is very divisive within the ranks of the Labor Party. As I mentioned earlier, Senator Evans stated quite categorically that he has had a view on this which has never changed. I congratulate him and hope he is successful. There is no doubt that if he is he will have the support of the coalition for what the Government hopefully intends to do. But I am unsure, as is the rest of Australia, of the Government's present position and the Government should clarify it. </PARA>
<PARA> The status of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation is now being transformed into that of a public company but nothing else has been said about it-except that in the Minister's second reading speech he says that all the shares will initially be held by the Commonwealth. That is a good sign because it indicates that the Government is thinking that it will move towards initial partial privatisation by management buy-out of certain shares and, eventually, the total sell-out of those shares either by sale to the management, through a buy-out operation, or by way of a merger with some of the leading consulting companies in Australia. If this is the plan, the Government should come clean and remove the confusion within its ranks and within the Australian community. If the Government comes clean, it can have no doubt that it will get the support of the Opposition. In the same way, Senator Chaney promised in another area of micro-economic reform that if the Government moved to free up the waterfront and pursue the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission, it would receive our total support. In this instance, the Government should put its toe in the water. </PARA>
<PARA> Compared with Australian Airlines or Qantas, the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation is a small fish in terms of privatisation. So I recommend that the Government put its foot into the water. I know it is a small step for privatisation, but it seems to me it is a giant step for a Labor government. The effect of such a step would be to let off the leash those who work within the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation-those top operators, those people whom we all admire-so that they can go out and enhance an organisation that has done an excellent job to date. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The package of Bills we are debating this evening-in particular, the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill 1989 and the Telecommunications Bill 1989 to which I wish to direct attention-demonstrate the way in which the Government has failed the test of an adequate commitment to so-called micro-economic reform. That reform is essential if the living standards of all Australians are to improve through the 1990s and into the next century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The supposed purpose of the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill is to improve the efficiency of Telecom through redefining its objectives, functions and powers, and also through financial restructuring. The Bill places three obligations on Telecom Australia: firstly, a commercial obligation; secondly, a community service obligation; and thirdly, general governmental obligations. Beyond that, it fails to introduce the sorts of reforms that are necessary if we are to see a competitive situation develop with regard to telecommunications in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> A key aspect of micro-economic reform strategy for the restructuring of the public sector is that government business enterprises should be as efficient as possible. This legislation in some respects will place Telecom on a more commercial footing in line with private sector competitors. It retains its statutory community service obligation as a supplier of a standard telephone service as efficiently and economically as practicable. However, the Bill maintains an excessive degree of monopoly power in the hands of Telecom. In particular, Telecom ought not be able to use funds which it derives from the exercise of its monopoly powers to compete in the private sector. That is a significant shortcoming in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the more important Bill is the Telecommunications Bill 1989. This is the Bill which purports to provide greater competition in the area of telecommunications, particularly with regard to the provision of value added services and private network services. However, the legislation is totally inadequate in establishing the circumstances for this to occur. Indeed, as other speakers on the coalition side have said earlier this evening, Telecom's monopoly in the field of telecommunications effectively remains. The legislation sets aside specific telecommunication services for Telecom, the Overseas Telecommunications Commission Ltd and Aussat Pty Ltd, defined in the legislation as the carriers. These are the so-called reserved services. The legislation also establishes the Australian Telecommunications Authority, Austel, which will be the statutory body responsible for regulating the telecommunications industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's telecommunications industry has been excessively restricted for too long. This legislation is an inadequate response to that excessive restriction and regulation. The proposals which the Government has put forward and which it has hailed as significant micro-economic reforms, are in fact false claims, because in this legislation the Government supports the retention of Telecom's monopoly powers. While there is a lot of talk about deregulation, no significant deregulation is being introduced in practice. The best example of this is Telecom's retention of the exclusive right to provide the first home telephone until 1992. It is not possible, under the legislation, for this monopoly to be broken until there is a further review, which in turn has to go to the Minister for decision. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also questions with regard to the present legislation which prevents Telecom's customers from taking legal action against it if they have suffered financial loss caused by its actions. This immunity is retained in the legislation. Most significantly, as I have said, the legislation entrenches the very broad monopolies for Telecom, the Overseas Telecommunications Commission and Aussat and very carefully protects those monopolies. The legislation also establishes an extensive regulatory and permit system which will be an additional burden on the private sector in the very limited areas that the Bill does open up to private competition. </PARA>
<PARA> Two categories of service are identified in the legislation: those defined as reserved services, that is, the services that are reserved for the carrier monopolies; and those defined as value added services, that is, services which can be provided either by the private sector or by the carriers competing with each other. The legislation also provides that Austel will determine the technical standards for customer equipment and customer cabling. The legislation further creates a cable licensing system for persons to install customer cabling and to connect it to the carrier networks. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition believes that too much is retained in the arena of reserved services in the legislation-that is, that area retained in the monopolistic hands of the Government's own authorities. Those reserved services include: public switched telephone services; public switched data services; public switched text and video services; public switched integrated services digital networks; leased circuit services; and public mobile telephone services. In addition, there is the retention of the monopoly on the provision of the first home telephone. Another monopoly retained for Telecom is the provision of public pay phones. The legislation also prohibits the resale of leased circuit services, and the carriers have exclusive rights to the provision of all services and facilities within the boundaries of their networks. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the area of reserved services, we see it leaves very little to be provided by the private sector, those so-called value added services which the Government claims it is opening up to competition. That range of value added services is too limited. That is why, as I said at the outset, the Government has failed the test of micro-economic reform with regard to the telecommunications industry. The coalition believes that the monopoly for the public carriers ought to be restricted to the basic public switched telephone network, and the provision of those other services that I outlined a few moments ago as being reserved for the monopolistic main carriers in this legislation ought to be opened up to competition along with the value added services. </PARA>
<PARA> Another failure in the legislation is that it does not create Austel as an independent regulator. All Austel has been given the power to do is to administer the regulations that will be set out in the Bill, so it has a very limited degree of discretion to be an effective regulator. The class licence provisions will discourage product innovation and development of the industry for three reasons. The main one is that there is no provision in the Australian Telecommunications Act for persons to apply for the issue of new class licences. All that is provided is the opportunity for an informal approach to Austel with a suggestion that it look at issuing a new class licence; there is no provision in the Act which requires Austel to do anything about that matter. That will make it extremely difficult for innovation to occur in the industry-an industry in which innovation is the hallmark and which is one of the most rapidly growing areas of technology, not only in this country but around the world. The legislation again falls short of the claims that were trumpeted by the then Minister for Transport and Communications, now the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), on 25 May last year, when he made that statement on telecommunications reform to the Parliament. The legislation falls well short of the goals that the Government set at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to deal in detail with a few of the quite specific shortcomings of this legislation with regard to its adequacy in establishing real competition in the telecommunications industry. There is no provision in the objectives of the Act for the promotion and maintenance of effective competition between persons engaged in the commercial supply of telecommunications services in Australia. If the Government is fair dinkum about opening up this area to competition, obviously that ought to be one of the objectives of the Act. By regulation under this legislation the Government could allow the monopoly reserved services area to encroach further onto the area of value added services. There is no provision in the legislation to prevent the Government, by regulation, extending in the future the area of reserved services. The legislation also prevents any shared use or resale of simple carriage of communications over private telecommunications networks; that is, there is no opportunity for the private sector to resell leased circuit capacity-again an unnecessary restriction if the Government is fair dinkum about opening up this industry to real competition. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also regulations authorised by the legislation to define the boundaries of the public switched telephone network or, indeed, any other network. This is an area which Austel ought to determine itself. The legislation ought to provide that Austel monitors the appropriateness of the boundaries of the public switched telephone network and makes recommendations concerning desirable amendments. That ought not to be undertaken through regulations attached to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation defines the exclusive rights of the monopolistic carriers, whereas it ought to allow the carriers to subcontract various areas without Austel needing to become involved. In other words, if those monopoly carriers want to use the private sector and want to involve subcontract activities in some of their own areas of responsibility, they ought to have the right to do that without seeking the approval of Austel. The legislation provides that Austel shall not authorise a person to supply, install or maintain and operate a facility that is connected to and within the boundaries of a network operated by a carrier unless that carrier has agreed. Again that is an entirely unnecessary provision if what we are seeking to do is open up this area to greater competition. Shortcomings of this nature raise serious questions about the extent of the Government's commitment to deregulation and, indeed, greater competition in this very important industry. There are others with which I could deal, but I know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is anxious for the debate to be drawn to a conclusion so that he can respond, so I will not take up any more time. However, I direct his attention to those shortcomings in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the legislation really means that the Government is maintaining its commitment to Telecom's monopoly powers. There is a lot of talk about deregulation, but in actual practice this legislation goes nowhere near far enough in ensuring that the telecommunications industry is opened up to the competition which would provide benefit to the majority of the Australian people. The coalition will in the committee stage move a series of quite specific amendments to various clauses of the legislation to open up the industry to that greater competition which is necessary and which will be beneficial to the Australian community. If the Government refuses to accept those amendments, we will have to wait until after the next election to see those better provisions introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Coalition policy will require Telecom to operate on a competitive and commercial basis. We certainly remain committed to the provision of cross-subsidy. In government, we will convert Telecom to a public company. We will retain Telecom's responsibility for the basic telecommunications network, but all those other services that have been reserved as a Telecom monopoly in this legislation will be opened up to competition. Of course, that is the key to seeing an improved provision of telecommunications services to the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an arena in which there is tremendously rapid technological change. New technologies are being developed with great rapidity. If Australians are to gain the benefit of developing technology, it will be achieved only if a maximum degree of competition is allowed within this sector. That is why this legislation is inadequate. The amendments that will be proposed by the shadow Minister will certainly go a long way towards making the legislation more adequate, but what is really needed is a coalition government to implement the policies we have developed with regard to this very important industry. I would urge the amendments on the Senate but, failing that, I look forward to a coalition government being in office after the next election to open up this area to effective competition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While I cannot claim any but the most fleeting ideological parentage of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (Conversion into Public Company) Bill and the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill relating to the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC), honourable senators will be aware-indeed, a number of their sallies during the course of this debate have made it all too clear that they are aware-that in one of my previous incarnations I had a hand in the development of the Government's policies on telecommunications regulation and the management of the government business enterprises that were announced on 25 May last year. I am not very sorry about many things in relation to my change of portfolio on this occasion, as indeed on previous occasions, but I am a little sorry that my change in portfolio in the middle of last year meant that I was unable to participate directly in the fun task of translating these government policy decisions into legislative form. Nevertheless, it gives me some pleasure, a little residual frisson, as one might put it, to wind up this debate in the Senate, and I thank all honourable senators for their contributions to the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill and the four associated Bills represent the final legislative step in implementing the Government's policy decisions of last year and a major milestone, on any view, on the Government's structural adjustment agenda. However, for the telecommunications industry it is only a beginning. On 1 July there will be an independent regulatory agency, Austel, which will have a clear role of working with all sectors of the industry in providing detailed and timely advice to government on the adequacy of existing regulatory arrangements. The Opposition has moved amendments in relation to the second reading of the Telecommunications Bill and the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill. I only wish that the paucity of its amendments to the motion for the second reading had been accompanied by a similar degree of self-denial when it came to the committee stage, but we will deal with that when the time comes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a bit too late now for the second reading, but it can always be matched in the committee stage if the honourable senator feels a degree of discipline coming on. The amendment in relation to the Telecommunications Bill that is before us does express concern at the Government's `failure' to introduce meaningful deregulation and/or competition, and then goes on to acknowledge that there is indeed a need for monopolies. How else can Telecom be expected to continue the cross-subsidy arrangements that are so dear to National Party hearts? The amendment, however, then goes on, having given the game away in that respect, to complain that we have not properly specified Telecom's community service obligations. This is also the gist of the amendment in relation to the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill. It closes with a statement suggesting that there is no need for the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC) or Aussat to remain in public ownership as they have no community service obligations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The extent of deregulation and competition introduced into the Australian telecommunications industry by this legislation is very significant and honourable senators will be fully aware that the legislation is welcomed and supported by all sectors of the industry for this reason. Naturally, however, there has to be a balance, and the appropriate degree of deregulation must be constrained by the need to ensure the orderly and efficient development of the basic network by enabling the fullest exploitation of the efficiencies arising from economies of size and scope and by avoiding costly and uneconomic duplication of facilities. The fact is that the Government has initiated major regulatory reforms which represent a significant liberalisation of one of the fastest growing sectors of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill states unequivocally in clause 52 that value added services will be open to full competition, and this is, on any view, a major reform. Secondly, our policy on private networks clearly permits the growth and development of private networks provided that they do not infringe the carriers' essential monopoly services. The Opposition has explicitly stated that it also recognises and endorses the need to safeguard the Government carriers' monopoly over basic telecommunications services. </PARA>
<PARA> Both Senator Alston and Senator Powell spoke of the importance of community service obligations, or CSOs. Senator Alston mentioned the study being carried out by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics (BTCE) on the costs of Telecom's CSOs. It is true that that study was not completed within the timeframe envisaged. However, this simply reflects the sheer size and complexity of the task. Far from being a cover-up, this Government has initiated the most fundamental and searching analysis of the CSO issue ever undertaken by any government in the world. The BTCE report is now approaching completion. But most honourable senators would agree that CSOs are not just an economic and cost issue. Austel will have a mandate to monitor not only costs but also the adequacy and appropriateness of Telecom's strategies in meeting its community service obligations. The fact is that this reform package will allow the Government to make better informed decisions about CSOs and we will be able to manage the way in which CSOs are met on a more rational and equitable basis than ever before. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the specification of community service obligations, the Government has set down its expectations of Telecom in some detail in clause 27 of the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Telecom shall supply a standard telephone service between places within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) The public switched telephone service shall be the standard telephone service. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Telecom shall supply the standard telephone service as efficiently and economically as practicable. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) Telecom shall ensure:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) that, in view of the social importance of the standard telephone service, the service is reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) that the performance standards for the standard telephone service reasonably meet the social, industrial and commercial needs of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA>The decision not to define the standard telephone service in precise terms in the legislation was quite deliberate. It is clear that the Government, in defining the CSOs that it expects Telecom to meet in each of its corporate plans, needs to be able to respond to the community's needs and expectations of the standard telephone service in the light of rapid developments in technology. Furthermore, Austel has a mandate to report to government on the appropriateness and adequacy of the strategies and policies that Telecom is following to carry out its community service obligations and its efficiency in carrying them out. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that OTC and Aussat do not have CSOs imposed upon them is not a reason for removing their monopolies. The fact is that the limited monopolies accorded to OTC and Aussat are necessary to secure the available economies of scale and scope. In addition, the continuation of the monopolies of the three carriers avoids uneconomic duplication of telecommunications facilities. Moreover, the legislation gives Austel wide powers to ensure that OTC and Aussat do not abuse their monopoly powers. Austel has a specific mandate in clause 22 of the Bill to monitor the efficiency with which all three carriers supply the reserved services, the adequacy and quality of the reserved services provided by them and the appropriateness of the boundary between the reserved services and competitive services. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell indicated a particular interest in the detail of the price cap arrangements and the question of two baskets in particular. Let me for a moment address some of her concerns. The Government has not resiled from its commitment in the May 1988 statement to have separate price control arrangements for residential and business consumers of telecommunications services. It has always been the Government's policy that all consumer groups would share the benefits of the efficiency improvements to be delivered by the new consumer price index minus X (CPI-X) formula. However, the only difference in telecommunications pricing between the business and residential sectors is the rental charge. Consequently, for reasons of administrative practicality, the Government decided to combine the standard services for both sectors into a single basket subject to a common CPI-X control, as announced in the ministerial statement on 1 June 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1988 ministerial statement on telecommunications policy that I made foreshadowed that there would be separate formulas for the two sectors because, at that time, it was believed that that was the best way to limit the permissible change in the residential rental charge. However, we now believe that this objective is better implemented by placing within the one price cap formula a specific limit on permissible increases in the residential rental charge. I am sure that were I still around in the portfolio I would believe that too. A determination setting out these price cap arrangements will be issued when the Telecommunications Bill has been passed by the Parliament. This is expected to occur shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Powell also spoke of setting CPI-4-the CPI-X that has been identified-prior to the completion of the corporate planning process. The Government has seen enough of the broad planning indicators to make a decision on CPI-X. Having now taken that decision on the value of X, this is now a given factor for planning purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one matter that has been of concern to the philatelic community, which is well represented in this chamber and in the other place, to which I am told I should feel obliged to make some further remarks. Some concerns have been expressed to the Government about the effects of the provision in the Telecommunications and Postal Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill that inserts a new section 85g in the Crimes Act on collections of forged stamps; that is stamps which are collected and sold as forgeries. The proposed section 85g makes it an offence to possess or sell forged stamps knowing them to be forged. This offence is based on the existing offence in section 86 of the Postal Services Act but some minor drafting changes have been made. </PARA>
<PARA> The current offence is expressed to apply to postage stamps of the kind issued by the Corporation; that is, Australia Post. The effect is that forgeries of pre-decimal currency stamps or stamps from other countries are not covered. Senator Puplick is positively agog with all of this! The new offence refers only to postage stamps and stamp dealers are concerned that it will now be interpreted to cover stamps issued before Australia Post was created in 1975 and possibly overseas stamps. It was certainly not intended to extend the scope of the offence in this way and the Government believes that the words `postage stamp' should be read in context as limited to stamps issued by Australia Post. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a definition of postage stamp in the Australian Postal Corporation Bill, which is incorporated in the Crimes Act by the amendments. This does not actually define the words but extends the meaning to cover marks, labels and designs authorised by Australia Post for the purposes of paying postage. However, in the context in which the words are used in the corporation Bill, the only sensible interpretation-Senator Puplick should be delighted to hear; I am sure he will not contest this-is stamps issued by Australia Post. For example, the words are used in the clause giving the Australia Post Board the power to determine terms and conditions about the issue and sale of postage stamps. I am identifying the legislative intent. If Senator Puplick could grunt acquiescence of that point it would no doubt help future generations of the judiciary to acknowledge that that is indeed the legislative intent. </PARA>

We will deal with those in committee briskly and expeditiously because I want to go overseas on Wednesday and I have a deep and abiding commitment to getting my packing done before then. The feedback that the Government has received to date from all sectors of the industry is that there should be no changes to the Bill. One hopes that that view of industry will be clear enough to the Opposition, such that it will confine its last charge on this matter to one that does not occupy us for too long. Industry clearly wants us to get on with the job of establishing Austel to commence a new era in the Australian telecommunications industry-one that holds great promise for the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In summing up the debate on the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (Conversion into Public Company) Bill, the Bill represents a further step in the Government's program of micro-economic reform in the freeing up of government business enterprises from the burden of detailed day to day bureaucratic controls, replacing these with strategic oversight through major planning and accountability mechanisms. It is also a further step in the Government's effort to ensure the full commercial viability of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, recognising its unique position as one of Australia's major assets as a government-owned consulting engineering firm, and its leading involvement as an Australian company in engineering consultancy projects in our region. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill does not provide for the introduction of a staff equity scheme as that is still to be considered by the Government, but it does provide for a share premium account which is necessary should a decision be taken to introduce a scheme at a later stage. It does not represent in any sense partial privatisation of the organisation. Let me simply make the point, which should be obvious from everything I have said so far, that there is no case, as we see it, for full-scale privatisation of the organisation of the kind that is called for in the Opposition's second reading amendment. The introduction of the Bill is just one more example of the Government's continued commitment to achieving the future viability of the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill deals primarily with an amendment to the AIDC Act and represents another step in the Government's economic reform of government business enterprises. The Bill, again, will remove unnecessary bureaucratic procedures which have inhibited AIDC's commercial activities but at the same time will put in place appropriate strategic controls which will ensure a sufficient degree of public accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reading amendment in relation to the Bill aims at the complete privatisation of the AIDC and an acceptance that there is no essential public interest requiring government involvement in such an organisation. Let me say in reply to that, and in urging the Senate to reject the second reading amendment, that the AIDC was moved to the industry portfolio in late 1983 when the Act was amended to expand the goal of the Corporation. The amendments at that time enable AIDC to provide finance for the restructuring and revitalisation of industry and for high technology and other growth industries in order to improve the competitiveness of the Australian industry. Since that time AIDC has made a significant contribution to the Government's industry objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> AIDC's ability to provide both loans and equity capital across the spectrum of new and old industries is a key characteristic that differentiates it from other financial institutions. Because of the contribution AIDC can make to industry restructuring plans, such as in heavy engineering and textiles, clothing and footwear industries and in projects such as the anti-malaria joint venture, the Government believes that it should maintain an on-going interest in AIDC. In saying this, however, I would quickly point out that the decisions made by the AIDC are based on commercial judgments. It has not been and will not be directed in its normal operations as to where it should or should not invest. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, the AIDC is manifestly in need of fresh injections of capital. The float of up to 30 per cent will overcome that problem and will provide the AIDC with sufficient capital to pursue its leading programs, particularly those relating to equity. The AIDC has an excellent record and is an attractive investment opportunity for the Australian people. The float will allow the AIDC to continue its operations and will give a wide spectrum of the community the opportunity to participate to advantage in the AIDC. At the same time, those investors will be confident of the AIDC because they know the Government is going to continue as a major shareholder. We cannot get a more gilt-edged investment than that. With those remarks, I commend the Bills to the Senate and hope and pray for their speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA>Subclause 16 (1) of the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill specifies the functions of Telecom Australia. Amendments (1) and (2) are simply mechanisms to enable the third amendment to take effect. Having regard to the fact that clause 16 deals with the functions of Telecom, our amendments will limit those functions to such business or activity as is related to telecommunications. Otherwise, we have an elaborate charade which would enable Telecom to obtain an unlimited commercial charter, which we believe is not appropriate. It should not be getting into areas where it is not experienced. It should not, therefore, be engaged in activities other than those which are primary or secondary functions-certainly not functions which could be described as incidental. Therefore, we propose the amendments to limit its functions in that fashion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is aware that the Government has made a series of decisions to reform Telecom Australia to make it more efficient so that the services it offers Australian people and businesses can improve. As well as direct benefits to customers from a more efficient Telecom, there will be secondary gains because telephone and related charges are a significant input to the costs of most industries. Telecom has to make maximum use of its assets if it is to maximise its efficiency. The Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill confers on Telecom incidental functions to give it every opportunity to be as efficient as possible. This does not mean that the Government expects Telecom to ignore the major reason for its existence, or allow this to be swamped by other business. The Bill makes it quite clear that the principal function of Telecom is to provide telecommunications services for Australians. What is more, Telecom's community service obligations require it to supply standard telephone services as efficiently and effectively as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the planning and accountability provisions set out in the Bill there is also scope for the Government, as owner of Telecom, to be involved in the strategic planning processes. The Bill provides for prior notice to be given to the Minister of new business ventures. In this way, we have provided Telecom with the function of carrying on business incidental to its main business to enhance its efficiency without losing sight of its major role as a supplier of telecommunications services. In those circumstances we do not believe the amendments are justified. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could the Minister explain whether clause 16 (2) (a) is limited in any manner whatsoever? Certainly, by the use of the term `incidental' one can imagine that somehow those additional activities have to be, in some manner, related to its principal or secondary activities. I ask the Minister whether, on the face of it, that expression allows Telecom to engage in any commercial activities whatsoever, if necessary, totally unrelated to the telecommunications business. The provision that, by the use of resources that are not immediately required in carrying out Telecom's principal or subsidiary function it may carry on any business or activity that is capable of being conveniently carried on, surely means it can do whatever it wants to do.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The words are wide, but they are obviously qualified by the requirement that they involve the use of resources that are not immediately required in carrying out Telecom's principal or subsidiary function. In those circumstances, a very stiff and high hurdle to jump, there is a limitation on Telecom Australia embarking on some frolic of its own. Surely Senator Alston is not suggesting that it would be better for resources to stand by idle, unutilised, not generating returns for Telecom and the community, simply in pursuit of some ideological will-o'-the-wisp to which he has a passionate attachment. I would not think for a moment that Senator Alston would have any such approach. I am sure that, properly understood and appropriately interpreted and applied by the courts, as undoubtedly this Bill will be, if Telecom seeks to go outside its obviously intended limited mandate it will not in any way amount to the kind of open-ended extravaganza that he is postulating. I commend the recommendation accordingly.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am referring to the kind of activities which are no doubt envisaged. The clause is, of course, to be read in the context of subsection (1). It does not stand separate and independent from it. Without limiting the operation of subsection (1), the functions that are capable of being carried on are those which may involve resources not immediately required. The requirement has to be that the function in question must be `incidental to' within the meaning of subclause (1)-`a business or activity that is incidental to'. Read in that way, because it does not limit the operation of subsection (1), the clause has a confined operation in two ways: the one I described earlier and by reference to the fact that it has to be seen in the way I have just described.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (3A.) Page 6, paragraph 27 (4) (a), lines 33 to 37, leave out the paragraph, insert the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(4) (a) in view of the social importance of the standard telephone service, that, insofar as it is in its opinion reasonably practicable to do so, its telecommunications services are made available throughout Australia for all persons who reason- ably require those services; and''. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 27 as now worded stresses:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . that, in view of the social importance of the standard telephone service, the service is reasonably accessible to all people in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a variant of Telecom's universal service obligation. The Opposition sees that as moving away from the original charter provision in the 1975 Act in that it makes life a lot easier for Telecom because it no longer has to make those services available to everyone; it merely has to make them accessible to anyone. In rural and remote areas that means that if one lives in an Aboriginal community it could be said that one could travel to the nearest town and therefore the services are accessible. We say that, if one is to be serious about a universal service obligation, one must accept the responsibility of making those services available to all. That means providing them at the point where they are required. We therefore propose this amendment as a result of representations made by the Northern Territory Government, and in particular, my colleague Senator Grant Tambling, in order to reinstate the provision in its previous form, to provide that Telecom will be required:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . insofar as it is reasonably practicable to do so, its telecommunications services are made available throughout Australia for all persons who reasonably require those services . . . </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government is serious about the holy grail and all that has been said in support of the monopoly as being based on Telecom's community service obligations, surely the obligation to provide a universal service must entail providing it directly to those people who want it and not indirectly, as the clause presently provides. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of all the amendments proposed by the opposition, the amendment just moved by Senator Alston comes closest to gaining the support of the Australian Democrats, although the Minister has yet to respond. The concern has also been expressed to the Australian Democrats by the Northern Territory Government. Part of that concern related also to the difficulty experienced by some people in remote areas in achieving delivery of adequate telecommunications services. Therefore, the broader issue is also raised by this amendment. We are concerned about the change of wording and we would need to be convinced by the Minister's response that the situation has not deteriorated as a result of the change of wording in this legislation from that in the Act.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government does not accept the Opposition amendment. The Bill imposes on Telecom an obligation to make its services, as the clause says, `reasonably accessible to all people in Australia . . . wherever they reside or carry on business'. The Opposition proposes to ignore this emphasis on geographical distribution and suggests that it is for Telecom to decide when it is reasonably practicable to make services available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's intention in the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill and in the Telecommunications Bill is to place much greater emphasis and importance on Telecom's community service obligations (CSOs) and how they are carried out. The new planning and accountability mechanisms in the Corporation Bill require the Board to produce a corporate plan, which separately identifies the strategies and policies it will follow to carry out its community service obligations, including that of reasonable accessibility. The corporate plan must also include a financial target which includes an estimate of the costs of carrying out the CSOs. The Minister can then direct the Board to vary the statement of strategies and policies for CSOs and the financial target. Telecom's annual report must include details about the performance and an assessment of the cost of CSOs. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the functions of Austel, the new regulatory body, is to monitor and report to the Government about whether the strategies and policies that Telecom is following to carry out its CSOs are appropriate and adequate and whether Telecom is carrying them out efficiently. Telecom has the function of receiving and investigating consumer complaints which can include complaints about the provision of services. Austel can also direct Telecom to provide a particular service if Austel forms a view that it has failed to meet its CSOs.</PARA>
<PARA> All these provisions impose on Telecom a positive obligation compared with the existing provisions which do not do any more than exhort Telecom to perform a duty. They also provide for both the Minister and the representative of the Government and Austel to have a significant impact on the way that CSOs are carried out. So far from lessening Telecom's responsibilities, the legislation now before us will provide much greater scope for the Government to ensure that Telecom delivers its CSOs. The advent of Austel will provide that element of independent review of Telecom's performance which has been lacking. </PARA>
<PARA> The specific language which gives some concern to Senator Powell, the words `reasonably accessible', has not been more precisely defined in the legislation for essentially the same reasons that I described in the second reading reply in relation to the question of the definition of a standard telephone service. The Government, in defining the CSOs that it expects Telecom to meet in each of its corporate plans, needs to be able to respond to community needs and expectations in the light of new developments in technology, population spread changes and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> Austel has the mandate, as we have said, to report to Government on the appropriateness and adequacy of the particular strategies and policies that Telecom is following to carry out its community service obligations, including the obligation of reasonable accessibility, and its efficiency in carrying them out. As the Government determines the meaning of the phrase `in the corporate planning process', as it gives content to that notion, anyone who is not satisfied will have an avenue of appeal, an avenue of consultation with Austel. I think properly understood in that way, namely that the legislation is not intended to be a precise nuts and bolts code but is intended rather to state the obligation in a way that will enable flexibility and responsiveness to changing circumstances over time, the language makes perfect sense. Standing behind it is the fail-safe mechanism of Austel itself. Viewed that way, the Government believes that the present provisions in the legislation are perfectly adequate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I understand the Minister correctly, he is saying that the Government is opposed to these amendments because Austel will be there at the end of the day to ensure that Telecom measures up to the mark. But I have not heard him indicate why it is has been thought necessary to change `available' to `readily accessible'. No doubt if one accepts the bona fides of the Government and the vigilance of Austel, Telecom will be held up to the mark. But why should a provision, which on its face is relaxation of Telecom's community service obligations, be included if the Minister is really saying that Telecom will be obliged to maintain the same level of universal service that has operated in the past?</PARA></TALK.START>

We believe that the concept of accessibility is one that is well understood in the community at large, that the language is perfectly adequate to describe what it is that we are trying to achieve in this way, and we see no need to delay the passage of this legislation by metaphysical quibbles of the kind that Senator Alston seems determined to get into.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The key words in the Opposition amendment, which as it says reflect the original language, are the words, `in so far as in its opinion'; that is, if in Telecom's opinion it is reasonably practicable to do so, the services should be made available. Our language in the amendment is much better than that so far as ordinary consumers are concerned, because there is no language about opinion here. It is an objective requirement of reasonable accessibility. It is not a matter of anybody's opinion, not of Telecom's opinion, but of whether or not the service is reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business. There is no opinion there; it is a matter of objective reality. That is the objective reality that has to be built into the corporate plan. That is what is subject to the overriding application of Austel's regulatory power. If we leave it with the language in the Opposition's amendment, which is, as Senator Alston says, the more familiar language, we are back to a situation where the statutory requirement is no more than to act in accordance with Telecom's opinion, however misconceived, misguided and insensitive to realities that may be. So there is in fact a quite significant difference. I was describing previously the general approach and thrust of the legislation-the way it might be expected to operate in practice. But as one looks more carefully at the detailed language of these provisions, it should become apparent that, far from representing any backsliding, the Government's language in the Bill represents a very substantial improvement from the consumer perspective.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a demonstration of how ill thought out the Opposition's approach to this legislation is. Having hung its heart and its hat on the pre-existing linguistic formula, which has served the nation well, it only takes two sentences from me for both the heart and the hat to be put back in the cupboard and a new offer made. The reality is that there may not be an awful lot of difference between the concept of `reasonably practicable to make available' on the one hand and `reasonably accessible' on the other. But the remaining language of the clause is, in our suggestion, much more attractive language. Senator Alston will appreciate that I am reading this language for the first time this evening so it has taken me a little while to get up to speed and appreciate the significance of this.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I am saying is that I am only just focusing on some of the detail of this language and the reasoning behind it. But it is perfectly obvious when one does focus on it that the language here is preferable because it talks about an equitable basis wherever people reside or wherever they carry on business. The language of equity, the language of wherever people reside, the language of whenever they carry on business is much more precise than the language that was in the previous clause. Senator Alston is really trying to make a mountain out of a molehill. The big difference was the question of whether the opinion was subjective or objective. If we strip that out we are confronted with an argument about the basic direction of the language. I concede that the basic direction of the language is very similar when we take out the `in its opinion', but the language of accessibility is really the essential thing from a consumer point of view. The language of equity, which is in here, makes it more precise, sharper, clearer and more attractive-and I am sure that that is the way this will be perceived by Australian telecommunications consumers. We will rest, accordingly, with the language we have got.</PARA></TALK.START>

Why should the Northern Territory Government and others proceed on the basis that what Telecom has in mind is distancing itself from the provision of certain services? Given the sorts of problems that already exist in the Northern Territory where Telecom is providing digital remote concentrator services at its great leisure-it will be about another three years before it finally services those 70 remaining Aboriginal communities-when they could be provided within three months by satellite, why is one not entitled to presume that Telecom is simply reducing its social obligations and is not prepared to adhere to the previous language because it regards it as to onerous?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I always get worried when people such as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) start talking about equity because one is never quite sure what they mean by it. For example, is the Minister evaluating the interests of the total number of subscribers in Sydney or Melbourne against those of two or three subscribers somewhere west of the Black Stump? I rather fear that, in general, in this instance he comes down on the side of the bulk of subscribers in one place and feels that there is no reason for the small number in another place to have any consideration at all. For that reason, I come back to the wording that we have proposed as being more likely to be of assistance to people who need some support from Telecom Australia than his qualified use of the word `equity', which is not clearly defined in this instance.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is the key phrase, and it is the one that makes clear-and it is very much the international language of telecommunications which has been picked up and written into the legislation by the draftsmen-that the equity is equity of access, not some broader, larger and looser concept; it does depend on physical access to services.

<PARA> (4) Page 7, clause 30, lines 32 to 36, leave out the clause. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment deals squarely with the question of Telecom Australia's immunity from suit. I must say that, in the deregulated and competitive environment in which we live, it strikes me as extraordinary that one can be seriously asked to support a clause which provides:</PARA>
<PARA>An action or proceeding does not lie against Telecom or any other person in relation to any loss or damage suffered, or that may be suffered, by a person because of any act or omission (whether negligent or otherwise) by or on behalf of Telecom in relation to the supply of a reserved service. </PARA>
<PARA>Telecom is about to declare a profit of around $1 billion and it should have had a profit of $1.3 billion last year. It has money coming out of its ears, yet the Government tells us that somehow it should have immunity from suit-in other words, a licence to be negligent and to act in any manner it likes in the performance of a reserved service which consumers have no choice but to use. It seems extraordinary that in this day and age one can talk about immunity from suit. All the pressures are the other way. There are class actions and strict liability suggestions with the Law Reform Commission. We are being told that product liability suits should be extended. Yet here we have the great monopolists asking for immunity from suit. It strikes me as anachronistic in the extreme and quite insulting to the intelligence of the electorate that in this day and age we can be the victims of negligence on the part of Telecom when we have no choice but to use its services and no recourse in law. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should point out that this provision which the Opposition seeks to delete is far more limited than that currently provided in section 101 of the Telecommunications Act, which applies to telecommunications messages and services. The reason for the continued immunity for reserved services for Telecom Australia is the disproportionate damages that could flow from a simple technical failure for a short period. Telecom is under an obligation to supply services throughout Australia and these standard telephone services are provided at uniform prices. In these circumstances it is not reasonable that Telecom should be liable for the consequences if a call or a fax does not get through. I should stress, however, that where Telecom is supplying services in competition with other providers there is no such immunity. So that is the explanation. I believe that it ought to be acceptable.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One can envisage situations in which events could happen beyond the control of Telecom Australia. In those situations there is no suggestion that it would be liable, because there is no doctrine of strict liability applying to the actions of government instrumentalities. Indeed, the whole notion of Crown privilege and the shield of the Crown is such that government instrumentalities have generally been very much protected. Surely the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade cannot be saying that, even where negligence is the cause of loss, the consumer is simply left to his, her or its own devices? It just seems extraordinarily unfair, if we are in the business of talking about equity, that someone can be the victim of blatant negligence and yet have no recourse. We are not talking about limits on the amounts of damages recovered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister will know from his visit to the United Kingdom early last year and from discussions with Professor Carsberg, as he then was, that the Office of Telecommunications, or, Oftel, has recently introduced a whole series of legal obligations which are imposed on British Telecom and which do provide for measures of damages for persons who do not receive services within a specified period. It seems to me that that is a normal commercial practice. If one is in the business of charging for a service, then surely one is accountable if one does not deliver the service? For the Government to say that somehow it has a monopoly over the service, that it can effectively charge what it likes until Austel comes along and disallows it, and then ultimately rub salt in the wound by saying, `Well, we did not even bother to do our best, we were negligent, but you are not going to get any damages', seems to me to be an outrageous proposition. If the Minister is prepared to defend that, he really is not showing much sensitivity to those consumers that he used to be so concerned about once upon a time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this particular series of amendments shows that the Opposition simply does not understand the way in which telecommunications services are provided in this country.

The distinction that is sought by the Opposition is just not feasible or realistic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The more important point is that made by the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. The Committee noted that clauses 87, 88 and 90 appear to permit infringement of private rights because Telecom is allowed to enter land for the purposes of inspection, installation and repairs. However, the Committee commented that clause 92 allows for compensation for damage done by Telecom and that it was prepared to accept the provisions on that basis. Clearly, with the prospect of compensation payments if it causes damage, Telecom will not use its powers carelessly or without regard to the interests of landowners. Telecom must also give notice to the owner or occupier before it exercises its powers to enter on land or construct or attach facilities although maintenance and repairs can be carried out at any time. Honourable senators, and indeed members of the community, should not be concerned that they will come home and find that their houses are swamped by huge satellite dishes or other exercises of overweaning Telecom power in that respect. The concern that is being articulated by Senator Alston is a nonsense. Accordingly, I ask the Senate to reject the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I think it is too good to waste, so I will have a quick run through it. Clauses 15 and 16 set up an elaborate structure of principal and subsidiary functions but, at the end of the day, a back-door method-a so-called incidental service-effectively enables Australia Post to engage in any activities inside or outside Australia as long as it has a few spare dollars up its sleeve. We regard that as an elaborate subterfuge. It pretends solemnly that it can carry on postal services which are related or incidental but ultimately seeks to substantially broaden its commercial activities into fields where it may have no previous experience, and to do that with funds gained from monopoly activities. If there is such a thing as a community service obligation in the postal area, those funds should be carefully husbanded and applied accordingly to ensure that those CSOs are properly delivered and not risked on venture capital exercises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We take the view that clause 16 (2) is a carte blanche, essentially dishonest provision. Apart from suggesting that Australia Post should give priority to its core businesses, this provision is an open ticket to enable it to get into anything that moves. The alleged justification for the monopoly, if it does exist, surely has to be on the basis that those funds are set aside to enable the provision of cross-subsidies to those services that are effectively priced below cost. The last thing that we would want to see would be further Victorian Economic Development Corporation or rural finance licences get into commercial areas where there are essentially very large risks to be taken. The Minister's second reading speech gave no hint of the secret agenda which is effectively contained in clause 16. Therefore, we propose an amendment which would limit Australia Post's activities to its principal and subsidiary functions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia Post has no more conspiratorial an objective than to realise efficiency gains, and to do that it has to make maximum use of its assets. The Bill provides for Australia Post to perform incidental functions to give it every opportunity possible to do just that. It does not mean that the Government expects, or Australia Post will be able, to get out of postal business in favour of something more lucrative just for the sheer heck of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The simple answer to Senator Alston's amendment is that it is redundant. As I said in the context of the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill, subclause 16 (2) contains the prefatory language without limiting subclause (1). Subclause (1) is the language which makes it absolutely clear that any such business activity here referred to has to be business or activity that is incidental to the supplying of postal services or the carrying on of an activity or business which is itself related to postal services. All the clauses are intertwined, interconnected, in this way, as Senator Alston should appreciate from his earlier barristerial incarnations. There is simply no need for the rhetorical overkill that is involved in his supplementary amendment before us. </PARA>

<PARA> (4) Page 6, paragraph 18 (d), lines 15 and 16, leave out `and telecommunications value added services'. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment seeks to limit the Australian Postal Commission to its own field of endeavour. In other words, it should stick to its knitting. Why should Australia Post be in the business of providing telecommunications value added services? We do not mind it supplying electronic mail services because, by definition, they are postal activities although they are provided in electronic form. But to suggest that somehow it now has a specific charter to engage in the supply of telecommunications value added services seems to us to go well beyond its traditional fields of endeavour, to put it into uncharted waters. It has no track record that would suggest that it has any degree of commercial competence that would enable it to provide those services. It is a highly competitive area. There is no shortage of providers in the private sector, and we regard it as quite unnecessary for Australia Post's charter to be expanded in that way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is pretty startling to see the extent to which the Opposition runs squawking to water when it is given a chance to give a real competitive fillip to a statutory authority to enable it to get into a commercial activity, to spread its wings, to do things which are relevant to its basic charter which will, in fact, involve the modernisation of the organisation, increase its efficiency, its capacity to deliver services and create additional layers of competitiveness in the community as a whole. It dives in wanting to bury its head beneath the surface and says, `This is an inappropriate thing for this sort of body to do'. It cannot have it both ways. This is the business of making these organisations more commercial, of giving them broader and more wide-ranging opportunities-not open-ended, though, because there are limitations in the way in which the legislation is cast-to do effective and useful community business. The kinds of things that are envisaged by this clause, which the Opposition would limit, include the opportunity to use facilities necessary to provide electronic mail and other value added business incidental to its functions. The same applies to a later provision, clause 18 (h), which I think the Opposition is also keen to remove.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Essentially, it is the same concept. The Opposition wants to leave out clause 18 (e). Exactly the same sort of point can be made. An example of this, which will do for what I want to say in relation to the next amendment, is that Australia Post has developed a computer-based asset valuation program in the course of preparing for the new financial and accountability provisions in this Bill. The program could be used by a variety of Australian businesses. Australia Post could develop a service to use the program to assist other businesses in their revaluation exercises, but the Opposition's amendment would limit the availability of that program to governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, the powers conferred throughout clause 18 are only available to Australia Post in connection with the performance of its functions. Again, this preserves the balance between productive use of resources by Australia Post and ensures that the major effort is concentrated-as we hope it will be-on its principal function. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There seems to be a degree of almost wilful misunderstanding of our position. Certainly, the Australian Democrats have consistently indicated that they refuse to comprehend the position that we have adopted in these areas. I would like to make it clear: we do not have any objection to anyone engaging in any competitive activity as long as they are operating on a level playing field. To use Senator Evans's classic words, what we manifestly do not have here is a level playing field. The Government is providing a monopoly which guarantees an organisation a level of revenue which simply is not available to others and which it can get without any risk. If that is the case, there has to be a quid pro quo. If this organisation is being provided with that monopoly protection in order to deliver the cost of its community service obligations (CSOs) then it does not need to risk any profits that it might make on commercial activities. After all, if it is there to provide that specialised service, let it provide it. If it wants to get into business generally, that is fine, but the Government should not start talking about CSOs and using them as an excuse for the monopoly. Let us cost the CSOs. Let us do a bit better than we have done with the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economic Study to date and let us quantify that cost so that we understand what is involved. We will then have some transparency and appropriate mechanisms for funding it. If we do that, the Opposition would have no objection at all to Australia Post being as any other provider in the business. That can apply to Telecom Australia and all the other government business enterprises that still remain in the public sector.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to mention a person who has worked for the Parliament for a very long time and who retired at the end of last week. I refer to Mr Ian Hope who, I understand, was with the Joint House Department for 23 years, which is a long period. More latterly, many members of both Houses would have known him in his capacity as technical adviser to the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House.

Many hundreds of people worked on this building for short or long periods. They are perhaps the silent workers. Ian Hope was one who played a great role in the construction of this building.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The document I have tabled is entitled On Shaky Ground-a critique of the dissenting minority report of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts on The Potential of the Kakadu National Park Region. It should be of great concern to the Senate because it details how Aboriginal custodians of the Coronation Hill area in Kakadu stage 3 have been misrepresented and how three senators, helped by the procedures and Standing Orders in place at the time, have facilitated and contributed to injustice to the Jawoyn people. Honourable senators would be aware of an anomaly in procedures in the past which was interpreted as allowing a dissenting report to disclose, and even to quote, in camera evidence, while denying the same right to the authors of the majority report and, importantly in this case, to those who sought to defend allegations made about them by the dissenters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Procedure Committee has now recommended changes to right this obvious injustice. Of course, this cannot be retrospective and one group of people was treated in this way prior to my reference of the question to the Procedure Committee. I refer to the case of the dissent attached to the recent report of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts entitled The Potential of the Kakadu National Park Region. At the time of the tabling of that report I remarked on the parallels between the content of the dissenting report and the views expressed by the mining lobby. I also pointed then to what I believed to be the unethical and selective disclosure of in camera evidence in that dissent. I draw the attention of honourable senators to the conclusion of the document entitled On Shaky Ground which points to the need to revise procedures to ensure that those who have given evidence in camera or who have been the subject of such evidence are not denied natural justice. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Procedure Committee has now taken action, but there is a need to set the record straight in this case. Contrary to Senator Crichton-Browne's statement in the debate on the tabling of the report last year that all the relevant evidence was presented in the dissent, the dissent ignored a considerable body of evidence which contradicted or refuted his views. The section of the dissenting report relating to Aboriginal beliefs concerning the Coronation Hill area in what Aboriginals call the `sickness country' is a dishonest attempt to discredit the concerns both of the Aboriginal custodians and those whose responsibility it is to help custodians protect their cultural heritage. On Shaky Ground places at least part of the dissenting report of Senator Crichton-Browne, Senator McGauran and Senator Panizza in its proper perspective, that is, a rehash of discredited allegations backed up by the selective use of Aboriginal custodians', actual or alleged comments and the actual comments often taken out of context to change their meaning. </PARA>
<PARA> When Coronation Hill was registered in October 1985 as part of a large sacred site complex by the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Protection Authority at the request of the Jawoyn people, controversy soon followed. As a result of the registration, exploration work was suspended while Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) engaged in consultation with Aboriginal custodians, as is required under the provisions of the Sacred Sites Act. By April 1986 the custodians had considered proposed exploration work by BHP and had refused permission. In the public hearings of the then Standing Committee on National Resources in May 1986 and subsequently in the local media, mining consultant Joe Fisher claimed on the basis of his involvement in exploration and mining in the South Alligator River Valley in the 1950s and 1960s that Coronation Hill was not a sacred Bula site, but that the real Bula site was located at Sleisbeck, nearly 30 kilometres away. I should explain at this point that in Jawoyn belief the Bula is the being whose presence in the area was central to the creation of what is known to them as the `sickness country' and thus gives it sacred significance. </PARA>
<PARA> During June 1986 a very one-sided controversy developed in the media on the theme of an el dorado being blocked by a `bogus' sacred site. On 25 June 1986 Mr Bob Ellis, Director of the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Protection Authority, received a complaint from a Jawoyn custodian about the activities of Mr Steven Davis who, it transpired, had been commissioned by the Northern Territory Minister for Mines and Energy, Mr Barry Coulter, to investigate the registration of Coronation Hill. On 27 June Mr Ellis received a phone call from a senior BHP employee who complained that Mr Coulter had threatened that, if he had not yet arranged for consent of Aboriginal custodians to exploration of Coronation Hill, then the Northern Territory Government would intervene. Mr Ellis gave this information in evidence to the Committee. BHP appeared to accede to Mr Coulter's ultimatum and hastily organised a meeting of Jawoyn people the next week, on 1 July, which gave approval for the drilling of six exploration holes, on the basis that the area proposed for drilling had already been desecrated by uranium mining in the 1950s, and that no explosives would be used. </PARA>
<PARA> Three days later, on 4 July, a further meeting was convened by the Jawoyn Association at which the decision to allow limited exploration was revoked. Senator Crichton-Browne stated in this chamber last year, without producing any evidence, that the Jawoyn present were `bullied and harassed' into revoking permission. There is no evidence for this allegation; indeed, the following quote from On Shaky Ground indicates that the opposite is true:</PARA>
<PARA>It is perhaps illustrative of the tension and confusion surrounding these meetings (of the 1st and 4th of July) that a rumour circulated amongst Aboriginal custodians that they would ``be shot'' if they did not give approval for BHP Gold to go ahead at Coronation Hill. This rumour, corroborated by a number of custodians, was voiced by senior custodian, Nipper Brown, during the meeting of 4th July . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The belief in the threat of shootings, however unfounded, was clearly a symptom of a more widespread pressure focused on custodians to agree to exploration. It is significant to note, I believe, that during the period of the problematical meetings of 1 and 4 July, Mr Davis was actively pursuing his commission from the Minister for Mines and Energy. In fact on 2 and 3 July Mr Davis took a party of custodians, including senior custodian Nipper Brown, to the important Bula sacred site at Sleisbeck. </PARA>
<PARA> At this location Davis recorded a video of his conversations with the custodians. The dissenting report reproduced extensive, though selective, portions of a transcript of an edited version of the video, which was presented as in camera evidence during the Committee hearing in Darwin. However, the document I have tabled points out that comparison of the portions of the transcript reproduced in the dissenting report with a full transcript made from the original video reveals that Mr Davis's version, that is, the transcript supplied as in camera evidence, was subject not only to editing, but also to incomplete and inaccurate transcription, which had the effect of emphasising the matters which Mr Davis sought to prove, while deleting portions which conflicted with Mr Davis's propositions. </PARA>
<PARA> We should also consider further the circumstances of this evidence. It should be noted, for instance, that the Aboriginal custodians whose conversations were taped and subsequently presented as in camera evidence have never had access to Mr Davis's original `transcript' to check its validity, because Mr Davis has refused to give it to them and the Standing Orders of this chamber prevent its release without such permission. The only parts they have seen have been those selective parts reproduced in the dissenting report. I believe this situation to be not only a denial of natural justice to those persons who are the subject of that evidence, but also an example of the unethical use of evidence. It is one of the important reasons that I have tabled the document here tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> Incidentally, I understand that the Aboriginal custodians concerned have initiated court action to retrieve the material Mr Davis recorded at the Sleisbeck Bula site-much of it restricted, some of which has found its way into various newspapers. I have, for instance, a copy of a letter sent to the Australian newspaper protesting about the publication, in a recent article, of a photograph of a restricted Bula painting believed to have originated from Mr Davis. I personally was also disturbed to discover that material in the video taken at the same site, which Mr Davis showed to the Committee as evidence when I was present, was restricted and should not have been shown to women. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Davis's evidence and assertions, and consequently the same material contained in the dissenting report, reveal some major internal contradictions. For instance, both Mr Davis's report and the dissent suggest that senior custodians were misled into requesting registration of Coronation Hill because they were led to believe by the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Authority that Coronation Hill was the Sleisbeck Bula site. Yet, both documents also present evidence suggesting that these custodians never requested registration of Coronation Hill. If one statement were true, then clearly the other could not be true. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, in order to prove the former case, it was necessary to prove also that custodians who, I might add, had grown up, lived and worked throughout this area did not know the location of the Sleisbeck Bula site and had to be shown it by Mr Davis. This scenario ignores the facts that the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Authority had registered the Sleisbeck Bula site in 1980, years before, that custodians' knowledge of and visits to the site prior to 1985 had been documented, and that the two sites at Sleisbeck and Coronation Hill have separate Aboriginal names, Ngartluk and Guratba respectively, which have been documented for over a decade. In the words of On Shaky Ground, the version of events Mr Davis and the dissenting report ask us to believe is not only inconsistent but also preposterous. Nevertheless, misinformation continues to be spread-more recently by the Northern Territory Minister for Mines and Energy, Mr Coulter, who claimed in a radio interview in April this year that Mr Fisher, a non-Aboriginal, had been the custodian of the area for 40 years. I suppose it was this fact which allowed Mr Fisher to guide Mr Davis to the Sleisbeck Bula site which, incidentally, Mr Coulter acknowledges as `the most significant sacred site in the entire region', without the permission of senior custodians and the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Protection Authority as is required under the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, the cynical use of the word `custodian' for the position of a non-Aboriginal in relation to a sacred site is consistent with the changes to sacred sites legislation which the Northern Territory Government is pursuing at the moment. It should be noted here that the serious allegations about the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Protection Authority contained in Mr Davis's report resulted in an inquiry on the Authority, the Sacred Sites Review Committee. However, the Review Committee did not even include the issue of Coronation Hill in its final report and found no impropriety on the part of the Authority in regard to any of the allegations put to it. This indicates the weight given to Mr Davis's allegations by an independent body examining the matter in detail. Yet these were the same allegations with which Senator Crichton-Browne and former Senator Townley confronted custodians during the taking of in camera evidence at Barunga on 9 March 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> This evidence, which was extensively quoted in the dissenting report, needs some background. It was taken at a time when at least two of the senior custodians held serious misconceptions about the proposed nature of mining at Coronation Hill. Evidence, which later was presented to the Committee, indicated that two of the senior custodians who gave evidence at Barunga had formed the impression, apparently from being shown gold in drill-core samples, that a new technology involving drilling the gold out of the ground was to be employed, thereby obviating the need for explosives. The use of explosives has been the main concern of custodians as it is believed likely to disturb Bula-a factor which I understand has resulted in custodians recently refusing to approve any further work at Coronation Hill. The confusion about the link between exploration and mining, between drilling and later use of explosives, was evident during many of our discussions with the Jawoyn people-that is, to those of us who were really listening. </PARA>
<PARA> The Barunga evidence was given in a context which created difficulties of a traditional nature in that men and women were questioned together about matters normally discussed in gender-restricted groups-a criticism which was raised both at Barunga and subsequently by custodians. During questioning, Senators Crichton-Browne and former Senator Townley subjected custodians to what could only be described as an inquisition of leading questions based on the allegations of Mr Fisher and Mr Davis. The answers from custodians were simply correct denials of the imputation that Coronation Hill is the Sleisbeck Bula site or that it contains a Bula site of a similar nature. In interpreting these answers, however, the authors of the dissenting report ignored other parts of the evidence which revealed the true distinction between the nature of Coronation Hill and the Sleisbeck Bula site. On Shaky Ground points to this omission, quoting a section of the Barunga evidence where senior custodian, Peter Jatbula, who regards Coronation Hill as a Bula site, answers to Senator Crichton-Browne that the Bula significance at Coronation Hill cannot be seen. I wonder whether Senator Crichton-Browne has seen his own god. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, in quoting custodians' answers which purportedly demonstrated that some custodians did not consider Coronation Hill to be a Bula site, the authors of the dissenting report edited out preceding questions which were clearly leading to elicit a particular answer. The dissenting report also claimed falsely that seven out of nine custodians who were present during evidence were of the view that Coronation Hill was not a Bula site. In fact, only four out of the nine expressed such a view and, as I have indicated, their answers were made in the context of correctly denying that Coronation Hill was the Sleisbeck Bula site. </PARA>
<PARA> On Shaky Ground exposes a number of other serious inconsistencies and points of error in the dissenting report which time does not permit me to outline tonight. I will just say that subsequent events have demonstrated the dissenting report to be a sham. Public statements from the Jawoyn community have consistently opposed exploration and mining within the Bula Sickness Country. The Jawoyn response to the Coronation Hill draft environmental impact statement forcefully rejected the proposal and since that document was produced the senior custodians have formally applied to have the entire area of the Sickness Country registered as a sacred site. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the distortions of Jawoyn belief used so cynically in the dissenting report, it also attacks, under privilege, the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Protection Authority and, in particular, one of its employees, Mr David Cooper. In so doing, the dissenting report has uncritically accepted and sought to spread allegations concerning the Authority and Mr Cooper while refusing to accept or even acknowledge their evidence and explanations about those same allegations given to the Committee. Such abuse of parliamentary procedures is not only unethical, but also a denial of natural justice. I hope that in tabling this document tonight, those whose integrity was attacked in the dissenting report-the Jawoyn people and those who sought to help them protect their heritage-will have had at least a degree of redress and that the record in relation to Coronation Hill and the Bula Sickness Country has been given some balance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to report to the Senate tonight on the January meeting of the Pacific Parliamentary Caucus, which was held under the auspices of the Pacific Forum. The Pacific Forum is a foundation dedicated towards the furtherance of knowledge as a basis for improving the relationships between nations of the Pacific region. The Pacific Forum is a testimony to the vision, energy and ability of its creator, Lloyd Vasey. He is a capable, intelligent and far-sighted man. Most of his life was spent as a career naval officer-a very successful and distinguished one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was apparent to Admiral Vasey that there was a need to promote understanding-at a high intellectual level-of the complexities of the national interests of individual nations so that a better and more peaceful world might result. He has dedicated many years of his life-years which could have been spent in comfortable retirement-towards this end. In those years Admiral Vasey has raised the money from many sources to establish the Pacific Forum, as well as directing its activities as President. </PARA>
<PARA> Men and women-world leaders and authorities in their field-from many countries serve as directors, members of the Policy Council and members of the Research Council. The Chairman of the Pacific Forum is Philip Habib, one of the United States' most distinguished former ambassadors. Nineteen participating institutions, which include the Strategic and Defence Studies Institute of the Australian National University, the Hoover Institution of Stanford University, and the Chinese Association of Industrial Economics, Beijing, are associated with the Forum as research bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the years the Forum has published a regular stream of learned papers on economic matters and foreign relations in relation to the nations of the Pacific. Four years ago, in 1985, the Pacific Forum founded its first meeting of Pacific parliamentarians-the Pacific Parliamentary Caucus-to bring together a number of parliamentarians from the Pacific region. The meetings have been held annually ever since. On several occasions members of the North Atlantic Assembly have attended in association with the Atlantic Council. The themes of the meetings, which extend over four days, deal mainly with trade, economics and security in the region. Being off the record, away from the television cameras, in an open forum format and with capable chairmanship, the meetings are frank and productive. Delegates to the Forum meet on a basis of equality and informality, which is far more conducive to an honest exposition of views than more formally structured international meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> This year there were three members from the Australian Parliament. Mr Ted Lindsay and Mr Michael Lee ably represented the House of Representatives. I was also present from the Senate. Thirty-six delegates in total attended. From nations in the Pacific region, delegates came from Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Philippines, Taiwan and the United States. From the North Atlantic Assembly came representatives from Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Turkey and the United Kingdom. The theme of this year's conference was organising for sustained global economic growth and security. Key sessions were devoted to: new political and leadership trends; implications for international cooperation; developing countries in the changing international environment; Pacific security issues; future United States-Soviet relations-implications for arms control; trade trends-problems challenges and opportunities; and organising for sustained global economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, it was a great honour for me to be a delegate to this meeting which genuinely and constructively set out to create a better world for all of us by using quiet reason for the promotion of understanding and for the resolution of the serious problems that exist between nations. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 28 February 1989:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) How could an award handed down by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission on 1 September 1975 to non-employees of the Minister who were not eligible to be members of the Firefighters' Union, have been valid, as members of the A.C.T. Fire Brigade were not eligible to be members of the Federal Firefighters' Union until 21 August 1985 (ruling arising out of cases R Nos. 16 and 17 before the Industrial Registrar) and the A.C.T. Fire Brigade was not part of the Industry in accordance with the rules of the union until that date.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) If the Fire Brigade (Administration) Ordinance and the Regulations do not apply to Service Maintenance Section employees of the A.C.T. Fire Brigade and they are not members of the Brigade as specified in the Ordinance and are not eligible for promotion as firefighters, how is it that the agreement to which the Minister referred (effective from 1 December 1983) confirms that 2 employees:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) were to be appointed to the A.C.T. Fire Brigade in accordance with the Fire Brigade (Administration) Ordinance;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) were to be promoted as firefighters in accordance with Regulation 7; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) were to be employed under the terms and conditions of employment prescribed in the Fire Brigade (A.C.T.) Award which provides for promotion only of firefighters.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Why was a member of the Service Maintenance Section retired because he had reached the age of 60 if, as the Minister states, the Ordinance and Regulations do not apply to Service Maintenance Section employees.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Is it correct that seniority in the Brigade derives from the Regulations and is a direct consequence of passing examinations for promotion.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) As there is no provision in the Fire Brigade (Administration) Ordinance for the appointment to the A.C.T. Fire Brigade of personnel other than as Fourth Class Firefighters, by what authority did the Fire Commissioner appoint employees to the Service Maintenance Section of the Brigade to positions as Servicemen.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) If the 2 members appointed to the Service Maintenance Section could only have been appointed to the rank of Fourth Class Fireman, what relevance has the unregistered agreement between the Union and the Fire Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Does the agreement made between the Union and the Fire Commissioner ignore the provisions of the Ordinance, Regulations and an Award of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) If, under clause 28 of the Fire Brigade Employees' (A.C.T.) Award, all Service Maintenance employees `shall be paid all loadings and allowances paid to the firefighting section' will the Minister have this matter further investigated and have the award provisions enforced for Service Maintenance Section employees from the date of their appointment to the A.C.T. Fire Brigade.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) If the Minister has no power to re-open the Award hearings to ensure justice for the 12 people incorrectly employed in the Service Maintenance Section, what recommendation can he make on how this injustice can be legally resolved.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Appendix 10A of the 1986 environmental impact statement on Harris-Daishowa's woodchipping operations stated that in the Eden area koalas were most numerous in the Myrtle Mountain and Mount Darragh areas to the west and east of Tantawangalo respectively, and in the Bermagui State Forest. Subsequent investigations by the NSW Forestry Commission and independent consultants have failed to find koalas in areas of Tantawangalo Forest scheduled for logging.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I have received a copy of the report entitled ``An Assessment of the Adequacy of Parks and Reserves in the Eden Woodchip Agreement Area''.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Forestry Commission of NSW has recently constructed a section of Apogee Road near an area where there have been reports that koalas have been seen. I am advised that the NSW Forestry Commission has asked the National Parks and Wildlife Service to provide more details of the reported koala sightings but has not yet received a reply.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Forestry Commission of NSW does not carry out logging activities but it has directed logging contractors to coupes along Apogee Road. I understand, however, that because of recent wet weather, logging has been temporarily suspended in the area.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) All forestry operations are conducted in accordance with the normal harvesting prescriptions described in the 1986 environmental impact statement. These prescriptions include the retention of a network of wildlife corridors, streamside reserves and habitat trees within the alternate coupe management plan. In addition, in areas where significant wildlife populations are identified, harvesting is either excluded or modified to preserve viable populations. As noted in (4) above, the Forestry Commission has sought more information on reported sightings in the area from the National Parks and Wildlife Service. I understand that, when received, the Forestry Commission will incorporate information into harvesting plans, to ensure the appropriate degree of protection for any koala population undetected to date.</PARA>
<PARA> In my proposals to the New South Wales Government for resolving the current dispute over logging in the South East forests, I identified several enhanced forestry prescriptions which will have a beneficial effect on wildlife protection in National Estate areas where logging takes place during the twelve month period set aside for biological studies. These prescriptions include</PARA>
<PARA> the widening of streamside and wildlife corridors, and their interlinking with national parks and flora reserves where appropriate</PARA>
<PARA> limitations on further roading in areas reserved for further biological studies</PARA>
<PARA> regrowth retention logging and regeneration treatments to be applied wherever practicable</PARA>
<PARA> no logging of swamp forest or box-ironbark woodland pending a revision of the reservation status of these forest types</PARA>
<PARA> increased pre-logging studies to identify and protect significant faunal values.</PARA>
<PARA> Taken together, the prescriptions proposed would reduce further the impact of logging on wildlife.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes; early this year, the Parliament of Western Samoa passed the Offshore Banking Act 1988, which provides, inter alia, exemptions from taxes for licensed offshore financial institutions. However, I am informed that there may be problems with the legislation in its present form. At this stage, it is not clear what the final outcome of these developments will be; the Government is monitoring the situation closely. In other respects, the tax system of Western Samoa is broadly comparable to our own, in terms of both its tax rates and its overall structure.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) On 12 April 1989, I released an Information Paper on Taxation of Foreign Source Income, which contains details of comprehensive new rules designed to thwart the use of tax havens to avoid Australian tax. For the purposes of these new rules, Western Samoa has been provisionally listed as a comparable-tax country. However I would consider qualifying that provisional listing with respect to offshore banking concessions, if and when it is clear that such concessions have taken practical effect.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 12 April 1989:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Did the former Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Willis) say in his answer to Senator Jenkins' Question on Notice No. 397 (see Senate Hansard of 23 August 1988, p. 107) that the [Fire Brigade (Administration)] Ordinance and the Regulations do not apply to Service Maintenance Section employees (they are not members of the Brigade as specified in the Ordinance).</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Was it the case that when wages and conditions for the A.C.T. Fire Brigade were being negotiated in 1974, it was agreed that all service maintenance officers would be employed as firefighters, and for that reason, no separate provision was made for them in that Ordinance.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Was it the case that in July 1987, the then Senior Private Secretary to the Minister for Territories (Mr Scholes) acknowledged in writing that, `There is no disputing that, from 16 January 1976, Messrs Bartone and Cresswell [two service maintenance personnel] were legally fourth class firefighters and members of the A.C.T.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 29 November 1988 (Hansard, page 3059), Senator Haines asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, a question without notice whether it was possible to provide an estimate of how much tax revenue had been lost since 1984 because private companies are allowed to claim their foreign borrowings as a tax deduction. The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I confirm that no separate tax statistics are kept on tax deductions as a result of foreign borrowings. I would also point out that there is nothing in income tax principle to suggest that interest on borrowings undertaken by Australian companies for the purpose of deriving assessable income should not receive a tax deduction. Deductability is necessary to enable an appropriate calculation of the net asses- sable income of a taxpayer. Accordingly, I do not consider that it is appropriate to regard the tax effect of such a deduction as representing a loss of tax revenue, relative to a reasonable benchmark such as a comprehensive income tax. It is, incidentally, for this reason, that the tax deductability of interest on such borrowings is not included among the list of tax expenditures published in the Government's Annual Tax Expenditures Statement.</PARA>
