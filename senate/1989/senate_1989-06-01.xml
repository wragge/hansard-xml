<TITLE>Health Insurance</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Senate assembled in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate that the Government is about to introduce into the Senate, legislation changing health insurance. These changes will increase the cost of health insurance to members of employee based funds and will do nothing to help the elderly, as is being claimed. Big public funds will increase their surpluses by taking money from more efficient funds. People will be forced back onto Medicare, which will not help to maintain private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that the Senate reject this legislation.</PARA>

<TITLE>National Flag</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully sheweth that whereas:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. They are completely satisfied with the design of the existing Australian National Flag.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. They are aware it properly reflects the immutable characteristics of Australia, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The Union Jack, itself the creation of three Christian Crosses, represents the nation's historical origin and the source of its language and law;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the Southern Cross on an azure blue background signifying its geographical location on this planet Earth;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the large star depicting the advent of Federation in 1901.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. They know the Flag has been a source of inspiration to generations of Australians in peace and war.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. They recall that millions of native-born Australians and newcomers to these shores from other parts of the world have become united under its proud symbolism.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. They are certain that any change to the Flag will produce division in the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that your honourable Senate will:</PARA>
<PARA> Propose and pass a motion that ``the existing Australian National Flag be changed only with the approval of the Nation as expressed in a Referendum''.</PARA>

<PARA> Senator Aulich-Mr President, can I seek a ruling from you? When you examine that notice of motion can you look at the quotation that is referred to by Senator Walters? I believe that part of the quotation may be a misinterpretation and a misrepresentation of what was said by Mr Murphy. I believe it is incumbent upon us in this chamber to ensure that such quotations do not damage the reputation of individuals outside this chamber under the cover of parliamentary privilege-a technique that Senator Walters is quite prone to use on many occasions.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw your attention to standing orders 104 to 114, which deal with notices of motion. Standing order 104 states how they may be given. It does not contain any description of particulars which a person may or may not set out in a notice of motion. It simply states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . shall be given by the Senator stating its terms to the Senate and delivering at the Table a copy of such Notice, fairly written, printed, or typed, signed by himself-</PARA>
<PARA>I presume that includes `herself'-</PARA>
<PARA>and showing the day proposed for bringing on such Motion. </PARA>
<PARA>If there are irrelevancies in it, under standing order 105 the President may instruct the Clerk to divide such a notice into two or more notices. With respect, Mr President, that does not give you the right to correct it or alter it as you may see fit. I suggest that, while you may be disturbed at the length of notices of motion, you may feel they are getting too long, and you may criticise them, until such time as the Standing Orders are corrected along those lines honourable senators are entitled to give notices of motion in the form in which they wish to give them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! I have been discussing this matter with the Clerk for some time and, as I have said, we are seeking an immediate meeting of the Procedure Committee. A notice of motion should be a proposed resolution of the Senate. Excessive argument should not be given in a notice of motion. I also remind the Senate of another standing order which says that the President may direct that the language of a notice be changed if it seems to him to be unbecoming or not in conformity with the Standing Orders of the Senate. As I have said, I intend to refer this matter to a committee. I do not believe that some of the notices of motion that have been given recently are strictly notices of motion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Senator Robert Ray-I raise a point of order, Mr President. Not only did we have this debate yesterday but also the use of the word `cowardly' in a motion is not parliamentary. If anyone on our side had given such a notice of motion there would have been multiple objections from those opposite. I notice that no-one stood up.

<PARA> (d) calls upon the Pro-Choice Group to remove Senator Schacht from any executive role within the Group for his lowering of the sensitive abortion issue to the level of gutter politics;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) calls on Senator Schacht to separate himself from the abortion debate following his action in the Senate which has removed any credibility he may have had on the issue;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night I quoted from Socrates. I mentioned the fact that he had said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Nobody is qualified to become a statesman who is entirely ignorant of the problem of wheat. </PARA>
<PARA>I said that after Senator Lewis moved the Opposition's amendments in this place. I believe that Mr Kerin, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, could go some way towards becoming a statesman and lose the image that he has at the moment of a Minister who has threatened the Senate with the passage of the Wheat Marketing Bill, a Bill which we want to amend and improve. He has said that if we do not pass the Bill in the way he wants it he will let it lapse. He will let this export industry, and the wheat growers, both so vital to Australia, go to the wall or be thrown to the wolves in corrupted world markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's performance in this whole debate has not been to its credit. As I said, I think that the Minister could become quite a statesman. The Socrates quotation is very relevant. I will quote what some of the newspapers have said about this Bill we are still debating. I quote from part of the editorial in Stock and Land of 25 May. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>The untidiness of the drafting required 26 amendments by Primary Industry Minister, John Kerin, in the second reading and another five on its return to the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA>It has been a very shoddily and very badly drafted Bill that has required so many amendments just because of its bad drafting. The editorial went on:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kerin says the Wheat Board will control the fund, and it will be the Grains Council who will select the majority of the board's membership. But just for the record, Mr Kerin will have the power to veto choice of members of the selection committee, he will have the power to reject selection committee nominations, and he has the power to approve or reject the board's corporate and operation plans. </PARA>
<PARA>He has a lot of power over this Board, if this legislation were to go through. The editorial went on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Coalition would be pushing for three major amendments in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are three of the four that Senator Lewis has already alluded to. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a higher level of underwriting, the appointment of a grower-chairman, and greater control for growers of their industry fund. </PARA>
<PARA> All three if adopted would put a smooth icing on a workable piece of legislation. If rejected the taste will be bitter for graingrowers. </PARA>
<PARA>If these amendments put forward by Senator Lewis are accepted, this Bill will make Mr Kerin a much more popular Minister. It will also enable him to say that he is moving into the statesmanlike area. I think he should sit and listen to these amendments. The editorial in the Land newspaper of Thursday, 25 May, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate must adopt the three key amendments being sought by the Coalition, and the Government should be magnanimous enough to accommodate them in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Coalition is seeking is a higher level of underwriting, the appointment of a grower-chairman for the new-look Australian Wheat Board, and greater control for growers over their industry fund-all perfectly reasonable requests. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, who is sitting at the table representing the Minister in this place, knows that they are perfectly reasonable requests. I hope that he transmits to his Minister in the other place the message that these amendments we are asking him to consider here today are reasonable requests. The editorial in the Land newspaper went on:</PARA>
<PARA> He-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Mr Kerin-</PARA>
<PARA>has effectively wrested control of the wheat industry from growers and achieved his major aim of exposing the Australian Wheat Board and its State instrumentalities to competitive forces. </PARA>
<PARA> In so doing he has thoroughly antagonised many growers. </PARA>
<PARA> As a wheat grower myself-and Senator Panizza has made this point as a wheat grower-I can assure the Minister that we have been antagonised by the way that this has been foisted on us and the way that the Minister now will not listen to these amendments we are asking him to consider. </PARA>
<PARA> The major point that I raise is that I have been accused of working very closely with the Grains Council of Australia. Yes, I work closely with the Grains Council of Australia, because it is the peak body representing the wheat growers in Australia. I am quite sure that Mr Kerin works very closely with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Labor movement because they are the peak bodies, if you like, of the trade union movement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will allude to that in a little while. One of the basic tenets to which the Government could and ought to yield is the question of underwriting. For the Government, this is a question of semantics. The 95 per cent underwriting arrangement would cost the Government nothing-I repeat: nothing. If one looks at the net pool return over the last 10 years to the time of setting the guaranteed minimum price (GMP) and at the final price achieved by the Board, one would find that only once during that 10 years has the price gone below 95 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Committee. That gives the complete lie to some of the assertions that have been made by the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, in this place. My good friend and colleague Senator Panizza alluded to that yesterday in Question Time and also in his speech last night. The Opposition has continued to press for 95 per cent underwriting because we consider it as a protection mechanism to give a strong market and to add stability. It will ensure a strong Australian Wheat Board, something the Minister has always wanted. It will enable the Board to be an equal trader in the domestic market, to come in easily with its cash trading options and to compete on the domestic market in a fair and equitable way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government, through the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, has been quoted widely as saying that he and the Government were prepared to negotiate, to come to some arrangement whereby the wheat growers of Australia would not be in the position of having no legislation in place. That is the point made a minute ago: the Minister has threatened us. He has also said that the industry would not be damaged. I suggest that he is playing politics and that he is jeopardising the sowings that are going on at the moment. I know it is pretty wet in many areas and that growers are having trouble sowing, but I am sure that those who are sitting out there on tractors and can sow will be wondering what the Minister will do with this legislation, whether he will put the icing on the cake and make the legislation better by acceding to our amendments, whether he will bludgeon it through, or whether he will do what he has threatened to do if we defeat the legislation and that is to let the legislation lapse. </PARA>
<PARA> I believed the Minister when he said that he was willing to sit down and talk, but if he cannot come to the party on this issue when it has been demonstrated that the proposal will cost the Government nothing and will provide stability to the industry, I will lose faith in him. Having had dealings with him recently on other issues, I do not think he is the sort of person who wants to see this industry jeopardised. He cannot expect the grain growers of this country to have any respect for him or to believe him when he says that he has their best interests at heart, if he does not accept these amendments, if he does not take notice of them, if he does not put the icing on the cake so that the job is done properly for the wheat industry. As I said, he can either become a statesman or he can become a Minister for primary industry about whom not only the wheat growers but also the people who rely on export income will be worried in the future. Clause 15 of the Bill states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Board shall consist of:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a Chairperson;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) if an appointment has effect under section 45, the Managing Director;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) a government member; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) 8 nominated members. </PARA>
<PARA>The eight nominated members will be appointed from persons nominated by the selection committee. In effect, it will be a list drawn up by the Grains Council from which the Minister can pick and choose. Under the heading `Selection criteria', clause 30 states:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The Minister may determine selection criteria to be applied by the Committee in selecting persons for nomination. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) A determination shall be in writing. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Minister shall give a copy of a determination . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Under the heading `Rejection of nominations', clause 33 states:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) If the Minister is not satisfied that a person nominated by the Committee is suitable for appointment, the Minister may give the Presiding Member written notice that he or she rejects the nomination of the person. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister has a lot of control. Even though the Grains Council and the selection committee might come up with good recommendations, the Minister can still override their choice. We on this side of the chamber are saying that we want the chairperson of the Board to be a grain grower. Again, it is an issue on which the Minister can move easily. It is not critical to the effectiveness of the legislation. It is commonsense. The Minister in his second reading speech states:</PARA>
<PARA>I have indicated to the GCA that the AWB will continue to have a grower chairperson. </PARA>
<PARA>In my speech on this legislation the other night I said that `where a right is uncertain there is no right', and I referred to section 15ab of the Acts Interpretation Act. I quoted a bit of Latin but because my interpretation is not very good I will not quote that Latin again. But it is very pertinent and important that the wheat growers should have the chance of having a grain grower as the chairperson of the Board. </PARA>
<PARA> I trust the present Minister. I trust that Mr Kerin will take notice of the sensible amendments that have been moved by Senator Lewis. While Mr Kerin is the Minister he will most probably keep a grain grower as chairperson. But I cannot tell what will happen in the future under other Ministers. Maybe Senator Cook will be the next Minister for Primary Industries. I would trust him as well. But we cannot say, nor can Senator Cook say, that we can trust some of his colleagues who might get that job in the future. Therefore, it should be written into the Bill that the chairperson must be a grain grower. It is very easy for the Minister to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> Another issue relates to the Trade Practices Act and the effect of the Australian Wheat Board on interstate trading. I am told by the Minister and other persons that this may cause problems. I still think that the amendment moved by Senator Lewis is very worth while. </PARA>
<PARA> The other problem relates to control of grower levies. Growers contribute around 2.25 per cent of their gross wheat returns to a levy fund. If you, Mr Temporary Chairman, were to invest money into something, you would like to have control over it. You would not like to give away control-nor would your representatives, your friends in the industry-of the money you are putting into something. You would like to have complete control over that grower fund. We have the word `consultation' in the Bill. We thank the Minister for allowing that. But we think there should be greater control over grower funds.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will be seeking to divide the motion so that there can be a vote on the first half and on the second half. They are essentially about different items. One is asking us not to press certain amendments and one is seeking our agreement to certain amendments made by the House of Representatives. It might be easier if they were taken separately; but that will be decided later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I reiterate the fact that it is not, contrary to what Senator Brownhill said, entirely up to the Government. This chamber has power. It has power, for example, to completely nullify the very blatant blackmailing exercise attempted by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) in the letter which was sent to all senators. Fairly clearly, if we continue with the status quo, which this chamber could ensure by supporting Senator Powell's Wheat Marketing (Renewal of Sunset Clauses) Amendment Bill, then there would be no basis on which the Government could say, `The whole wheat industry will collapse unless you pass our Bill'. </PARA>
<PARA> I say that for the benefit of honourable senators who do not not have a long institutional memory, because we have gone through this exercise before. In 1984 a package of Bills dealing with wheat marketing was discussed. Part of one of those Bills dealt with the structure of the Australian Wheat Board. That was the first attempt by the Government to take away grower control of the Board. In a speech I made in this place on 9 May 1985, I said that it had been Democrat policy that there ought to be grower control of commodity boards. In line with that, I negotiated with the Minister with regard to this particular piece of legislation. It might be interesting to quote from the speech in the House of Representatives that the Hon. Tom McVeigh made on behalf of the Opposition parties on 4 October 1984 when, as Opposition spokesperson, he was debating the Wheat Marketing Bill:</PARA>
<PARA> I have drawn the attention of the House to the Minister's statement. That statement is blackmail, and blackmail of the most cowardly kind. By blackmailing the Opposition this Government, through its lame-dog Primary Industry Minister-</PARA>
<PARA>it is the same Minister now-</PARA>
<PARA>is attempting to blackmail Australian wheat growers. In consultation with industry representatives the Opposition has several amendments to propose to the legislation. However, the Minister, intent on prostituting the Westminster system, has ensured that there can be no meaningful amendments to this legislation without denying growers their $2 billion of harvest payments. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the exercise in 1984. That was the type of blackmail attempted then. It did not work then because, while Tom McVeigh was on his feet saying that because of that blackmail the Opposition would support the legislation, I went to the Minister and said, `There is no way that legislation is going through the Senate because we will keep talking about the wheat Bill until Christmas'. The Minister at that stage backed down and that particular section dealing with the Wheat Board was taken out of the Wheat Marketing Bill and deferred until the following year. The following year we got the Government to accept that there would be grower control of the Wheat Board because there was no other way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> So this is not the first attempt at blackmail; it is not the first time that the Government may succeed in using blackmail over the Wheat Board. All that is required is that the status quo be maintained, and there is no possibility of blackmail. That can be done very simply because we can say to the House of Representatives, `The sunset clause has been removed. You have another four years to work out what you want to do'. If the House of Representatives does not accept that, it is the Government's and not the Parliament's problem. We have in fact legislated to protect the wheat industry. There is a very simple way out. Once this chamber gives in to the type of blackmail in that letter, we will not have a leg to stand on. So it is not just about this matter; it is about whether or not we will be able to do an effective job in this chamber. Last night in this debate I said by way of interjection that there is no way the Government can continue the type of exercise that it was proposing in the letter. It is simply absurd to think that any responsible government could go about what it is suggesting. </PARA>
<PARA> Most honourable senators well realise that I do not have a great place in my heart for most bureaucracies. Indeed, I find that many of the problems that have emerged in legislation have stemmed not from the Government but from what has been written in by a variety of people who think they know better than the elected representatives what ought to happen. When I was our party's primary industries spokesperson, I had a number of dealings with people from the Wheat Board. I met them on quite a number of occasions not only in Australia but also overseas, particularly in Washington on two occasions when we had a parliamentary delegation lobbying Congress with regard to the United States stance on trade with Australia. I found these people to be some of the toughest bureaucrats that I have ever met. They have a very tight structure and they have worked very well. They have the runs on the board. They have been operating in an extraordinarily tight trading market and have done their job well. In fact, they have moved our wheat under the most incredibly difficult international circumstances. They have got prices which I think most people did not believe they could get. </PARA>
<PARA> This whole exercise ought to be seen as a model for other boards and corporations, not as something that ought to be dismantled. We do not see deregulation of the domestic market in the same light as do the Opposition parties. Quite frankly, our view is that deregulation of the domestic market will destroy the Australian Wheat Board's ability to operate as an international trader. What would happen if the market were opened up in that way? At the end of the day, if I were a grower-which I am not-I would prefer to deal with the Wheat Board rather than with Elders IXL Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we need to continue the arrangement under which growers have primary control of the Board. It is important to note that the Board has had grower control during the period in which it has been incredibly successful. As Senator Powell said the other night, the Government suggests that a wheat grower cannot be a successful entrepreneur. But the entire legislation is premised on the view that he can. I think the contradiction is apparent to everybody: we can deregulate the domestic market but we cannot trust the growers to operate properly on the Wheat Board. </PARA>
<PARA> But I think a further important point has been missed in this debate, and that is the relationship between the Board and the people whose livelihoods we are talking about-the wheat growers. This is a two-way process. If changes need to be made, if modifications are necessary when the going gets tough in the international market, the Wheat Board, in view of its association with the Grains Council of Australia-the commodity body-and the National Farmers Federation, is able to get back to the growers and give them information. The Board has an understanding of the context in which the growers are operating. The growers, who know that there is a majority of people on the Board who understand their industry, are much more likely to accept decisions made by the Board than they would decisions made by people who have never been in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> So there are many pluses in having grower control of the Board that I think are often missed by people who want to wave wands and make the types of changes that are proposed in the legislation. I have not discovered where the Opposition stands, but I presume that we are not going to make the changes that are required by the Government. I do not think the changes have been argued for. No basis has been put up as to why they should be accepted. One only has to look at the explanatory memorandum as to why our amendments have been rejected. We are simply told, `We do not accept them'. This is probably almost the same as the gobbledegook that we are given as to why legislation has not been proclaimed. We are told that our amendments are not appropriate. Quite frankly, I do not want some pipsqueak public servant putting into the mouth of the Minister that they are not appropriate. It might be all right if we could be given a reason as to why they are not appropriate. But I find it quite extraordinary that the Parliament and the elected representatives should be told by the wave of a quasi-ministerial hand that it is not appropriate for us to amend the legislation. If the Minister can give some reasons why it is not appropriate, we could debate them. I am not going to have a debate with somebody who merely says, from his position of power, that it is not appropriate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened to Senator Panizza last night in relation to the support system. I thought he was very kind in his remarks, because the situation goes back a long time. That support system set out by Senator Panizza is to provide a fall back position. If it is ever activated, it will be only for a year and then the new floor price comes into effect. It is a means of adjustment. The wheat industry, under the Board which has been so roundly criticised by the Government, has managed under incredibly difficult circumstances. I think that the Government, wearing another hat, would recognise that it has had to trade in most extraordinary circumstances. I refer particularly to the Americans, whose wheat costs twice as much to grow as ours, but who then embark on a subsidy exercise. One person said to me on the hill in Washington that the biggest wheat grower last year-who did not grow any wheat, by the way-had just received $US20m. He said that the Texans do everything big and that even those people who do not do anything do it in a big way. It is extraordinary that one individual should receive $US20m. That is the type of thing against which our farmers are competing. As Senator Brownhill said, they are competing not just against the weather or Australia's internal problems-and, by the way, those types of problems exist in every country-but also against the United States Treasury.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Wheat Board has done a magnificent job. It has been able to draw on expertise and advice in every area where it is required. It has no lack of expertise in the international market. One has only to look, as I did, at the futures trading floor in Chicago, which trades in our wheat, to know that things are done in a very sophisticated way. There is no lack of expertise, there is no lack of initiative and there is no lack of success. If those are the circumstances, why are growers going to be ditched in favour of some other silvertail?

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Let it be signalled to the rural community of Australia that we have before us a most important piece of legislation deeply affecting rural Australia and we had to call a quorum to get some Ministers in the chamber to listen. Quite frankly, they have not been listening since the beginning of this debate, which has been going on for the past 12 months. We have had to drag them out of the pool room, the members bar and even the tea room just to hear some words of wisdom, even from the Australian Democrats. That is an utter disgrace. It is a fair signal to rural Australia that the Government has never had any interest in this piece of legislation except to make it a political piece of legislation, an attempt to drive a wedge between the two Opposition parties. As far as that goes, it has failed. However, what the Government has succeeded in doing is to sell out the wheat farmers of Australia and in fact, in the long run, the rural community of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before reaching what can be termed the eleventh hour of this legislation-in which I have been deeply involved from the beginning-we have gone down a tortuous path, swaying from side to side, never knowing what the end result would be. As we reach the eleventh hour of this controversial Bill, I suppose it is time to pay some dues, difficult as that might be for me, to the Democrats for their support. I recall quite warmly Senator Powell and me flying off to a wheat farmers' meeting in Warracknabeal. The meeting was well attended by Australian wheat farmers, who were outraged at the Bill. Senator Powell and I linked arms to give the wheat farmers the utmost confidence that we would fight this to the very end. That is exactly what we intend to do. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Macklin's contribution has to be recognised also. He brought home the realities of the legislation: the reality of the attempted blackmail of the Government, the reality of the respect that the Australian Wheat Board has overseas, particularly in America, and the reality of who will be the great beneficiaries if the legislation goes through. Of course, Elders IXL Ltd will be the great beneficiary of the legislation. There is absolutely no doubt about that. We cannot get away from it. It has to be admitted that the grain merchants will be the great beneficiaries of the legislation and to the forefront will be Elders IXL. Many questions must be asked about why that company will be at the forefront of those benefiting from the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Wheat Marketing Bill sells out wheat farmers. It will absolutely finish the Government in the bush. The Government has signalled to Australian farmers that it does not care about them at all. The legislation was sloppy from the very beginning. When it was introduced in the other House the Government had to move 40 amendments, quite apart from the honourable member for Murray, Bruce Lloyd, bringing in 40 amendments. The threat by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, is absolutely idle. As Senator Macklin has pointed out, it was attempted before in 1984 and also attempted in relation to the dairy industry legislation. That sort of threat has been put on this Parliament before and it should never be taken seriously. If the Minister chooses to run his portfolio by threatening the Parliament, we in this chamber who must make judgments should never succumb to that threat. I hope that my colleagues never believe that the Minister will allow the Bill to lapse, thus throwing the whole industry into chaos. When one considers the Minister's own words in 1987, one realises that he has done a black flip on this matter. He is not genuine in his attempt to improve the lot of wheat farmers. In 1987 he recognised the very point we are making today. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>If you get rid of the Wheat Board's power you would be handing the industry over to the Elders and Cargills and Continental Burges and away you go. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister knows exactly what we are on about. He is into the politics of the matter. Unfortunately, others are into the ideology of the matter. Those of us who are against the Bill are into the reality of the matter. The Bill will sell out 45,000 family farmers who contribute a great deal to this country's wealth, who work from dawn to dusk and have to face the threatening elements of the Australian climate. Family farmers are of great benefit to this country, both socially and economically. They are of great benefit in those two ways. They own Australia's natural resources. Heaven knows, that is very important in this country today. The ownership of our own natural resources, our own dirt, is becoming rare as this country slips into a quagmire of economic irrelevance. </PARA>
<PARA> We should not underestimate the Government's inability to understand what the Wheat Board is all about. It is not a monopoly, as it is painted so often; rather, the Wheat Board is the cooperative or collective of 45,000 wheat farmers. It is their marketing arm. That is completely different--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WH4">Senator McGAURAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Senator Brownhill is one of the experts on this matter. From the very beginning he has put in a great deal of work. He not only has kept in close liaison with wheat farmers and the Grains Council of Australia but also has been a strong spokesman for the National Party. It is no secret that the National Party has not warmed to the Bill. As a National Party spokesman, Senator Brownhill has been at the forefront.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In giving more praise to the industry let me ask: Why would we muck about with an industry that produces over $2 billion of export income for this country when the world is on the verge of a trade war? We know that to be true. It has never been as important as it is now to support such industries. We should not think that by changing the domestic market the export market can be kept intact. If we took 20 per cent away from any business it would not remain viable. The domestic market is very important to the Wheat Board's operations and, of course, to farmers' operations. We should not think that the export market will not be threatened. Of course it will be threatened. I want the Government to explain why this would not be the thin end of the wedge of deregulating the export market. Once the grain merchants are freely able to buy wheat in the domestic market, what will stop them from overbuying and carrying a surplus which will not only affect the following year's prices for the farmers but also encourage grain merchants to run to the Government saying, `We have a surplus. Let us export it.'? That will be the first cry. If the Wheat Board has to fulfil its quotas and half the grain is being bought up on the domestic market, the Wheat Board will have to buy the grain from the grain merchants to fulfil its export quotas. That will absolutely snooker the Wheat Board. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Powell says, by way of interjection, that that is what they want. Let them deny that that is what they want. I would like to hear from the Government on that matter. There are 45 sellers and two or three large grain merchants. For those idealistic ideologues who work out of text books, that is called an oligopoly. Let them try to explain how that leads to an efficient market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no argument about micro-economic reform. The argument centres only around the Wheat Board. The report of the Industries Assistance Commission says that. It says that we can maintain the Wheat Board as it is today-the Commission believes that it is an efficient industry-and that deregulation of the transport industry and similar changes can come about. The waterfront situation is no different. There have been any number of reports on the waterfront and how it can be improved. Billions of dollars can be saved in that area. The Trade Practices Commission supports my concern. I would like to quote the most potent parts of the Trade Practices Commission's concern about just open slather deregulation from the rural guidelines. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>While a superficial analysis may suggest that economic efficiency would be best served by removing regulation and allowing the market to operate free from intervention with the individual seller negotiating with the buyer, this does not hold where the market power of the large buyers would (in a deregulated market) far outweigh that of the producers. The concentration of market power among processors, manufacturers, distributors and retailers implied by these figures, indicates that powerful buyers have emerged in the acquisition of primary products. Similar concentration has developed in the supply of goods and services such as fertilisers and services provided by stock and station agents. </PARA>
<PARA>So my concerns are backed up by the Trade Practices Commission. I signal my support for the coalition amendments. I call upon the Government to support those amendments. The most important one is, of course, the 95 per cent underwriting provision. The Government must realise that, on this particular amendment alone, all that lies between the farmers and destitution is a strong Wheat Board. It will not be strong unless there is that significant underwriting factor of 95 per cent. What the Government has in place is no more than a market facade. It will never be triggered. The phasing down of the underwriting provision that the Government has and which will ultimately, after five years, be wiped out, will never be triggered. It is a market facade, and the Government knows it. Underwriting is most important to any orderly marketing system in rural Australia, and I support such a system. It gives some security to the farmers and it is also an efficient allocation of resources in primary industry. It is a guard against the collapse of prices; it is a guard against corrupt markets; and it is a guard against the pending trade wars. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I give my full support to the coalition amendments. I salute the endeavours of those attempting to incorporate these amendments in the Bill. I know the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, has been unflinching in not accepting these amendments. But perhaps by the end of this debate the Government will finally come around to understand that underwriting is of critical importance in this Bill. At the same time, however, I signal my vote against this Bill at the third reading stage if those amendments are not supported. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I realise that I have already spoken during the committee stage but I seek your indulgence, Madam Temporary Chairman, to speak for a few more minutes. I slept on what was debated here last night, and I am afraid I did not sleep too well when I thought about the misleading figures given on the guaranteed minimum price (GMP) to justify why we should not have 95 per cent underwriting. Senator Macklin made some points about the GMP. The Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) has not given us any good reason why we cannot have 95 per cent underwriting. By questions I told him that. This chamber is sent false information, which Senator Cook knows is not correct. Yet he will sit there and not withdraw it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said last night, the GMP is very important. The reason it is so important is that it permits someone borrowing money to get a reasonably high first advance. But at the same time, it is an underwriting. There is no way in the world, with the present modern-day forecasting of prices, that on a one-year basis it will ever be triggered. So let me allay the fears of honourable senators on that matter. The preliminary GMP is set in roughly the third week in October, in time for some of the Queensland harvest coming off, and a lot of it is delivered before the preliminary GMP is set. It is set at 90 per cent of what it is thought the final GMP will be. Ninety per cent of 95 per cent is 85.5 per cent; so the forecasters have to get within only 85.5 per cent of that subject year forecast. In the third week of October, say, we know exactly how many acres are planted in Australia, and we will know almost exactly what Australia is going to produce, because the satellite can pick up what crops are being grown. After all, these days satellites can pick up 10 square metres of marijuana in 100 miles of bush in Western Australia just like that, so they can tell us exactly how much wheat is in-if the Australian Bureau of Statistics does not know-and what it is likely to yield. By then the Northern Hemisphere harvest is taken off and we know the exact number of tonnes growers in the Northern Hemisphere have harvested. We know the prices that have already been paid in the Northern Hemisphere and how many tonnes have been sold there, and we know how many tonnes the Australian Wheat Board has sold in a forward market. </PARA>

With a 95 per cent subject year the Government would not have put in a cent. In fact, if we wanted to make it a two-way bet on the 95 per cent, if one got more than another, the wheat growers would have been paying back to the Government at 3 1/2 to 4 per cent. But not one cent would have been paid in, and Senator Cook knows that. Misleading figures had to be used to try to prove his point. He has successfully fooled a lot of taxpayers. I am afraid he has even convinced some of my colleagues that we could have been up for $300m. In fact, if I thought I would be putting the Australian taxpayer up for $300m, I would be very wary of supporting it myself.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am arguing for the 95 per cent underwriting, so it is there for those guaranteed borrowings. There is no way in the world that it will ever be triggered at 95 per cent of the forecast year. With the amount of forecasting that can be done, we can get it spot on. As I said, in that worst scenario of 1986, we got within 98.8 per cent of what the final pool paid. They got within 22c a tonne, and methods of forecasting have improved since 1986. Anyway, I have made my point. When we get the final GMP, which is not until about the first week in March, then we know exactly how many Australian tonnes are harvested and how many sales have been done up to that stage, and know whether the Northern Hemisphere has sold more wheat and consumed more wheat. So we are in a better position in the first week of March to come to a final GMP, and we will not make any mistakes, especially with a rising market.</PARA></TALK.START>

Let me return to the reasons that the Government has given for being unable to accept our amendments. In respect of amendment No. 7, the Government has indicated, `Initially, the Chairman will be a grower, although this is regarded as a transitional arrangement'. The fact that it is meant to be a transitional arrangement shows that the Government intends to get right away from grower chairmen. As I said last night, it is ridiculous to think that a suitable chairman could not be found among 45,000 Australian wheatgrowers and their families. Counting growers' wives and children, many of whom have been well educated, the figure could be 135,000. Most of the children remain in the industry or are defined as growers because they belong to a family partnership, a family trust or something like that. It is ridiculous to imagine that it would not be possible to choose a suitable chairman from among 135,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA> Later I will give some examples of the kind of farming people who would be suit- able. The chairman of any corporation must be someone who has a feeling for the industry. In the case of wheat, it must be someone who has a feeling for wheat; in the case of dairying, it must be someone who has a feeling for dairying; in the case of mining, it must be someone who has a feeling for mining. The Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, which is involved mostly in mining, must be headed by someone who has a feeling for mining. Is anyone going to tell me that the head of Telecom Australia has not been involved in communications? I do not know the background of the Chairman of Qantas Airways Ltd, but I am sure that it was something to do with transport. I ask once again how it is that out of 135,000 or 150,000 people a suitable person cannot be found to head the Wheat Board. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give some examples of the kind of people that the Australian farming community has produced in the last 20-odd years. There is a fellow called Malcolm Fraser, one of the longest-serving Prime Ministers of this country. </PARA>

We have produced fellows like McEwen, Doug Anthony, and other capable people who came into parliament but did not necessarily achieve the position of Prime Minister. There is no better example than John Stone. I heard a senator opposite the other day call John Stone a silvertail. No one who, like me, was brought up on a farm during the Depression and who went to school by horse and cart, after doing all the jobs that had to be done on a frosty morning, could ever be called a silvertail, no matter how far he had progressed. Over the years I have heard Malcolm Fraser called a silvertail. When Malcolm Fraser was born his father was a rabbit-trapper in north-west Victoria. The silvertails are not all on this side of the chamber. Having heard me mention the kinds of farming people that Australia can produce, is any honourable senator going to tell me that they cannot produce a suitable chairman for the Wheat Board?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has heard powerful speeches explaining the merit of the amendments, but, in the motion that we are discussing, the Government is rejecting them. Like other senators on this side, I put it to the Government that a number of the amendments do not go against deregulation of the domestic wheat market but are of major importance to wheat growers. My colleague Senator Panizza has just referred to two of them. The Government could accept amendments Nos 18 and 19 to allow the underwriting guarantee to be 95 per cent without a sunset clause. That would improve the Australian Wheat Board's capacity to borrow on the commercial market. Amendments Nos 7 and 8 would ensure that the chairperson and five of the eight nominated members of the Australian Wheat Board were wheat growers. By accepting the amendment, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) would put beyond doubt the commitment that he gave in his second reading speech. Amendment No. 12 relates to the non-application of the Trade Practices Act to the marketing of wheat, and amendment No. 20 would require Grains Council of Australia approval with respect to the use and management of the levy fund, which, after all, consists of money contributed by the grain growers themselves. It is not unreasonable that the Grains Council-their peak body-should have a say in the use and management of that money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put it to the Government that, of all the amendments, it should accept at least the ones I have just mentioned. Is the Government going to reject all the amendments, or is it prepared to accept any of them? I hope that, in his response, the Minister will say clearly whether he is prepared to accept any of them, so that we may make our decision. If he is going to reject all of them he must tell us why. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my privilege to reply on behalf of the Government to the propositions that have been put forward by the Opposition and the Australian Democrats and to support the motion moved last night by the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Committee does not insist upon amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 20 to which the House of Representatives has disagreed, and agrees to amendments made by the House of Representatives in place of amendments Nos. 1, 5, 9, 10, 19 and 21. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend that motion to the Committee and trust that it will be carried, although I note that the numbers are stacked against us, suggesting that it will not be. However, I want to persist in arguing that it should be carried. It would have the effect of rejecting the amendments made previously by the Senate, enabling the Government to carry the legislation and put in place deregulation of the Australian domestic wheat market. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lewis has identified the four core clauses that, in particular, are commended to our attention. There would be no point in my reciting them because we all know them well, but I have to indicate that if Senator Walsh's motion is passed they will be rejected. There are a number of reasons for what the Government proposes, and I will now address myself to most of them. Perhaps it is unfair of me to identify any particular speaker and, under parliamentary procedure, it is probably wrong of me to worry about answering what are essentially side arguments rather than core arguments. However, I was so diverted by the artificial anger generated by Senator McGauran that I have to say that, for me, his speech had a particular pithy quality. </PARA>
<PARA> I was a member of parliament back in 1983, when we inherited government. I recall every lobby group identifying unemployment as the biggest problem in Australia. They all said, `The biggest problem in Australia is unemployment, but in our case you should do this'. The same lobby groups now say, `Look, one of the big problems that the community is concerned about is the environment. We are concerned about it too but you should now do this'. Over the years industry delegations have said, `We want some more deregulation. We want a phase-down of tariffs. We want a removal of that type of protection'. But often the members of those industry delegations presenting an industry view to government have sprinted back up the front steps of Parliament House as soon as the members of the delegations were in their cars heading back to their hotels and have privately said to us, `But in my case you should do this'. There is a marked resemblance in what has been said by Senator McGauran to that type of approach. </PARA>
<PARA> What is being said here is that we should deregulate across the board and that we should speed up deregulation. The recipes for that have been paraded. But these people are also saying, `But in our case there are special sensitivities. You should be cautious and you should do these things'. I make one observation: one cannot be half pregnant. One has to be one thing or the other. In this case one has to say, `We support the de- regulation that the Government has proposed and it should be done fully'. Otherwise the purpose of it is subverted. If one subverts the purpose, one discredits the case by not allowing it to work effectively. Senator McGauran is saying, `Do all that to everyone else but our case is a special case'. Against that background, why should we pay attention to his special case? Why should we not say, `This is not an example of ``Don't do as I do, do as I say.'' '? This should be an example of adhering to the principle across the board in order to get the best effect. I make that observation constructively. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been a number of speakers. It is not for me to reply exhaustively to each of the arguments that have been put. Before I go to the detail of the four clauses that have been mentioned I want to say that a number of the arguments have fallen into a couple of categories. I can answer them by globally replying to those categories. </PARA>
<PARA> The first is the McGauran form of argument. He says that in his particular case there are special sensitivities and that we should tread differently here. As I said, that argument has its roots in the old fashioned protectionism of the National Party of Australia-the old style regulator mentality. It is a product of that mindset. The difference between us is not in the measures the Government has taken but rather in mindset. One cannot apply a regulator's mindset to a deregulated market and try to retain ancient vestiges of old regulations in order to feel comfort and joy that maybe something has been retained. One does one thing or the other. </PARA>
<PARA> While I recognise the differences of view in the Opposition parties, I have to say that the prevailing view seems to be that expressed by the dries in the Liberal Party. These were acknowledged as being Mr Howard's finest moments in terms of drawing the Opposition together. Maybe these moments unfortunately led to his demise as leader. They are, nonetheless, the views of the Opposition. But the Opposition, in order to get a compromise on its side, cannot patch all the little bits and pieces together and make people feel good; it actually has to tackle the matter full on and do things properly. The Opposition cannot operate in a new environment by maintaining vestiges of the past and making little comfort stops at this little clause or that little clause. </PARA>
<PARA> I am a little dumbfounded when the born again regulators of the Australian Democrats come in here and put their views, but their stand on this legislation is consistent with Democrat philosophy. The Democrats want nothing to change but everything to improve. In these circumstances we cannot obtain improvement without change. I have to say that in this place the Democrats are notorious for picking up the interests of any pressure group that bobs through the front door and puts a case to them in which there might be a voter base. If we were to do that in government we would never be able to make a decision. We would be paralysed by indecision. One of the features of this Government is that we have been prepared to make decisions that, in the short run, have caused particular difficulties for us in the electorate. But we make those decisions because we believe that in the long run it will be proven that those decisions were beneficial to the electorate. With all the across the board deregulation that we have entered into, that has been the case. I believe that it will again be the case with this legislation. We are prepared for some short term pain in order to get the better long term result. The Democrats should show a bit more resolve in that type of approach in their contributions to this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I am running out of time but I want to reply to the four specific provisions. I will take them in the order they appear in my notes. The first is the matter of the Chairman being a wheat grower. That is indeed a mindset problem. Opposition members think only in terms of the old style of doing things. We are not saying that a grower will not be the Chairman. In fact, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, has said that initially he will ensure that a grower is the Chairman. But we do not want to be locked into having a grower as a Chairman always and forever more. That is not capriciousness on our part; that is an interest in seeing that the industry is properly protected in a domestically deregulated environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Panizza has asked why we cannot find someone from the huge population of growers-all the sons, daughters, wives and husbands-to be Chairman. I hope we can. But he should remember that it will not be a domestically deregulated environment. I do not think that any grain grower in Australia, or indeed the world, would want to go into a court case and represent himself if the value of his product were at stake. If the value of his product were at stake, the best silk in Australia, specialised in that area, would be found to represent him. </PARA>
<PARA> When one moves into a deregulated market one may well find a grain grower with the specific skills to lead the Australian Wheat Board in that environment; but one may not. We therefore need to keep the flexibility to find the best person so that in a competitive environment we have the best competitive and entrepreneurial skills at the helm. A grain grower may have, but will not necessarily have, those properties. If we are to enable the Board to best respond to the competition entered into by it and to get better returns we do not want to be locked into that position. The same applies to members of the Board. </PARA>
<PARA> The next matter is the exemption from the Trade Practices Act. The aim of this amendment is specifically to exempt the Australian Wheat Board's pooling activities from the Trade Practices Act. As we said in the first instance, such an amendment really is unnecessary. The Bill provides clear authority for the Wheat Board to operate pools. Such operations are therefore authorised under section 51 of the Trade Practices Act, which provides for specific exemptions of the activities of statutory marketing authorities. Secondly, such a specific exemption in respect of the pools' marketing activities is unwarranted. As indicated in Mr Kerin's second reading speech in the other place-which speech was put down in my name here-the Australian Wheat Board should not operate in such a way as to abuse its market power. We need to have it operate within the terms of the Trade Practices Act, not exempted from the Trade Practices Act. After all, that Act provides the rules for profit trading activities. It should apply here. </PARA>
<PARA> With my eye on the clock I go to what is perhaps the most strongly fought issue: the 95 per cent underwriting. Many things have been said about this 95 per cent underwriting-most of them by Senator Panizza. He is having a debate with Senator Walsh. I indicate my support for the Walsh position. Senator Panizza's comments in this debate are a red herring. He is making a debating point. The core issue is: what level of underwriting should be provided for? Underwriting is provided so that better and earlier payments can be made to growers because the Board can borrow against the level of underwriting. We want to phase that down, and we are determined to see that it comes down to a reasonable level. In the circumstances, we believe a reasonable level ultimately would be about 80 per cent. But we recognise the sensitivities of growers about this issue. This is one of those security blanket type things that relate to the old mind-set. So we say, `Let's start at 90 per cent and work our way down to 80 per cent, and as we move down the fears that you have expressed will be assuaged by the perform- ance because there will be an increasing competitiveness by the Board'. </PARA>
<PARA> The final matter, of the top four, is this question of the Grain Council of Australia's involvement in regulations governing the operation of the fund. Senator Lewis actually gave the game away by saying, `Well, of course, since the Council represents grain growers, it should have a say in the regulations'. Of course it should; we agree. All we differ on is that it should not control the ultimate regulations. That would be to delegate to an outside body what is a final government authority. The Government, in the end, will make those regulations. But the Government will make them in full, proper and due consultation with grain growers, as it should properly do, and the commitments on that have been many and numerous and are well known; in fact, some would say notorious. So with those remarks, on behalf of the Government, I indicate to this chamber that the Government rejects the proposals that have been put forward and would ask the Committee to support that rejection. </PARA>

I am quite happy to go on after lunch in those circumstances. This is supposed to be the committee stage, in which we can question the Minister and obtain answers. The information that I have just received is extraordinary and worries me greatly with regard to what we are now doing in terms of dismantling the Australian Wheat Board. As honourable senators are aware, the United States farm Bill, which was signed into law in December 1985, is due for review. Indeed, the United States Congress is currently reviewing that particular Bill. The cost to Australia of the last farm Bill-and wheat figured very heavily in that cost-was set by the last Trade Minister, Mr Dawkins, at $1.3 billion. So it is not a matter that we can take lightly. It was an economic disaster of extraordinary proportions for Australia. The next one is now on its way this winter. The Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture, Clayton Yeutter, has been appealing publicly for additional funds for the export enhancement program. The Government itself has been lobbying a large number of people, not least of which was the Vice-President of the United States on his last visit here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the verge of this new legislation being discussed in the United States Congress, Australia has just replaced its ambassador. The information I have just received is that it is now in the process of replacing its trade and agricultural attaches, Greg Wood and Tim Mackey. Those who know the effective work that both those people have done in our embassy and the enormous amount of experience, expertise and penetration that they have been able to have on these issues must stand aghast that the Government at this time could be contemplating the removal of two of the most capable people in our Washington Embassy. The situation is extraordinary. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is on the eve of a visit to Washington. I do not know whether he knows about this. Indeed, I ask the Minister whether we are now denuding our United States Embassy of that hard won experience. In addition, I ask the Minister whether he knows who we are replacing them with. This is a matter of extreme importance to the wheat industry. What particular Washington experience do the replacements have? We are currently in the process of destabilising our own industry. On the international scale, we are actually going to destabilise it further by taking away that extraordinarily hard won experience that we have in our Washington Embassy. Before we vote on these particular amendments, I ask the Minister whether that information is true. Who is going to replace them? What Washington experience do both the trade and agricultural attaches have? And is the Prime Minister involved in this particular exercise?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to say that Senator Macklin's question has all the hallmarks of the beginning of a filibuster. He knows, I know and this chamber knows that it has nothing to do with the Wheat Marketing Bill. The Bill before the chamber is about the domestic market, and about deregulation of the domestic market. That is round about 10 per cent to 12 per cent, which is a very small proportion, of the total output by grain growers in Australia. Despite this effort of Senator Macklin's to engender fear and anxiety in the minds of growers, we are not moving to deregulate the international market. Senator Macklin and I both know that. I wonder then why Senator Macklin raised this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Much of what Senator Macklin has said is reminiscent of someone who has been on a trip once, met a few people, come back and is then an expert. We are not denuding our Washington Embassy of talent; we are maintaining a high level of representation. As we all know and as is recognised internationally, Australia, as the leader of the Cairns group of free trading nations, is the foremost nation in the world seeking to break down cartels, protected markets and so on. We are persisting in that; we are recognised for that; we get criticised because of that performance by the United States, by countries in Europe and by other groups within those countries. There is no argument about that. Madam Temporary Chairman, I suggest that the question be put. </PARA>

It was to that point that I was raising the question. The Minister has asked the chamber not to insist on the amendments. I am suggesting that the context that Australia is now going into is fraught with so many perils that it would be far better to continue with the current situation until at least we have been able to ascertain where the United States is going with regard to its farm Bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Macklin may not have heard the Minister, but he said that he had given Senator Macklin such answer as he is prepared to give at this stage. That is what he said across the chamber. We understand that Senator Cook as Minister for Resources is actually representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, who has control of the legislation. It may very well be that Minister Cook ought to put to Mr Kerin something of what Senator Macklin has said. In addition, I ask the Government whether there are any amendments the Government might be prepared to accept at this stage, before the House of Representatives rises, so that we can amend the Wheat Marketing Bill if possible before the winter recess. For example, we have moved amendments which deal with a request that there be a 95 per cent underwriting guarantee. I have been assured by people that from time to time the Minister has indicated that at one stage anyway he might have looked favourably upon a 90 per cent underwriting provision, not reducing as it is currently reducing in the Bill. If honourable senators look at subclause 78 (14), on page 39 of the Bill, they will see that the appropriate percentage for the season commencing 1 July 1989 is 90 per cent and that it reduces each year thereafter by 2.5 per cent down to 80 per cent for the season commencing 1 July 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Would the Government consider an amendment that the appropriate percentage for all seasons commencing on or after 1 July 1989 be 90 per cent, as it says, without reducing by 2.5 per cent over the ensuing four years? Would the Government accept that if the sunset provision were left in this Bill? I ask the Government whether there is any other amendment it would accept. For example, clauses 82 and 83 relate to Grains Council approval. In his response, Minister Cook said that the Government would make arrangements as provided under the Bill. Clause 83 (3) of the Bill states:</PARA>
<PARA>Regulations for the purposes of subsection (1) shall not be made except after the consideration by the Minister of a report by the Grains Council made after consultation with the Board. </PARA>
<PARA>Would the Government accept any amendment that would enable the Grains Council to be consulted by the Minister? It seems to me that there are opportunities for the Government to come back to the Senate and say whether there is any room to move, for example, on the simple proposition that the chairperson be a wheat grower. These changes would mean only slight variations of the amendments which are proposed to be rejected by the Government's motion. I ask the Government to give one final consideration to the possibility of some amendment of these matters before members of the House of Representatives go away from Parliament today. To enable the Government to do that, I shall move that the Committee report progress and seek leave to sit again today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Tuesday last, in the late evening, I began the debate for the Opposition on the Government's package of superannuation taxation Bills. In the course of some 24 minutes I made several points which are the basis of the Opposition's decision to move several amendments to this package at the committee stage. Specifically, those amendments are, firstly, to effect the excise of the 15 per cent investment tax on superannuation fund income and, secondly, to raise to $125,000 the threshold of $60,000 above which a tax of 16.25 per cent will be applied.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The salient points I made in the course of that address were, firstly, that the 15 per cent investment tax is a disincentive to savings; at the very time when the economy is seeing a desperate need to encourage our savings ratio it is a retrograde step to have this disincentive built into the superannuation laws of this land. Secondly, this package is being introduced 13 months after it was first brought down in the May statement in 1988 by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). I think any reasonable person would say that there is a degree of complexity in the legislation, which has taken 12 months to come into the Parliament for final scrutiny. It is being raced through because the Government has not been diligent in bringing the legislation on earlier so that there could be a proper assessment of it. That is a most important point. It is truly a flagrant example of government by press release. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the Government claimed that industry is supportive of the legislation and that others are pressing for it to be introduced somehow to give certainty in the area. The basis for the Government's claim seems to be the press release put out by the Life Insurance Federation of Australia on 5 May saying that it welcomed the legislation, while still complaining about the tax. Subsequent to that, in the days leading up to the presentation of the Bills into this chamber, industry and others became very much aware of the retrograde step that this tax imposes. So we had Coles-Myer Superannuation Fund, Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, the Life Underwriters Association of Australia, Mr Garry Weaven, the Assistant Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and Professor Michael Porter saying that it was a disincentive. We had people from all ends of the political spectrum making statements about the effect of the introduction of this particular tax which is, we estimate, a value of somewhere between $20m and $120m to the revenue. We should bear in mind that that is a very small percentage of the revenue to be raised by the full package, which is some $1.4 billion. There is ample room for the decision the Government has made to impose this tax and actively discourage people from entering into superannuation arrangements to be reconsidered. There is ample time and opportunity for the Government to reconsider that proposal and to excise the tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I also raised the question of public administration and the laudable decision that various State governments were making to move towards accrual accounting generally, and specifically, to fund their own superannuation schemes. The imposition of this 15 per cent tax has directly resulted in the majority of States saying that they will not fund their superannuation schemes in the public sector for the simple reason that this tax is only attracted by funded schemes. Queensland went to the extent of passing legislation to alter the nature of the funding of its scheme so that it would not attract this tax. I think that is quite salient to recognise when we realise that the State governments have just taken a cut in their general purpose grants at the recent Premiers Conference while at the same time the Commonwealth Government is accruing to itself a rise in its own general purpose grants of some 5.5 per cent. The State governments are simply saying, `You don't get it both ways; you are cutting our general purpose grants and you want to take a further taxation benefit by imposing this tax on funds which we would otherwise fully fund'. There is an important point to be made there. It would sound a warning if the private sector decided to look at the concept of having unfunded superannuation schemes to similarly avoid this tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point I made that is important relates to the discriminatory nature of the tax. In May 1988 the Treasurer said that if fund managers chose to invest all their investments in imputed dividend equities, they could reduce the effect of this tax to make it almost negligible. That is discriminatory because of the nature of approved deposit funds and roll-over funds which are in fixed interest or capital guaranteed funds. There is $12 billion at present in those sorts of funds. The people who are in those funds would be disadvantaged by not having access to the imputed dividend scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important point that has prompted the Opposition to move its amendments is that the Treasurer's promise in May 1988 is fallacious-it cannot be sustained. Very simply, he said that not one personal end benefit will be diminished by one cent. Quite plainly, in the examples that I gave last Tuesday evening and in the matters I have summarised here, that cannot be met.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This has to be a classic example of how a system is messed up when the Government persists with introducing legislation by press release. This Government, in particular, has got into the habit of announcing measures that it proposes to introduce to change all sorts of things, from the social security system through to the tax system, and then a long time later, sometimes years later, actually producing the legislation that implements those proposals. In doing so, it leaves people in a state of considerable uncertainty, and in this case it looks like costing a lot of people a lot of money no matter which way this legislation goes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats have been talking to the Government since July last year. Our concerns have not been about the 15 per cent contributions tax-I do not think anybody is worrying about that too much-or about the host of regulations that are going to implement other changes; we are used to dealing with regulations in this place. We are concerned about the 15 per cent earnings tax that the Government is introducing in the six tax Bills that we have before us today that have become known around the place for the last year or so as the superannuation legislation. The earnings tax is something which will leave a lot of people worse off, despite the comments of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to the contrary last year, about people not being even one cent worse off. We expressed our concern about a particular group of people who will be disadvantaged if this earnings tax goes through in this form. So far we have had no significant response from either the Treasurer or the Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA> The people I am talking about are those who have rolled over generally small superannuation payouts into fixed interest funds. Those people are going to be worse off. We went to the Government last July, and on almost a monthly basis since, pointing out that we wanted those people quarantined. We said that if they were not quarantined we would have no option at all but to support the Opposition's proposal to delete the earnings tax from this legislation entirely. That is not something I want to do, but it is at least one way of protecting those people who have put generally relatively small amounts of money into fixed interest deposits. </PARA>
<PARA> I suspect that the Government has not heeded or responded to our concerns and has not provided any assistance by drafting an amendment that will quarantine those people in fixed interest funds. I suspect it thinks that the Opposition is going to go to water on this matter. The Opposition has caved in on the health reinsurance fund legislation, it looks like caving in on the wheat legislation, and I suppose that the Government has some justification for expecting it to go to water on this legislation. I hope that the Opposition does not do so, not because I am so concerned about people who have very large lump sums in National Mutual or anywhere else but because if the only way to protect those people with small investments in fixed interest funds-that is, in very secure funds-is to oppose the earnings tax outright, that is what I am prepared to do. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the legislation. The Bills implement the changes to the taxation of superannuation and roll-over funds which, as I said a moment ago, were announced by the Treasurer in May 1988. They came into force on 1 July 1988. They came into force before any of us, much less the people who have to try to implement these changes, had seen any legislation at all. The superannuation and roll-over funds have been operating for nearly a year under the new arrangements without the legislation giving any force to their actions. This has been an administrative nightmare for them, having to put aside the earnings tax-presumably into a separate account somewhere-in case this legislation goes through. This raises the equally awful nightmare of what they do with it and the money they have earned on it if the legislation does not go through in a way in which the Government anticipates. In any event, they had to put tax aside to meet the new taxation requirements, notwithstanding the fact that we did not see the legislation until, I think, November last year-and then only part of the legislation. They had to do that because if the legislation goes through, the first instalments of the taxes are due later this year. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, some of the Bills to enact the changes announced in May last year were introduced into the Parliament in November last year. The rest were introduced a few weeks ago. It has taken the Government almost a year to draft the legislation that was supposed to come into force on 1 July 1988. Superannuation fund managers, superannuation policy-holders, people who have retired recently and those who plan to retire soon have had to make decisions on the basis of interpreting the original announcement, that is, the announcement of May last year, hoping the legislation will confirm their interpretation. This is the problem that we get when governments legislate by press release. It is bad enough in an area where there are no financial complications or implications but it is outrageous that the Government is persisting in doing this when such a financially sensitive area as the whole superannuation and life insurance industry is involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Even worse than all of this, of course, is the pressure which the Government, deliberately or otherwise-I suspect it is deliberately-applies to members of parliament under these circumstances. There is an implicit threat from the Government, when it proceeds through this sort of formula of making a statement and introducing legislation when it feels like it, and requiring people to comply with the original proposals from day one, that any change will cause havoc. Of course it is likely to cause havoc. But the problem is not the changes that are made in this place. The problem lies with the Government either in not getting its act together quickly enough or in assuming that, if it is complex enough, people in this place will lie doggo, roll over and have their tummies tickled or something, despite having concerns about the legislation. It is long past time the Senate in particular refused to be bludgeoned into submission by the Government, no matter what the consequences may be, if we believe that the legislation is detrimental to one group in the community or if it is seriously flawed in some way. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is, of course, that no one out there can act with precision when all they have is a general statement but no legislation. In this case the problem is compounded by the fact that we have now reached the stage where the first tax payments for the 1988-89 year are due after 1 July and we are debating the legislation in the first week of June. It is the last week, I might add, in which both Houses of Parliament are scheduled to be sitting simultaneously. That in itself is outrageous and I for one-and I am sure many other senators-are getting tired of the Government taking the House of Representatives off on to an early recess and leaving us here for two or three weeks to deal with the mess that the Government has left us in the legislative program, with the threat over our heads that if we do not comply with everything it wants or if we dare to move any amendments with a start date prior to the August Budget session, the House of Representatives will have to be recalled at huge cost to the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no reason why the House of Representatives has to rise tonight. There is no reason why it cannot sit tomorrow to deal with wheat legislation or with any changes that we make today to this legislation. It will not cost the taxpayer another penny if that House sits tomorrow. Its members cannot get home tonight anyway. Their allowances are paid for their overnight stay. I do not know what some of them think they are getting paid for. It is high time that the House did what the Senate does on a regular basis, that is, look at the legislation in detail and act accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA> The Government has in fact created a situation where, if this legislation is not passed in some form before the end of this financial year, which is a matter of weeks away, there will be no legislation to enable the Government to collect the taxes legally; superannuation funds will not know exactly what form the taxes will take; and self-employed and personal superannuation contributors who have increased their superannuation contributions from $1,500 in the expectation that they will be able to claim up to the new $3,000 limit which qualifies for a tax deduction, will discover that this legislation has not been enacted in time for them to take advantage of it this financial year.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We, as a chamber, can enact whatever parts we see fit. Whether the Government is prepared to accept part of the package instead of all of the package is another matter and, of course, that is part of the blackmailing process. By and large, the ears of the journalists to whom the Government is talking are not ready to hear that the Government has the option of accepting those parts that are passed and continuing negotiations on those parts that are not passed. On the other hand, if the legislation does go through because the Government beats all or part of this place into submission, small investors will suffer and State governments, which have enormous power in this area, will change their public service superannuation schemes into unfunded ones and this Government will lose money anyway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What are the major features of the legislation, apart from a general mess-up of the area? There is, as I said, the increase from $1,500 to $3,000 on the limit for tax deductions for superannuation contributions by self-employed and other personal contributions not covered by an employer fund. This is the form of superannuation used by most small business people and people who are not in an employer-sponsored superannuation scheme. Why should they suffer if the Government does not get all of its package in the way that it wants? It is yet another example of how the Government has, in the past, discriminated against the self-employed and may well continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no longer any statutory limit placed on the top deduction available to an employer for contributions to a superannuation fund on behalf of an employee other than the reasonable benefits limit. In contrast, a self-employed professional is limited at present to a $1,500 deduction and, under this legislation, to a $3,000 deduction with any additional contributions also being subject to the reasonable benefits limit. The increased deductable contribution of $3,000 is immediately subject to the 15 per cent contribution tax in the hands of the fund as part of its assessable income. So, of a contribution of $3,000, $450 is immediately lost in tax, leaving an effective contribution of $2,550. That amount is less than compensation for consumer price index increases since a deduction of $1,200 was available in 1975. It is a clear case for indexing these types of deductions so that the value of the tax deduction for superannuation contributions by the self-employed is not eroded over time until a benevolent government sees fit to amend the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The second feature of the legislation is the 15 per cent tax on deductable superannuation contributions. As I said a while ago, people do not seem to be getting their knickers in a knot over this matter particularly, and that piece of the legislation is not being challenged. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is looking not at simply accepting the indexation of the new $60,000 threshold but at increasing that threshold to $125,000. I remind the Senate that, in 1984, the Australian Democrats moved for indexation of those thresholds. We argued that, if they were not indexed, there would be a serious erosion of real benefit to those people who were making contributions to fund their retirement years. That year we received no support from the Opposition or the Government. The move by the Opposition to more than double that threshold will benefit, in the main, only those people on high superannuation payouts and, if the Australian Taxation Office is right, it is a matter of only several hundred people who will benefit from that move by the Opposition. Certainly, far fewer people will benefit from the increase in the threshold than would benefit from the quarantining of fixed interest funds. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to the problem facing those fixed interest funds, that is, the 15 per cent tax on the investment earnings of superannuation roll-over funds. That tax, according to the Government's statement and to the legislation, can be reduced with imputation credits for franked dividends received from Australian companies. I cannot understand why the Opposition wanted to oppose this tax from day one. Our position has been to quarantine fixed interest funds from that tax because, by and large, unless they are dealing with preference shares, they will not get the imputation benefit. For some reason the Opposition wants to remove the 15 per cent earnings tax outright, notwithstanding that, in itself, it is of real benefit to the community in that it encourages the big life and superannuation funds to invest money in Australian companies instead of taking their investment dollars offshore. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Democrats certainly support the intention of the earnings tax, that is, to keep money in Australia to benefit Australian companies, and while we can see the sense in allowing the 15 per cent earnings tax to be reduced through imputation, the problem still remains that some funds in which people have already invested because they considered them to be secure, as they do not play around with shares or property, will not have access to imputation credits. We have received quite a number of representations from people who have retired at age 55 or over, who have rolled over their superannuation payout into funds which do not invest in shares and who now look like losing a considerable amount of money. For example, one constituent who retired at age 60 after 40 years of service rolled over his $50,000 superannuation payment into an interest-earning type of roll-over fund. He chose the fund deliberately because he wanted to put his money into a low risk investment; a secure investment; an investment that will not be caught up in another situation similar to October 1987; an investment which is a lower risk than even capital guaranteed funds, which somebody like Eric Mayer has admitted are higher risk funds than fixed interest funds. </PARA>
<PARA> This man put his money into an interest-earning type of fund. He knew that he had to take the money out of the fund at age 65. He set out to avoid roll-over funds which invested a high proportion of their assets in property and shares and which could-it happened in 1987-reduce in value over five years. This constituent calculated that, because his approved deposit fund will pay the full 15 per cent tax on its interest earnings, he will lose something like $4,000 over the five years that the money is in the fund. If he moves out of the fund into a capital guaranteed fund he will pay upfront and/or higher management fees of 5 or 6 per cent of his money. Furthermore, he does not want to go into capital guaranteed funds because they invest in shares, despite the impression that is given to the contrary in many advertisements. Some of them have a share exposure of 40 per cent or more. Their substantial shareholdings will enable them to reduce their earnings tax liability. However, the `guarantee' in the words `capital guaranteed fund' is the reserves they can use to support the fund in the event of a market downturn. Maybe not all of them will be able to meet that guarantee. Not everyone wants to take that risk. This particular constituent was one of those people who did not want to take the risk. I have had his figures checked by actuaries, and they are correct. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats want the legislation to be amended so that the Treasurer is kept to his word that no-one will be one cent worse off. We did not ask him to make that statement; he opened his own mouth voluntarily and, equally voluntarily, he put his own foot in it. Given that, this chamber is entitled to expect that he be kept to his word. I will move an amendment-which we have had drafted because the Government would not allow its parliamentary drafting officers to give us any assistance-to exempt interest-earning roll-overs from the earnings tax for 10 years. I pay tribute to the Clerk and the Clerk Assistants of the Senate for the tremendous amount of work they have done, especially when it comes to providing amendments to legislation, particularly legislation as complex as this, when the Government churlishly refuses to make available its resources. Over the years there have been occasions when the Senate Clerks have produced amendments that have been considerably better, and have gone to the heart of the problem in a more appropriate way, than some of the things that the Government comes up with. I think it is time that we acknowledged the work that they do. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government does not like the amendment, does not think it will work, thinks that it will be administratively difficult, or thinks that it will have unintended consequences, or any of the other Sir Humphrey Appleby reasons that governments come up with, maybe in the time that is available to it before the House rises it can have more appropriate amendments drafted by Treasury and the Tax Office, although I would not hold out much hope of that occurring. If the amendment to exempt fixed interest roll-overs is not successful, the Democrats will resort to supporting the Opposition's amendment which would remove the earnings tax altogether. I do not want to do that, but we will have no choice. I would prefer that the Opposition or the Government supported our amendment simply to quarantine from harm those people who have taken the secure route of investing the exempt fixed interest roll-overs. If that does not happen, we will use the only alternative available to us to make sure that those people will not lose thousands of dollars and be considerably worse off as a result of these changes. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last few minutes available to me I would like to look at the revenue issue. When the Treasurer announced the changes in May last year, Treasury estimated that the combined effect of the 15 per cent tax on contributions and earnings would be $980m in 1989-90, rising to approximately $1.4 billion in subsequent years. I raise this issue because a tactic that the Government uses every time somebody in this chamber attempts to amend money legislation or legislation with revenue implications is to complain that this will be the end of the Western world as we know it, it will not have any money to do anything with, it will cost it a small fortune, and it might even have to duck into its $9.6 billion domestic surplus in order to cope. These are Treasury figures: the combined revenue for both the contributions and earnings tax, according to official figures, will be a bit less than $1 billion in the first full operating year and $1.4 billion in subsequent years. Unfortunately, that is where its helpfulness finished because it refused to disclose how much of the revenue comes from the earnings tax and how much from the contributions tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure it knows anything much at all about anything; certainly, it is about as useful as a hip pocket on a singlet when it comes to providing those of us who have to deal with legislation with the information that we need to make informed decisions. Given that we know how much the total is but we do not know how much each of the elements contributing to the total is, we have had to go outside Treasury to find the answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Treasury has given us one other small piece of information. It has argued that most superannuation and roll-over funds will pay little or no tax on earnings. It has said, `Here is the combined total, but we will give you a hint: the earnings tax is not going to form much of it'. National Mutual has estimated that the total earnings tax would be worth $55m to the Government in 1988-89 and $130m by 1990-91. If it is true that all the earnings tax revenue comes from fixed interest roll-overs, because Treasury says that most of the funds will pay little or no earnings tax, the National Mutual figures indicate that the most the Government would lose this year would be $55m and a little over $100m in subsequent years, if the fixed interest funds were quarantined. I think it is somewhat unlikely that the fixed interest roll-over funds would be the only ones to pay the tax. In any event, the amendment we would want would cost revenue less than $55m this year. As I said earlier, it would effectively help the Treasurer to keep his promise about people not being any worse off. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government was quite prepared to lose $2 billion last year by cutting company tax at a time when we knew that many major companies in this country were paying little or no tax anyway. The Government and the Opposition gave companies a 20 per cent cut in tax; that is, the tax went from 49c to 39c-a cut of 10c. That $2 billion loss to government revenue is far greater than the $55m that we are looking at today. As I said earlier, we have already seen one State government pass retrospective legislation to avoid the Federal Government's legislation by making the Queensland State superannuation schemes unfunded. On 7 April this year the South Australian Labor Premier, John Bannon, threatened to do the same thing. I wonder how much money the Government will lose if all States act in that way to avoid the tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to mention some further problems that have occurred following the Treasurer's changes last year to the taxation of superannuation. We should take note of those changes for future reference. In announcing the changes to the taxation of superannuation, the Treasurer also announced a new reasonable benefit limits scale. I understand that the scales will be dealt with by changes to regulations to impose new maximum contribution and benefit levels for lump sum and pension funds. The new limits meet some of the objections from welfare groups and the Democrats who have previously attacked inequity in earlier schemes which allowed high income earners to get massive taxpayer-funded lump sum payouts but gave no additional assistance to low income earners. So the measure goes some way to meeting those concerns. The Treasurer also recognised the need to protect benefits which have already been accrued with transitional arrangements designed to preserve the higher benefit limits available to superannuation fund members with pre-July 1988 service. So some parts of the legislation are good and some are not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the superannuation legislation package. As honourable senators who have spoken earlier mentioned, it is over 12 months since the package was first announced by the Government. That in itself has drawn criticism from the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills which drew attention to the fact that the Senate has said in a resolution that if a Bill is introduced some six months or later after the time of the original announcement by press release, the date of commencement of the legislation will be the date on which the Bill was introduced into the Parliament. That is a very rational and reasonable conclusion, given the enormous complexity of the legislation before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, we must note that the terms of the Senate resolution related to a press release as distinct from what I understood the original announcement in this package to be, which was one of the now famous May economic statements emanating from the Treasurer (Mr Keating). For that reason I suspect that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee's comment does not necessarily apply to the present legislation. Nevertheless, the sentiments which are expressed by the Committee are supported by me and other senators from the Liberal and National parties. It is just not good enough for a government to announce a very complicated and difficult taxation regime for a very important area of the Australian economy and then not provide the detailed legislation in a reasonable period. Just before Christmas last year the Government even introduced, after pressure from the Opposition, about one-third of the legislation and said, `Well, we'll deal with the other later. Here's a bit of it so you go away and chew on it'. That is the kind of nonsense that the Government has been going on with for far too long. The Senate has rejected that approach in the past and I hope that the Government will take note of it when it deals with future legislation involving either superannuation or other matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators who have spoken so far have mentioned the details of the legislation. On this occasion I would prefer not to go too deeply into that, but rather to speak of the principles upon which the legislation has been designed. Let us start by sketching the overall need for a better and more effective retirement incomes policy in this country. Australia is one of those Western nations with a rising proportion of its population in the ageing group. It is estimated that by the year 2010, 8.6 million people, or about 40 per cent of the total population, will be aged over 45. That represents a growth of some 70 per cent in the number of people in middle and old age compared with the situation applying today. So that indicates the kind of challenge which planners, governments and the private enterprise sector need to face. Obviously the taxpayers who will have to fund retirement benefits, either through income support or the provision of aged care, will become fewer in number and, as a result, the burden per capita of those paying tax will rise. </PARA>
<PARA> The only answer that can possibly be advised in order to ensure that people are, firstly, looked after well in their old age and, secondly, provided with an adequate income, is to ensure that adequate retirement benefits are available. They must stem from the stimulation of private investment. We must as a nation have a comprehensive and effective retirement incomes policy. Nobody could say that we have such a policy under the Hawke Government. The Government is full of rhetoric, ideals and lofty ideas. Perhaps I should quote one of those. </PARA>

The present legislation does not deliver in any way an effective and comprehensive retirement incomes policy. It is ad hoc and designed to draw out of the superannuation systems some billion dollars a year to fund current consumption expenditure by tax cuts to other taxpayers. That is what the Government is doing. It is not about encouraging people to save for retirement; rather, it is about utilising the funds which people have been saving, drawing off from those funds by way of taxation, and using those funds for expenditures by the Government or to provide tax cuts. Of course, that would find its way mainly into consumption rather than into savings. That is really what the Treasurer was saying in May of last year when he brought down his statement. The Government made those changes only because it wanted the tax revenue from superannuation now rather than at a later time when people collect their retirement income or lump sum benefits. That may be 20 or 30 years down the track, but the Government says, `We can use that money now, by drawing it out of the superannuation funds, for spending and for tax cuts now'. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the other main benefit of superannuation for our society today, and that, of course, is to stimulate savings. If ever this country needed to stimulate savings, it must be now. Only yesterday we had a new set of statistics which indicated that Australia's foreign debt is now about $125 billion. That means that we have to turn to stimulating our own population's rate of savings to ensure that we rely less and less on overseas borrowings. Many of the current economic problems stemming from the balance of payments difficulties are caused by our low savings ratio. It is salutary just to run over the savings ratio as a percentage of disposable income over the last several years, to get an idea of how this has trended. In the decade from 1971 to 1980, Australia had a savings ratio of 12.4 per cent. From 1978 to 1982, it was 10.5 per cent, a fall of about 2 per cent. But between 1983 and 1987, it fell to 8.9 per cent. This came at a time when there was a similar fall in the savings ratio of many Western nations. But it is salutary to note that the relevant figures for Canada, a country with a similar economic base as our own and with a similar population level, over the same period are 11.3 per cent rising to 14.6 per cent, and settling at 12.9 per cent. The trend in Canada has therefore quite clearly been in favour of stimulating savings, whereas in this country it has been moving in exactly the opposite direction. Of course, there are other examples, Japan and West Germany, which are not typical of the Australian economy but which have similar trends. Those approaches should be adopted in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Superannuation is one of the most critical ways in which we can encourage people to put sums away into funds where they can be supported by tax breaks, and where they can be accumulated and managed by experts in the private sector who can build up substantial benefits for the future for those people and, at the same time, provide a pool of funds from which borrowers and other investors can draw money to stimulate the economic growth of the country. That economic growth means jobs, not just for us but for our children and for the generations yet to come. The funds for that basic infrastructural development are critical to Australia's development, and superannuation funds provide an enormous proportion of the whole and enable stimulation of that growth. That is why we need to lay more emphasis on superannuation fund development and not less, as this legislation tends to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public interest which I wish to raise today relates to the Fedorczenko Legacy Fund. I would briefly like to tell the Senate about it today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Earlier this century a man immigrated from Poland to Australia. He had just spent many years in a Russian prison camp in Poland where he was separated from his wife and his children. His family were believed to have been taken to Russia and killed. Mr Fedorczenko loved his new country; he did not want it to suffer the same kind of communist dictatorship that he himself had suffered. So when he died in 1983, at the age of 83, he bequeathed all his assets to the Commonwealth to protect his adopted country against a possible communist invasion. </PARA>
<PARA> After legal challenges to Mr Fedorczenko's will, the legacy was eventually received by the Department of Defence on 26 November 1985. The Chief of the Defence Force and the Secretary to the Department had many discussions about the matter and eventually decided that the money should be used solely by the Australian Defence Force Academy. It then took until March 1989 before a decision was taken to invest the money and use the income rather than to use the money at once. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the Defence Department received this money-$100,000-on 26 November 1985. It took until March 1989 before a decision was even taken about what to do with the money. As yet, however, the money has not even been invested. It has been sitting in a trust fund earning nothing, waiting for the Department of Finance to approve an investment in a fixed term bank deposit. In actual fact, this bureaucratic dithering has meant that Mr Fedorczenko's hard earned money and generous bequest for the defence of Australia is being wasted. </PARA>
<PARA> The $100,048 which he left for the defence of Australia is now worth $78,285 in real terms-a waste of some $21,763 of that man's hard earned money which he hoped might contribute to the defence of Australia. If that legacy had at least been sitting in a fixed term deposit since November 1985 whilst the bureaucrats dithered, it would at least be now worth $123,654 after inflation-a gain of $26,606. There is simply no justification for such irresponsible delays and bureaucratic indecision. </PARA>
<PARA> That money, for example, could have been put to very good use in things like scholarships to help put students who have qualified for a place at the Defence Force Academy through their higher school certificate year in secondary school. Every year the three services select 50 students each to receive a $1,000 scholarship for their higher school certificate year. Since November 1985 an extra 23 of those students could have been funded just from the interest of the Fedorczenko legacy had it been invested properly. Alternatively, it could have been used, for example, to help cadet organisations at disadvantaged schools throughout Australia to get the equipment and the kit that this Government will not provide for them and makes them find for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> So strapped for resources as Defence is at the present, one would have thought that any extra money would have been appreciated, treated properly and used for any one of a myriad of purposes relating to the defence of Australia, as Mr Fedorczenko had wished. Instead, his patriotic concerns and his kindness have met with an ungrateful procrastination of which the Department of Defence ought to be ashamed. </PARA>
<PARA> It does make one wonder whether there are any other trust funds sitting in the Defence Department gathering dust. If there are any other patriotic Australians who would like to contribute to the defence of Australia, I would say to them, `Beware'. Defence is clearly not too good at managing its own money-we know that well enough; it also has not done too well with the management of Mr Fedorczenko's money. So it probably is not too wise to consider leaving a legacy to the Defence Department in the future until it learns to manage its own money. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw the Senate's attention to certain problems facing thousands of Australian pharmacists-problems created by this present Federal Government and its very erratic administration of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS). The blame for these measures must be sheeted home to the Minister for Community Services and Health, Dr Blewett, and especially the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples), who is responsible for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. I think it is really quite extraordinary that a Commonwealth department should be making policy decisions on the run, and yet that is exactly what Community Services and Health has been doing under these Ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is worth looking at some of the recent Government decisions in this area. Heavily prescribed drugs were suddenly made highly restricted last August, only to be restored to their former status a few weeks later because of the overwhelming protests from medical and pharmacy spokesmen throughout the country. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to some of the people who have criticised the Government's cavalier policies on pharmaceutical benefits. The distinguished former President of the Royal Australian College of Physicians, Professor Priscilla Kincaid-Smith, CBE, stated in relation to the authority listing of ACE inhibitors:</PARA>
<PARA>Authority listing of ACE inhibitors is a serious blow to all who believe in preventive medicine. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's response was to brand Professor Kincaid-Smith's comments as `alarmist nonsense'. I wonder whether they accuse the editor of the Medical Journal of Australia of similar nonsense for that journal making the following remarks in August 1988 regarding the placing of 53 drugs on the `authority only' list:</PARA>
<PARA>This decision did not include any assessment of the efficacy or cost-effectiveness of the drugs, simply their monthly cost. No discussions with medical or pharmaceutical professions took place before the decision about authority restrictions was made. </PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government made a submission to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Tribunal that the Tribunal should make an absolute cut in pharmacists' national health scheme dispensing fees-something never before contemplated by any Federal government and a step which has ruptured the relationship between chemists and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The next step on the Government's chaotic course was for the Government to insist last month on the de-listing of 12 widely used brands of drugs, which are then to be restored to the PBS list on 1 August. Recently in Tasmania-and this is not surprising-there was a State-wide pharmacy strike, when 174 of the 177 pharmacies in the State were closed for more than three hours and more than 600 chemists and their staffs attended rallies in Hobart, Launceston and Burnie. This was the first ever stoppage in the history of the profession and an action which was not taken lightly. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators would know that pharmacists are basically conservative people and that they have taken up a career path which is devoted to the service of the community. The Government in general, and regrettably Mr Staples in particular, unfortunately have tried to smear the reputation of pharmacists in Tasmania when they stopped work and, more recently, when similar action was also taken in New South Wales. The inference that the Government tries to promote is that pharmacists are wealthy and living off the system. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us examine some of the comments of the Minister in charge of the PBS, Mr Staples, on 9 March. The Minister described the Pharmacy Guild of Australia as running a `scare campaign' amongst the sick and elderly in order to boost members' income. On 9 May, he compounded this slander by describing the Pharmacy Guild as `the biggest spreader of misinformation of any national organisation in this country'. This is wholly incorrect and is the sort of statement that is made only behind the protection of parliamentary privilege. </PARA>
<PARA> The vast majority of pharmacists in Tasmania, and I am sure in all of the other States, have heavy overdrafts to carry on their businesses because of the high overheads that they have to sustain. They provide a service to the community under very rigid guidelines, both from their professional bodies such as the Pharmacy Guild and the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, and from the pharmacy boards in each State and Territory. Most of them are earning average and, in many cases, below average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government has taken an aggressive stance and anybody who denies this should have witnessed the comments of Mr Staples in Burnie recently when he was presented with a petition against changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Unfortunately, the situation has now been reached where no pharmacist in private practice in Australia has a great deal of confidence in Mr Staples and the current policies of the Government. This has been exacerbated by strikes, marches and even legal action in the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> While this Government tries to cut the returns to pharmacists, these same people have had to fund salary increases, rent increases, an impending 3 per cent superannuation award and the loss of time due to the 38-hour week. There are approximately 5,200 pharmacies in Australia. They are not only a major component of the small business sector but also a major employer of women. It is worth reminding the Government that 60 per cent of pharmacists and 99 per cent of pharmacy assistants are women. I think it is appropriate at this stage that I should comment that I do have a vested interest because my wife is a salaried pharmacist on a part time basis. Certainly these people will remember the Government's actions when they next vote. </PARA>
<PARA> Along with many of my colleagues, I have been inundated with letters from individual pharmacists, who have always been apolitical and have been prompted to write in protest as never before. They have drawn my attention to many aspects of the maladministration of the scheme, including a lack of adequate supply of replacement generic drugs; and the de-listing of many products-only to have them relisted subsequently, confusing both the professionals and the patients. Indeed, there has also been a lot of confusion about the availability of drugs. Other problems include the 5.2 per cent surcharge on wholesale prices and continual delays in PBS payments. Unfortunately, Tasmanian pharmacists seem to be singled out for special treatment in this area. Problems are also treated by the late payment of the national health scheme claim results. The April statement introduced by Mr Keating proposes a reduction in dispensing margins from 25 per cent to 10 per cent and a dispensing fee of $3.30 discounted by 25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> How is this Government handling the problems? It has set aside $1.1m to pay for the extra staff needed to process `authority only' forms; $2m has been earmarked to educate doctors on prescribing practices; and it has wasted thousands of dollars on sending out ridiculous red and white capsules to medical practitioners and pharmacists-a cost only revealed by Senator Cook after a probing question posed by my colleague, Senator Sue Knowles. Therefore, the Government's answer is to pour more money into an already bloated bureaucracy to administer more and more red tape while thousands of chemist shops throughout Australia shut their doors and pharmacists quite simply go bankrupt. Unfortunately, it is going to be the remote areas of Australia, the small country towns, that will lose this sort of service. </PARA>
<PARA> The fine print of the April statement shows that spending on the PBS will be cut by $31m in 1989-90; by $96m in 1990-91; and by $156m in 1991-92. These figures clearly demonstrate just how deliberately the Government is white-anting the scheme which has, up until now, received bipartisan support for approximately 40 years. The facts of the matter are that the administration of PBS in recent times under this Hawke Government has been quite hopeless and bad in the extreme. I am sure that members of the Government, especially Ministers, who have represented the Department of Community Services and Health in this place over the past few years, have been privately embarrassed to have to defend some of the policies-particularly policies that have been made on the run-that have come out from this Department. The coalition promises a complete review of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, so as not to humble pharmacists to the point of bankruptcy, deny patients urgently needed medication and unnecessarily disrupt what was previously an efficient scheme which delivered the service for which it was established. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to talk about concerns expressed in Western Australia about the proposed merger of the University of Western Australia (UWA) and Murdoch University. Few on either campus actually appear to want this merger and it seems that the decision will depend entirely on the threatened consequences of not merging. The deleterious consequences of not merging have been stated orally-that is, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) to the vice-chancellors-but they have never been expressed explicitly and openly. For public consumption, Mr Dawkins says it is entirely up to the universities. But a major sotto voce threat is to take away from Murdoch University the right to teach external degree programs if it does not agree to merge. Murdoch University pioneered external university studies in Western Australia and about one-third of its students are taking some or all of their units externally. The loss of external teaching would be financially crippling, even in the absence of other financial measures against Murdoch University which have been quietly threatened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The threat to take away external teaching is subtly put. If Murdoch University does not merge, it is told the Western Australian College of Advanced Education (WACAE) will be given the Western Australia's Distance Education Centre, that is, the sole right to run external courses. In theory, Murdoch could continue to teach its external students through the Distance Education Centre, controlled by the WACAE. However severe rationalisation of external offerings can be expected. </PARA>
<PARA> The Western Australian State Minister for Education, Dr Carmen Lawrence, has repeatedly stated that only a merger voluntarily entered into by the two universities would be supported by the State Government, which has the constitutional authority to change the University Act to accommodate a merger. The Senate of Murdoch University has set out six requirements which it states are of fundamental importance to Murdoch University. Those requirements, which were published in the university magazine Changes, are:</PARA>
<PARA>1. That the academic staff on both campuses have equal access to research and teaching. </PARA>
<PARA>2. That the terms of employment shall not deteriorate. </PARA>
<PARA>3. That the Murdoch campus will continue to offer a wide range of disciplines, to develop its own courses and programmes at both undergraduate and graduate level, and retain its commitment to interdisciplinary study. </PARA>
<PARA>4. That any new academic structure continues to promote openness and to allow staff at all levels the opportunity to participate in decision making. </PARA>
<PARA>5. That a liberal admissions policy be retained. </PARA>
<PARA>6. a.) That the Vice-Chancellor of the amalgamated University should have an office and a presence on both campuses. </PARA>
<PARA> b.) That there should be a senior academic at Deputy Vice-Chancellor level on each campus with responsibility for the co-ordination of the academic policies on each campus supported by an appropriate administrative structure. </PARA>
<PARA>Any merger not containing these conditions can, therefore, only be seen as forced. </PARA>
<PARA> The University of Western Australia receives some $20m per annum from income on endowments, independently of government finance. It, therefore, has far less to lose from Commonwealth Government financial retribution than does Murdoch University and it is, therefore, in a position to dictate terms of any merger. Its own requirements are at odds with the Murdoch University's Senate's conditions. A merger would, therefore, destroy the educational gains to Western Australia which have been achieved by Murdoch University, some of which are indicated in the Murdoch University Senate's six conditions, which I have just read, and others of which include strong encouragement of educationally disadvantaged groups. For example, more than half of Murdoch University's students are women and about 40 per cent of students are over 30 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA> The University of Western Australia has already begun unilaterally appointing senior administrators who would run the combined university. Mr Jeff Gawthorne, the Pro Vice-Chancellor (Academic) of Murdoch University, wrote a letter on 4 May 1989 to school deans and heads of units in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA> From 1990 DEET will provide a block grant to the new University of Western Australia rather than separate grants to Murdoch an UWA. The principles and procedures that should apply to internal allocation of the funds need to be agreed between the Universities as soon as possible, so that action can be taken to advertise new positions. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it seems that the merger is presupposed. A considerable number of Murdoch University staff are not unhappy about a merger which preserves Murdoch University's distinct features but most of them, plus those which would not contemplate a merger at all in the absence of financial threats, are deeply concerned at the increasing evidence that the merger will be forced and that it will, in reality, be a takeover rather than a genuine amalgamation. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Dawkins's Department, the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET), has foreshadowed that Murdoch University's funding for 1990 is to be paid directly to the University of Western Australia. DEET has covered itself with reference to current negotiations but it has been made clear to the Murdoch Vice-Chancellor that he can assume that Murdoch University will be past history by next year and that all funds will be handled by the University of Western Australia. This is in spite of the fact that neither of the university senates has decided on a merger and the State Parliament has not passed the necessary legislation. So this sweeps aside the fiction that the States are responsible for making the major decisions about university education. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also received a letter from a member of the academic staff at UWA who writes on behalf of other academics at the university and expresses extreme concern. I will merely pass on to the Senate some aspects of the letter. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>I have not seen any public arguments in favour of the merger which show any benefit to anyone. The cost of administering a merger of any type would be, and indeed already is, prodigious in terms of man hours which could be spent on teaching and research and are instead committed to bureaucratic idiocies. . . The loss to students, who would perforce have less choice. . . to the academics who would have to waste some ten per cent of their time commuting between sites in one scenario, and the taxpayer, who has to pay for turning productive academics into bad bureaucrats because the existing bureaucracy isn't big enough, has never been assessed. . . It might pass without comment in Romania and be accepted with resignation in Poland, but that Australia should have got to the point where imbecile plans can be imposed by government fiat in the face of reason it scandalous. The only people inside the Universities who favour a merger appear to be those empire builders who, like their political masters, have no interest in either research or teaching, and hope to profit from those who do. The academics who oppose the merger do so quite simply because it can only make it harder to do what they want to do-which is to do research and teach. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to talk about the White Paper. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> On the White Paper, the document is so full of internal inconsistencies that it is plainly intended to placate the credulous, while in fact, turning Universities into extensions of the bureaucracy. It is a cynical exploitation of those innocent souls who trust the government to be honourable and to do what is best for society . . . The model of the Universities as widget factories that can be improved by central administration is so manifestly silly that few advanced societies have tried it. And those that did, didn't stay advanced for very long. </PARA>
<PARA> If Mr Dawkins wants the Universities to be doing more applicable research, he is using the worst methods which could be devised. I suggest that the main barriers to getting Australia research into Industry are on the Industry side . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It also says:</PARA>
<PARA>We are not protesting some reforms that threaten our privileges, we are protesting that we are being diverted from doing our teaching and research in order to support the centralist bureaucratic idiocies which have such a depressing record elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, we need to know whether it is true that DEET has already decided, without having regard to decisions by the senates of both universities in Western Australia, that the merger will definitely take place. I would suggest to honourable senators that the merger of universities in general can be supported in any State only for good educational reasons and not for any reasons of convenience. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is now debating the Income Equalization Deposit Laws Amendment Bill 1989. In the 1960s drought bonds were introduced by coalition Government to encourage farmers to make provision for bad seasons by cash deposits as well as providing hay and water reserves. In 1976 the Fraser Government broadened the scheme to cover all the factors which can significantly alter farmers' incomes. Nearly six years ago the Hawke Government scrapped the old income equalisation deposit scheme, effectively denying farmers the opportunity to put something aside for bad times in a way that would not penalise them in relation to other taxpayers while, at the same time, not put them in some special favoured position. That was the substance of the Fraser Government scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At that time Senator Walsh was on his rort craze. Everything Senator Walsh could see that was happening in this nation was a rort-frequently and most often a tax rort. So Senator Walsh, as soon as he got into government, went in with his broadsword, cutting off heads wherever possible without regard for the economic consequences or the difficulties that taxpayers might have to face as a result of his changes to legislation. He was totally preoccupied with tax rorts. He used to talk all the time about everyone in this country, except himself, rorting the system. Without regard, as I say, for the farmers that he was affecting, the Hawke Government removed the tax link from the scheme because Senator Walsh alleged that the incentive was too generous. </PARA>
<PARA> By removing the tax link, Senator Walsh, Mr Keating and Mr Hawke effectively ruined the scheme and deposits have steadily declined since then. Instead of applying their minds, as might have been expected, to discovering whether any loopholes existed and, if so, removing them, they have wrecked the scheme. They put in its place a scheme which they claimed would encourage more farmers to participate but it was nothing more than glorified savings account system and it has been a disastrous failure, as we predicted at the time when they brought it down. That scheme-the Hawke Government scheme-no longer attracts funds because, as the Government was warned by the coalition, the replacement scheme offers no incentives to farmers to participate or save. </PARA>
<PARA> Incentive is the key to any saving program. That simple truth appears to have escaped this Government. Farmers voted with their feet and there was a mass exodus from the scheme. Lodgments fell from over $73m in 1979-80, to $485,000 in 1987-88. The value of the Fraser Government scheme can best be illustrated by the fact that during the 1982-83 drought, when the net value of rural production fell by 80 per cent and Australia was in the grip of one of the worst droughts in the nation's history, redemptions peaked at over $65m and those redemptions saved many farmers from absolute ruin. And, of course, with the good commodity prices that we have been having over recent years, farmers should have been putting away savings to help them deal with some future drought or crisis on the land. But this Government has not enabled them to do so, other than in a way which does not offer incentive. </PARA>
<PARA> I might mention that the 1982-83 drought is always conveniently ignored by the Hawke Government when it discusses the problems that the Fraser Government faced during that year. Ever since then the Hawke Government has been under pressure to restore what was undoubtedly a worthwhile scheme to encourage self-help; to reduce natural disaster relief and rural adjustment assistance payments; to allow farmers to put aside funds for their own benefit to be used when they face a crisis; and compensate them for the greater amounts of tax they pay in good years. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1988 May economic statement the Government at long last announced that it would reintroduce a tax linked income equalisation deposits scheme to operate from 1 July 1989. The mix of high wool prices and the economic mess created by this Government's economic policies are the reasons the new scheme is not to come into effect until the next financial year. What the Government is doing is saying, `All right, you can have it as from 1 July 1989. We know that there were very high wool prices last year but you will not be able to benefit from those high wool prices. What you are going to be looking at is from 1 July 1989'. But the problem is that the Government is locking the stable door after the horse has bolted because recently wool prices in fact dropped by almost 30 per cent and it is too late. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic mess that this Government has created is a disaster all round, as we observe a net overseas deficit of $100 billion. But, of course, the people of Australia will not have to worry too long about Senator Walsh because his political future has now emerged as a key issue in Western Australia where the Labor factions are fighting as to who will get his seat. The right wing Labor Unity faction is apparently demanding that Senator Walsh retire early so that it can get his seat. </PARA>

<PARA> The average farmer is not engaged in tax rorts. Farmers are battling for survival and due to the policies of the Hawke Government they are being exposed to crippling interest rates, frequently up to 23 per cent on overdrafts. These interest rates are stopping investment in rural enterprises and robbing Australia of much needed export income. The income equalisation deposits scheme of the Hawke Government does not offer significant benefits to the average farmer. It is largely cosmetic because of the tax rates involved and the real winners may very well be those in the top tax brackets-the rich mates of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). </PARA>
<PARA> Interest will not be paid on the part of the investment which is considered deferred tax; it will, however, be paid at the short term Commonwealth bond rate-that is, 14.5 per cent-on the investment portion of the deposit. We should compare that bond rate with the rates which farmers are paying on their bank borrowings at present. As I said, they are paying about 20 to 23 per cent on overdrafts. The tax deferred component will be considered to be 39 per cent, the second highest tax rate. This means that depositors will be paid interest only on 61 per cent of their money. There is no provision in this Bill for a constant update of the average tax rate and our amendment calling for the annual declaration of the average tax rate of depositors to be published each year with the Budget was defeated by the Government in the other place. In order to enable the Government to get through its legislative programs, we have decided not to press on with that amendment in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government should closely monitor the operation of this legislation to see whether it provides any real incentives for the average or battling farmer to participate. This amending legislation is an admission of the stupidity of this Government in abolishing the Fraser Government's tax indexed scheme and, as it moves back towards that scheme, it is not opposed-it is better than it was previously. In government we will review the operation of this legislation to establish whether it benefits those that it is intended to benefit, or should be benefiting, namely, the average farmer, the battler on the land. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Income Equalization Deposits Laws Amendment Bill 1989. I am very disappointed that it has been brought on at this time and the debate has to be rushed. As Senator Lewis has quite ably pointed out, the system put in place in 1976 by Malcolm Fraser's Government worked very well but was wrecked by Senator Walsh in 1983-84. Senator Lewis said that he welcomed the admission of stupidity by the Government in wrecking the system in 1983. The Government is now attempting to undo some of that damage. But is it really attempting to rectify the mistake that it made? I believe that it is doing very little. I believe that it is only painting over the problem that it is trying to redress.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been calling for income equalisation deposits (IEDs) to be introduced on a sensible scale. The Western Farmer of 25 May 1989, contains an article headed `Farmers stand to gain from a new IED scheme'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>The big savings will arise if a farmer deposits taxable income when in the highest bracket and withdraws it when taxable income is in the lowest bracket.</PARA>
<PARA>That journalist forgot to say that this arrangement fell down because of the requirement to declare income for provisional tax purposes. Savings could have been made if one did not have to do so. But farmers will still have to do it. A farmer will have to pay provisional tax, plus 12 per cent. One pays the tax up front. It is, in effect, a free loan to the Government. As far as I am concerned, a farmer may as well pay the tax in the first place and be done with it. There is totally nothing in this legislation in this respect. We were originally told that certain things would be done but, just like in the debate on the wheat legislation, we were fed wrong information. I have a letter explaining that originally it was mooted, whether by design, error, inference or whatever, that IEDs did not have to be declared for provisional tax purposes. But the National Farmers Federation questioned the Department of Primary Industries and Energy a second time because it could not quite believe that the Government would have brought down legislation like this and expect it to work. The second advice read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Following the reading of the explanatory memoranda the Department of Primary Industry was again contacted because the explanation of how IEDs would affect IEDs was different from the advice the Department had given after its consultation with the Tax Department. </PARA>
<PARA> DPI again sought the advice of the Tax Department and has now altered its advice. </PARA>
<PARA> Provisional tax in the year following the deposit will be based on the total income without regard to IED, although the Tax Office points out that farmers can vary this amount to match their expected income. This is different from the earlier advice that the base for provisional tax would be total income minus the IED. </PARA>
<PARA> The advice on the withdrawal has not altered. When drawing out the deposit it will be regarded as irregular income and will not be taken into account for the base for provisional tax. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it is quite obvious that IEDs must be declared for provisional tax purposes. That is where the whole scheme falls down. I believe that a farmer might as well pay his tax so that he can then have full control over what he does. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told that farmers can vary their provisional tax assessments. But once a farmer does that he is subject to the penalties that apply if he is out by more than 10 per cent when he submits his tax return the following year. The penalties are vast and extensive. One can try to make a forecast but forecasts at the best of times can go wrong. A wheat grower might get a payment that he had not allowed for or that he could not have forecast. Other unforeseen matters could arise. Once one undertakes to change a provisional tax assessment, one is locked in and one does not have flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA> A farmer has to estimate, within 10 per cent, what he is going to earn. But for three months, between 31 March when his tax bill is due, and 30 June his flexibility is out the window. A farmer may have 1,000 wethers that he thinks he may or may not sell. But he may run short of feed and has to sell them. He may have some wool on hand that he was not intending to sell and then, because of fluctuating prices, he may decide to sell. So, under this arrangement, his flexibility will go out the window. </PARA>
<PARA> They are the main points that I want to make. I know that my time is limited. However, before I conclude my speech I would like to refer to some figures that show that there is no great advantage in this legislation. Take the case of a farmer who has a taxable income of $100,000 and decides to put $40,000 into IEDs. If he has a taxable income of $100,000, his primary tax, ignoring Medicare payments, is $49,000 and his provisional tax is $54,880, giving a total of $103,880. If we deduct any tax credits that he may have in respect of previous provisional payments-for argument's sake, I have put that amount at $45,000-he would have $58,880 to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> My second example concerns a farmer with a net income of $100,000, who puts $40,000 into IEDs. He would pay income tax of $29,400 and provisional tax on the $100,000, not on $60,000, of $54,880. His total tax payment would be $84,280. However if we deduct his $45,000 credit his actual payment would be $39,280. That farmer would have reduced his tax bill by $19,600 for the outlay of $40,000 but his total loss of liquidity is $79,280. This compares with an outright payment of $58,880 in the first place and the difference in terms of outflow is $20,400. As I have said, although provisional tax can be varied, the arrangement is not flexible and, therefore, I do not believe that it will be used as well as it could be. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I would like to make concerns the 29 per cent retention rate that applies when IEDs are taken out. But how can the Australian Taxation Office justify this practice when provisional tax has already been paid? If one is charged provisional tax, how can a prescribed tax payment be made when IEDs are withdrawn? I simply cannot understand this and perhaps the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) can fill me in on that a bit later. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Government for attempting to bring back a system that is needed by farmers throughout Australia to level out their income and have money in reserve for downturns. But I have pointed out that the arrangement is not what it seems to be and there is really nothing in it for farmers. I can tell the Government that it has a long way to go and, in the long run, this system is not going to work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill 1989 is, once again, an example of the Federal Government not being prepared to wear its share of pain in cost cutting. It is determined to make not only the State governments but local government wear the pain and make the serious cuts that need to be made. Of course, this Government has a poor and paltry record in dealing with local government. Firstly, it has chosen to change the tax sharing arrangements which existed from 1976 when the Fraser Government introduced legislation to enable local government to have a share of personal income tax. In fact, local government was given up to 2 per cent of money from this source and, on that basis, it was able to plan in an adequate way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government chose to alter those arrangements in 1986 when it decided to fund local government by way of financial assistance grants. The proposal at that time was to tie that amount to general purpose grants and the amounts given to State governments. This enabled local government to budget and plan the money in a predictable way. </PARA>
<PARA> But in recent times the Government has changed its mind again. It has treated State governments poorly by reducing their general purpose grants. For the second time we are amending the legislation which originally tied local government to State government grants. But for this arrangement local government would receive even less money than it is getting under the proposed amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to observe that at the time the Federal Government has chosen to cut by a considerable figure the grants to State governments and, indeed, to cut local government grants in real terms by 3.8 per cent, it has given itself an increase through its own general purpose grants of 5.5 per cent. To put a finer point on it, Tasmania, will, for the first time, receive a grant which is lower in monetary terms. That is despite the fact that, in the second reading speech to the 1986 legislation, the Government said that the reductions were being made because of a changed method of assessing the amounts of money that should be given to each State. It said that this would be done in such a way that there would be no reduction in the payment to any of the States in money terms from one year to the next. So the Government's own undertaking given in its second reading speech on 2 May 1986 is in fact being breached this year because Tasmania will in fact receive less money in monetary terms. But, as I said, across the board local government per se is receiving an effective loss of 3.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, local government is being used as a tool by the Federal Government in that the Federal Government has attempted to pass on to local government, without providing adequate funding, functions for which it hitherto had responsibility. I think it is fair to say that local government, as the third tier of government, has a most important role to play because it is so close to the coalface, as it were. It is the closest level of government to the people and, as such, it is often better placed than particularly a centralised Commonwealth government and, indeed, sometimes by State governments, for the delivery of particular services. But, in our view, there has to be a realisation that, if there is to be a devolvement of function onto local government, local government should carry out that function and be funded in a proper way so that it can properly exercise the responsibilities that are given to it. </PARA>
<PARA> We have all focused in recent times on the role of local government and how it fits into our federal system. From the Opposition's point of view, it is important and vital that local government be seen to be an important vital third tier of government. As I said a little earlier, it is the tier of government which is closest to the people. It is, of course, the tier of government which most often hears complaints-to a greater extent than perhaps people in this chamber-about the things that affect people in their day-to-day lives. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986 the Government chose to go a certain route and in its second reading speech on that occasion it said that one of the reasons for deciding to tie local government grants to State government grants was that these new financial arrangements would provide a stable financial base from which local government would be able to plan with a greater degree of certainly than under the previous arrangements. It said that the volatility that characterised the previous tax sharing arrangements would be eliminated. Of course, it is the Government's deliberate decision to cut State grants that has brought about the need to introduce the Bill that is before us today. Local government and State governments need to be able to expect a constant level of funding so that they can plan sensibly. This Bill will ensure that the cut that they are suffering is not as great as it otherwise would have been. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, local government generally has a responsibility for roads. We see a constant disregard for the proper funding of that responsibility which local government has to carry out. Quite clearly, the Government pays lip service only to the third tier of government. The Government has a cynical view, in that although it has transferred functions to local government and is not prepared to make the hard decisions, it has made local governments suffer cuts while giving itself an effective increase in general purpose funding. </PARA>
<PARA> In the overall context of federal affairs, we know that the Federal Government has a centralist attitude. We know that its concerns for the proper devolvement of power, both to the States and to local government, is not a genuine one. Most often, it is a token gesture. The true intent of this Government, as we see in so many pieces of legislation, is to have a centralised function. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has indulged in window-dressing. From time to time it has embarked upon quite dishonest campaigns. Its rhetoric that it is interested and concerned about any particular endeavour in Australian life has been shown to be, in fact, paltry words with no substance at all. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important for local government to have adequate, proper and predictable funding. In this respect, it is not well served by the Government's present legislation or its 1986 legislation. Nonetheless, it is important that the money that has been allocated be received by local government as quickly as possible. This Bill will facilitate the passage of that money. At least local government will have some funds to carry on the continuing work which is growing and burdensome to ratepayers. As I have said, we are most critical of the attitude that the Government has shown. It took a decision at the Premiers Conference first to cut State funding and then to cut local government funding. It is prepared to take an increase but it will not look at government expenditure cuts in any real way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As the shadow Minister for local government, Senator Bishop, has said, we are debating the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill today. The coalition will not be opposing the Bill, but I believe it remains to us to take this opportunity to bring to the attention of the Senate the number of real concerns that local government has in Australia about the way it is being presently treated by this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most honourable senators will be aware that this Bill will amend the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986. Under the Fraser Government local government used to receive a percentage of personal income tax receipts. This was changed to a general purpose grant in accordance with a formula which was paid in grants to the States. Of course, we know that this Bill changes that again so that local government will be `a little better off', in the words of a news release that was put out from Senator Ray's office. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the introduction of this new formula we have seen an ongoing decrease in the amount of funds provided by the Federal Government for local government until we have arrived at this deplorable situation where in 1988-89 the only local government body that will receive an increase in real terms is Western Australia. As the previous speaker, Senator Bishop, has said, my own State of Tasmania will actually receive a decrease in real dollar terms. Once again we see a Federal Labor Government showing its contempt for my State of Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that this is a contradiction of the undertakings which were made when the original Bill was introduced and the Federal Government promised that there would be no reduction in the payment of funds to any State from one year to the next. We have seen a reduction in the payments not only to the States but, quite naturally, also to local government. The Government also claimed, ironically, that the new financial arrangement would provide a stable financial base from which local government would be able to plan with a greater degree of certainty. I do not know how many more formulas we will see to fit in with the amount of funds that local government is to receive, but I would have thought that these changes being made from year to year certainly do not provide anything stable for local government. All they have done is to prove that the Government's words were only a hollow sham. If one needs any proof of that, local government bodies have been beating a path not just to my door; those on this side of politics have had representations from local government on many occasions about the lack of funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that under the Fraser Government local government was provided funding of 2 per cent under a personal income tax sharing arrangement which was guaranteed. It was 2 per cent of whatever personal tax revenue was generated in real terms. If one takes the figures of that scheme that the coalition government put in place, and if one follows those same arrangements, today we would see that the amount has dropped to 1.55 per cent. That just proves this Government's commitment to local government. </PARA>
<PARA> One has to ask `What does local government have to look forward to?', because every year this Government has been in power there has virtually been a reduction in real terms in local government funding. We have to ask what amount of funding will be provided for local government in the future. I think we need to look no further than at the April economic statement which details the very sorry saga and tale of woe for local government over the next few years. In the Forward Estimates for 1988-90 local government funding has been reduced by $17.9m; in 1990-91 it has been reduced by 18.7m; while for 1991-92 we see a further reduction of $19.3m. This means in total that local government will have a reduction of $55.9m over the next three years, and that does not even take into account the inflation rate. One can see that the outlook for local government is very poor. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to a press release that came from the office of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) in which he announced details of the new funding arrangements for this year. One could be excused for thinking that local government was going to receive extra funds. The first line says, `Local government will receive an extra $18.5m dollars in 1988-89 under the Federal funding arrangements'. Then the Government does what it normally does with local government; it tends to cover up the real story by adding in the benefits that may accrue to some local government areas from the axing of the clawback situations. Further in the press statement Senator Ray says, `This means that local government will be better off by about $47m in 1988-90'. That is not true because the matter of clawback is a separate situation altogether. It has nothing to do with the financial assistance grants. That was put in there only to try to dress up the figures and to make local government think that it was better off. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988-89 local government received $625.5m; in 1989-90 it will receive $671m, as is indicated in the press release. In the same period inflation is tipped to be about 6.9 per cent. If we project those figures, the real figure that local government should receive is $697.5m. As it is, local government will experience a decrease in funding in real terms of 3.8 per cent in this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> When this Bill was debated in the House of Representatives, the Federal Member for Denison, Mr Duncan Colquhoun Kerr, spent some time explaining how local government had never had it better. I just cannot believe how he could say that road expenditure, for instance, had increased by 20 per cent in real terms, and that the Federal general purpose assistance provided by the Hawke Government to local government was 30 per cent higher in real terms than that provided by the Fraser Government. I would have to challenge those statements because I have had quite a long involvement in local government over many years and I believe that his comments really show how far out of touch he is with the true situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refer to a press release that I put out following the press release from the Local Government Office on increased funding. I am pleased to say that without any prompting from my local association, the Secretary of the Municipal Association supported my remarks when he said that the funding had not been increased at all. Therefore, I would suggest that when Mr Kerr comes to the Parliament and makes statements which are obviously incorrect, we can only assume that he is either out of touch or he is really trying to hide the real situation. I believe that Mr Kerr is guilty of both those actions and I do not think he is doing the case of local government in Tasmania any good at all. Personally, I long for the day when my friend and colleague Mr Michael Hodgman, QC, returns to Canberra and is able to provide the people of Tasmania with the type of strong and meaningful representation which was his trademark. The present representation of Mr Kerr, who seems determined to toe Mr Hawke's line, is pretty weak to say the least. I believe that Mr Kerr would have been better off not saying anything about local government funding because all he has done is enable local government to see him for what he really is. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as I can see, local government has two choices as a result of these funding cutbacks: it can either reduce its services or pass on its increases to the ratepayers. In view of the huge hikes in interest rates that are affecting home buyers, I believe it would be unfair to pass these rate increases on to the families of Australia. One can only say that these cuts in road funding will mean a decrease in services. It is just another example of the attack by the Hawke Government on the families and home buyers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This treatment of local government is nothing new and every time one of the members of the coalition criticises this Government we hear the same sort of thing. I heard Senator Cook say, `What about the referendum?'. Well, what about the referendum?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just wish that the Minister would give local government the recognition it needs in financial terms rather than just saying things. That is what local government really wants. It wants the sort of ongoing assistance on which it can rely, not the sort of hollow promises that come from that lot on the other side. Financial assistance is something that is meaningful; something one can see. All we have had from the Government are promises which have been welshed on every year. Another important part of local government budgets-and this is tied in with financial assistance grants-is road funding. There again, the coalition when in government had a very easily understood policy. The percentage of fuel excise which it returned for roads was 75.7 per cent. At the moment, under the present Hawke Government, it sits at a miserable 20 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the Hawke Government came to power in 1983 its budget for road funding was $1.2 billion. It is exactly the same now. So in real terms it has fallen by 30 per cent. This represents a cut of something like $350m in around five years. This is something that we cannot be very proud of. Petrol bowsers have become the tax collectors for the Federal Government. Local government is on the end of the queue. Out of every 22.4c, 4.95c goes back to the States and out of that local government gets a miserable 1c. With cuts in financial assistance grants and road funding, the outlook for local government is pretty hopeless. </PARA>
<PARA> Question Time is about to be called on and, therefore, I wish to conclude my remarks. Before I do, I again wish to bring to the attention of the Senate the situation at the moment in my State of Tasmania. At a recent meeting of the Municipal Association of Tasmania, Tasmania's 46 councils agreed to spend $20,000 promoting public awareness of the deplorable situation of the roads network. This sort of campaign is going on all around Australia. Local government and the automobile associations have had enough of the penny-pinching attitude of this Government to road funding. I would suggest that local government also has had enough of the penny-pinching attitude of this Government towards one of the most important tiers of government in our country. </PARA>

As for the NRMA spokesman's comments on the responsibility of car manufacturers, I have to say that a more balanced view suggests that the Australian industry, like its overseas counterparts, has been active in combating the problem. That is not to say that there is not more that could be done. Any vehicle, imported or locally made, is vulnerable to theft by forced entry. Locking devices are perhaps a help but they only make entry more difficult, not impossible. The Australian car industry, in consultation with State and Commonwealth authorities, supported the introduction of new vehicle identification numbers for all new vehicles from 1 January 1989, through the Australian design rule system. That is expected to contribute to making the theft of cars much less attractive.</PARA></TALK.START>

If so, does the Minister agree that it is the Government-not the banks, not the Opposition, not anyone else-that is responsible for the interest rates which are crushing Australian home buyers, small businesses and farmers? Just as the Labor Party, when in opposition, encouraged the growth of home interest protest groups in the early 1980s, will it ensure that Government speakers attend the meetings now being organised around Australia by similar community groups so that home buyers may hear from those who are responsible an explanation for the situation? Would it not have been a good idea if last night's meeting of a community group known as Interest Rate Protest had been attended by a Government Minister, so that the 1,000 or so angry home purchasers who were present could have heard from the Government an explanation of their plight?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I have seen reports in this morning's press-supplemented by material from our mission in Washington-that the United States Administration has indicated that it will seek the approval of Congress for a program to supply rifles and other lethal weapons to the non-communist resistance headed by Prince Sihanouk. This is a topic that I have discussed with Secretary of State Baker. Both I and the Prime Minister discussed it with Vice-President Quayle when he was here in Australia. In those discussions with the United States, both the Prime Minister and I counselled real caution about providing lethal aid to Prince Sihanouk and those forces working with him at a time when diplomatic efforts were in train and making obvious progress toward a Cambodian settlement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While the Australian Government continues to regard Prince Sihanouk's role as absolutely crucial to any lasting settlement in Cambodia, the Government is concerned that the supply of arms to the non-communist resistance, rather than assisting the diplomatic process, which is the stated United States rationale, will work against the process of achieving agreement among the factions on an internal settlement. Accommodation among the factions is the major stumbling block at present in the way of an overall statement.</PARA>
<PARA> It can also be said that there is a real risk that some of the arms supplied to the non-communist resistance could find their way into the hands of the Khmer Rouge, the third partner in the forces of the CGDK-the Coalition Government of Democratic Cambodia-which is obviously something that we would deplore. In that context I should say that I do not want anything that I have said this afternoon to be taken as in any way critical of the United States position on the Khmer Rouge. Vice-President Quayle made very clear that the United States, like Australia, wants absolutely no return to the brutality of the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia. We are all determined that such a tragedy must not again befall the people of that country. As a result we are very concerned to ensure that negotiations for a resolution of the Cambodian issue will succeed.</PARA>

What proportion of the entire Eden management area does the 1989-2009 EIS cover compared to the previous EIS?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sanders has to be recognised as a late developer in this debate. Apart from Government senators and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Dunn must take the prize for persistence in arguing for the environmental lobby. I am getting a bit annoyed with questions which assert things which are factually wrong as if they were right and, on the basis of that, go ahead and draw conclusions. Senator Sanders's question is riddled with factual errors, the first one being that the New South Wales Forestry Commission conducted an EIS for 1989-2009. It did not. That EIS was conducted by Harris-Daishowa (Australia) Pty Ltd on guidelines agreed to between Harris-Daishowa, the then Department of Environment, which has been taken over by the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, DASETT, and in consultation with the State department of the environment in New South Wales. Harris-Daishowa conducted the EIS, not the New South Wales Forestry Commission. I would have expected someone who puts himself forward as an expert in this issue actually to know the factual base of it, and not gloss over the facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me go to the questions. As I have said, the EIS to which Senator Sanders has referred was not conducted by the Forestry Commission. I have explained whom it was conducted by. That EIS covers the period 1989 to 2000. I am aware of it: I have a copy of it and I have certainly read it.</PARA>
<PARA> The next question was about prudent and feasible alternatives. Senator Sanders should know that I have thoroughly and exhaustively considered prudent and feasible alternatives that I have put forward to the logging plan in the south-east forest. He should know that because last week I tabled in the Senate a fairly full document which was a full analysis of my consideration of those prudent and feasible alternatives. I imagine that Senator Sanders has read it. No-one has yet come forward to challenge the content of that consideration. The absence of a challenge by Senator Sanders or his question to the content of that consideration is a notable omission. The current EIS for the period 1989-2009 covers the entire Eden management area of 630,000 hectares and considers the environmental impact of Harris- Daishowa's operations beyond 31 December 1989 to 31 December 2009.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth plans for the south-east forests do not pervert the intention of the Jarasius decision. Since this is now a matter of contention Senator Sanders should get the Jarasius decision out and read it so that he can be satisfied on that point. That decision relates specifically to the New South Wales Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1980 and imposes an obligation on the Forestry Commission of New South Wales to prepare a separate environmental impact statement if the forestry activity is likely to significantly affect the environment. As a result of that decision an EIS was completed by the Forestry Commission of New South Wales. That EIS covers forestry operations in the Eden management area and adds to the information presented to the Harris-Daishowa EIS by specifically addressing those additional matters required by New South Wales law. The information provided by the Forestry Commission EIS was taken into account in the preparation of my consideration, which I tabled here, under section 30 of the Australian Heritage Commission Act.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my answer by making this observation: I would be a bit more accepting of the criticism of the balanced, considered and rational proposition the Commonwealth has put forward to bring to a conclusion the dispute in the south-east forests, to enable the environmental aspects to be protected and properly studied, and to enable the industry to continue, if people such as Senator Sanders asked, `What should be the fate of the 700 families who are dependent on the industry in that area?'. These people are operating in a regional zone with twice the unemployment level of elsewhere in New South Wales. Indeed, that is a consideration of the Commonwealth as well. We should not simply argue one side of it; we should find the right balance between both sides in order to meet the objectives of both sides. I have heard this from Senator Dunn; she at least is aware of the question. I have not heard it from Senator Sanders. I would like to hear it from him some time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The declaration that emerged from this week's NATO summit is an important and timely document, as I would hope the Opposition would appreciate. In what has been a very balanced and responsible statement, NATO has chartered a course that is fully responsive to the unprecedented opportunities that are now available to establish a new pattern of relations between East and West characterised by cooperation, trust and peaceful competition. We applaud particularly in this respect the very constructive leadership shown by President Bush at the summit by responding with imagination and boldness in seeking a satisfactory compromise by linking progress on conventional force reductions in Europe with reductions in short-ranged nuclear forces (SNF). It is a linking such that, once implementation of a conventional arms control agreement is under way, the United States, in consultation with its allies, is prepared to enter into negotiations to achieve a partial reduction in United States and Soviet land-based nuclear forces of shorter range to equal and verifiable levels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The highlights of the NATO declaration included acknowledgment of the important and welcome changes taking place in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and some Eastern European countries; a resolve to maintain viable and credible defences of the lowest possible level consistent with security requirements; the view that, based on the historic progress of recent years, the alliance can now exploit fully the potential of arms control as an agent of change; a far-reaching proposal to radically cut, as I have said, conventional forces in Europe in an ambitious timetable to reach and implement the agreement; a determination to press ahead comprehensively through the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe process to overcome the division of Europe; a resolve to develop NATO into a more mature and balanced partnership corresponding to the political and economic realities of the 1990s; and, finally, a clear acknowledgment that security has to be seen in a broader context and include such issues as environmental degradation, resources and complex and grave economic disparities.</PARA>
<PARA> These developments all have, in their way, important implications for Australia in that, just as we could not in the past escape the ramifications of East-West tensions over Europe, so these new developments should enhance encouraging trends that are equally apparent in our part of the world.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the article, and it certainly does not provide any support for the campaign being waged by a number of motoring organisations. It gives figures of the price, converted into United States dollars at the official exchange rate, of a United States gallon of petrol in 25 different cities around the world at the end of 1988. The highest price in the world is in Tokyo with $4.10 a gallon and the lowest was in Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, with 14c. Certainly, if the healthy state of its international account is taken as an indicator of how soundly its economy is managed, then Japan is obviously right at the top of the world league, but I do not think that it should be concluded that there is necessarily a correlation between the price of petrol and the health of an economy. It does not necessarily mean that, at every level, countries can be ranked in accordance with the price of petrol. But the difference in those prices, as was explained in the article, is the varying levels of taxation imposed on petrol by different governments. Of the 25 cities listed, Sydney was ranked sixteenth. It had cheaper petrol than 15 of the 25 cities listed. We are well below the general level of taxes that apply to petrol in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. It is about time the motoring organisations realised this and dropped the silly campaign they have run sporadically for as long as I can remember, and that is that whatever the tax is on fuel that amount should be spent on roads. That has never been the case in Australia, and it has never been the case, I do not think, in any overseas country, and never will be.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did read an abridged article on those United Kingdom reports in one of the Australian newspapers. From initial research, I think many of the allegations happen to be true. It was of course a different time in the 1950s and different standards applied. Quite clearly, it was thought to be a philanthropic thing to take orphans and others and ship them off to Australia and Canada. More serious was the shipping of those children to countries in Africa, et cetera, where apparently the idea was to redress the racial balance, or implant enough of a racial balance for survival. Many of those children who came to Australia went into circumstances where they were abused, where they were exploited and where their life was made a misery which has caused social problems for them later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that in the 1988 spring conference of the Standing Committee of Social Welfare Administrators, a decision was made that all Australian authorities would assist those people in tracing their parents and in establishing their background.

I do not think they knew the conditions under which these children came out. We were talking about a period of 25-odd years. Anything we can do at a Federal level-I am sure the State governments and the United Kingdom Government feel the same-to assist these people to find out what their origins were, maybe to trace parents, if that is a feasible process, and also to counsel them and give them support services because of the traumas they have been through, will be done.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come back to some of the details later, but Senator Stone is essentially asking me to indulge in a bit of economic forecasting. I am reluctant to do that. One of the reasons why I am reluctant to do it is that I have seen the horrible crashes that some people have when they do indulge in economic forecasting. I remember Senator Stone writing immediately after the October 1987 stock market crash. With his usual explicit conviction of infallibility, he wrote `There is absolutely no doubt that there will be a world-wide recession in 1988'. It did not happen. That draws attention in a pretty spectacular way to the hazards of making economic forecasts, particularly dogmatic economic forecasts. I do not intend to accept his offer to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other figures that Senator Stone quoted were correct or approximately correct. It is a matter of record that gross national expenditure for the March quarter of 1989 over the same quarter in 1988 grew by 11 per cent, approximately double the growth in our gross domestic product. One of the swing items in that was a big increase in imports. The Government believes that that is unsustainable. That is the reason why we are running a tight monetary policy. Everything the Treasurer said seems to me to be consistent with that. Whether inflation, which is approaching 7 per cent, is runaway inflation depends largely on what Senator Stone's expectations are. In the 1960s it would have been considered to be runaway inflation but it is certainly not runaway inflation compared to some recent experiences, in particular, in 1981 and 1982 when the coalition was in government when it managed to achieve inflation above 10 per cent, unemployment above 10 per cent and a $10 billion Budget deficit. No government in Australia has come close to matching that sort of runaway inflation with such a high level of unemployment.</PARA>

Even the Tasmanian Government, not known for its conservation stance according to the electorate in Tasmania, which has made sure that that Government no longer has a parliamentary majority, took that step.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While the Commonwealth is proud of its actions on the fronts I have just mentioned, it is true that some rainforest logging still goes on, particularly on private land. In north Queensland that is certainly the case. Given Senator Boswell's earlier interjection about the 2,500 jobs, the fact is that 2,500 jobs did not get lost. One of the reasons for that is that rainforest logging has kept going. The other is that before the ban the companies took so much timber out of the forest that their stockpiles were much greater than Senator Boswell had been prepared to concede. Nonetheless, it is true to say that logging does go on in small patches in Queensland. In New South wales there is virtually no logging on private land now. Since 1982 all general purpose rainforest logging on public land in New South Wales has been phased out in favour of hardwood substitution. I think that is still the case. I have a feeling that there is one rainforest logging operation which still goes on in Grafton, but I believe it will end shortly. There is not much in Tasmania. A very small amount of rainforest logging can be done on private land. Obviously rainforest logging is now confined to some very small areas and the Commonwealth has no authority over those areas. All we can do is offer as much moral persuasion as we can and use those rainforests and afforestation initiatives to which I referred.</PARA>

The specifications for that consultancy study have been completed and, within the next few days, tenders will be called for that consultant.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Austudy take-up rate could vary for a number of reasons, one of which, if I heard correctly, Senator Patterson drew attention to at the end of her question-that is, a person does not get full Austudy unless the household income is below $17,000. Whether the variations that have taken place for this year or outlays being below estimate this year are due to wrong assumptions about the level of incomes in the households from which students come, I do not know. I gather that Senator Patterson is critical of the income level beyond which full Austudy is not paid. I imagine we would all like the income test to be more generous but I suggest to the honourable senator that she have a word with some of her National Party colleagues, who want to pay the full Austudy equivalent, under the assistance to isolated children scheme, to children of people with net assets in excess of $600,000. Her National Party colleagues say it is disgraceful to deny additional educational allowances to them. Should Australia be unfortunate enough to have a coalition government, the more her National Party colleagues succeed with that sort of rorting, the less they will be able to do for low income families who do not have any assets at all. The honourable senator should bear that in mind. It is not unusual for slippage to occur in the implementation of labour market programs.

However, to this point, he has not nominated them to the National Parks and Wildlife Service for its consideration.

<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> On 6 April (Hansard, page 1072) Senator Messner asked me, as Minister representing the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters, a question without notice about the Public Service early retirement scheme. I undertook to raise the issue with the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters and seek to obtain an answer as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters has supplied the following answer to the honourable Senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not true that a public servant aged 54 with at least 20 years' service could have received up to $170,000 more under the Government's one-off early retirement scheme than if he or she had retired at the age of 55 under the normal retirement benefits provisions.</PARA>
<PARA> The only additional benefit an officer retiring under the early retirement scheme would have received would be a severance payment based on years of service. If the officer received four weeks' pay in lieu of notice on retirement then the officer may have received a severance payment up to a maximum of 52 weeks' salary. The officer would have been entitled to elect for a lump sum superannuation benefit on retrenchment, an option that is not available to officers retiring on age grounds. This lump sum cannot be regarded as constituting an extra cash benefit; it is paid in lieu of the indexed age pension for life that is the normal option for Public Service retirees.</PARA>
<PARA> The maximum amount that a public servant can receive under the early retirement scheme is 48 weeks' salary as severance pay (for officers with 24 or more years of service), and 4 weeks' pay in lieu of notice. Officers also receive payment in lieu of unused recreation leave and long service leave credits, benefits which in most cases would be payable on age retirement or resignation. Benefits payable under the Superannuation Act will depend on the officer's superannuation contribution history as well as the particular superannuation option chosen by the officer.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the re-employment of retirees as consultants or in other ways, there is no legal barrier to former officers being reappointed to the Service or being engaged as temporary employees or consultants in accordance with the normal competitive merit selection process. It has been clearly recognised, however, that re-engagement may raise particular sensitivities. The former Public Service Board issued advice to departments on this matter in 1987 and the Public Service Commissioner has since written in similar terms to Secretaries indicating his expectation that re-engagement immediately or quite soon after such retirement should not occur. He has asked Secretaries to ensure that careful consideration is given to any proposal for the appointment, employment or consultant engagement of any officer who has recently been retrenched or retired.</PARA>

<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of commercial factors involved in the current New Zealand wheat trade with shipping being only one factor. Since the New Zealand wheat marketing arrangements were deregulated international wheat traders have been able to offer wheat from a number of countries including those that subsidise production. Prior to deregulation all New Zealand imports of wheat were sourced from Australia and shipping arrangements posed no apparent threat. It is not the case that trans-Tasman shipping costs are the only factor involved in the recent sales referred to by Senator Chapman nor that shipping arrangements threaten the viability of the market. In this context I am advised that the Australian Wheat Board has recently chartered a foreign crewed ship for a trans-Tasman grain shipment.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has reviewed trans-Tasman shipping arrangements and Australian and New Zealand Ministers issued a joint communique on trans-Tasman shipping on 21 June 1988 (copy attached). This statement recognised the need to pursue measures to reduce the costs of shipping across the Tasman, a major element being the on-shore costs at both ends of the trade.</PARA>

<PARA> In accordance with the accountability invested in the Telecom Board, the decision to construct this building was made at the April 1989 Board Meeting and advice was then forwarded to the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom's decision to construct a Corporate headquarters in the CBD was based on the need to resolve the present unsatisfactory situation where Telecom has its headquarters' staff located in a number of different leased buildings. It is important for Telecom to locate its headquarters in the CBD for operational efficiencies. A significant factor is the need to be able to recruit top line staff from the whole of Melbourne city and its environs. If the headquarters was located in a suburban area it would limit the pool of talent attracted to employment in Telecom because of the difficulty in travelling to a suburban location. the Honourable Senator should be aware that Melbourne has a radial transport system. Where appropriate Telecom locates components of its organisation in suburban locations. For example the Telecommunications Laboratories are at Clayton and Telecom recently established a major suburban presence at Brandon Park, Mulgrave.</PARA>
<PARA> Many options were evaluated before the decision to build, rather than buy or lease was taken. The options were considered exhaustively by the Board a number of times. In examining the options Telecom approached the market and sought offers for lease or purchase. Detailed evaluations were performed which demonstrated that it was financially advantageous for Telecom to construct its own building. The honourable Senator should be aware that the new Boards of the GBEs are under their Acts accountable for performance and commercial results. I again assure the Honourable Senator that the Telecom Board has been meticulous in ensuring that its decision has been taken with full regard to the fact that the Board is accountable for its decisions.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The report of the Royal Australian Air Force Veterans' Residences Trust was sent to the Honourable R. J. Kelly, MP, the then Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, on 6 December 1988 and it was tabled in this place in May. I mention this as part of my continuing campaign against the Government's incompetence. It seems incapable of getting itself into gear sufficiently to present such reports in a timely and effective way. I believe that, unless the Minister has some adequate justification, these reports should be presented to the Senate as soon as practicable after they have been received, in this case by the trustees. I would expect that the Government, having been criticised by me almost daily on this score-and quite properly criticised-would have done something about responding to defend itself. I would think that, if this continued arrogance from the Government persists, the Opposition will have to consider taking another course of action about the way the Parliament is being treated with contempt by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention in passing that one thing does bother me a little about the Royal Australian Air Force Veterans' Residences Trust, that is, that such a large proportion of its assets have been left in government and semi-government loans rather than invested in the land and buildings which are required to meet the demands of those people who need the assistance of the Trust-those former air men and women who are in necessitous circumstances. The annual report reveals that there is something like $844,000 in investments in government and semi-government loans and other authorised trustee loans but that the total invested in land and buildings and so on is only something like $660,000 net, or about $900,000 gross before depreciation. The return on the investments is only 11.5 per cent, whereas the return on the gross cost of the housing and other assets is something like 13 per cent. So it seems to me that the assets could be better used. Maybe there is a sound explanation. It would be nice, if there were a sound explanation, to get it in the annual report. It would be even better if we received it on time. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>Although the report is very short it concerns an important issue, that is, the transfer of the nursing education function from State hospitals to the Commonwealth tertiary education system. The program, which started on the Commonwealth's initiative and was subsequently agreed to by the States, was funded by the Commonwealth. Because of the titanic nature of the program-I do not intend any pun there; it was a big program-it was decided to phase it in because of the possibility of a loss to the work force during the life of the program. The program involved not only the State hospitals but also the repatriation hospitals because they also carried out their own nursing education. In addition, the report deals with some of the numbers involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The program is due to be completed by 1993. A 10-year program, it started in about 1983; so we are just over halfway through. There was a long and involved process of negotiation as to how it would be funded. An agreement was reached and the Commonwealth put in $1,500 for each student nurse involved. That figure was indexed so that as costs went up the subsidy would be sufficient. By the time the program is completed about 18,000 nurses will have been trained under it. As I have said, all the States are in agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth was presented with a very vexed question because of the changing rule of nurses in society. I think everyone has come to realise that the Commonwealth Government took a rather enlightened role as to the changing nature of nursing. Instead of just being practical people looking after patients, nurses had to become practitioners. One of the great concerns was that if all nurses had a tertiary education qualification we would have all chiefs and no indians looking after the patients. Indeed, that could even be a concern today, and that is the point I wish to make. Many nurses do not require training to the tertiary level. The type of nurses to whom I refer are those in nursing homes and hostels who do not need the degree of training that is required under this scheme. Many nurses will be quite prepared to do that sort of work, as the number of patients increase, without going to this degree of training. If nurses need training in ordinary general nursing, by all means that training should be available to them. That should also apply to other forms of nursing because not all nurses have to be part of the transfer from the State-based system to the tertiary education system. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This delegation took place in July of last year. I do not know of any parliamentary report that has taken so long to come before the Parliament. This is because of the serious problems that arose during this delegation's visit. This visit has been the subject of much publicity, a great deal of it unfavourable, and it has created serious concerns about the conditions under which visits like this should take place. In my view the major problem with this delegation was its leader's inability to handle a difficult situation that was created both by the different personalities on the visit and the tiring and at times depressing nature of much of the visit itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say at the beginning that the leader's unfortunate behaviour is evident in his introduction to the delegation's report, in which he notes in what is, frankly, a gratuitously insulting remark:</PARA>
<PARA>I would suggest it is important that all members of any outgoing delegation arrive together and participate in all official meetings, briefings and functions unless there are extenuating circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>That is in part aimed at me. I arrived three days late because, as the leader of the delegation knows, my mother was dying and in fact did die a few days after I returned from that visit. It is grossly offensive for Mr Hollis, the leader of the delegation, to include such remarks in such a report. The other person to whom he was addressing these remarks was Mr Goodluck, who absented himself on a couple of occasions because he was ill, and he also had some blood pressure tests done. Honourable senators would be aware of the fact that recently Mr Goodluck did in fact have a heart attack. We can do without remarks of this nature in a report which deals with very serious matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the substance of the report. There is no disagreement in the dissenting report-I stress to the Senate that there is a dissenting report to the main report-with the main conclusions of the Government members' report that the delegation's visit did strengthen the cordial relations between Australia and the governments of the four African nations visited. These consist of the dictatorial, oppressive, Marxist governments of Ethiopia and Mozambique, the improving but still authoritarian Government of Tanzania, and the single-party Government of Zimbabwe, clearly the nearest model to a democratic state we visited but which is marred by the renewal during our visit of the 24-year-old state of emergency that has little if anything to do with any perceived or real threat from South Africa. However, the facts revealed to us during the visit raise serious questions about the merit of much of Australia's political, economic and humanitarian involvement with the nations visited and with their relationship with South Africa. Unfortunately, the delegation had no official opportunities to examine the `other side' of the contentious issues affecting these nations, such as the situation of Eritreans and other dissidents opposing the Ethiopian Government or Renamo leaders opposed to Mozambique's Frelimo Government or of South African responses to the concerns about South Africa expressed by the governments visited. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's often ill-conceived and inappropriate assistance to some African governments may have deepened rather than alleviated the distress of their people by strengthening the ability of undemocratic, authoritarian and often racially oppressive governments to subjugate them and to damage their economic potential by imposing dogma-bound politico-economic systems on them that have universally failed-but where the extent of that failure has been diminished by continued foreign aid. This applies not only to misdirected development aid, but also to emergency, humanitarian food aid, particularly in Eritrea. The removal of the International Red Cross and non-governmental organisations from their distributing and monitoring role in emergency food aid in this area, which took place shortly before our arrival, raises serious questions about the ultimate beneficiaries of such aid; if it is going to help feed the armed forces engaged in this 27-year-old civil war, then it must be halted immediately as it is simply helping to perpetuate the conflict. In civil war situations, as in Ethiopia, the Australian Government must not provide direct aid to the governments or movements involved, but must make any aid conditional on it being distributed by non-government organisations, NGOs, or monitored by the ICRC-the International Committee of the Red Cross. </PARA>
<PARA> Any official aid should also be conditional on positive measures being taken to negotiate to end the conflict. Specifically in the Ethiopian situation, the Australian Government must apply greater international pressure to stop the conflict in Eritrea and the violations of human rights throughout the Ethiopian nation. It also should bring strong pressure to change the intolerable treatment of women in much of Ethiopia, where their role appears to be almost as beasts of burden. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a problem with humanitarian aid in refugee situations in other parts of Ethiopia. Emergency food aid is still being provided to hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees more than three years after many of them arrived in a fertile, undeveloped area of western Ethiopia, yet there is no requirement on them to do anything from their own efforts to supplement the aid they are receiving. Rather than providing such food aid, Australia should be assisting by teaching them to provide for themselves the way the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other agencies are assisting Mozambican refugees in Tanzania to become largely self-supporting. With developmental and other aid, it is vital that it not depend on a level of technology beyond local skill levels; in nations where labour is plentiful it is ludicrous to see aid money spent on sophisticated labour-saving devices without providing the skills or cash needed for their expensive maintenance with the result that remnants of such projects are scattered rusting throughout Africa. Australia must concentrate its activities on those matters on which it has most to offer-such as in rural skills like prevention of land degradation and reafforestation programs. </PARA>
<PARA> On a political level, the Australian Government's wholehearted and apparently uncritical support for the campaign by the front-line states against South Africa, which has given Australia a very high standing among governments in the region, appears to be encouraging those elements in black Africa who argue that the only solution to the South African problem is by confrontation and, if necessary, bloody revolution. At a time when President P. W. Botha was building on modest, domestic, humanitarian advances by making conciliatory diplomatic contacts with important black African leaders in the region, it was regrettable that the views expressed by Government members of the Australian parliamentary delegation, and indeed those of the Australian Government, could be taken to be both dismissive of those moves and supportive of the hard confrontationist line that would, in all likelihood, lead to a major disaster for both the black and white populations of southern Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> Our experience on this visit indicates to us that Australia has a duty to encourage African nations to diminish their obsessive concentration on the South African scapegoat as the excuse for all their problems and instead to address the real issues which, even given natural difficulties such as drought, are mainly of their own making. For its 25 years existence, the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) has done little other than concentrate on the South African problem, as an issue on which the Africans in member states have been diminished and in many cases destroyed, even to the extent of tribal genocide and the collapse of once-rich commodity producing nations into the status of mendicants. Now that the OAU has at last recognised, at its latest annual meeting, the need to address Africa's economic problems, Australia has a special opportunity to provide major and meaningful advisory assistance, particularly in its role as a significant commodity producer itself in a continent rich in potential. </PARA>

<PARA>However, by closing its Embassy in Addis Ababa, where the OAU organisation is headquartered, Australia appears to have foregone any real opportunity to play such a significant role. Any re-opening would nevertheless need to be done in such a way that could not be taken as any endorsement of the Mengistu government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is evident that the relative poverty in which the vast majority of Africans live, despite their generally rich natural resources, has little if anything to do with the prime preoccupation of all their governments in their talks with the delegation-the South African question. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Contrary to the confrontationist propaganda, the level of economic dependence of some frontline states on trade with South Africa is such as to indicate that a withdrawal of that trade (and in the case of Mozambique, economic assistance) would have a disastrous impact on their economies. Even in civil war-torn Mozambique, a senior official of the Frelimo Government readily admitted that Renamo could not be blamed for all Mozambique's problems as Frelimo had itself made major mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now clear that the economic failures of East Africa have been despite enormous volumes of foreign aid and development assistance; a World Bank representative in Tanzania could not identify one `really successful' program in the nation's 28 year history of independence. It is only because of the moves away from doctrinaire Marxist models into more market-oriented societies that the World Bank now feels more confident about the prospects of new development projects in East Africa. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that the delegation was warmly received at senior levels by all governments and wide-ranging probing questions were generally allowed and answered appropriately (except in the interview with President Mengistu of Ethiopia); there appeared to be relatively little evasion or prevarication, although delegation members did not press politically embarrassing matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the personal and political divisions within the delegation that have been played up in the Australian media, the delegation maintained (except on two relatively unimportant occasions) an appropriate facade of unity in its dealings with host governments, none of which would have been aware of the internal problems that helped make this a very difficult visit. </PARA>
<PARA> It is recommended that clear and unequivocal guidelines be drawn up for the conduct of such delegations to politically sensitive areas, particularly relating to the duties and obligations of delegation leaders and deputy leaders, the rights of non-government members, the nature of relations with the local media and the prior arrangements to be made with host nations about the involvement of any accompanying spouses. </PARA>

The delegation from the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) which met in Guatemala on 11 to 16 April 1988, under the leadership of the Hon. Tom Uren, enjoyed a very good relationship and good fellowship, and there were absolutely no problems of any sort-unlike the situation to which Senator Michael Baume alluded. With no problems and no minority reports, I find it extraordinarily difficult to understand why it has taken from 11 to 16 April last year until 1 June this year to get a perfectly simple report before the Senate. But so be it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ninety-five countries were represented at the IPU, and there were 689 delegates. In addition to debates on peace and development and environmental issues, there was a general debate. This produced considerable hot discussion and much disagreement between the parties, and often tended to make the debate less than useful. I see the IPU as being a good organisation to broaden international understanding and cooperation, but I believe that these conferences could do a lot better. I said then, and I say now, that much more could be achieved if the effort and time were spent on areas of common concern and basic understanding and agreement, on which real progress could be made. Twelve months ago I suggested the greenhouse effect as one such issue. I have suggested it as a topic for submission and consideration subsequently. On matters like that, all countries are in complete agreement, and real progress could be made if they were discussed. Instead, we get onto matters which only bring hostility and disagreement between the parties. The IPU can be a much more useful organisation, and I urge that our delegates work towards those ends. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not be long. I would just like to add a few words about the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the Eighty-first Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. As was said, we met in Budapest at a most interesting time. It was a highly significant time politically. Unfortunately the leader of the delegation, Mr Tom Uren, was ill in Budapest for most of the conference. We were all very concerned because he was in bed for most of the time with very heavy flu. This put additional pressure on the deputy leader, Mr Roger Shipton, who attended all the early morning twelve-plus meetings and took over the leadership of the delegation very gracefully. I will read the very short thank you that the leader gave in his report:</PARA>
<PARA>I want to thank all the delegation members for their contribution at the conference and in particular Mr Roger Shipton, M.P., the deputy leader, for the assistance he was able to provide to both myself and the other delegates. </PARA>
<PARA>It did not really reflect the amount of work that Mr Shipton did as acting leader of the delegation for well over three-quarters of the time the delegation was away. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian delegation voted on two main issues in separate areas. First, there was a split in the delegation's vote on the Israeli motions. The Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia members voted one way and the Australian Labor Party members voted the other. This is not indicated in the report. I think it is necessary that that also be brought to the Senate's attention. The Labor Party consistently voted against the Israeli motions while the coalition voted in favour.</PARA>
<PARA> Again, the delegation split on the South African issue, with the Labor Party voting one way, again in line with Labor Party policy, and the coalition voting the other way. We voted the other way because we did not agree with the words `armed struggle'. We do not believe that these matters can be resolved through armed struggle and through the trade boycotts that were suggested. That is why the Liberal Party and the National Party voted in a different way to the Labor Party in those two instances. I have risen only to make those very short facts known to the Senate. They are important. Again, I would like to congratulate Mr Roger Shipton on the way he took over the leadership so gracefully at such short notice. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the reports. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the tabling statement in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade's Sub-committee on the South Pacific visited eight South Pacific countries in June 1988 as part of an inquiry into Australia's relations with the South Pacific. Although New Caledonia had been included in the original itinerary for this trip, it was deferred to a later date due to continuing troubles in the Territory. The Committee remained convinced, however, that it was important to visit New Caledonia and see first hand the situation almost twelve months after the signing of the Matignon Accords. Approval was sought and obtained for the visit by a working group from the Committee, which I had the pleasure of leading, and the visit took place 22 to 26 April 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The delegation's visit to New Caledonia, only three and a half days in length, was most useful in providing the participants with the chance to discuss and see first-hand political developments in the Territory. Observers of developments in New Caledonia were dismayed with the spiralling cycle of violence and civil disturbance apparent from 1984 onwards. Following the terrible violence on Ouvea, and the re-election of President Mitterand and appointment of Michel Rocard as Prime Minister in mid 1988, there was a major shift in French policy, and hope that the cycle of violence would be broken. The Matignon Accords, and the later Oudinot Accords provided a basis for some hope about the future of the Territory. Although fragile, they have so far provided a framework within which the various groups can work without the need to resort to violence. </PARA>
<PARA> Pockets of opposition to the Accords remain-and this was tragically brought home to the world with the assassination of Jean-Marie Tjibaou and Yeiwene Yeiwene. I, along with others, spoke in this place when news of this tragedy came through, and I am sure that everyone would deplore the deaths of two such great men. The people of New Caledonia, both Melanesian and French and the people of the South Pacific are poorer for their passing. </PARA>
<PARA>I will take this opportunity to express my thanks to the Foreign Minister Senator Evans for enabling Senator Robert Hill and myself to travel with him to New Caledonia for the funeral of Jean-Marie Tjibaou and Yeiwene Yeiwene. The funeral service was extremely moving and demonstrated the enormous support and affection in which both men where held by not only the Kanak population of New Caledonia but also the French community. I will always remember the very sad but moving atmosphere of the funeral. The ceremony at both the cathedral and at the airport demonstrated that the people of the South Pacific had been robbed of two outstanding leaders. The speech by the French Premier Rocard indicated that the French government and the French people had experienced an unmitigated tragedy. When Premier Rocard bowed at the feet of the two widows and made a traditional Kanak custom presentation this more than anything else demonstrated the extent of the loss of these two men to New Caledonia and the French nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Personally, with Senator Hill I had the opportunity the night before the funeral to visit the small chapel on the outskirts of Noumea where the bodies of the two leaders were held. Even at 2 o'clock in the morning the chapel was full of mourners and was surrounded by several hundred other Kanak mourners maintaining a vigil. The Kanaks asked both myself and Senator Hill to address them in the chapel. I found it, as I'm sure Senator Hill did too, a very emotional experience to speak to the people present, many with tears in their eyes, about the way we as Australians felt towards Jean-Marie Tjibaou and Yeiwene Yeiwene. I will always remember that particular event. </PARA>
<PARA> When the delegation left New Caledonia it was `cautiously optimistic' about the accords holding together. That optimism has now decreased significantly. The danger is that without the strong personal leadership of Jean-Marie Tjibaou and his support for the accords, they will come under increasing stress and may give way to the violence seen in the mid-1980's. </PARA>
<PARA> The delegation discussed a number of issues other than political developments during its visit, and these are dealt with in the report. Issues such as land ownership, trade, Australian assistance to the territory under the matignon accords and the economic future of New Caledonia were covered during the visit. There is also a section on the French University of the Pacific which the delegation was able to visit. </PARA>
<PARA> As we note in the report, the University has the potential to make significant cultural and educational contribution to the territory in the future. It is keen to establish contacts with other academic institutions in the region, and the delegation wholeheartedly supports such closer contacts. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, Mr President, it remains only for me to thank the other members of the delegation-Senator Robert Hill, Mr Gary Nehl, m.p. and Mr Phillip Ruddock, m.p.-for their hard work and participation in the delegation. On their behalf I would also like to thank the Australian Government for providing funds to enable the visit to proceed; officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for their assistance in providing briefings and suggestions on the itinerary; Australian Diplomatic Staff at the Australian Consulate-General in Noumea for their co-ordination of the visit and expert advice to the committee during its visit; and to French authorities in Noumea who facilitated and welcomed the visit. </PARA>
<PARA> We hope that this visit will be the first in an on-going exchange between Australia and New Caledonia as the territory moves towards deciding its future in 1998. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>Late in 1987 the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters received a reference from the then Minister for Home Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, to inquire into all aspects of the conduct of elections for the Parliament of the Commonwealth, including legislation governing the operation of the Australian Electoral Commission. The Committee's predecessor, the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform, has reported on previous elections. This report concerns the conduct of the 1987 Federal election and is the product of a committee representing both Houses of this Parliament and all shades of political opinion. The report contains over 50 recommendations which will bring about reform and improvement in Australia's electoral system. With the exception of the small number of recommendations referred to in the minority comments, the recommendations were unanimous. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to mention just briefly some of the Committee's recommendations. A number of submissions received expressed concern about electoral fraud, particularly the accuracy of the rolls and the possibility of cemetery voting, multiple voting and impersonation. The Committee did not receive any factual evidence to support these allegations of organised electoral fraud but, whilst no evidence to this effect was obtained, the Committee has suggested a number of ways to improve the accuracy of the rolls. Some members of the Committee have called for the introduction of locality voting, which would allow electors to cast ordinary votes at only one polling place in their electorate. Prior to 1984, when electors had to vote within their subdivision, voters who attended a polling booth within their electorate but outside their subdivision were forced to cast a declaration or absentee vote. In the view of the majority of the Committee locality voting would result in large numbers of electors having to cast declaration or absentee votes increasing congestion at booths and dissatisfaction and confusion amongst electors. </PARA>
<PARA> Another suggestion was that a computerised electoral roll be introduced to prevent multiple voting. This would require an on-line terminal at every table in every polling booth in every electorate and, in our view, would be prohibitively expensive. The Cundy inquiry calculated it would cost New South Wales more than $20m to introduce such a system. Given the seriousness of allegations of electoral fraud, the Committee has recommended a substantial increase in the penalties for electoral fraud. For example, the Committee recommends that for multiple voting impersonation the penalties set at $1,000 or six months imprisonment should be increased to $12,000 and/or two years maximum imprisonment. This hike in penalties reflects the fact that electoral penalties are well overdue for review. The recommendation will also put Australia in line with other countries which have much higher penalties for electoral fraud than we do here. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Commonwealth Electoral Act was amended in 1984 only Australian citizens have been eligible to nominate for election to the Commonwealth Parliament. British citizens enrolled before 1984 are eligible to vote but not eligible to nominate unless they become naturalised citizens. After being declared elected to the Senate in 1987, Mr Robert Wood was found to be in this category, although he believed he was an Australian citizen at the time of nominating. </PARA>
<PARA> To reduce the possibility of persons who are not Australian citizens nominating, the Committee has recommended that the Commonwealth Electoral Act be amended to require candidates to declare on their nomination form how they became Australian citizens-that is, by birth or naturalisation-and, if naturalised, where and when the ceremony took place. The Committee rejected a proposal to excuse aged voters from compulsory voting, as occurs in Victorian local government elections. The Committee believes that most elderly voters would take exception to the idea and supports the continuation of uniformity for Federal, State and local voting to minimise confusion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee received a submission suggesting that it was in the public interest that candidates be required to declare their political affiliations when nominating. To overcome the difficulty in determining which organisations are political, the Committee has recommended that candidates be required to declare their membership of any registered political party at the time of nominating. The Committee received from the Australian Electoral Commission a report on an audit of six divisions and was concerned at the considerable number of errors revealed in that audit. The Committee welcomes the decision of the Australian Electoral Commission to expand staff training and to conduct future audits using the strictest audit standards to ensure uniform electoral procedures are being followed throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, on behalf of the Committee, I wish to thank the secretary of the Committee, Trevor Rowe, and other members of the secretariat who have assisted in preparing this important report-Denise Denahy, Helen Missa and Lexia Noakes. I would also wish to draw the Senate's attention to the minority comments that are contained at the end of the report, expressing some views contrary to the majority report. As was said earlier, they are small in number, but important minority recommendations nevertheless. The minority report signed by me, Mr Michael Cobb and Dr Wooldridge recommends, firstly, the introduction of a system of locality voting and, secondly, that the three months provision, which was removed from the Act in 1987, be reinstated. We disagree with the majority of the Committee in not proceeding with these because of the widespread reports of concern in the community that the electoral system is subject to abuse and manipulation and, therefore, to inaccurate or rigged election results. We believe that any long term perceptions of this nature would inevitably erode the confidence the electorate has in our democratic parliamentary system. The implications of this, of course, are obvious and would be of profound significance and concern. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee is presently considering clause 5 of the Regulation of Video Material Bill, my private member's Bill, which will do two simple things: it will legislate to downgrade the violence in videos and it will abolish X-rated videos. Senator Jenkins's amendment to clause 5 of my Bill would totally destroy my Bill, because it would not only entrench X-rated videos for all time but would also liberalise quite dramatically the present guidelines, which prohibit the use of all types of extreme fetishes. Her amendment would result in allowing these extreme fetishes to be shown.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has said publicly that the matter of videos rests with the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) now that it has a government. I am afraid that is totally untrue. The Prime Minister is trying to duck for cover. The situation is that it is the Federal Government alone that has control over the Customs Act. As the evidence which was given to our Committee shows, it is the importation of these X-rated and extremely violent R-rated videos that is the problem. These types of videos are not made in Australia; they are imported from overseas. As I say, the only way that they can be stopped from entering the country is by this Government. The ACT has no control over the Customs Act. The Prime Minister is trying to muddy the waters in shifting the blame to the ACT for the fact that it is the only centre in Australia that is distributing these X-rated videos and extremely violent R-rated films. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jenkins has said that she is fully aware that her amendment does indeed destroy totally my Bill, and it is her desire to do so. I do not know how the rest of the Australian Democrats will be voting on this issue. I do not know how Senator Dunn and Senator Vallentine will be voting on this issue. I only hope that they will support my Bill. I only hope that people in this chamber realise that it is the legislators of this country who are responsible for the safety and protection of the people of Australia. We know beyond any shadow of doubt that violence has increased over the past 10 years. For instance, the incidence of severe assault has gone up 224 per cent and the incidence of rape has gone up 140 per cent. It is of no use our trying to make excuses for these figures or trying to make out that they really do not exist, as members of the Government have attempted to; they do exist. Women are concerned and do feel threatened. Every women's organisation throughout Australia has written saying that they want the Government to support my Bill. I now plead with the Government to allow its members to at least have a conscience vote. If it did that, then I am very confident that my Bill would be supported. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Democrats' amendment and clause 5 have been debated fully. I do not think there is anything left for anyone in the chamber to say. The clause has been debated for several days. I now plead with the Committee to support this particular clause, because it is this clause that is the crux of the whole Bill. </PARA>

At present that relates to X-rated and R-rated material. My amendments would also mean that promotional material relating to the current X-rated and R-rated videos would not be permitted to be displayed in public places where there may be people who are under 18 years of age.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am debating the first of my amendments, which takes away a total ban of X-rated and R-rated videos. I am explaining that one of the problems and one of the reasons people want a total ban is that they cannot always be sure of the content of the videos. I am referring to R-rated videos also in this regard. I have been corresponding with many groups that have written to me, as they have written to every other senator who is concerned about these matters. Today I received a letter from the Chairman of the Mothers Union in Australia. The letter states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I very much appreciate the correspondence we have had and I now have a clear understanding of your view of the subject of X rated videos. We are really not very far apart in our aspirations, and if you could achieve all that you have stated in your letter, we would be much less concerned about the video industry than we now are. </PARA>
<PARA>One concern I have, a concern that also has been expressed by other senators, relates to the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Of course one cannot catch AIDS from watching an X-rated video, but concern has been expressed that there might be some imitative behaviour. As honourable senators know, for some time now the video industry has voluntarily placed on its video material a graphic warning against AIDS-associated behaviour. On X-rated videos that warning is X-rated and on R-rated videos it is R-rated. I have been requested by the Mothers Union in Australia to bring forward amendments which would mean that those warnings would not continue to be on a voluntary basis. The Association wants those warnings included on a legislative basis. I have sought to have the amendments drafted, but they are not ready. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to comment on some remarks that were made earlier about a recommendation of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material-this was a majority decision-that a new category called non-violent erotica (NVE) should be instituted. The second recommendation, which was not in reality a majority decision because some of the committee members abstained from voting on it, was that the new NVE category contain material in the current X classification. Having listened to the debates we have had since the Committee's report was tabled, I am not sure that I agree with the second decision. Were we to institute a new category of NVE, just as we are trying to remove the top levels of the violent material, perhaps there should be some elements of the current X-rated material that we should also remove; in that way we would have NVE material which was clearly non-violent and labelled as such; any video marked with an X would be known to be an import from the United Kingdom or the United States of America and therefore definitely containing violent material. It would take away the confusion in the minds of the public. </PARA>
<PARA> Because such material would be available we would be able to do away with the possibility of criminal elements taking over the importation, hiring out and reproduction of this material, as it appears they have now done in Victoria, where X-rated videos are banned. This is a serious danger and it concerns me. This concern was expressed extremely well by Senator Macklin in his speech on the second reading debate. He explained what resulted when hard drugs were made illegal, which was done with the best of intentions. We have put the drug industry into the hands of the big criminals. There is a lot of money in it and many people fall by the wayside because they believe that they can make money out of the drug industry. Now there is a move for some of those hard drugs again to be legalised and tightly controlled. That is what I am advocating as far as non-violent erotic videos are concerned. We should be able to have control over them and not push supply underground, where the industry could fall into the hands of criminal elements. I know that is not an opinion with which everybody agrees, but I certainly believe we would be much better off if we were to do this. It is for that reason that I have moved this first amendment. I am very apprehensive that if we move a total ban on these materials now, we could be causing many more problems in the long run than we have at present. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Jenkins is saying that because people disobey the law regarding drugs, we should legalise them; that we should legalise heroin because, since it is illegal at present, people tend to share needles and therefore they are more likely to get acquired immune deficiency syndrome. There is therefore a push to legalise heroin. Because she is worried that these videos may go underground, she wants to legalise them. I can assure Senator Jenkins that when I was sitting on a committee which was looking into the legalisation of marijuana, every one of the witnesses who came before our committee to give evidence, including those who believed that marijuana ought to be legalised, said, `Of course, if you legalise it, then its use will be increased dramatically'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we keep these extremely violent and X-rated videos legal, this means the Government condones their use and people will use them. If they are illegal, a few will be sent underground-as are those videos that are already censored and illegal, such as those relating to child pornography. But the majority of the population will not do something illegal. The majority of the population will not go to criminal elements to try to get something illegal. The majority of the population abide by the law. It is wrong for Senator Jenkins to say that if we make something illegal, then the people will get it anyway-because generally people do not. Very few do; that will always be the case. The number of people who seek illegal child pornography is very small. Young people and adults do not go down to the shop next to the supermarket and get them. They know that they are illegal. Very few people will get videos from the illegal trade. The same thing would apply to some other videos. </PARA>
<PARA> We had so much evidence before our Committee which showed that the continual viewing of those videos desensitised people. As I have said in this place on so many occasions when debating the Bill, we are all well aware that when we see something that horrifies us and the next week we see something that is even worse, we are desensitised about that first view. This happens. It is natural; it is normal. I do not know how far Senator Jenkins is willing to go, bearing in mind the tremendous increase, as I have already stated, in cases of serious assault. There has been a 224 per cent increase in serious assault cases in 10 years. There has been a 140 per cent increase in rape. We have received evidence about that. As one of the legislators and one of the members of that Committee, I am not prepared to sit on a committee and be presented with all this evidence and then come into this place and say that they should be allowed legally in every shop and garage and all through the agents that are presently proliferating in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> We must, we are required and it is our obligation to do something about making Australia a safer place for our families. I do not understand why Senator Jenkins is not prepared to do that. I do not understand why the Government is not prepared to do that. I am quite sure that if Government senators opposite were given conscience votes, many of them would join this side of the chamber. I have been told by many of them that they would certainly do that. </PARA>
<PARA> I am anxious to put the matter to the vote and see just who is keen to vote for the security and safety of our families and who is willing to run the risk of continuing the problems shown up in the evidence given to our Committee, from the judges of the land and from the police and a crowd of others. As I have already said, every women's organisation throughout the country has written to the Government and pleaded with it to support my Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not participated in the committee stage debate on this Bill to date but I will do so now briefly. I did participate in the second reading debate when I brought to the attention of the Senate, as has Senator Walters, the fact that practically every women's organisation in this country is opposed to the exploitation and degradation of women through the pornographic video industry which operates out of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). As you would be aware, Madam Temporary Chairman, all the Attorneys-General of this country resolved that X-rated videos should be banned for that reason. The Attorneys-General in all States of Australia have so acted and banned the X-rated videos business from within their respective States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although the Federal Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) was of that opinion and wished to act accordingly within the Commonwealth jurisdiction, he was overruled by his Caucus and was unable to so act. The effect of that is that there is a pornographic video industry operating out of the ACT, which, through the postal capacities of this country, has tentacles extending over the whole of this Commonwealth. Canberra has become the pornographic video capital of Australia. That is the reason why Senator Walters brought this private member's Bill to the Parliament. We commend her for that. She is acting in response to not only the views of a very large number of Australians but also the views of every Attorney-General within the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> We are about to vote on the first amendment of the Australian Democrats. It is important that it be absolutely clear that the effect of that amendment is to destroy the purpose of Senator Walters's Bill. Senator Walters's Bill seeks to ban X-rated videos and certain other videos, including materials which depict detailed, relished or gratuitous acts of considerable violence or cruelty. The effect of the Democrats' amendment is to so change those definitions that the Bill, as amended, would no longer have that effect. The amendment would therefore emasculate Senator Walters's Bill. It would no longer be her Bill and no longer would achieve her objectives if the amendments were passed. Clearly, that is why we will be voting against the amendments. We trust that the Government will join with us and defeat the intention of the Australian Democrats in this regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise because I understand an arrangement has been made to report progress after the vote on this amendment is taken.

<PARA> The amendment moved by Senator Jenkins has, as its effect, the entrenchment of hard core pornography in the community and, therefore, I am opposed to the amendment. I was slightly heartened to hear Senator Jenkins say that she may well vote differently now in respect of the second recommendation in the report of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material. She now considers that some material at the outer end of X-rated clearly should not be classified. Frankly, I knew that all along.

<PARA> We, the majority of the Committee, strongly oppose that proposition . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the proposition that a new non-violent erotica, or NVE, category be proposed and that that contain material as defined in the current classification of X. I continue:</PARA>
<PARA> It would entrench X-rated video (pornography described officially as `hard core pornography' . . .) in the community under guise of the misleading title of NVE. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no need for me to go into what that material contains because that has been discussed in, I suppose, laundered terms in this chamber. Clearly, the material is of such a nature that, when an honourable senator tried to have incorporated in Hansard a description of some of the material, it was ruled that it could not be incorporated. Presumably it was unparliamentary. </PARA>
<PARA> Even if it cannot be presented here, it can be presented in newsagencies throughout the country. This type of material has been advertised as an insert in a newspaper that is circulated throughout the country. I have a copy of a document contained in a news- paper, which was bought in Tasmania by a senior lady constituent of mine. She is a racing fan and she bought the newspaper for the racing section. The insert fell out. She was disgusted, horrified and concerned that this sort of material could be advertised in a newspaper. It is disconcerting. I will not go into it. Clearly, it advertises material that, firstly, shows high risk AIDS behaviour and, secondly, promotes the view of women as being highly promiscuous and available. This problem has been described in the report of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material. </PARA>
<PARA> Thanks to every member of the Government, thanks to the Australian Democrats thus far, this material can be distributed throughout the country through the post. One of my subsequent amendments will ensure that this material cannot be distributed through the post or courier services. So that is non-discriminatory, which counteracts the argument adopted last time by people voting against the amendment. It is non-discriminatory in that it will affect postal services and other courier services. Contrary to what Senator Evans said on the last occasion about how we would get the postal services to look at every article that looks like a video, this is enforceable. I have never heard so much nonsense in all my life. Do not law enforcement agencies ever set traps? Is it legitimate for law enforcement agencies to set traps? Is it legitimate for law enforcement agencies to have somebody ask for this type of video and then to charge with an offence the very large firms with international connections in the United States that handle this material?</PARA>
<PARA> This is the import of the further amendments that I have. The further amendments that Senator Jenkins has will go some way in respect of the advertising material. I agree that there should be amendments which would go to ensuring that the very violent videos are not placed side by side with videos of PG or G classifications and that there is no advertising or display of the material in areas to which persons under the age of 18 years have access. That is a fairly reasonable proposal and it would be effective. It would go some of the way towards overcoming the problems that parents and others have in respect of this material. This material can get into the hands, and inevitably does get into the hands, of children. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very important debate. All clauses of the Bill ought to be considered. I acknowledge what Senator Walters has said, that is, that if the amendment moved by Senator Jenkins is carried, it will effectively gut the Bill. To my way of thinking, that is very disconcerting. It may well be that, at a particular stage, the other matters before the Committee at present should be considered on their merits to see whether half a cake is better than none at all. That is something which needs to be considered by all Opposition and Government members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw that word, Mr President. I find it incredible that Senator Tate is not courageous enough to come into this place and say that he agrees with my Bill rather than seek the alternative of being allocated a pair. To me it is quite inconceivable that this Government would throw Senator Georges out of the Party because he had the courage to cross the floor and vote against the Government on a matter of conscience. This Government threw Senator Georges out of the Party on that occasion because he was a courageous senator. On this occasion Senator Tate has sought a pair because he will not vote against my Bill. Therefore, he can go out into the electorate in Tasmania and claim that while he was the Minister who had responsibility for the area covered by my Bill he did not vote against it. Yet in the Caucus room the Government insisted that all Labor members should vote against my Bill. Many other senators would have liked to have voted for my Bill. Many senators have come to me privately and said that they have difficulties, yet they are forced to vote against their consciences. What reason can the Minister responsible for this area give for absenting himself from the chamber? How can that Minister get out of his responsibilities so easily?</PARA></TALK.START>

The Government rejected the written amendments. We then put to the Government orally that it could at least agree to 90 per cent underwriting for five years, even if it left the sunset clause in. We put it to the Government that it ought to allow the legislation to contain the provision that there be a grower chairman when the Minister himself has indicated that he will appoint a grower as the next chairman of the Board. That seemed to us to be very reasonable. All I can say to the Australian Labor Party is that it has an electorate out there, we have an electorate out there, and we believe that the Government has treated that electorate, the wheat growers of Australia, very poorly.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important that before the vote is taken we are clear what is happening, especially after Senator Lewis's comments. Apparently he is continuing to plead with the Government. I think that I should plead with Senator Lewis in equal futility. He knows very well that those compromise amendments which he has discussed with the Government would pass this place if they were put by the Opposition because they would be supported by the Democrats. However, he has chosen to do what Senator Macklin hoped this morning the Opposition would not do again, as it eventually did in 1985, and that is to cave in to blackmail which has come by way of a letter from the Minister to all senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendments which we are about to vote against could stand if the Opposition would stand by its amendments, as it has said publicly it would do. However, since it has chosen not to do that, the second option would be to put the alternative amendments which Senator Lewis has just talked about which would be supported by the Australian Democrats. We could have done that before lunch. Five hours ago we could have tossed those amendments back to the House of Representatives, which is still sitting, and confronted the Minister once more in the interests of the wheat growers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition has decided not to do that. The Democrats are disappointed that that is the case because we will not be able to have a successful vote on either the full range of amendments or, it seems, any alternative that ought to have been put forward today. We should not have to listen to a plea such as `The Government has a constituency out there and the Opposition has a constituency out there', as if it makes any difference. It is the Government and the Opposition together which are deregulating the domestic wheat market and along with it-this is the soft underbelly for the Government-the transport system. Let us make that quite clear before the vote is taken. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to detain the Committee because we have been through this issue almost exhaustively. The facts of the matter are, as stated by my colleague Senator Lewis, that the Bill having been brought back to this chamber yesterday, the Opposition, in good faith, has sought to give the Government a further period for consideration of the possibility of agreeing to the four amendments which Senator Lewis outlined yesterday. At that time I supported him in outlining them. The amendments concerned the guaranteed minimum price arrangements, the question of a grower chairman and the composition of the Board, the application of the Trade Practices Act to the intrastate trade in wheat, and the degree of grower control of funds contributed by levies on wheat growers-not government funds but funds contributed by levies on wheat growers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Ray, informed us-he did so because the Minister responsible was not present-a moment ago that this afternoon in the other place the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, gave the Government's answer by way of a response to a dorothy dix question, thereby compounding the series of discourtesies to this place of which the Minister has been guilty throughout his whole handling of this matter. That was merely another small element in the total shabby process on which the Government has embarked. </PARA>
<PARA> As my colleague Senator Lewis has said, the Government's principal activity in all this has been to divide the coalition parties. It will not succeed in doing so. The coalition parties will remain united for the overwhelmingly important purpose for which the people of this country want them to remain united, and that is to get rid of this Government, a task in which we propose to be successful as soon as the Government gives us the opportunity to do so. I will not pursue that point. I simply lay it very clearly on the line that that mine has been mined out as far as the Government is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday Senator Lewis, in good faith, gave the Government an opportunity to respond sensibly, and after consideration overnight, to his suggestions. The Government has told us today quite clearly that it proposes to say nothing other than to present us with two fingers on that matter and that basically, as far as the Government and Mr Kerin are concerned, the wheat growers of this country can go and jump. If that is the message which the Government wants to convey to wheat growers, we will do our best to assist it in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> In light of the diversionary remarks by the Democrat speaker who preceded me, I make it clear that at this stage the debate has nothing to do with deregulation of the wheat industry. As I said yesterday, the one comment with which I agreed in the threatening letter which Mr Kerin wrote to all honourable senators was that the deregulation debate was over. It was over at the time he wrote that letter; as he said quite rightly in that respect, two weeks earlier. For Senator Powell to yap away today about deregulation and matters of that kind is simply an illustration of how out of date and far behind the times the Democrats have become in this matter. The very idea of the Australian Democrats standing up in this place and presenting themselves as the champions of the wheat farmers of Australia is almost as bizarre as having the League of Rights stand up in that categorisation. There is a resemblance between the two groups in some respects. They are both always skirmishing around the fringes of whatever issue happens to be current at the time with a view to picking up a vote or two in their usual jackal-like manner. </PARA>
<PARA> I join with Senator Lewis in expressing disappointment-I will refrain from using stronger words than that-at the attitude which the Government has indicated it proposes to adopt to this legislation. That having been said, I propose to sit down so we can get on with the business of getting rid of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to say a couple of words on the non-acceptance of some very sensible amendments that were sent to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). I would have thought he would definitely agree to them, because they were full of commonsense and they would have improved this Bill. He threatened that if we did not pass it, he was going to let it lapse and make sure that the Australian wheat growers had neither an export market through the Australian Wheat Board nor a domestic market. The wheat growers of Australia have been hoodwinked by the Minister. I am very disappointed that he has not accepted those amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is important to put on the record at this stage that, quite apart from the amendments that we put forward, the Government had to bring in 39 amendments to its own legislation. That is a sign of a very badly drafted Bill. It shows that the Government was drafting a Bill for political purposes and with political motives in mind rather than in the interests of the industry and the nation. I believe Mr Kerin has now put himself right up the very sharp end of any deregulation in this country. He has asked the wheat growers to pay a supreme sacrifice without fixing up those few little things that would have helped make it not so bad. He says he wants to bring efficiencies into the domestic wheat market. I say to him, and to all the people of Australia, `Make sure that you now put it right up the ginger of the Australian Labor Party to bring forward the deficiencies of the labour market, the deficiencies of the waterfront and the deficiencies that this country of ours is burdened with at the moment'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the end of the last round of a long debate on the future of wheat marketing in Australia-a debate highlighted, in the coalition's view, by the Government's shabby treatment of Australia's wheat growers. I did not hear Mr Kerin in the House of Representatives today when he was answering a dorothy dixer, but I have in my hand a copy of an Australian Associated Press report about what he said. I want to deny his allegations. Apparently he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> the . . . new Leader of the Opposition has ratted on his mates who support deregulation and has returned to the days of Liberal toadying to the . . . National Party. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not read out the offensive words. I just say to the media, for what it is worth, that they have seen the vote tonight. There is no question of the Liberal Party or the National Party ratting on any decision of the former leader, Mr Howard, or on the decision of the coalition parties some time ago. I say this because the wheat industry and the effects of this Bill are so complicated that many people, including most of the media, do not understand them. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, especially as many of them did not want to understand. The Government kept talking about deregulation when deregulation was never at issue. The Government has exploited this in an attempt to put a wedge between the coalition partners, ignoring the legitimate grievances of the industry and its 46,000 participants. This legislation has been hailed as the Government's first piece-indeed, only piece-of micro-economic reform. It has been said that to vote against it would be to vote against deregulation. Unfortunately, the media have never been able to understand that none of the Opposition amendments have been against deregulation of the domestic wheat market, or even more complete deregulation of transport than that proposed by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To test the genuineness of the Government's desire for deregulation we moved an amendment to extend the use of the export power to allow greater labour flexibility and efficiency in the grain handling, transport and waterfront sectors. The Government failed the test by not even considering the proposal. This again reveals its double standards towards significant and comprehensive reform. All that we ever tried to do was improve the legislation. That would have cost the Government and the taxpayers nothing, but would have provided real value for the farmers of Australia. However, instead of looking at what is right for the wheat industry, the Government has played petty party politics, and that is something that the wheat growers of this country will not forget. Every Australian knows that this Government has made an absolute mess of the economy and that we need every dollar of export income that we can get. As the wheat industry earns more than $2 billion in export income each year, Australians will not be impressed by this Government's callous treatment of such an important industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Today the Government had only to decide on two relatively minor amendments which in no way would have altered the thrust of the legislation. The first would have provided a very reasonable 90 per cent underwriting guarantee for five years. The Government knows, and the Minister has said publicly, that that would not cost the Government any money. The second amendment would have provided for a grower chairman. In his second reading speech the Minister said that he would appoint a grower chairman, so we really were not asking for very much. The Government has refused these reasonable requests and will stand condemned for all time by Australia's 46,000 wheat growers. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there is a bright side for this industry. There is now a very clear choice for the grain growers of Australia. They can vote either for this disgraced Government, which does not care about their future, or for the coalition parties, which, on return to government, will amend this legislation to make provision for a 95 per cent underwriting guarantee; a wheat grower chairman; five of the panel-selected board members to be wheat growers; and a review of the Board's Australian trading operations to see whether trade practices exemption is required. Australian grain growers are so efficient that they are able to compete on world markets against the highly subsidised grain from the United States and the European Economic Community. The gross value of wheat this season is expected to be $2.77 billion, but this Government has completely disregarded the value of the industry as it has tried to score political points. The industry, and indeed the Australian taxpayer, should never forgive or forget this shabby treatment of such a major industry in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Opposition is disappointed that its amendments have not been accepted, it has forced the Government to make several major changes, including: the Wheat Board remaining the sole marketer of export wheat; consultation with grain growers about the use and management of their levy funds; more flexibility in how the Wheat Board pays its staff; legislation which will lower the cost of storage, handling and transport; protection for State marketing boards; and numerous technical amendments to improve the very badly drafted legislation. We will now wait and see whether the Government has the same political deregulation drive when it comes to the waterfront, coastal shipping labour practices, and the many other things keeping farmer costs high and making our primary products less competitive overseas. </PARA>

The Government has tried to play a very smart game but, as sometimes happens on these occasions, it has been too clever by half. Politically, the outcome of this will be that all wheat growers in this country, at the next election, will have the choice between electing parties that have agreed and undertaken, in their written coalition policies, to do the things that Senator Lewis has just told the Senate they intend to do and putting back into office the disgraced and failed Government that has brought them to the present pass by way of these Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the debate on this legislation was interrupted just before lunch I was making the point that superannuation conducted by private companies contributed substantially to the savings of this nation. We need savings more than we have ever needed them before because of the economic mismanagement of the Hawke Government. We have a colossal overseas debt. We are not generating sufficient funds within our country to keep economic growth going. Therefore, superannuation is vital to us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In that environment one would think that rather than imposing heavier taxes on superannuation, as this Government is now doing by this legislation, the Government would have been better off giving incentives to individuals to contribute to their welfare and retirement. That would seem to be the logical situation, but of course the Government has removed tax incentives for people, other than self-employed people, who want to contribute to their superannuation. In imposing a further tax on the income of superannuation funds and in other ways it has created a disincentive for people to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has adopted an entirely contradictory approach. It is inconsistent with its overall approach towards retirement planning, which it professed at an earlier stage, and quite obviously confuses the public as to its real intentions in retirement income policy. On the one hand, the Government says it wants to encourage people to take out superannuation but, on the other hand, it whacks three different kinds of taxes on superannuation: first, by this legislation, it imposes a tax on contributions made to the funds; secondly, it imposes a tax on investment earnings; and, thirdly, when one eventually takes the benefit out, there is a tax on it. Even if one takes the end benefit in the form of an annuity, no deduction is provided against taxable income for the cost, to a reasonable extent, of purchasing that annuity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government says that these legislative changes complete its review of superannuation tax arrangements. Of course, that is absolute nonsense. This is just the latest instalment. Since 1983, when this Government was first elected, there have been no fewer than 20 changes to retirement planning. In respect of superannuation and the way in which taxation applies to it, we have pre-1983 tax rules, we have post-1983 tax rules, we have pre-1985 tax rules, we have pre-1986 tax rules, we have pre-July 1988 tax rules and we have post-July 1988 tax rules. We have had one confusing policy change after another. Is it any wonder that the population is confused about what the Government intends? The industry itself is having enormous difficulty in comprehending the legislation. That industry is vital to our future in terms of stimulating savings for economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA> It has to be noted that there is still a long way to go. The Government has already said that it is conducting a review of both public sector and private sector superannuation arrangements in conjunction with the Cass review of retirement planning systems. The Government has not given us a definite time but we are led to believe that further changes may well come into play some time later this year. Again, there are more changes down the track. It makes a further mockery of what this Government has been saying about certainty in people being able to plan for their futures. </PARA>
<PARA> The main point that I wish to bring to the Senate's attention is that there are no genuine incentives for people to participate in superannuation schemes. The longstanding view of the community has been that superannuation funds need to be expanded in order to increase retirement income. The Cass report recommended that. So did the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. This legislation quite patently does not encourage private retirement income cover. Sure, it provides some tax incentive for the self-employed in that the deduction available to them has risen from some $1,500 to $3,000. But it does not provide any incentive to employed people where funds are provided by individual employers to contribute to their own retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely the way to encourage people to look after themselves in retirement would be to provide tax incentives. But the Government does not enter into that area at all. Instead, we have a gradual movement towards the privatisation of superannuation and imposing the cost on employers rather than encouraging a genuine partnership between employers and employees and the Government by tax incentives to share the future cost of superannuation. Surely, that ought to be the objective of the Government. It as much as admitted it when three or four years ago it introduced the 3 per cent productivity scheme. That indicated the direction the Government wanted superannuation to go but the Government failed to go further and encourage employees to contribute to those schemes by allowing them tax deductions for those contributions. If the Government were interested in the future of superannuation then it would move down that track, but it has failed to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> This legislation only rearranges the existing tax concessions; it does not increase the incentive for tax savings so as to encourage people to fund their own retirement income schemes. Yet that is what the Government claims it was on about in the first place. A total confusion of objectives has existed since 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that the Government had an opportunity to increase incentives but it did not do a thing about it. In fact, it is saying no to the further encouragement of self-funding. Obviously, it is jeopardising the future of these kinds of schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> To further demonstrate the point, if we look at the case of lower income earners we see that the equivalent of the combination of these three taxes which are now being applied to superannuation is to apply a marginal rate of 29 per cent tax to those amounts. That means that there is a disincentive for low income earners-those who are earning less than, say, $20,000 a year or thereabouts-because their marginal income tax rate is 29 per cent or less, to put their money into superannuation. If they do put it into superannuation they will be incurring a higher rate of tax than they would on their other income. Surely that kind of nonsense is what the Government ought to be seeking to redress. Its failure to do so, of course, has left its retirement income policy in an absolute shambles. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to some of those who are losers in this Government's taxation scheme. There are literally hundreds of thousands of them. The Treasurer, Mr Keating, in his address last year promised that there would be not one cent of superannuation lost for any member of superannuation funds. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As it has turned out, we know that we cannot trust that. There are a number of areas where this has happened. The fact is that benefits will be lost by members of funds as a result of these new taxation measures, notwithstanding the Government's promises. Amongst other assurances, Mr Keating said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>For most superannuation funds this will mean in practice no tax at all on investment earnings. For others the rate will be minimal, and can readily be adjusted to zero by including more Australian company shares in their investment portfolios. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is to take advantage of the dividend imputation scheme. It is an impossibility to accommodate all the funds that are flowing through the superannuation system in the stock markets so as to take advantage of that facility. It is just not on. While the Government continues to perpetrate that little fib, of course, we will not get a proper debate about the form of this legislation. It is a nonsense, absolute codswallop. There will be a significant number of losers. Senator Haines has already drawn our attention to those who will be putting their money into approved deposit funds. Those who put their accumulated retirement savings in a so-called roll-over facility which has no investment in shares but rather in fixed interest will find that they have to pay 15 per cent tax. They are obviously going to be losers whereas previously they would not have been. </PARA>
<PARA> Consider the case of new members entering superannuation schemes who are, one might say, on the younger side of their careers, maybe around 30 years of age. For young people who are just commencing to participate in superannuation, the cumulative effect of the earnings tax on superannuation funds over a working lifetime will be substantial. For a 30-year-old, the loss at age 65 in a non-contributory superannuation scheme will be something like 6.5 per cent of the total sum. That means $6,500 out of $100,000. If one can project one's thinking ahead, at current rates of inflation and with what future rates may be, $100,000 in 40 years is going to be a very small amount of money. One can expect losses to be far greater than that when inflation is taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at those people who have substantial prior service before 1 July 1988, they will also be net losers as a result of the new tax. This is despite the fact that, in the legislation, there is a no detriment clause to contain that situation. People in that category will include mostly those who have gained the benefit through the 3 per cent productivity contribution scheme and have invested their money in union/industry investment and superannuation schemes. Generally, they have followed a capital guaranteed approach to investments. These are the unionists, the low income earners, presumably, the blue-collar workers, the very people whom Hawke and Keating are supposed to represent; yet they are the ones who will lose most as a result of this package. Where is the sense in all this? We should be moving in the opposite direction of improving the incentives for people to invest in their own superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that this legislation contains a number of technical difficulties, and many of those difficulties have been brought out already by my colleagues and the Australian Democrats during the debate. No doubt there will be further debate on those matters when we come to the committee stage. However, the number of matters which have been raised so far deserve the most thorough examination by the Government in the course of this debate. I notice that we have very few speakers from the Government side prepared to come in here and defend the Government's taxation regime. Maybe that speaks volumes for how much they feel about it in the light of representations that have come to them from ordinary folk. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to highlight very briefly the Opposition's commitment to vote against the new tax in respect of investment income. That is obviously the most pernicious in that it will tend to reduce substantially the accumulated amount in superannuation funds over the career of a member of the fund. I believe that will probably cost a relatively small amount of money, although the Government is unable or unwilling to tell us how much it might be. I would suggest that it is probably less than $100m across the whole community. It is surprising, though, that the Government is totally unable to give us an estimate of what that might be. In fact, the original statements by the Treasurer gave us no indication whatsoever of the breakdown of the cost between the tax on contributions to superannuation funds and the cost of tax on investment income. That is a hopeless situation for any government to be in and really does show just how intelligent its decision-making processes are. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing the Opposition will be doing which I strongly support is moving to raise the lump sum tax threshold below which tax is not payable from $60,000 to $125,000. That is obviously a sensible move. The current level of $60,000 makes the point that there should be an exemption for some amount of money from a lump sum to be invested in order to generate income, and that ought to equate roughly to a reasonable standard of living. Certainly $60,000 does not do that; $125,000 is far nearer to the total amount of money that would need to be invested in order to generate an income equating with the age pension. That is certainly to be welcomed and something that this Government ought to consider favour- ably. We hope we have its support on that amendment.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I believe that there is a substantial matter that ought to be examined carefully by the Government affecting, in general terms, life companies; that is, a new regime for the taxing of life insurance companies. Obviously there are numerous anomalies here which are very difficult and technical matters. I believe the Government is examining those questions. I hope it will continue to conduct a favourable debate with the life insurance industry to gain a far more equitable approach to that which is currently in vogue so as to more carefully align the tax deductability of expenses incurred by life companies with those which are actually incurred in running the business to which they are committed. That matter needs examination. I hope that the Government is prepared to give it that in the most generous way. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of us on the Opposition benches have misgivings about this legislation. We shall be moving substantial amendments and opposing the vital area of tax on investment income. </PARA>

<PARA> Some industry observers have described the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) as a minefield. Others have described it as a maze-once you are in it is very difficult to find a path out. It is a very strange piece of legislation. It gives unusually wide powers to the Commissioner of Taxation and to the Commissioner of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC). In fact, it spells out draconian requirements for all funds which are so great that it will mean the demise of many small superannuation funds around Australia. But the big winners, as in all cases with this Government, will be the big life assurance companies-not the small funds-and those superannuation funds and roll-over funds, et cetera, associated with the major banks. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of legislation previously passed in this place, the cost burden of superannuation funds and the like is often disproportionate to the income earned. This is one of the sad features about occupational superannuation and in the package before us today. It does not recognise the balance between the revenue and costs. For example, only last week I heard of a closed fund which had an income of $3,000 per annum and an administrative cost of $6,000. Not all funds are geared to have high revenues, but these sorts of funds will be in significant trouble when this package of legislation is passed, as will the small funds. Inevitably, there will be a movement towards what is termed pooled funds because of all the complications that will arise from this and earlier legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The timing of this legislation is simply appalling, because it comes more than 10 months after the Treasurer's press release, and it requires action to be taken by these funds before 30 June in order to get an adequate tax deductability. It does not give them much time, does it? In November last year the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) was introduced. By leaving it on the table, at least it provided some relief and an opportunity for what I would call a limited amount of consultation. But what we have before us today is the worst form of legislation by press release, because there is virtually no opportunity for us to delay its implementation. It would be desirable for its provisions to take effect not from 1 July this year but from 1 July next year. Many life offices have taken action and have transferred moneys on the basis of the press release and not of the legislation. If we decided to delay this legislation beyond 1 July 1989, it would cause acute problems. It would cause embarrassment for all those who had acted in good faith on the basis of a press release. We need a commitment from the Government that legislation will follow within less than three months of a press release, because these burdens are quite intolerable and unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, there is the problem of getting all the approvals and rulings from the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. The burdens that are being placed on the trustees of funds are quite abnormal and unreasonable; yet most of these requirements have to be met before 30 June. I say to the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh), who is in the chamber, that this cannot be done. First, the life officer has to consult the industry before he can get his regulations. There are requirements for notifications to recipients to be in a form approved by the Commission; yet naturally, we have not even got the approved form. Why not? It is because we do not have the regulations. The regulations should have been issued prior to or at the time these Bills were being debated. It is quite unfair to participants. So, we do not have the approved form, we do not have the regulations, and we do not have the signatures on these forms, and the forms have not been submitted for approval.</PARA>
<PARA> I now wish to comment on some curious drafting-and there is plenty of it. For example, let us take clause 275 of the Bill. This clause requires different things to be done on the last two days of receiving income. Let me turn to another example. The greatest criticism surely must be the Bill's impact on savings. It is an appropriate time to debate the impact of superannuation legislation on savings. This Bill will lessen the interest in superannuation as an investment option. Fancy a government, when it is trying to cool the economy, when it is trying to lift people's propensity to save, and when we hear stories about the need to have special legislation to lessen the impact of taxation on personal savings, deliberately putting before us a measure which will lessen the right and opportunity to save and take away some options for people to save! It is incredible. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that one of Australia's problems is that it has a relatively low level of savings, it is indeed strange that this Government should be putting before this Parliament, at this very time, legislation to positively discriminate against and to discourage savings, particularly so when one adds to this the second dimension-the fact that we have an ageing population whose future retirement benefits have largely been unfunded over the productive working life of the retirees. This Bill effectively discriminates against individual savings, particularly for the self-funded retirement-in particular at the level just around or below average weekly earnings. To give the Senate an example, the tax impost could be about 40 per cent on fund earnings against a lower marginal personal rate based on the earnings of the individual of less than 29 per cent. What is the incentive there? In another area the Government is telling us to try to move into superannuation. It has been built into awards. It would be far better for many of those employees to pay off their high mortgages rather than move into an area where they are now maximising their taxes as a result of being forced into superannuation where there is a higher rate of tax on the fund and on those superannuation earnings than on their personal earnings week by week. This Government has a strange level of priorities. No wonder it is being coined as a party of the rich and famous. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at another dilemma that we have. This time the dilemma relates to opposition to the Bills. We have found that the industry is not united. Some sections want amendments, others want delays. At another extreme we have a section of the industry that wants us to vote against the whole package of Bills because it thinks they are not good enough. The only thing that is certain is that the passage of this tax Bill relating to superannuation will benefit the large life offices, the actuaries and the accountants. One cynic has gone as far as saying that if Australia needs a recovery, this Bill is going to help-but in a narrow and restrictive sense because it will be an actuary led recovery, with the accountants not far behind. Why do I say this? It is because of the greatly enhanced role and responsibilities for approved actuaries. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is yet another in a whole host of legislative changes that have occurred in relation to superannuation since this Government came to office. There have been over 20 major changes in this general area. What does the Treasurer say in support of this legislation? Strangely, he is reported as saying that these changes will be implemented without diminishing any personal end benefit by one cent. He must have regretted making that commitment because it is only true in a very narrow and restricted sense. In order to make it true in that very narrow and restricted sense he had to introduce horrific legislation. In other words, to honour that commitment in any way at all, and then only in a very narrow manner, he had to introduce cumbersome procedures that are going to add hundreds of thousands of dollars to the administration of those funds. Those procedures will be so complicated in some areas that it will be necessary to set up funds within funds in order to give legislative effect to that commitment that was not thought through by the Treasurer. It is only going to operate in one area. Most people are going to be very much worse off. These complications and cumbersome legislative requirements could have been simplified by lifting the threshold and taxing the excess at 15 per cent. Instead, the Government has opted for an increased workload for fund trustees, administrators and fund managers. The administrative complexities that can be expected raise a number of questions as to whether it is even worth persisting with superannuation at all, particularly for small employer-sponsored superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an appropriate time to remind the Senate that the Treasurer has often said that tax reform will lead to simplified income tax laws. This has not been true. Tax reform has been associated with some of the most complex legislation that has ever been introduced into this Parliament. If the Treasurer insists on pursuing this notion of tax reform with so-called simplicity then it is about time we stopped this so-called reform. If honourable senators do not think that this is complicated and involves issues that counter and contradict each other, perhaps they should look at some of the anti-deterrent provisions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> A further problem facing the funds is the lack of regulations from the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. There is a responsibility for the Commission to approve past funding credits but the regulations that I mentioned before have not been drafted to enable such action to take place. The funds could be penalised because-as I have said previously-the operative date is 1 July 1989 and there may not be adequate time for the regulations and all the approvals to be put in place. It is just not good enough. The regulations have not been drafted. You might recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, that we had the same problem with occupational superannuation. The Government only just finished drafting the first stage. It had problems with the last Bill two or three years ago and it is now looking at stage two for further regulations in that particular area. How long are we going to have to wait for adequate regulations to be drafted in relation to the superannuation tax Bill which is before us today?</PARA>
<PARA> There are also problems for the actuaries themselves. After all, the actuaries are the people who are going to benefit most because of their enhanced role and responsibility. There is at least one requirement for an actuarial calculation to be based on last year's result. One does not have to be an actuary to know of the potential for wide fluctuations in the investment portfolio from year to year in superannuation funds. A prudent actuary will actually calculate his figures over a longer time frame, yet the legislation prohibits this. It prohibits a cautious and prudent approach that a normal actuary acting with care and consideration would take. There is a legislative requirement that prohibits the prudent approach; he must calculate his figures purely on the basis of what happened last year. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a doubt about the definition of an actuary. It is simple for those who are members of the Institute of Actuaries but when one moves to provincial areas the problem becomes significant. If one walks into a bank building and sees the name `accountant' on the door, that does not signify that he has any particular qualifications. The Australian Taxation Office and the ISC should have been able to come up with one common return. In other words, there are responsibilities for the Tax Office and for the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. One would have thought that the Government would have been able to come up with one form, maybe with addenda, to meet the requirements of the Tax Office and the Superannuation Commission. But that is too hard. The Government wants to put the responsibility, the extra work, back onto the trustees and the administrators. It could not even come up with one form. Under the provisions we are told that there will be one common instruction book. That is great. At least it is a first step. But, separate forms for the Australian Taxation Office and the ISC will be required. That is just not good enough for a government that is putting more and more responsibilities onto individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me run through the main features of this package. There is a 15 per cent tax on employer contributions to public and private sector superannuation funds. So what initially goes into a fund will not be 100 per cent of the employer's and the employee's contributions, because the employer's contribution will be diminished by 15 per cent. Only 85 per cent of the capital will go in in the first place. There is also this iniquitous 15 per cent tax on superannuation fund income. As my colleague Senator Messner mentioned earlier, this will force more and more funds into investing in fully franked dividends in order to minimise the tax payable. Probably no prudent trustee-manager would put more than say 30 per cent of his funds into such areas, because caution is needed: there must be a spread of the investment risk. There is also a 16.25 per cent tax, which includes the Medicare levy, on sums over $60,000, thereby reducing the previous post-1983 lump sum tax by 15 per cent. This is one of the few small carrots, I suppose. There is also a capital gains tax on assets bought and sold by superannuation funds after 1 July 1988. Of course, this provision is designed to avoid retrospectivity. </PARA>
<PARA> I now wish to summarise briefly the effect that these changes will have on different types of funds. Before moving to that, I mention that two basic types of funds are provided for: there is a complying fund and a non-complying fund-and there are severe tax disincentives associated with non-complying funds. Basically, a complying fund is one that has received a notice of compliance within the umbrella of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Acts. There will be a 15 per cent tax on complying funds and roll-over annuities. Non-complying funds holding superannuation policies will be taxed at the top marginal rate, and normal life insurance business, including accident and disability cover, will be taxed at 39 per cent. That is the situation for life insurance companies. </PARA>
<PARA> Non-statutory fund business will be taxed at 39 per cent. The taxation basis for registered organisations will consist of three categories: firstly, businesses associated with complying superannuation funds or roll-over annuities are to be taxed at 15 per cent. Secondly, business associated with policies held by non-complying superannuation funds will be taxed at the top marginal rate. Thirdly, business referable to life insurance as well as accident and disability insurance will be taxed at 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of pension fund assets we find further unnecessary complications. This area is becoming increasingly important as more people opt for pensions rather than lump sum payments. Under this legislation, assets backing current pension payments will be treated differently, and investment income from these particular assets will not be subject to taxation at 15 per cent. From the second reading speech, I understand that the Government has two means of handling such situations. Firstly, one separates out those assets backing pensions in course of payment and separately accounts for them; or, alternatively, one exempts a proportion of income linked to pension liabilities in a complying fund. That is all very complicated, and it requires additional administrative effort and care. </PARA>
<PARA> Next there are the difficulties with the pension rebate. There will be three basic steps to calculate tax rebates on pension benefits: firstly, determining the taxable portion of the pension; secondly, determining that part of the taxable pension relating to fund membership after 30 June 1983, of all dates; and, thirdly, calculating the rebate as a percentage of the post-July 1983 portion of taxable pension. It is indeed a complicated business. How can we expect the small funds to keep up with all the legislative requirements and the separation of investments and income on this basis? Where a pension commences before the age of 55 because of death or disablement, the rebate applies. There are no other circumstances where a rebate is applicable to pensions commencing prior to age 55-not even after a person has reached 55. </PARA>
<PARA> There are further complications with the transfer to roll-over funds. We all know that lump sum benefits can be rolled over into approved deposit funds or deferred annuity funds, thereby deferring the tax payable. However, later withdrawals from such funds are taxed in a manner similar to that applying to superannuation fund payments. So the package of amending tax Bills which we are considering in this cognate debate will include the changes to the concessional application of capital gains tax to superannuation funds, approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation funds. It includes also the reduction in the scales of tax on the retirement benefits paid from taxed funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Because my time is fairly limited, I must skip some of the more complicated features in order to highlight for the Senate some of the major problems associated with these funds. Before doing so, I must refer to what we term the `special income' category, which applies in respect of certain excluded private company dividends and non-arm's length transactions. This special income will be taxed at 49 per cent after allowance for deductions exclusively related or appropriately related to such income. While generally the taxable income of these funds will be determined in the same manner as for other taxpayers, there will be some differences in the treatment of funds' assessable income and allowable deductions. I would like to quote the words of Mr Robert Brown, who wrote in the Chartered Accountant of February this year. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The new superannuation laws are unnecessarily complex-</PARA>
<PARA>the emphasis is on the word `unnecessarily'-</PARA>
<PARA>and appear to have as their aim the raising of further revenue for the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>That is true. So, as I mentioned earlier, this legislation clearly should be seen as an impediment to saving and a disincentive for people to invest in superannuation. Above all, this legislation is a revenue raising exercise. It has little to do with principles and a lot more to do with income for the Government. Unfortunately, the consequence of all this will be that many people will be turned off superannuation altogether-a result which the Government can ill afford. </PARA>
<PARA> As we debate this legislation, we know that already some unintended consequences have come to light. Why will the Government not fix them up now rather than correct them down the track in two or three years time? One of the great difficulties-and we, as the Opposition, seek to rectify this-is that the income of a superannuation fund will be reduced, through the tax on employer contributions, to a greater extent than expected by the Government. Most superannuation funds will find it almost impossible to offset the 15 per cent tax on fund earnings as the Government claims they can. I think the Government has been blinded by its own rhetoric. It has been advised of the problems by the industry, and yet there is no substantial change. </PARA>
<PARA> Serious unintended market distortions may be caused by the new emphasis which superannuation funds will have to give to equity investments in domestic shares which will return fully franked imputed tax credits on dividend income. This tends to push people into the highly speculative stock market at a time when perhaps people should be investing in other areas. At this time it would be far better for people in receipt of average weekly earnings or just below that level to be paying off their mortgages, the interest rates for which are at disastrous levels, and reducing their interest component rather than moving into superannuation. These Bills are an absolute disaster. They are full of unintended consequences and will be a nightmare to administer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating cognately a package of taxation Bills which give effect to a number of proposals announced in the May 1988 economic statement and the 12 April 1989 economic statement. With the indulgence of the Senate I will address my remarks first to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Rebates) Bill 1989, which reduces personal income tax in two stages commencing on 1 July 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I welcome the tax cuts announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the 12 April statement. I am sure everybody welcomes them. I particularly welcome the measures to assist families and help the elderly. There is no doubt that these tax cuts are long overdue. However, having said that, I have some difficulty following the logic of the explanation for the integrity of the tax cuts, having looked at the overall economic strategy that has been presented to us by the Government. On the one hand, we have high interest rates designed to slow down domestic consumer demand and, on the other hand, we have significant tax breaks which under normal circumstances can be assumed to do nothing less than considerably stimulate that consumer demand. I make no mention of the productivity pay-out; it is nothing more than a further wage adjustment of a uniform nature. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Keating's theory, if I understand it correctly, is that the tax rates fall into a gap or a trough which will be brought about as a result of his Budget setting predictions. Of course, the truth is that without exception those predictions have been wrong. The Budget predicted that gross domestic product (GDP) growth would be 3.5 per cent; it is now 4.7 per cent. Average earnings were expected to be 6.5 per cent, according to the Budget, and they now look like being 7.3 per cent. Import volumes were expected to be 9.5 per cent, while the figure is now 28.2 per cent. Employment growth was predicted to be 2.75 per cent; it is now 4 per cent. It would seem that inflation is considerably ahead of the projections given to us by the Government. By any measure, on those calculations there is a conflict in logic between the tight monetary policy, the high interest rate policy of the Government, and the fact that it is providing tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that the tax cuts will in many respects do very little to alleviate the deplorable financial burden faced by the vast majority of Australians who have suffered at the hands of this Government's increased taxation. It has increased taxation consistently since it came to office in 1983. Perhaps it is worth reminding ourselves of the major tax initiatives which this Government has taken since 1983. I do not raise them because they are intrinsically wrong; I raise them because they are part of the record of this Government's tax policy. We saw the introduction of lump sum superannuation payments from 1 July 1983, which raised $300m in revenue in its first year of operation. We saw the introduction of the Medicare levy on 1 February 1984, which in its first year of operation provided the Government with $1,054m in revenue. As a result of that measure, the number of people in private funds has fallen, if my memory serves me correctly, from 70 per cent to the current figure of 45 per cent. We saw the abolition of negative gearing on 1 July 1985; that went through until 1 June 1987, when the Government realised that there was a dramatic downturn in the amount of rental accommodation available. During that period of aberration the measure raised the Government $50m in revenue. We saw the application of tax-free threshold restrictions, which added $85m in revenue. A capital gains tax was introduced on 20 September 1985. In the 1987-88 financial year it returned to the Government $89.7m. As from 1 July 1986 we saw the application of a fringe benefits tax, which for the 1986-87 period provided $535m in revenue and $881m in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> As from 20 September 1985, deductability for entertainment expenses was abolished and the revenue gain for 1986-87 was $330m. The foreign tax credits system, which applied from the 1987-88 financial year, has earned the Government $60m in revenue. The deductability of accelerated depreciation rates was abolished from 25 May 1988. It is estimated that that measure has produced a revenue gain of $190m. As from 1 January 1991 we will have the abolition of income tax exemption for the gold mining industry. On the Government's figures, it is predicted to provide an annual revenue of $70m. My judgment is that, given the present price of gold, the value of the Australia dollar and the disincentive that has created for the industry, that revenue figure is pitched far too high. This series of Bills contains a proposal to tax superannuation funds at the rate of 15 per cent. The Government calculates that it will raise approximately $980m in  1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate of a commitment that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made by way of a taxation policy statement on 31 October 1984 when he set out nine fundamental principles which would dictate the direction the Government would take in respect of its taxation policy. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>There must be no increase in the overall tax burden as measured by the share of Commonwealth Government tax revenue in gross domestic product next year or through the Government's next term in office. </PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government's tax to GDP ratio has risen every year since then: in 1985-86 it was 25 per cent, it rose to 25.7 per cent in 1987-88, and today the figure is 27.3 per cent. Another Government pledge was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Any reform must continue the process already begun by this Government and provide further cuts in personal income tax. </PARA>
<PARA>The truth is that these taxes in many respects are not for real in the context of the level of taxation paid by people since that date. Until this year we have seen an increase in the share of personal income tax within the total Commonwealth tax revenue from 55.5 per cent to 57.7 per cent in 1988. It is not without significance, of course, to note that much of the Government's estimated Budget surplus of $5,600m for this financial year is expected to come from increases in revenue as a result of increasing levels of taxation. Pay as you earn (PAYE) tax collections to the end of March were 18.2 per cent higher than collections in the first nine months of 1987-88. I understand that a new figure out inflates that 18.2 per cent figure. That should be contrasted with what occurred during the last financial year of the Fraser Government, when 17.45 per cent of average weekly earnings went into personal income tax. Under Hawke, that level rose to a height of 20.85 per cent in  1988-89. Even after the tax cuts in the coming financial year, that percentage will still be 18.6 per cent, rising by 1991-92 to 20.56 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that Senator Walsh admitted last year that in two previous financial years $3 billion of revenue had been collected by the Government as a result of bracket creep. Since the Government's last notional tax cut, $10 billion of additional revenue has flowed into the Government's coffers, and from that it has discharged the minute amount of $4.7 billion. In other words, slightly less than half the revenue received by way of taxation is being redistributed back. With the Senate's indulgence I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a document prepared for me by the Parliamentary Library which shows the number of people who have moved into different brackets over the last three years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. While an additional 2 1/2 million people in the $20,801 to $35,000 salary range will benefit from a 1c drop in their marginal tax rate in 1989-90, the following year 515,600 people will move upwards into a tax bracket where they will face an additional 8c in the dollar rise, and 316,300 new people will move into the $20,601 to $35,000 bracket. They will be faced with a punishing 10c rise in their marginal tax rate. So it is no wonder that there is out there a growing constituency of disaffected workers as they see their real take home pay not only being dissipated but also transferring itself into the Government's Consolidated Revenue. Of course, bracket creep hits hardest at ordinary Australians as their tax payments increase by much more than the rate of inflation and their after tax income falls in real terms. Naturally, as we know, bracket creep helps to produce lower living standards, higher inflation and more unemployment than would otherwise necessarily apply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The latest tax cuts affect not only those on lower incomes but also those on higher incomes. The top earners-those who are in the top bracket-constitute 8.2 per cent of the total number of taxpayers. In 1986-87 they contributed $11.1 billion in tax, representing 31.6 per cent of total individual taxes paid that year. Taking into account the effects of bracket creep, it is more than likely that 11 per cent of all taxpayers will be in the top bracket by the end of this financial year. More than three-quarters of a million people will be paying a higher marginal tax rate than will Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd and other major companies. </PARA>
<PARA> High marginal tax rates are affecting an increasing proportion of the work force. Over one million taxpayers will pay 52.5 per cent in tax in 1989-90. Unless action is taken the number will rise by 200,000 per year. Half the taxpayers already pay the marginal tax rate of 40 per cent and the number rises by 5 per cent of taxpayers each year. It is not only the very rich who are affected by high marginal tax rates-more than half of all taxpayers are affected. </PARA>
<PARA> The tragedy is that the tax cuts do not help to the extent that they appear to help. Under this Government there has been an enormous increase in taxation levels. This year its tax income is expected to rise by 9.9 per cent. Income tax collection from individuals is expected to rise by 13.6 per cent. I am certain that those projections are far too low, because the Government underestimated inflation levels and economic growth. Growth in GDP was anticipated to be 3.5 per cent, but it is now 5.4 per cent. Growth in average weekly earnings was expected to be 5.5 per cent but, in fact, it is closer to 7 per cent. The consumer price index was set at 4.5 per cent and at the end of 1988-89 it had reached 7 per cent. As I have said, there has been a significant increase in PAYE tax collections since the Government has been in office. In nominal terms there has been an increase of 87 per cent and in current terms an increase of 23 per cent. The gross increase in PAYE taxation since Labor has been in office is $16.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> When we contrast the levels of the tax cuts and the effects on the average Australian of housing interest rates, we see clearly that they do not provide a benefit. Let me give as an example the 16 per cent interest rate which we experienced some little time ago. As a result of the rate rising to 17 per cent, the average New South Wales mortgagor with a mortgage of $84,000 will pay over $270 a week in home loan repayments, representing an increase of $40 a week so far this year. If interest rates rise to 18 per cent later this year, as predicted, the repayment will be about $300 a week, representing a total rise of $70 a week since last June. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent home buyers who took out a loan at a lower interest rate either face a huge increase in their repayments or are required to extend the term of their loan to the point where they will never quite own their own home. A person with a $100,000 mortgage taken out at 13.5 per cent would pay $1,125 a month on the interest component alone. That would be well covered by the repayment of $1,166 a month. At 16 per cent the interest only cost rises to more than $1,330 a month, or about $160 a month more than the monthly repayment. So at the end of the year that person will have paid $14,000 in repayments but he will be $2,000 further behind. So the person who took out the loan at 13.5 per cent will move further away from owning his own home. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider the benefits that the weekly tax cuts and the family package will provide. A person on a single income of $35,000 with two children will receive a tax break of $25.65 a week. If that family has a mortgage of $40,000, the weekly repayment on that mortgage will increase by $25.15 as a result of the increase in interest rates from 13.5 per cent to 17 per cent. So the ordinary, average Australian person will receive a benefit of 50c a week as a result of the Government's indulgence in providing tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to a couple of other matters. Firstly, the legislation proposes major measures relating to the taxation of superannuation. It will impose a 15 per cent tax on employer contributions to public and private sector superannuation funds, a further 15 per cent tax on superannuation fund income, and a 16.25 per cent tax, which includes the Medicare levy, on lump sums of over $60,000. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the 15 per cent tax on fund income which I specifically seek to oppose, in view of its effect as a disincentive for people to enter into superannuation arrangements and thus provide for their own retirement. One of the great difficulties that the community as a whole is confronted with in relation to government retirement benefits and benefits generally is equity. Inevitably we have income tests for government paid pensions. But at the end of the day there is something to be argued for examining very carefully the gross income that a person has received over a number of years as distinct from his savings and income at that time, because there is no incentive to save.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The impact of the proposed amendments will be to reduce further the attractiveness of superannuation as an investment option. According to the superannuation funds, many of the thousands of Australians who recently joined superannuation funds will lose up to 10 per cent of their expected benefit. This is despite Mr Keating's claim in the May 1988 statement that the measures introduced would not reduce end benefits. The tragedy is that, at the very time when the Government should be doing everything in its power to encourage savings, it is introducing legislation which provides a disincentive for people to provide a saving for their retirement. In addition, the many changes to superannuation in recent years have created a climate of uncertainty and an environment where people feel dissatisfied with superannuation generally. To add to that, the rigidity of the incomes and assets test, which I referred to earlier, has forced many people off the age pension. Now, perhaps more than ever before, these people need access to superannuation and life savings if they are to make plans affecting their future with any certainty. </PARA>
<PARA> The real problem with this legislation is that the tax will fall heavily upon funds, such as approved deposit funds and roll-over funds, which do not have access to the same level of dividend imputation as is available in the superannuation schemes. It is the large superannuation schemes that will receive the benefit of dividend imputation, which is not available to these funds. Of course not everybody puts their money into superannuation schemes for life. Many people, when they change jobs, put their money into approved deposit funds and roll-over funds. Of course, as soon as one pulls one's money out of a superannuation fund, the full 15 per cent tax will apply. The Life Underwriters Association of Australia points out in what the amendments in this Bill will mean:</PARA>
<PARA> Superannuation will become an unattractive investment for the very people who most need an incentive to break away from the inevitability of a retirement on the pension. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed taxation impost on fund earnings will result in effective rates of taxation nearing 40 per cent for those on lower marginal income tax rates. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a fair observation. An important point to consider in discussing retirement income is that Australia's current social welfare outlay is around 30 per cent of total Budget expenditure. Of course, that will get much worse in 10 or 20 years time, when we are likely to have at least 15 per cent of the population over the retirement age, compared to the present 8 per cent. Superannuation is the one form of saving which is specifically intended for retirement purposes. As such, it has considerable potential to reduce the demand on the Budget. If this Government were serious about reducing its Budget deficit, it would refrain from its short-sighted attacks upon self-funded retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to raise one other matter in the few minutes left to me, that is, the Government's commitment in October 1984, when it set out its nine-point tax review plan. When talking about the tax position, it said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . any reform must lead to a simpler system, which therefore all Australians can understand more easily, and which therefore makes tax avoidance and evasion more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the criterion for the tax legislation and tax generally was simplicity. Let me remind the Senate of the contribution this Government has made to the Income Tax Assessment Act since it came to government in 1983. The Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, at its last reprint, runs to some 1,737 pages and contains 266 sections and 1,200 subsections. For those who wish to calculate it, these contain about one million words. On this basis alone one gets an indication of the complexity and the difficulty of interpretation that face not only unsuspecting taxpayers but also tax lawyers, accountants and Tax officers alike. The truth of the matter is that it is almost impossible to be interpreted by the ordinary person seeking to understand the level of taxation he or she should be paying. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act is almost impossible to read because we are faced with provisions numbered in the following terms-and I think these are good examples as they come from the investment in Australian films section-section 124zaga subsection (1) (a) (ii) and section 124zah subsection (1a) (c), both of which deal with deductions for capital expenditure for investment in Australian films under division 10ba. Surely that gives one an idea of the enormous difficulties the ordinary person never mind lawyers or accountants, has in interpreting the Act. Let me give a classic example from the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act. An ordinary employer, attempting to determine whether or not a food allowance he pays to an employee travelling away from home is a fringe benefit, turns for assistance to section 136, the interpretation section. It states that a `living-away-from-home food fringe benefit' is an `expense payment fringe benefit'. This latter term is defined in the same section. That employer turns to that definition and comes up with the very helpful bit of information that an `expense payment fringe benefit' means `a fringe benefit that is an expense payment benefit'. It is devastating in its clarity and certainty! That really would give comfort and succour to a poor soul reading the Act!</PARA>
<PARA> However, this mythical employer is persistent, so he looks at the definition of the `expense payment benefit' he has just read about. He then finds that this is in fact `a benefit referred to in section 20'. Section 20 contains another two internal definitions which basically state that, if an employer pays for something on behalf of an employee, the employer is taken to have provided a benefit to that employee. That is reasonably easy to understand. Finally, having divined this piece of information amongst the sections, the employer returns to his starting point, if of course he can remember what it was, to find that he has discovered the meaning of the first internal definition in the first line of a definition which then runs for six paragraphs. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that gives an indication of the frivolity of seeking to find out what one's tax liability is. Yet in October 1984 we were told by the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, that one of the nine fundamental principles of this Government would be simplicity and certainty and a system which all Australians could understand more easily and which therefore would prevent avoidance. I have to say, with respect: if that is simplicity by definition from this Government, may the Lord help those of us less intelligent in seeking to work our way through Acts of the Parliament to find out what our responsibilities are in terms of certainty and consistency-two of the fundamental principles upon which the taxation law has previously stood. If we lose that certainty, we lose our ability to make judgments and our ability to pay the right amount of tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first thing that needs to be said about the package of superannuation and taxation Bills before the Senate is that its motivation is purely to sweep more revenue into the Government's tax coffers. It has nothing to do with equity or fairness, or with concern about our ageing population or about the vital need to increase private domestic savings. Superannuation is the major form of private savings in Australia. By discouraging people from going into superannuation-and that is what these Bills do-the Government is acting totally contrary to its own rhetoric and contrary to the national interest. Its rhetoric is to beat the drum and try to make us believe that it is taking action to encourage private savings. Nothing, however, could be further from the truth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Prime Minister Hawke and Treasurer Keating, as a result of gross economic mismanagement, have already put this country into hock to the tune of nearly $130 billion. With these Bills the Government is mortgaging individual Australians' futures by tampering with their retirement superannuation incomes. These changes follow a pattern of enormous change to superannuation by the Government. If this legislation goes through, Australia will be one of the very few nations on earth to tax both part of the contributions to superannuation funds and the earnings of the funds themselves. Amongst other Western nations, Denmark certainly does; I am not sure that there are any others that do. It is proposed to levy a 15 per cent tax on the earnings of funds and on employer contributions. A 15 per cent tax on fund income and employer and self-employed contributions is equal to a tax rate of 38.8 per cent in 10 years time-that is, allowing for a very modest interest rate of 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The other interesting thing about this legislation is that, despite the fact that its motivation is purely to put more money into the Government's tax coffers, the changes, when viewed over the longer term, may actually increase the costs to the Government. This is due primarily to the fact that the yield earned by the superannuation funds is higher than the cost of the Government's borrowing. Hence a tax at retirement will generate more revenue in the long term than would a similar tax on contributions. So, in the longer term, it is very much a two-edged sword, so far as the Government's revenue base is concerned. It should be pointed out also that the reforms-the so-called reforms-incorporated in this legislation have not caused any greater integration between superannuation benefits and the age pension. Indeed, it could be argued that, with a lower lump sum tax at retirement, they have encouraged lump sums for most members. Until a form of integration between these two forms of retirement income is achieved, Australia will never have a rational, equitable and efficient system of providing retirement incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> In the taxation rip-off that is occurring through these Bills in the short term we are bringing forward tax of at least $1 billion. But that should come as no surprise to those Australians-and that is all of us-who have suffered at the hands of Labor's crushing taxes over the past six years. Since the Hawke Government came to office it has saddled the Australian community with a plethora of new and debilitating taxes. Indeed, during Labor's approximately 300 weeks in office no fewer than 300 changes have been made to increase tax. It is the ordinary workers who are footing these enormous tax hikes. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me run through just a few of the figures. In the first nine months of this financial year, for example, gross pay as you earn receipts are up by 16.9 per cent, against a Budget estimate of 13.8 per cent, and net pay as you earn receipts are up by 18.2 per cent. As a result of bracket creep, the community has been pushed into higher and higher income tax brackets over the last few years. An extra $10 billion-$10,000m-in tax has been paid as a result of that alone in the last four years. We see that in terms of the applications nowadays of the top marginal tax rate. Thirty years ago an income earner reached payment of the top marginal tax rate when his or her income was 18 times average weekly earnings; today a taxpayer reaches the top marginal tax rate when his or her income is less than twice average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> Paraded as the vehicle that would correct some of these imbalances, the April economic statement has, of course, turned out to be a complete furphy. In fact, the Government is giving back only half of that $10 billion tax creep windfall in tax cuts from July. The Australian Labor Party policy platform commits a Labor Government to `a fair and equitable taxation system'. What a sick joke that is. The reality is that Labor's crushing taxes now mean that a two-income family, with both husband and wife on respective average weekly earnings, would need at least an extra $71 a week to restore its real disposable income to the March 1983 level. With all of the resources at the disposal of the Department of Finance and the Treasury, the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) and the Treasurer have been challenged to refute our calculation that a person on average weekly earnings, with a dependent spouse and two children, will need an extra $56 a week to restore his or her disposable income to the March 1983 level. Significantly, they have failed completely to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Small business, too, has suffered the down side of Labor's taxation policies. It, too, has been barraged with dozens of new taxes, rules and regulations. Again the figures tell the story. In the first nine months of this financial year sales tax receipts are up by 24 per cent, and receipts under the prescribed payments system are up by 38 per cent. Under Labor, sales tax has gone up by a huge 150 per cent-that is three times the increase in the inflation rate since Labor came to office, and more than double the increase in consumer expenditure. The 1987 Budget Papers stated that sales tax would rise by 14 per cent in 1987-88, but when the results came in they showed that it had gone up by 19 per cent. This followed rises of 10 per cent in 1986-87 and 15 per cent in 1985-86. This year the wholesale tax will raise a record $8,700m-an increase of nearly 15 per cent on last year. All up, this year these consumption taxes will raise a total of $21 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Treasurer introduced, in the May 1988 economic statement, his proposals for changes to the taxation of the superannuation funds he said some truly heroic things. Let me quote a few of them. He said that as a result of these changes:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the value of existing and future lump sums and pensions will not be reduced . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He said that the changes will:</PARA>
<PARA>not reduce the related end-benefits but will align the structure of superannuation taxation with other forms of savings. </PARA>
<PARA>He said-and this was the dolly of them all-that the changes:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . will allow the Government to bring forward nearly $1 billion of its own tax money-now lying in superannuation funds-without diminishing any personal end-benefit by one cent. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer believed that these changes would disadvantage superannuants not one cent! To cap all that off, he said that as a result of these changes:</PARA>
<PARA> People can therefore plan for their retirement with complete certainty and confidence. </PARA>
<PARA>He omitted to tell the Australian community that in the Hawke Government's period of office there have been no fewer than 20 significant changes to superannuation arrangements and that the tax take from superannuation under the Hawke Government has gone up by 1,000 per cent-the tax take has gone up tenfold in the six years that this Government has been in office. There is no way that the changes incorporated in this legislation can be revenue neutral-no way at all. To argue that would be to argue that no-one will be disadvantaged in net terms as a result of the changes, and that is obviously quite wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of difficulties arising from the measures in these Bills which were, quite patently, not properly considered by the Government. They seriously undermine any claims of revenue neutrality in terms of fund income. For example, there is a wide variety of reasons why superannuation funds do not hold a greater proportion of their assets in equities. Remember that the only funds that will not be paying any income tax are those that do not hold all their assets in equities of Australian companies which receive the full imputation tax credit on dividends. There are many funds that do not wish to hold all their assets in equities nor should they do so. The principal reason is that the value of shares is subject to wide and unpredictable fluctuations over time. The 1987 stock market crash showed that par excellence. It encouraged many funds to move more of their portfolios back into stable secure investments such as capital guaranteed bonds. Many of the superannuation funds which will be the subject of these new taxation measures have provided to their members a guarantee of the maintenance of the value of their capital. There is no way they can do that if they put all their funds into equities. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, for very legitimate reasons, many Australian companies have a lower effective rate than the nominal corporate rate. Therefore, their dividends are not fully franked. Companies such as Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd, Pacific Dunlop Ltd, Brambles Industries Ltd, Elders-IXL and many others have a growing proportion of their operations in foreign countries. That is a very highly desirable development and one which is encouraged by virtually everyone in this country. But those overseas earnings are of course discounted for dividend franking purposes. Companies which do pay full or close to full tax rates include the three major private banks and most of the blue chip industrial companies such as the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, Comalco Ltd and Jennings Industries Ltd. Competition for fully franked shares in companies such as those may well push up the value of stocks and create a catch 22 situation where the higher prices lead to lower yields. There is considerable doubt as to whether there are sufficient quality imputation stocks available in domestic companies to offset the tax on earnings. Some of the largest superannuation funds are already close to the 20 per cent shareholding limit and will therefore be unable to increase their holding in these companies without launching a full takeover bid. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned before capital guaranteed funds. They account for some $10 billion to $20 billion of superannuation savings. Those funds tend to include no equities or only very small amounts of equities in their investment portfolios, to minimise the risk of capital loss in the share market. Capital guaranteed funds of course aim to establish a stable and secure rate of earnings through fixed interest debentures and other forms of guaranteed returns. It has to be said at the outset and without any equivocation that the proposals in the Treasurer's tax package are not revenue neutral. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps as well as the concern with the details of these Bills, which of course is an ongoing and continuing concern, the Government is worthy of the strongest possible censure for the way it has handled this legislation. This is legislation by press release in an almost unprecedented way. It was certainly unprecedented prior to this Government coming to office. Increasingly over the last six years the Government has put out a press statement or made a statement that it will do something which will have very significant effects on the whole, or important sections, of the community. We then wait and wait and eventually the legislation comes forward. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal for these changes to the taxation of superannuation funds, as I said, was announced in the May 1988 statement by the Treasurer. The new taxation arrangements were to start by 1 July 1988. So a statement was put out only five weeks in advance of the start of these fundamental tax changes. The superannuation fund managers had only that very limited period to attempt to get their act in order before the tax regime commenced on 1 July 1988. It then took six months before any legislation at all to give legal effect to these changes was introduced. That occurred in November 1988. We then had to wait a further five months before the rest of the package emerged. We are now debating that whole package. We are doing that almost one year after the Treasurer's announcements. In other words, there has been a delay of almost one year in the introduction of legislation to make legal the Government's May 1988 proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the taxes started being collected on 1 July 1988, there has been no legal authorisation for their collection. Not only that the Bills are, at least in some respects, different from the May 1988 statement. To the extent that the legislation that we are now debating is different from the detail of the proposals announced by the Treasurer in May 1988, that then makes this legislation retrospective tax legislation. Time and again this House and this Parliament have expressed an abhorrence for retrospective tax legislation. It is perhaps the most abhorrent of all forms of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I said before that the Treasurer had said in his remarks that people can now plan for their retirement with complete certainty and confidence. I mentioned the numerous changes that have been made over the last few years. There is no guarantee at all-indeed, to the contrary-that these changes will be the last that will be seen from this Government. These 20 changes to superannuation proposals that have occurred in the life of this Government have made our superannuation system and laws the most complex system of occupational superannuation anywhere in the world. I doubt that anyone fully understands it. In fact, I was interested to see in the Australian Financial Review of 21 May that Mr Graham Carew, a former Assistant Commissioner of the Australian Taxation Office who assisted in the framing of the Government's legislation, told a seminar in Sydney:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the new tax provisions were a minefield . . . (superannuation) has become too complicated and unwieldy. </PARA>
<PARA>What we are talking about here is something that goes to the heart of the feeling of well-being, confidence and comfort of all Australians in their ageing years. We are talking about something that is not just an economic matter; it is a very important social issue. It is one that people need to have confidence in and to understand. Here is one of the drafters of the legislation saying that superannuation has become too complicated and unwieldy. No wonder so many people in our community are feeling fear and concern for their futures. </PARA>
<PARA> I said earlier that the comment by the Treasurer that no-one would be disadvantaged by one cent was absolute bunkum. It is just not possible for that statement to be correct, for reasons that I have just outlined. In addition, the doubts about this legislation and what its real effects are going to be are mounting. I refer to an excellent article in the Bulletin of 16 May, just a couple of weeks ago, by Glenda Korporaal, where, under the heading `The doubts are mounting', amongst other things, she said:</PARA>
<PARA>Despite the promise by Treasurer Paul Keating that `no-one's end benefit would be reduced by one cent', it is hard to see how the decision to tax employers' contributions to super funds by 15% and the decision to tax super funds' investment income by 15% cannot reduce the final benefits of investing in superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA>She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Treasury's aim was purely to get its hands on the billions of dollars flowing into superannuation through union super funds and the greater awareness of the need to provide for retirement. The changes will reduce the cumulative amount at the end of an individual's working life which will be available to be taxed at the lower rate. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that a cent today is worth a lot more than the same one cent in 20 or 30 years after it has been eroded by inflation-which is why Treasury decided to take most of its share of the take up now rather than wait for the hereafter. </PARA>
<PARA>A professional analyst from one of the leading superannuation companies in Australia was reported in the Australian Financial Review of 29 May, earlier this week, as having found various quirks in the superannuation tax law. I quote the comments of Mr Ray Stevens, an actuary and superannuation consultant with Mercer Campbell Cook and Knight and certainly one of the leading specialists in this area in Australia, who at seminars around the country recently has been looking at the anti-detriment provisions of the law which are intended to ensure that no-one is worse off than before. I remind the Senate that the law says that where a person receives a benefit after age 55 and, as a result of contributions tax, would pay more tax under the new arrangements than under the previous tax regime, the person may receive a rebate for the excess tax. According to Mr Stevens, the anti-detriment provisions have serious limitations. They cannot take into account any loss resulting from the taxation of investment income. Only compensation for the 15 per cent contribution tax is intended. They apply only to lump sum benefits paid after age 55. </PARA>
<PARA> In determining whether any detriment has occurred, the unrealistic assumption must be made that the threshold for the old tax rates would always have remained at $55,000, whereas an indexed threshold starting at $60,000 is used for the new tax calculation. He also points out that it is up to the taxpayer to provide evidence to satisfy the Commissioner that detriment has occurred. It appears that the Commissioner will not initiate application of the provisions. If that is not so, then I hope that the Minister, in summing up at the end of this debate or in the committee stage, will clarify that situation, because it is a very important point indeed. It has also been pointed out by leading accountants, actuaries and tax experts that there are a number of quirks which need to be very closely watched by superannuation fund members if they are not to end up worse off than before. I commend to honourable senators the article in the Australian Financial Review of 29 May. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also a fact that the April 1989 economic statement has again taken the edge off superannuation as a form of investment. The recent April statement has made superannuation less attractive. When people are on a less than 30 per cent marginal tax rate, as will apply to incomes of less than $20,600 a year, the combined effect of these taxes will make other investment avenues more tax effective and more flexible. Again, that is a matter that was not taken into account, I am sure, when the May 1988 statement was made. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some very considerable concerns about this legislation. A great deal of pressure has been put on the coalition to reverse its announced decision to vote against the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2). That is the Bill that will tax the income of formerly exempt superannuation funds and approved deposit funds at 15 per cent. That has in fact been occurring in practice since 1 July 1988. I believe that it would be quite wrong for the Liberal and National parties to let that legislation go through unchallenged. There are some major defects in that legislation which will have the effect of greatly disadvantaging many superannuants in this country. They will have the effect of discouraging savings, people will be less attracted to putting their savings into superannuation and, therefore, into superannuation funds, and the pool of private savings available in this country will be lessened as a result. The decline in private savings that we have seen in Australia in recent years is one of the prime reasons why we have the overwhelming economic problems we now have on our external account. Any measures that are taken which will have the effect of worsening the situation for private savings in this country are to be avoided unless there are overwhelming reasons for their introduction. There are not overwhelming reasons for the introduction of this legislation, particularly the tax on the income of superannuation funds. I urge the Senate in the strongest terms possible to reject this piece of legislation. Not only will it hurt every Australian superannuant but it will also hurt the nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The package of Bills we are discussing contains a variety of titles but it is loosely referred to as the superannuation package. It is a very significant package of Bills which will have an impact on the lives of a large number of Australians, perhaps not immediately but certainly in the years to come. I, too, like the previous speaker, Senator Short, cannot believe the assurance of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) that these Bills will not really affect anybody. That is really not credible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The main features of the package are to impose a 15 per cent tax on employer contributions to public and private sector superannuation funds, to impose a 15 per cent tax on superannuation fund income, and to impose a capital gains tax on assets bought and sold by superannuation funds after 1 July 1988. It is now 1 June 1989 and we are bringing in this legislation. I have never actually worked in this area but how on earth one conducts a business buying and selling, and so on, on that mere phrase `There will be a capital gains tax on assets bought and sold by funds after 1 July 1988' I do not know. It is an impossible situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will impose a 16.25 per cent tax on lump sums over $60,000, which includes the Medicare levy. This was announced in the May economic statement of 1988. Part of it was announced in the statement of 12 April 1989, but no legislation was introduced into the Parliament until last November. Even then, only about half of it was introduced. We took the view that it was impossible enough trying to manage with a press statement announcement rather than legislation, but to be dealing with the legislation in parts was almost completely impossible. It was our view that we should have had the whole package before us before it was considered. We now have that and we are able to debate it. One of the reasons for that was that we felt we ought to be able to look at the whole range of changes that the Government was making to superannuation arrangements. There have been 20 changes since this Government was elected. How accountants, lawyers and financial advisers have managed to inform their clients and to give advice during this period is beyond me. It must have been a very difficult time indeed. I believe it still continues to be so. We cannot be certain that these will be the last changes the Government will make in the area of superannuation. There has been so much done to date but, hopefully, there will be some stability and it will not change the rules again. </PARA>
<PARA> There are 3.6 million Australians who belong to superannuation schemes, 325,000 being compulsory members, as are Commonwealth employees. When about 63 per cent of those compulsory members retire they receive only a very low amount from the superannuation scheme. They receive the balance of their income by way of age pension. They are in a particularly difficult situation. We only need to talk to them to find out how financially disadvantaged they are. We can have two retirees living next door to each other, one receiving all the benefits of a full age pension, having never contributed to a superannuation scheme and therefore not getting anything out of one, and next door a former Commonwealth employee who gets part Commonwealth superannuation, which he cannot surrender because he is forced to take it, and a part pension, but who receives none of the benefits. The latter is badly off indeed. He never seems to get any consideration or any benefits. When we look at pension entitlements and benefits, it is time we gave far more consideration to Commonwealth employees in that situation. These two retirees might go off to bowls together, one with the full pension and his bus pass, which enables him to travel, and the other without. There are so many areas to be looked at. While the actual fortnightly income of the full pension against superannuation and the part pension may appear to be the same, the difference in the spending capacity is enormous. It is an area that nobody ever seems to think about but it is certainly significant for those who are trying to live on the scheme that I referred to. </PARA>
<PARA> These days much more attention is being paid to the provision of secure retirement income. That is rightly so, as the population is ageing. The inadequacy of government pensions is something that is referred to frequently but it is unlikely that the economy can go on providing support to an ageing pensioner population unless something is done to encourage people to take more care for their own security. It is worth looking at some of the statistics. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Institute of Family Studies puts it into perspective when it tells us that over the next 35 years the number of elderly people in Australia will grow at twice the rate of the population as a whole. The fastest growing segment of the population will be those aged over 85 years. By the year 2021 there will be three times as many people over the age of 85 as there are today. Life expectancy at birth has increased dramatically over the past 100 years. For males it has increased from 47 then to 73 now, and for females it has increased from 51 to 79. The labour force participation rates for males over the age of 65 has declined from 23.3 per cent to 9.4 per cent since 1966. That has been a dramatic change in the percentage who are contributing and are productive. It must have made an enormous impact on the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a tendency towards earlier retirement. My view would be that rather than force people out of work at 65 we should be adopting policies which would encourage them to remain productive for as long as possible. We adjust the superannuation schemes and retirement policies to fit in with that; and make it attractive for people to give up work at 55, a much younger age. The whole attitude does not make sense to me. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986 there were 221,700 men aged 55 to 64, too young for the age pension, in receipt of Commonwealth income support. Since 1975 numbers of men in that group receiving unemployment benefits increased by 275 per cent, sickness benefits by 217 per cent, service pension by 182 per cent and the invalid pension by 116 per cent. If we do not take a very close look at those statistics and draw some very hard conclusions from them, we are going to make life more and more difficult for the younger group in the community-the taxpaying public. These are statistics that warrant debate on their own for the implication they have. They indicate to me that we have a large number of people in the community with not a great deal to do who are probably feeling that they are not productive and generally costing more in sickness benefits and other things than would actually be necessary if they were able to lead a different life. To be aged 55, feeling that no-one really wants them and that they do not have a chance of getting a job is very serious, especially when we look back to the increase in the life expectancy figures that I referred to a moment ago. These are men who for 10 years prior to eligibility for an age pension have been reliant in one way or another on the Commonwealth for income support. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of age pensioners per 1,000 population, or per 1,000 of the labour force, and age pension outlays as a proportion of the gross domestic product, is at the lowest point for over a decade. Of those people retired from full time work in 1986 aged 45 years and over, 8.6 per cent had superannuation, life assurance or similar schemes, and 11.5 per cent had investments as their main source of income. Three-quarters of the 361,000 people included in the Australian Bureau of Statistics Superannuation Australia Survey in 1983 who had received lump sum payments had in fact received less than $20,000. Thirty-six per cent had received less than $5,000, 20 per cent between $5,000 and $10,000 and 18 per cent between $10,000 and $20,000. Three-quarters of the women had received less than $10,000 and only 8.5 per cent received $20,000 or more. One cannot do a great deal to provide for oneself with those sums of money. </PARA>
<PARA> These are very revealing statistics and they should reinforce a number of things: the burden of supporting a mushrooming ageing population cannot continue to be borne by taxpayers; individuals need to be encouraged to make provision for their own income security beyond their working lives-and clearly at present that is not occurring on as large a scale as it ought to be and needs to be; and in order to encourage individuals to provide for their retirement, it would be at least useful-and I think essential-if the Government offered some incentive to people to provide for their own retirement, or at the very least refrained from putting up disincentives for people to make such arrangements for their future. But if we are to encourage people to save through the mechanism of superannuation one would expect there to be a steady, consistent regime whereby the end benefits would not be jeopardised by constant changing of the rules, which I say has been happening up until now. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government cannot ignore the fact that these changes-including those in this latest package-create doubts in the minds of those who are in superannuation schemes, and those contemplating taking up superannuation, about whether in 10, 20 or 30 years from now the scheme will in fact deliver them for their retirement what they expect it to deliver. As a consequence, of course, they have doubts about whether they should embark upon providing for themselves or not. Last year when this package was announced a number of comments were made about it that reinforced that view. I refer particularly to an article in the Adelaide Advertiser by Malcolm Newell. It commenced by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Confronting another quagmire of superannuation tax changes is a nightmare. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer Keating's words, `together these changes complete the Government's review of superannuation taxation arrangements. People can therefore plan for their retirement with complete certainty and confidence.'</PARA>
<PARA> Can any government, in all seriousness and in the context of recent years, sustain public credibility by making such a claim?</PARA>
<PARA>Other comments of a similar nature were made in other media and industry publications. They all reinforced the need for certainty when planning long term superannuation. It is important to encourage people to embark upon it at an early age. Unless there is credibility, they will not do so; they will be frightened to do so and will not bother to spend the money on it at that time. We need schemes that will be seen to be effective for a period of up to 30 years before people receive moneys from them. The Government cannot expect people to choose this course and enter into a scheme when their retirement is decades away and when there is as much uncertainty as there is at present. I believe that this Government has contributed significantly to the climate of uncertainty as far as superannuation is concerned, and that is most regrettable indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> In most cases where changes have occurred-indeed, in the case of these Bills-the motivation of the Government has had nothing to do with the security that people ought to be able to find in their superannuation schemes; rather the motivation has been merely the revenue from taxation-money grabbing. We know this Government is a high taxing government. We have come to live with that. But this package is the latest of its money grabbing schemes, and the uncertainty it has created in the industry is, I think, most regrettable indeed. The changes have not been initiated to encourage additional participation. I refer to a letter which I know has been referred to previously in this debate, written by the Life Underwriters Association of Australia. I suspect it was written to all senators. It said that the Association remains `deeply concerned over the potential impact of the proposed taxation arrangements outlined in this Bill on the attractiveness of superannuation as an investment option'. The letter went on to indicate that the Association believes the Government is actively discriminating against superannuation investment based savings. I think the Government ought to listen to the advice of a group such as that which is so heavily involved in this industry. I think it is incredible that the Government takes such a short-sighted view of providing for an ageing population. Everybody knows that the statistics indicate that the population is ageing and will continue to age, and that the proportion of pay as you earn taxpayers will fall in relation to the number of people who may otherwise be looking for age support, or age pensions, if they are not able to provide for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the institutions which deal with superannuation have indicated that they would welcome changes-they are not saying there should not be changes-but they think that such changes should lead to greater participation in the superannuation schemes and should not merely produce revenue for the Government while discouraging people from being in them. The recent National Australia Bank Quarterly Summary said that changes to the superannuation and taxation systems are vital if we are to provide for our ageing population. It predicted that outlays for age pensions would rise from 2.8 per cent of the gross domestic product in 1985 to nearly 4.5 per cent by the year 2025. That is a dramatic increase. It described participation by Australian workers in superannuation schemes as poor compared with other countries. Only 28.3 per cent of women in the work force are in schemes compared with 50.9 per cent of men. But the legislation we are looking at now will not encourage women to embark on superannuation schemes for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Australia Bank called for new schemes to be developed which were specifically attractive to women to enable them to contribute to superannuation while they are in the work force. It also called for enhanced incentives for young people, such as vesting and portability, to correct the situation of nearly 60 per cent of people with no superannuation being under the age of 35. As the law is at present, I cannot imagine how one could go about persuading people under the age of 35 to embark on a superannuation scheme when in fact they should be better off in the long run the earlier they do so. To me, the philosophy of this is quite wrong. Young people are those most at risk. By the time they reach retirement age the pension as we know it today may not be available to them. </PARA>
<PARA> There are those, as I said, who wish to see changes, but they wish to see changes for the better. While the Government seems determined to use this measure as a means of revenue raising and creates uncertainty and reluctance in the minds of those who belong to a scheme or are thinking about going into a scheme-causing people to feel that their superannuation, after the many years of paying into it, may not in fact meet their needs in their retirement-the situation will only get worse. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is not the way to encourage people to provide for their retirement. I believe that the Government must know that. I cannot imagine why it cannot devise a scheme that would encourage people to provide for themselves. I hope that if we see any more changes to superannuation they will be changes for the better that will encourage people to be in schemes. I certainly hope, for the sake of lawyers, accountants and those involved in this industry, that there will not be any further changes, because if there are the nightmare they have suffered so far will only become worse. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The package of taxation Bills before the Senate relates to a number of changes which the Government proposed in its May 1988 and April 1989 economic statements in relation to superannuation laws. The main features of this legislative package are a 15 per cent tax on employer contributions to public and private sector superannuation funds, a 15 per cent tax on superannuation fund income, a 16.25 per cent tax on lump sums over $60,000 and a capital gains tax on assets bought and sold by superannuation funds after 1 July. These changes are just further discouraging Australians to save at a time when we are taking another step down the Argentine road. Our foreign debt, which is over $100 billion, is a fair indication of that. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has taken one more step towards his famous Paris option-that option of selling one's antique clocks and leaving the country to live in Paris. That was a well-mooted option, a well-known joke around the Cabinet. One media commentator, Paul Lyneham of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, asked the Treasurer before he left, `Are you coming back?'. He took a couple of seconds to answer. I am not sure whether he gave the right answer, but he gave the impression to Australians that he was coming back. I wish he would hurry back and fix up the mess.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Haines is quite right. I am a bit worried by the number of times I find myself agreeing with the Australian Democrats, at least today. Senator Haines makes the clear point that when the Treasurer does come back he will do some damage. Perhaps he should stay there. It really does not matter any more. The whole economic system is so far out of hand that he cannot take hold of the levers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Encouraging Australians to invest in a superannuation scheme is of the utmost importance in these bleak economic times. Superannuation is the only real form of savings for the great majority of Australians that is designed specifically to provide income for people in their retirement. It plays a role in the welfare of those who enter retirement as well as reducing the very heavy costs of government provided welfare. Nobody should underestimate the desire of Australians to have a secure income, a nest egg in their retirement, and their preference for their own scheme rather than a government provided welfare scheme in their retirement. It gives the elderly both financial and psychological security, and that is of the utmost importance as people enter their later years. Given the right incentives, most would retire from the work force. As I said, they would rather have their own security than being dependent upon a government welfare system. The Bills before the Senate do not improve that prospect one iota. </PARA>
<PARA> Contrary to the Treasurer's commitment that no-one's end benefit will reduce by one cent, the Government has heightened the risk of returns to superannuation funds. That is the real essence of the Bills before the Senate this evening. The critical element in the package before the Senate is the ability to offset the new 15 per cent tax on fund earnings by use of fully franked dividends. The Treasurer's claim of revenue neutrality in these changes is based upon the proposition that the superannuation funds will start to flow to what he called the quality end of the Australian share market. Quite frankly, the Treasurer fails to understand the market system. In fact, it has been a gross failing on the part of the Treasurer for some time. He has no grasp of market reality and all it is made up of: its drive, its risks, its psyche, its knowledge and its limits. He has no understanding of the market. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many reasons why the superannuation funds will not suddenly flow into the so-called quality end of the share market to take advantage of the tax credits. Risk and security are the prime reasons. Since the 1987 crash many funds have moved more of their portfolios away from the share market and back into secure investments such as guaranteed bonds. Most capital guaranteed funds, approved deposits or roll-over funds, which account for as much as $10 billion to $20 billion of superannuation savings, tend to include no equities, no shares, or at least a very minimal amount, for the simple reason of minimising the possibility of being wiped out in a share market crash. That is always possible under this Government's economic strategy. These types of funds aim to achieve a stable and secure rate of earnings through fixed interest debentures and other forms of guaranteed returns. Is the Treasurer suggesting that Australians forgo their retirement security-something that is very important to them-and start a rush on the share market just to get some tax credit? Quite frankly, the risk of entering the share market outweighs the benefit of the tax credit. That is something the Government must understand and come to grips with. It makes false the claim that nobody will be worse off under this superannuation package. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition proposes amendments to address the situation. One amendment will effectively excise that 15 per cent tax on investment funds so as to ensure that the end benefits of millions of superannuants will not be reduced and to ensure that superannuation remains a viable savings alternative for retirement. Another amendment is designed to ensure that supernnuation remains a viable savings alternative for retirement. That amendment would increase the present tax free limit on lump sums from $60,000 to $125,000. That is part of coalition policy. The coalition policy would index that $125,000 limit. That policy is related to our retirement incomes policy. I recommend that the Government read the coalition's policy. Perhaps it could come to grips with one itself-one that is worthy of the respect of elderly Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Superannuation is very important to Australians for two reasons: first, as I said, to provide for the welfare of older Australians in their retirement years and, secondly, because superannuation is a significant contribution to the macro-economic need for increased private savings. Superannuation, coupled with the pension system for the needy, forms a national retirement incomes policy. That is something which the Opposition, unlike the Government, as I said, has carefully prepared and published. The issue of financing the future welfare of Australians in retirement is becoming increasingly crucial to the nation as the age distribution of our population becomes older. </PARA>
<PARA> The ageing of Australia's population is shown by the changing relative proportions of different age groups in the population. The trend in recent years has been for the 45 years and older age group to increase as a proportion of the population. In 1987 there were 1.7 million Australians over the age of 65. By the year 2011 this figure will have risen to three million. At the same time, the proportion of the young-that is, up to 14 years-will decline significantly because of the declining birth rate. To highlight that statistic, I refer to the fact that the immigration contribution to total population growth in this country outweighs the natural increase contribution. I refer also to the increasing life expectancy due to advances in modern medicine, as well as the greater level of health consciousness in the community. These trends of a lower natural increase and higher life expectancy together mean that in the future there will be proportionately fewer and fewer taxpayers in the prime of their working lives and income producing potential and more and more retired people. The old age dependency ratio is expected to double in the next five decades. </PARA>
<PARA> This increase in the ratio of retired people to working people has a clear message: the public purse can no longer be expected to finance the retirement of all. The Economic Planning Advisory Council has estimated that if pension rates increase in line with general living standards age pension outlays will increase by 50 per cent and, as a percentage of gross domestic product, from 2.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent by the year 2025. So we can no longer maintain a system of financing current pensions from taxation revenue alone. That imbalance between those working and those retired will become far too great. The imbalance underlines that encouraging superannuation-people saving for their own retirement-is absolutely essential now. </PARA>
<PARA> Increased superannuation is just as essential to meet an equally urgent need-the need to increase private savings, particularly by households, to arrest the foreign debt explosion arising from Labor's economic mismanagement. Australia's private savings are not only low; they are falling. Household savings have fallen from 15 per cent of disposable income in 1975 to 8 per cent today. Australia must borrow because national savings are inadequate to finance national investment. The importance of encouraging a greater savings level in Australia can no longer be ignored by the Government. It is, in fact, the most vital economic lever to steer Australia out of its pending economic collapse. It is the lever that the Government has yet to pull. </PARA>
<PARA> The major crisis facing Australia today is the ever increasing foreign debt, now standing at over $100 billion net and fuelled each month by the billion dollar-plus current account deficits. As has been said many times in this House, the foreign debt has quadrupled under the present Government. When the Hawke Government first came into office it was $32 billion; it is now $120 billion. That represents an increase of $1m every 1.5 hours. Seventy-five per cent of that debt has a maturity of less than three months-90 days. The short average maturity means that the economy is not liquid: it is vulnerable to a liquidity crisis. Indeed, we are heading into a liquidity crisis with interest rates alone to meet that debt burden at $12 billion, which is about $1 billion per month, the greater part of the monthly current account deficit. We are reaching the stage that Italy faced in the 1970s-borrowing to meet interest payments; interest on interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The payment of interest on foreign debt is now the largest single component of the current account deficit. This problem has been a major contributor to Australia's record high current account deficit and record high interest rates. Interest rates are higher because funds must be attracted from overseas to plug the gap of the savings shortfall in this country. Foreign investors have reacted to a widening current account deficit and rising foreign debt by demanding higher interest rates. Enter Moody's Investor Services Inc. Higher interest rates are demanded by foreign investors to cover what they perceive to be a greater and greater risk that Australia will not be able to sustain the servicing of the foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has become trapped in a vicious cycle of higher interest rates, a widening current account deficit and a rising foreign debt, which in turn leads to higher interest rates. The only way to break up this cycle is to increase domestic savings. That is why increased savings via superannuation or incentive by way of tax incentive for interest on domestic savings is utterly vital. Increased savings would mean lower consumption and a lower demand for imports, which would lead to less and less pressure on the current account front. Increased savings would also increase the supply of loanable funds for industry, local business and housing, thereby lowering domestic interest rates from their current crippling levels. </PARA>
<PARA> Superannuation as a major part of the savings mix has the virtue of providing long term savings that can be invested long term to business to the benefit of the economy and society. In other words, because superannuation represents savings not to be drawn upon until retirement, many decades after the initial contributions have been made, superannuation is a pool of savings that can be invested long term. If the economy is to ride out the current account crisis and to invest, to restructure in the long term, superannuation must be encouraged as part of a national effort to boost savings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I indicated in my speech in the second reading debate, the Australian Democrats intend to move amendments to this clause with regard to those people who have rolled over their lump sums into fixed interest investments-that is, those people who will not get any benefit at all from the Government's allowance of imputation to run back the 15 per cent earnings tax to a lesser percentage. I said during my speech that we were concerned that some very ordinary wage earners who had retired at 55 or 60 years of age on small superannuation pay-outs would be disadvantaged by this legislation, notwithstanding the fact that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) had indicated that no-one would be 1c worse off under this legislation. Indeed, a large group of people will be hurt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The 15 per cent tax on the investment earnings of superannuation roll-over funds is a maximum. It can be reduced by those companies which spread their investments into the share market. Those people who retired early on small superannuation payments, however, still remember October 1987; they still remember the fact that the share market got a significant jolt and that there was a ripple effect through to other financial areas. We certainly support the Government's aim of encouraging the big life and superannuation funds to invest in Australian companies, if they are going to invest in companies at all, rather than taking their money offshore. Using imputation as a way of reducing the 15 per cent tax on earnings is one way of getting those people to invest in Australian companies. But overriding that is our concern that some people are going to be significantly worse off. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said during my speech in the second reading debate, we have been contacted by a number of constituents. I cited one who retired at the age of 60, after something like 40 years in the work force. He rolled over his $50,000 superannuation payment into an interest earning type of roll-over fund. He chose this fund deliberately, he said, because he wanted to put his money in a low risk investment. He knew he had to take the money out of the fund at age 65, so he set out to avoid roll-over funds which invested a high proportion of their assets in property and shares which could reduce in value over that five-year period. He wanted a secure investment. He was not even prepared to go as far as putting his money into capital guaranteed funds, because he either guessed or knew that some of those have quite a commitment in the share market-in some cases up to 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> He then calculated that under the new legislation, because his approved deposit fund will pay the full 15 per cent tax on its interest earnings, he would lose some $4,000 over the five years that the money is in the fund. He has some options, of course. He can leave it there and lose that money or he can take it out of that fund and move it into a capital guaranteed fund. But if he does the latter he will have to pay up-front fees and/or higher management fees, perhaps something of the order of 5 to 6 per cent of his money. As I said, he is concerned about moving it to capital guaranteed funds because of their investment in shares and their higher risk. </PARA>
<PARA> If this legislation goes through unamended, this man and others like him-and some women, although still very few women have access to superannuation-will lose thousands of dollars over the next five years. People who have retired at 55 and who have acted similarly with the intention of withdrawing their money at 65 will lose even more if the legislation is unamended. For that reason, we want some alterations to the legislation. The Government cannot argue that it has been caught short on this one. We spoke to it last July about this; we have spoken to it on an almost monthly basis ever since. We have asked for assistance from the parliamentary draftspeople so that we can get amendments drafted that will satisfy the Government. Nothing has eventuated; so we have had our own amendments drafted, partly to make the Treasurer keep his word but more importantly to protect those people who could lose thousands of dollars because of these changes-changes made after they had taken the decision to invest in safe roll-over funds. Our amendments 1 and 2, which are connected amendments, will seek to assist people who have put their money into secure funds. </PARA>

So the amendments to be moved by the Opposition and those already moved by the Democrats are defective in that, even if one conceded that the objectives in either case were valid-which the Government does not; it firmly rejects that assertion-they are selective in the area to which they have been applied, or to which it is sought that they apply. The Opposition's amendments are more selective, that is, embracing a narrower range of the whole field, than the Democrats' amendments-but none of them embrace the whole field. The Democrats' amendments would be most generous to banks, because most fixed interest funds are in fact approved deposit funds run predominantly by banks. I think it is somewhat incongruous, with the criticisms that the Democrats have been making over some time of banks and their allegedly high profits, to be bringing in an amendment which would selectively-although, as I said, less selectively than the Opposition's-advantage banks. </PARA>
<PARA> Most superannuation funds, moreover, have substantially less than 90 per cent of their assets in fixed interest securities, which is true even for the so-called capital guaranteed funds. Those that have not, of course, have the option of increasing the amount of equities and therefore of franked dividend income which they receive. Giving tax preference to a particular segment of the superannuation industry, as both the Opposition's amendments and the Democrats' amendments would do, would encourage other parts of the industry to restructure so as to obtain the tax preference. For example, a fund with, say, 80 per cent of its assets in fixed interest securities would almost certainly do better under the Democrats' amendments if it sold off some of its shares and acquired additional interest bearing assets. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears that neither the Opposition nor the Democrats have considered what effect that could be expected to have on the domestic share market, although I understand they have been inundated with stockbrokers' views on that subject. Moreover, there is of course a cost to revenue. Most importantly of all, all of the Democrats' amendments and the proposed Opposition amendments act against the fundamental rationale of the changes that the Government is seeking to make, that is, to remove the bias in the existing system in favour of debt rather than equity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's amendments, of course, go very much further, since they propose to abolish the tax absolutely for all but pooled funds and the superannuation business of life offices. Therefore, they would be far more damaging to the underlying objective of the Government's policy than the Democrats' amendments. Both parties' amendments are unacceptable for the reasons I have given. I will make some more detailed comments about the Opposition's amendments at the time they are moved. I have made the comments I have up to now because there are some similarities between both lots of amendments which would have an effect unacceptable to the Government and, of course, which are in both cases selective and, I suppose, internally inconsistent in the sense that they do not extend what the Opposition or the Democrats might see to be a good idea to all the players in the field. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Page 15, clause 9, proposed section 281, lines 30 and 32, leave out the proposed section, insert the following section:</PARA>
<PARA> `` `281. Subject to section 275, the assessable income of a complying superannuation fund of a year of income shall comprise only taxable contributions made to the fund in a year of income.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Page 17, clause 9, proposed section 290, lines 13 to 15, leave out the proposed section, insert the following section:</PARA>
<PARA> `` `290. Subject to section 275, the assessable income of a complying ADF of a year of income shall comprise only the taxable contributions made to the fund in a year of income.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>In moving these amendments to clause 9, the Opposition is proposing that the 15 per cent tax on investment income be excised. We did not support the Democrats' amendments because they did not go far enough and because their nature was such that they would have made the legislation fraught with technical difficulties and definition problems. But the overriding thrust, very simply, was that they did not go far enough effectively to excise the whole of the 15 per cent investment tax in the hands of the fund. </PARA>
<PARA> In the second reading debate, I and other senators made the point very strongly that we consider this tax to be a disincentive to savings. We have said also that it is a discriminatory tax in that it purports to allow certain types of funds to make investments in equities on the stock market to take advantage of imputed dividends to lower their rate of tax, whereas the approved deposit funds and the roll-over funds would not have access to that lowering of tax because approximately only 25 per cent of investment of total funds of that nature would be in the equities market. The reason for that is very simple: the people who are using those funds are seeking secure fixed interest investments or capital guaranteed investments. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh, in replying to the debate on the Democrats' amendments, and in foreshadowing remarks that he will make about our amendments, talked about there being a cost to the revenue. I think we have made the point very clearly that the cost to the revenue is probably only between $20m and $120m, depending on the decision that various fund managers would choose to make in their investment portfolios. At this stage it is not possible to be more precise, but we know that that part of the superannuation market which comprises approved deposit funds and roll-over funds is in the vicinity of $12 billion. So in this package of Bills there is ample room for the Government to forgo this particular slice of the revenue because the total package will afford to it, in toto, $1.4 billion, of which it is losing only something between $20m and $120m. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time the May statement was brought down, the Treasurer gave a commitment that no end benefit to any superannuant would be diminished by 1c. That is clearly not the case. In the second reading debate I gave a particular example of somebody who had taken early retirement and received a payment of $100,000. For the purposes of making it a more simple proposition, let us take a simple sum of $1,000 that an employer has contributed to a superannuation fund for an employee in this financial year. The employee, who is under 55 years of age, leaves the employment and becomes entitled to the benefit. The following would be the total tax package under the proposals. There would be 15 per cent in the fund, plus 27 per cent as an eligible termination payment when the benefit was paid to the employee. Thus, a total of 42 per cent would be paid under the proposed scheme, whereas under the existing tax regime the total tax payable would be only 37 per cent on the eligible termination payment. </PARA>
<PARA> Further complications arise out of these packages but, as I have said, the Opposition's main concern is about this particular tax, which we say is a disincentive to savings. Earlier I pointed out, too, that it had a public administration implication. I referred to States of Australia which had decided to fund their superannuation schemes. They were avoiding putting future generations into hock by setting aside the money for the superannuation payments within this generation-a sensible practice. Because of this particular tax a majority of those States that intended to fund their superannuation schemes have now declined to do so. Indeed, the Queensland Government has actually enacted legislation to ensure that the 15 per cent tax on its superannuation funds will not be paid to Canberra. I think that the Queensland Government is demonstrating that it is doubly incensed at having its general purpose grants cut by the Federal Government at the Premiers Conference, and that it is not prepared to give even more hard earned money to the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier I made the point that such disparate people as Garry Weaven of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and Professor Michael Porter had said that the proposed tax was a disincentive. Professor Porter said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the present taxation of superannuation and means testing of the government pension significantly penalises many Australians saving for their own retirement relative to spending income today. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Weaven said:</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that to get people to prefer a future lump sum or income stream to current cash in hand requires a very major incentive. </PARA>
<PARA> Speculation and uncertainty about future government policy in the area only increases the preference for current cash rather than preserved savings. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly that, together with industry views which have come to the surface in the latter days of this debate-industry, too, acknowledges that the tax is a disincentive-should convince the Government, if it were of a mind to be reasonable and to judge the situation fairly 12 months after the May statement was brought down in 1988 by way of press release, that circumstances have perhaps changed, that there is a desperate necessity to have policies which encourage savings and do not discourage them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I indicated a little while ago, with the defeat of our attempt to quarantine simply the fixed interest funds, we will be supporting the Opposition attempt to remove the 15 per cent earnings tax absolutely. It somehow slipped past me, when I was moving back to my place after the previous division, that Senator Bishop was moving her amendments to proposed section 281, which came after my first two amendments, and to proposed section 290. I know that the honourable senator sought leave and that leave was granted. However, this means that my amendments to proposed section 289 slid past. I am not going back to them-for the simple reason that they attempted to do to approved deposit funds and to pooled superannuation trusts the same sort of thing as our first two amendments would have done to another group of fixed interest funds. I would just like it on the record that we are not proceeding with our amendments 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 as two groups because they will meet the same fate as amendments 1 and 2 and because we are now supporting Senator Bishop's-that is, the Opposition's-amendments that slotted neatly in between all of those.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition's proposal is to abolish the 15 per cent tax on the earnings of most funds. It would not apply to the superannuation business of life offices-they would continue to be subject to the 15 per cent tax-or pooled superannuation trusts. So, technically, it is very defective. It is difficult to believe that the Opposition is actually serious about this. I personally believe that to be the case. The Opposition believed it would be a good stunt to pull but, having done that, it has been hoist with its own petard and it believes it has to proceed with it. It is very difficult to believe that the Opposition is serious.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The 15 per cent tax on the earnings can be, providing a fund has the correct investment mix, offset or more than offset by the imputation of credit from franked dividends. It is part of an indivisible package. If this part of the Government's total legislation on superannuation funds were knocked out, the rest of it really would not be defensible and would not proceed. I would not go so far as to say that it would make the whole imputation system indefensible, but it would very seriously flaw the imputation system to the point where the Government, should these amendments actually be put into the legislation, might even have to look at the legislation again. </PARA>
<PARA> The essential purpose of the whole superannuation package, of which this Bill is a vital part, is to remove the bias which exists under the present arrangements for debt financing rather than equity financing. I am astounded that, on this issue, the Australian Democrats, who have for many years been lecturing the Senate and others on the alleged evils of debt financing as compared with equity financing, are in this instance contemplating voting for a proposition which unambiguously favours debt financing over equity financing and which will cause, without any doubt, should it be adopted, a continuing distortion and a growing problem in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's amendments are difficult to understand for other reasons as well. They are clearly inconsistent with the Opposition's retirement income policy, launched only last November, which stated that the Opposition would:</PARA>
<PARA>Continue to provide company tax imputation credits to superannuation funds on franked dividends. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a repudiation of that policy if the Opposition proceeds with these amendments. Several representatives of the superannuation industry have stated publicly that, in practice, the tax will have no effect on the investment earnings of most superannuation funds. Those upon which it will have some effect can rearrange their investment portfolio in favour of equity rather than interest bearing securities. In some cases, superannuation funds expect to have excess imputation of credits, which they can use to offset the tax on contributions. The net result is significantly improved end benefits for those investing in major superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA> For other funds, including many approved deposit funds, the earnings tax either will be minimal or could be readily reduced by an adjustment to their investment portfolios-not only by adjustments to shift the portfolio in favour of investment in shares but also by investments in assets which provide a return in the form of capital gain-property obviously being one. Moreover, in those cases where some net earnings tax would be payable, it does not follow that after tax end benefits would be lower. The reason for that is that the reduction of the tax on end benefits intentionally exceeds that which is necessary to offset the new tax on deductable contributions. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I stress again that these amendments are absolutely unacceptable to the Government. If the Opposition persists with them, the whole superannuation package, including the reduction of the lump sum tax, falls to the ground. It is an indivisible package. This Bill is an essential component of that package. Under no circumstances will the Government consider allowing this amendment to pass but still proceed with the package. I say again that I really am astounded that the Democrats, who have been, if one takes their remarks seriously and at face value, very strongly committed to equity financing instead of debt financing, could even contemplate supporting this amendment which restores the bias in favour of debt financing and, on the way through, destroys the rationale for the whole imputation of credit policy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly take the point made by the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) about debt versus equity financing. I indicated during the second reading debate and again a little while ago that it gives me no joy to support the Opposition's amendment. I certainly would prefer not to support the removal of the earnings tax absolutely. But the fact is that we also have to concern ourselves with those people who are vulnerable, who made a conscious decision to invest in a secure fund which now looks like leading to their losing about $3,000 or $4,000 over the next five years, through no fault of their own, except an excess of caution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister is quite right. It is disappointing that we have to go against our traditional attitude to the relative merits of debt and equity financing in this piece of legislation. But the Government has to bear some of the responsibility for that as we told Government members of our concerns last year. In the intervening period they must have been able, with the genius at their disposal, to come up with some alternative route to protect those people without pulling the rug out from underneath this part of the legislation altogether. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I move on to another point that the Minister made, that is, that the Opposition's amendment is flawed because it does not cover pooled super trusts. I think I heard that correctly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister is making the claim that the Opposition's removal of the earnings tax absolutely will not exempt pooled super trusts from the earnings tax. Does that mean that I get the opportunity to come back to the third pair of our amendments following this exercise, which aim to exempt from this tax predominantly interest earning pooled superannuation trusts. If that is the case, I am more than happy to go back and pick that up after supporting the Opposition's amendment. Under those circumstances, I would hope that the Liberals would see their way clear to patching up the deficiencies in their amendment by supporting our third pair of amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In his remarks, the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) said that he did not believe the Opposition was serious in pursuing these amendments. I can assure him that the Opposition is serious. He said that the fundamental thrust of this part of the package was to encourage investment in imputed dividend shares. One of the concerns the Opposition has is that the superannuation area must have a prime reason for legislation to be passed, that being that we want more people to enter superannuation funds, with a larger percentage of Australian citizens being involved. There is a need for more people to be attracted into superannuation in order that they can be more self-reliant in retirement. One of the groups of people who have to be attracted in if this is to be achieved are those on the lower marginal tax rates. The figures speak for themselves. We have 3.6 million Australians in superannuation funds. In the private sector only 39 per cent of employees are in superannuation funds whilst in the public sector some 67 per cent of people are in superannuation funds. As I have already pointed out, it is possible for the public sector to avoid paying that 15 per cent investment tax simply by not funding its schemes. If the private sector tried a similar sort of system, then there could be great problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Going back to the point I was making previously, there is a need to attract into superannuation schemes those people who are on the lower marginal tax rates. This package simply does not do that. A tax advantage is needed to make the package attractive. People are being asked to forgo the enjoyment of spending money that is in their hands today and to put it aside for their retirement, in the meantime making those funds available for savings and investment. The decision to do that has to be encouraged by giving people a tax advantage. For people on the lower marginal rate that advantage is simply not great enough. Excising this 15 per cent tax we believe will make superannuation more attractive to this group of people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-In light of the comments made by the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) with regard to an alleged deficiency within the Opposition's amendment and not wanting to take the risk that one of the types of superannuation providers that we are concerned about slips through the exemption net, I now move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(5) Page 18, clause 9, proposed subsection 296 (1), line 7, leave out ``The trustee'', insert ``Subject to subsection (4), the trustee''. </PARA>
<PARA>(6) Page 18, clause 9, after proposed subsection 296 (3), add the following new subsections:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(4) Subsection (1) does not apply to income of a fund where 90% of the assets of the fund are in interest earning investments. </PARA>
<PARA> ``(5) Subsection (4) ceases to have effect on 30 June 1999.''. </PARA>
<PARA>We have moved three pairs of amendments relating to our exemption attempt. They would have exempted from the earnings tax for a period of 10 years three groups of funds: complying superannuation funds whose assets are 90 per cent invested in interest earning investments; complying approved deposit funds which are 90 per cent invested in interest earning investments; and predominantly interest earning pooled superannuation trusts. We were defeated in a combined vote of the Government and the Liberal and National parties in the first of those amendments. I understand that approved deposit funds are picked up under the Liberal Party amendment which was supposed to be a general exemption. However, I also understand that there is at least a strong belief on the part of the Minister and his advisers that pooled superannuation trusts will not be gathered up under the Liberal Party's amendment to exempt funds from the earnings tax. I would not like the legislation to leave this place and go back to the House of Representatives for consideration without absolutely ensuring that all of the groups of superannuation trusts were covered. It would be better for the Opposition's amendment and our amendment to pass this place, rather than for the Opposition's amendment to go through and our third pair of amendments to be defeated and a significant group of fixed interest funds to be left outside the earnings tax exemption and forced to pay 15 per cent tax with no capacity for a significant imputation offset. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that the leading financial lights in the Liberal Party are currently having a discussion and given that I have talked this out for as long as is possible, even for me, to go on repeating the same thing over and over again, I would like to get some indication from the Opposition as to whether it is prepared to support these amendments at least pro tem. We should not kid ourselves; this Bill will come back from the House of Representatives, which is waiting breathlessly to get it tonight. We will probably receive it again on Monday, at which stage we can sort it out. I do not want to risk having the Bill leave this place with over half the Senate concerned about the earnings tax and its effect on a range of people but not covering one significant group. I do not know whether the Opposition wants to report progress so that it can consult its spokesperson in the other place or whether it is prepared to take a punt on this one and see what happens after it has been to the House of Representatives. If the Opposition is serious about removing the earnings tax, I urge it not to leave, however inadvertently, a loophole with regard to pooled superannuation trusts. In order that the Opposition not do that, I ask it to support our amendments 5 and 6 relating to those groups of superannuation trusts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question that has been raised by Senator Walsh only reflects the complete complexity of this whole area of legislation. When we realise that the size of this package of Bills is about the size that the Tax Act used to be, it is not surprising that the Government has managed to place some seeds of concern in the minds of the Australian Democrats. It is no wonder that the May economic statement on superannuation with the acronym `MESS' is how this package of Bills is known in the industry. The question that has been raised by Senator Walsh as to whether there is complete coverage of all aspects, as he alleges, is but one example of the difficulties and complexities that are comprised in the whole package.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw the Committee's attention to one of the other difficulties that are contained in various parts of the package of legislation. For instance, the contribution tax of 15 per cent, which is only payable on contributions which are tax deductable and payable by the fund, poses a whole ream of problems, considering the 600,000 people who are in private superannuation funds. Let us look at the way this problem might present itself. </PARA>
<PARA> First, the legislation is not clear as to who a prescribed person will be who can state whether or not a contribution tax ought to be paid on all contributions received where, for instance, somebody who is in a private fund might also be in a fund where there is an employer contribution. Thus, fund managers who have to pay the tax are concerned to know whether or not a contributor to a private superannuation fund who would normally attract a tax deduction is in a second or more fund to which an employer makes a contribution in excess of 3 per cent. If such a contributor to a private fund is in a second or more fund, then his personal contribution will not attract a deduction. Therefore, the fund will not need to pay the 15 per cent contribution tax. The funds will probably be advised by employers of names of persons in respect of whom they are contributing in excess of 3 per cent, but there will be those people whose names will not appear and to whom a communication will be required to be made in order to determine whether their contribution is subject to tax deductability. If that person chooses not to respond to the inquiry, then there has to be a presumption that the contribution is deductable and therefore the tax is payable. </PARA>
<PARA> The relevant question of the contribution of the employer being over 3 per cent is relevant because originally it would have been if no contribution were made that the tax deductability question was relevant, but because of the 3 per cent productivity funds, it was considered to be unjust if somebody who went into one of the funds was penalised of the right to have his or her ordinary superannuation payment deduction. Thus we have a further complication. As I said, this whole package of Bills is the size the tax Act used to be prior to the whole matter becoming more and more complex, so that even the simplest person with the simplest income now needs professional advice to comply with all the filling out of forms and laws and regulations which are part of our horrendously complicated system. It is no wonder that the Minister has posed a doubt in the minds of the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> I go back to fundamentals. Senator Haines has said that the Democrats are very concerned about people who are in approved deposit funds and roll-over funds and who through no fault of their own would be disadvantaged and lose some thousands of dollars. Our concern equally is with those people and, as I said, the total sum of investment in those funds stands at around $12 billion. Again as I have said, there is a need to attract more people into superannuation funds, particularly people on the lower marginal tax rates. Indeed, the Opposition's retirement policy looks to the situation whereby people who are in employment only part time and then opt out-perhaps women who seek to have children and leave the work force for some time and come back in-are afforded the advantage of being able to join a superannuation fund and maintain continuity. After all, women live longer than men-on average, nine years longer-and therefore, in a way, superannuation for women is of fundamental importance. Of course, by and large, it is women who are on those lower marginal tax rates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Temporary Chairman, I raise a point of order. We are at present, I thought, debating whether or not to support two Democrats' amendments that relate quite specifically to one section of the legislation dealing with one of the types of superannuation funds which, according to the Government, may escape the net of the Opposition's general exemption amendment. I do not need to be patronised by Senator Bishop; nor would I have thought it appropriate for an honourable senator to discuss the discrimination against women in the superannuation field. I would have thought that this was more appropriate to a speech at the second reading stage. What I want to know is whether or not our amendments with regard to these funds will be accepted by the Opposition-as a safety measure-and, if not, why not.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Senator BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Temporary Chairman. Senator Haines directed her attention to a doubt put in her mind by the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, as to whether or not there is a need for a different class of superannuation funds to be looked at. Indeed, Senator Haines makes the presumption that, in the event that the Minister was correct, her amendments would deal with the doubt that he raises. The remarks I was making with regard to superannuation generally and the reasons for the Opposition's concern and support for a system of superannuation which encourages savings are just as relevant to Senator Haines's amendments as they were to my own amendments. Therefore, I feel that the point of order that was raised was not relevant to what I had to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I was in the process of saying, there is a need to encourage women-who, by and large, are on the lower marginal tax rates and, as I said, live on average nine years longer than men-into superannuation schemes. In our view, the Opposition's amendments to excise the tax on superannuation investment funds are an attractive proposition to enlarge the number of people entering into superannuation funds so that the superannuation figures grow from the 39 per cent figure for the private sector and the 67 per cent figure for the public sector. I also raised the point that there is a need-which we acknowledge in our policy-to cater for the whole group of people in the community who work for a period of years within the paid work force, then leave it for a time and return to it. There is a need for continuity so that they may enjoy the benefits of superannuation as well. </PARA>
<PARA> When dealing with our own amendments I dealt with the question of confusion within the industry about how satisfactory the Bills were. I mentioned that the Life Underwriters Association of Australia had urged the Opposition to disregard calls from some sections of the life insurance industry for the immediate passage of this Bill, regardless of its faults, in order to avoid administrative inconvenience. Certainly the question of administrative inconvenience is a relevant one, for the simple reason that the statement was made in May 1988 and we are only now dealing with the package of Bills. Indeed, it is not surprising that we are having to deal with the area of doubt raised by the Minister, for the simple reason that the boffins of Treasury have taken some 12 months to prepare this massive and complicated package of legislation. Yet the industry, let alone the poor person who is contributing to the superannuation funds, has been given only days to try to absorb the complexity of the Bills and deal with their full ramifications. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very important that a stand be taken with regard to this particular tax which, as I said earlier, on our estimates is worth only between $20m and $120m of revenue in a package which in total is worth $1.4 billion. We should look at the whole rationale of the Government in saying that it is entitled to acquire early the tax on this money which it would normally receive when the benefit fell due to the person who has made this long term commitment to savings. The Government is saying, `Oh, no. We want to have that money now. We want the benefit of that money which is lying in superannuation funds to be paid up front instead of at the end'. So the whole thrust of this whole package of Bills is really to achieve a simple tax take. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it was significant that when we listened to the speeches at the second reading stage we heard the point made that during the six years that this Government has been in office there have been some 20 alterations to superannuation provisions, which is hardly conducive to making people feel safe and secure in the investment of their hard-earned long term savings. In fact, this history, including this package, has seen taxation of superannuation generally increase by some 1,000 per cent. That is a tremendous indictment of a government whose policies fit into an economy in decline at a time when we have concerns about whether we will be able to create a more substantial savings ratio in this country and see a more healthy domestic economy develop. I find that the amendments moved by the Democrats would not solve the problems they purport to solve. Accordingly, the Opposition will not be supporting them. However, we will, as I said, pursue the matter of the need to have policies in place which will generate--</PARA>
