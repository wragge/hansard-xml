<TITLE>Violent Television Programs</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, that:</PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned about the increase in violent television programmes for children and particularly those programmes promoting violent toys that are available for sale in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray;</PARA>
<PARA>That you support the Broadcasting (Prohibition of Violent Programmes for Children) Act 1988 which has been prohibited by WA Independent Senator for Nuclear Disarmament, Jo Vallentine. This act aims to prohibit the broadcasting of children's TV programmes that are violent and that promote toys modelled on characters, weapons or other war accessories which are also available for sale in Australia.</PARA>

<TITLE>X-rated and Violent Video Material</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Video Material has concluded that ``Adverse effects upon people, and especially upon children, of exposure to material containing various degrees of violence, pornography or obscenity have been demonstrated''.</PARA>
<PARA> The majority of the Select Committee strongly opposed the proposition for a new NVE (non-violent erotica) category, which would have entrenched X-rated video pornography.</PARA>
<PARA> All six State Governments have, through their Attorneys-General, expressed unanimous opposition to the circulation of X-rated videos.</PARA>
<PARA> We consider the continuing distribution of X-rated videos from the A.C.T. to be reprehensible and to be contrary to the wellbeing of the Australian community in general.</PARA>
<PARA> We strongly request urgent Government action to prohibit the distribution of X-rated and excessively violent video material.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Home Ownership</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families</PARA>
<PARA> Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Hawke-Keating government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many Australians out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray</PARA>

<TITLE>Queensland: Disaster Relief Funds</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, that:</PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned that the National Party in Queensland is diverting money given by the Federal Government to the Queensland Government to alleviate natural disasters; that it might not be finding its way to its intended targets; and that it is being diverted to the coffers of the National Party itself or otherwise to expansion projects promoted by members or supporters of the National Party.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray the Federal Government be asked to legislate for an audit of account from the Queensland Government for every dollar or cent provided by the Federal Government for any type of relief operation in Queensland.</PARA>

<TITLE>Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament; the humble petition of the undersigned showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That Kingsford-Smith Airport is becoming increasingly congested and existing facilities are inadequate to handle the number of aircraft or their passengers.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government's plans to divert aircraft from Mascot to Bankstown and/or increase landing charges for peak periods will do little to relieve congestion and will place enormous financial and other burdens on commuter airlines and their passengers.</PARA>
<PARA> We therefore call on the Federal Government to take heed of airline and travel industry warnings and-</PARA>
<PARA> 1. give immediate approval for the construction of a third runway at Mascot</PARA>
<PARA> 2. upgrade existing radar and other traffic control facilities to enable Australia's high safety record to be maintained.</PARA>

<PARA> that we believe a patient's doctor is clearly the best judge for medication needed for their particular illness and that it is therefore wrong and unfair to force that doctor to waste valuable time referring to a case to a person in Canberra who has no personal knowledge of that case.</PARA>

<TITLE>Peace Tax Fund</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully brings to your attention:</PARA>
<PARA> that there are individuals who have a conscientious objection to war because of their religious or general moral principles</PARA>
<PARA> and that the Parliament of this country has already recognised the right of such individuals not to have to participate in military service in time of war</PARA>
<PARA> and that all Australian taxpayers are required to contribute to military expenditure, regardless of their beliefs, through that part of their tax that is used for the Defence budget</PARA>
<PARA> and that while we acknowledge the right of the Government to levy taxes and to decide on the expenditure of monies so collected we cannot accept that those with a conscientious objection to war should be forced to contribute to military expenditure</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that the Federal Government will acknowledge the right of those who have a conscientious objection to war to withhold their taxes from military allocations and enable the military related proportion of their taxes to be used for peaceful purposes only</PARA>
<PARA> and, as we note that taxes are collected or disbursed for specific purposes (such as for Medicare), that the Commissioner of Taxation be directed that the military-related proportion of taxes collected from conscientious objectors to war be set aside in a separate fund, the Peace Tax Fund, to be used only for peaceful purposes, such purposes to be determined by the Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I seek leave to make a statement to the Senate regarding a question asked of me by Senator Reid yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Reid asked me about an alteration to the transcript of an answer I gave on 17 October 1988 as Minister representing the Minister for Community Services and Health. The facts concerning Senator Reid's question are as follows. She asked me a question on `health nutrition' on 12 October 1988 which at the time I put on notice. I obtained an answer by the end of Question Time on that day and then read it into the Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 17 October I added to my answer of 12 October. The Daily Hansard of 17 October contains in my answer the words `. . . however, the scientific positions will be retained'. These words were deleted by Hansard, at the request of one of my staff, in the final Hansard record, the Weekly Hansard. The request for the deletion was made because after 17 October the Department of Community Services and Health advised my office that Hansard needed a correction. I did not understand this to be a request for an important or substantial change, and certainly not one that would alter the sense of the answer. As I have said, Hansard was approached and the alteration was made. </PARA>
<PARA> The silly thing is that the words could have stood and, indeed, could now be reinserted. There was certainly never any intention on my part to misinform, confuse or conceal anything from Senator Reid or the Senate. Now that Senator Reid has drawn my attention to the matter I have reread the question and the answers and can see that, from her point of view, she has some cause to complain that the meaning may have been altered. Alternatively, I can see how my staff and Hansard could be of a contrary view. However, it would be wrong for me to quibble about this and the words should go back in. That would be consistent with my wish to answer completely and fully. I formally request that the words be put back in. I especially do not wish Hansard or my staff to be blamed for what has happened. I believe the buck must stop with me. I accept the responsibility for the circumstance and I apologise to the Senate for it. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the real issue raised by Senator Reid in her question relating to the nutrition section of the Department of Community Services and Health. In view of yesterday's developments I again asked the Department whether there was any further explanatory information that could be provided. It advised:</PARA>
<PARA>There has been no reduction in the number of science officers in the nutrition area since the recent organisational changes nor has the Department any plans to reduce the number of science officers in that area in the next financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, so I can assure Senator Reid on this point, if for any reason the situation should change I undertake to let her know. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In light of the confirmation by the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) of the matter which has been raised, pursuant to contingent notice I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Chaney) moving a motion relating to the consideration of a matter concerning the alteration of Senate Hansard by the Minister for Resources. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not wish to mislead the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray). It would be my intention, if that motion is carried-I think I would have the support of the Australian Democrats in carrying it-to move a motion which censures the Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, and calls upon the President to enforce strictly the rule that senators' corrections in Hansard must not have the effect of deleting words actually spoken so as to alter the sense of words spoken. My motion, although couched in those general terms, is to enable me to move a motion in those terms. </PARA>
<PARA> I will speak at least briefly to the motion to suspend Standing Orders but if the Manager of Government Business indicates that he is going to accept it-which is often the case in these matters-I will cease and move the substantive motion that I wish to put before the chamber. My reason for wishing to suspend Standing Orders would be clear to all honourable senators. A number of honourable senators on the Opposition benches made clear by their interjections the response, which I think is a proper response, to the explanation given by Senator Cook. What we have and what has been raised by Senator Reid is an undisputed case of an alteration of Hansard which does alter the sense of the statement which was made not off the cuff but in a considered way by the Minister on the advice of his Department. We have a situation where the clear meaning of the words has been totally changed by the removal of a sentence from the Hansard. That is clearly not a satisfactory situation for the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) censures the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) for the improper alteration to the Hansard transcript of 17 October 1988 to alter the sense of his answer to a question relating to nutrition services provided by the Department of Community Services and Health; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) calls on the President to enforce strictly the rule that Senators' corrections to Hansard must not have the effect of deleting from the record words actually spoken in debate so as to alter the sense of words spoken. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the essential tools of the parliamentary process and a tool which has been an essential part of the process for generations now is the issuing of a Hansard record of what is said in this Parliament. What is said in this Parliament is regarded as important. Misleading the Parliament is regarded as one of the few cardinal sins of politics which usually result in the removal of a Minister from his position. On a daily basis we all rely on the Hansard to confirm the comments which have been made, the words which have been spoken, whether by Ministers or senators in this place or, indeed, by Ministers and members of the other chamber. The keeping and accuracy of that record is a matter of fundamental importance to the good operation of the whole parliamentary system. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not a new matter to have members of parliament seeking to change the record. Mr President, you would know from your own experience in the chair and from your reading of the history of this place that it goes back to the very beginning of Federation that issues have been raised about the propensity of members to change the parliamentary record. The rules have been clear and well established from virtually the beginning of this century. If we go back to 1906, we find that the Speaker of the House of Representatives laid down a rule in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> No alterations of Hansard are permissible, but corrections are allowed . . . Any member is at liberty to make any corrections which will bring the report into closer agreement with what he actually said. </PARA>
<PARA> But alterations of Hansard-that is to say, changes in the sense of what has been said, so that the Hansard report makes an honourable member say something which he did not say, or something of a different tenor-such changes as that, which I deem alterations, and not corrections, are not permissible, and ought not to be attempted by any honourable member. </PARA>
<PARA> In the debate on this issue, and the rulings which have been given and the words that have been written since that time, one finds that that fundamental statement remains accurate, and one finds that these words have been blessed by continued usage since they were laid down in about 1918:</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members are respectfully requested to note that emendations which alter the sense of words used in debate or introduce new matter are not admissible. </PARA>
<PARA>I doubt whether in this debate there will be any particular difference of view about what the rules are with respect to the operation of Hansard. Again, therefore, I do not wish to labour the point. As Mr Hughes, as a private member of parliament-and I do not think these words will go amiss-said:</PARA>
<PARA> Alterations in form but not in substance are properly allowed, because, when an honourable member is addressing the chamber, he is so torn by conflicting emotions and troubled with interjections that his delicate equilibrium is disturbed and he recovers himself only with difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that in many cases that is the reason for our ungrammatical expressions, which are so kindly corrected by Hansard-and about which, of course, nobody raises any objection. But in this case we are dealing with a change which, on the Minister's own admission, is a change which is outside the guidelines on what is permitted. In the documents that were attached to the Minister's pinks these words are stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Necessary corrections may be made, but alterations of sense or the introduction of new matter are not admissible. </PARA>
<PARA>What Senator Cook has clearly admitted, and what the record clearly shows, is that there has been an amendment to the sense of the answer which he gave. </PARA>
<PARA> The practical importance of that is demonstrated by the fact that in this case, as I am advised by Senator Reid, this was an answer which was of considerable interest to her constituency, and she in fact circulated the Minister's original answer as reported in the Daily Hansard to those people who had been making representations to her. It was a matter that was regarded as of some moment, and she might have something to say later in the debate about the particular staffing position to which the Minister has referred in his answer today. </PARA>
<PARA> This Minister has been courageous enough not to seek to shift the blame to his staff or to departmental officials, and I welcome that because he is the person responsible. What happened in this case is that, not in the emotion of debate but on a considered basis, the Minister put down a statement which was provided for him by the Department of Community Services and Health and then, on the initiative of the Department of Community Services and Health, he brought about the removal of a particular sentence which was of major importance to the answer which was given-namely, that `the scientific positions', which had been queried by Senator Reid, `will be retained'. In those circumstances, we face the situation where there has clearly been a falsification of the record. That is totally unsatisfactory. It is totally destructive of the good operation of this chamber and, indeed, of this Parliament. We believe, therefore, that it is a proper basis for the censure of this Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the motion raises a second point which goes to you, Mr President, as the responsible Presiding Officer. Again, it has been long accepted that it is your office that has the final responsibility for the material that appears in the Hansard report. At page 141 of the fifth edition of Odgers' Australian Senate Practice there is reference to the statement of Sir Magnus Cormack, the then President of the Senate, on 26 September 1972 explaining that it was the well-established practice that the President has the final responsibility for the material that appears in the Hansard report of the Senate proceedings. Odgers stated:</PARA>
<PARA>For many years the President has exercised this authority to direct the Principal Parliamentary Reporter to expunge from the record objectionable matter, irregular questions and offensive remarks withdrawn at the direction of the Chair. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, in this motion we call upon you to enforce strictly the rule that senators' corrections to Hansard must not have the effect of deleting from the record words actually spoken in debate so as to alter the sense of words spoken. I think that the Minister's position would have been clear had that been understood as a clear duty of Hansard under your direction. On the basis of what has been put forward by the Minister, he would have been given cause for pause to consider the matter in more detail than he apparently did in making the changes which were made. I believe that it is in the interests of Ministers, as well as all senators, to have that rule strictly enforced. If we are to have a situation where, in excessive enthusiasm, senators or their staff seek to change the meaning of the record which has been taken by Hansard, there should be an automatic check on that or at least a query which will ensure that people are put on guard if this matter arises again. Mr President, I ask you to support the motion in terms of its call to you to ensure that the proper rules are followed. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook is entitled to credit for coming into this place and accepting responsibility for the matter which occurred. However, I do not believe that that is a reason for the Senate simply regarding this as a matter which should be let pass. The proper operation of this place is not automatic. As this incident shows, departmental officials and members of ministerial staff are prepared to see a clear falsification of the record take place, and the reason is not explained. The extraordinary thing about the Minister's statement is that he has claimed that the sentence could have stood; that in fact there has been no reduction in the number of scientific places within the Department. That renders even more extraordinary and inexplicable the preparedness of departmental and ministerial office officials to change the clear meaning of the record in this place. If they are prepared to do that in the sorts of circumstances which the Minister has outlined, one could be far less sanguine about the attitude that might be adopted when there is some heavy political import. </PARA>
<PARA> One recalls that the last time we debated such a matter it involved Minister Evans, who was then the Attorney-General, who had added a word which he had not said in an answer to a question which he gave in this place. On that occasion there was very detailed debate as to whether or not that had changed the meaning of the statement which had been made. There can be no such debate on this occasion. It is quite clear that there has been a falsification of the record in a quite meaningful sense. In those circumstances, the Opposition believes it is appropriate that the Minister should be censured and that you, Mr President, should be called upon to enforce the proper rules in a strict manner through Hansard, which is ultimately under your control. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not believe that it is appropriate in these circumstances for the Senate to carry a censure motion. When this matter was first brought to my attention I provided, as quickly as I possibly could, a full, frank and honest explanation as to what happened.

So the answer given would have been consistent on that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have also provided on the issue raised by Senator Reid a more full explanation of the detail. I have advised the Senate that I will keep Senator Reid-because I recognise that it is a matter relating to some of her constituents-further advised on the matter. Having said that, I do not accept what Senator Chaney has said about a falsification because my own basic understanding--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am coming to that, Senator. My basic understanding as to what ministerial responsibility is in answering a question is actually to answer the question that is asked. My standing instruction to my staff on that score is actually to answer the question that was asked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we look at the question that Senator Reid asked me on 12 October, we see that she did not explicitly ask me a question on that point. That may well be regarded as a pedantic interpretation of what the question was, because it is obvious from a discussion I had with Senator Reid after the event what the intention of the question was. It was because of that obviousness, and because I had no need to conceal or delay, that a second answer was supplied several days later. That is why there are two answers to this question. </PARA>
<PARA> In the second answer there was more elaboration on what Senator Reid was actually asking. What Senator Reid was actually asking was whether the quality of the nutritional services section of the Department of Community Services and Health was to be reduced in any way. She asked that, as is her right, and as is commonly the right of honourable senators, in a political context in the form of an allegation against the Government. If she had asked me explicitly, `Has staffing been reduced?', that would have been an explicit question, but she did not ask me that question. So when my staff interpreted the question they believed, and I believe Hansard believed, that there was no alteration to the semantic meaning of those words and therefore there was no fabrication of the record. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it would be entirely unforgivable for any allegation to be made that there was a deliberate attempt to fabricate to be believed in this chamber. I believe that I am entitled to be believed in the explanation that I have given. There was not any attempt to do that. In retrospect, the responsibility or the fault in this matter was that I did not check what it was that was being changed in Hansard after I knew that the Department had some quibble with the answer that was given. As I said, I recall speaking to Senator Reid after the first answer had been given, her indicating to me the question of staffing, and my indication that I would get a more full answer. I knew what she really wanted to know, as opposed to what the pedantic words on the page were. </PARA>
<PARA> When the indication was that there may need to be a correction, I did not examine what the correction would be. To that extent, I have been, I believe, in error in not following through all those details. Rather than leave it to my staff, I should have done it myself. Therefore, that explains why my staff and Hansard acted in a way that was consistent with their understanding of the circumstances and why, had I paid closer attention to the issue, the matter would never have arisen. Having made that explanation, I do not believe that there has been a deliberate falsification or a falsification in fact. There has been a quite important misunderstanding, and I have acted at each point to try to assist Senator Reid in getting an answer. I do not resile from that. I hope I will continue to do that in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The other factor that needs to be mentioned goes to the background of this issue. There is something called the establishment figure that departments maintain and there is something called the approved staffing figure that departments maintain. In drawing up tight answers and tight questions on these matters, sometimes there is a propensity to use the establishment figure and the actual staffing figure interchangeably. That is not the case. I think there was in this case some genuine misunderstanding about the context of the positions referred to in Senator Reid's question. Hopefully, the fuller explanation I have given resolves that question. I have promised to continue to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, I do not think there is any need for me to make a long speech, other than to say that I do not think it is reasonable or fair, in these circumstances, to hold any allegation against Hansard. It acted properly in all the circumstances of what was before it. I certainly do not think it is proper for me to in any way blame my staff. It is my responsibility. What my staff do is an extension of what I do and that is my responsibility. I accept that. My error was in not matching my personal understanding of the intention of Senator Reid's question with what appeared on the actual page and not following through on that detail. That was a mistake. I regret it. It was a glitch; it was no more than that. I do not believe it was a serious miscarriage of anything. Ministers are human and do make mistakes. But the real question about making mistakes is not that mistakes are made by human beings, but what human beings do when a mistake is made. In these circumstances I believe I have acted properly. I think if one takes a reasonable and wider understanding of the whole circumstances, rather than a narrow and political point-scoring stance, what has occurred is understandable. </PARA>
<PARA> On that basis, I do not think the material is a matter for censure. It would be improper for the Senate to move to that level, which is the repudiation of actions taken by Ministers. That is quite serious. I do not think the matter is of that quality. The Senate should not proceed to censure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must join Senator Chaney in commending Senator Cook for accepting the responsibility for the deletion and for apologising to the Senate for that. I know it must be tempting, when one is exceedingly busy, to blame one's staff to whom one does pass on a lot of responsibility. It gives Senator Cook at least some brownie points that he was prepared to accept the full responsibility for this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, having said that, I am afraid I cannot agree with his somewhat disingenuous assertion in his explanation that the alterations did not affect the sense of his response. They quite clearly did. They were not extraneous words. They were not the result of tidying up the grammar. They were not an attempt to make sense out of what was, or could perhaps have been, a garbled response. Senator Cook is not in the habit of making garbled responses. I do not think Hansard would have had to spend a great deal of time tidying up his grammar or organising the words he puts together. This matter does not fall into that category. </PARA>
<PARA> The change which was made quite clearly alters the sense of the answer to the question asked by Senator Reid. But much more importantly than that, the removal of these particular words removed an undertaking made by the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) with regard to the staffing in the nutrition services program. The words deleted were:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . however, the scientific positions will be retained. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a statement, a commitment, made by the Minister from his position in the Government and in the Parliament. It is not good enough for the Minister to say that the deletion did not alter the sense of the answer-because it clearly did-and that, in any event, if it did alter the sense, it did not really matter. Everything is okay because the guarantee could have been left in. That is a classic parliamentary example of the lawyer's old broken window argument. I admire the honourable senator for thinking of this way out of his dilemma, but it simply is not good enough, because just as easily the reverse could have been true. As Senator Chaney pointed out, it is here that the real problem lies. </PARA>
<PARA> Hansard is a record of what is said in this place. Sometimes it is merciful that Hansard gets around to altering some of the things said, or at least the way in which they are said, because I suspect that if what was said were left in its original form, the general public would have even less confidence in the capacity of its elected representatives to cope, or even to think, than it currently has. </PARA>

Under the Acts Interpretation Act it can be used to interpret legislation, to give the courts an idea of what Ministers and the Government intended legislation to mean. It is important, therefore, that Ministers in particular do not abuse this situation by saying one thing in the chamber-whether it is a considered comment or whether it is an off the cuff comment, or whether it is a comment made in the heat of the moment in response to an interjection does not matter-and then feeling free on reflection, mature or otherwise, to change, add to or delete words from their statement.</PARA></TALK.START>

I do not want to quibble about semantics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Cook may not have, in his view, falsified the records. He may have felt, even after deleting the words with regard to the scientific positions, that he still answered Senator Reid's question. But that too is not the point. Whether it was gratuitous or otherwise, the words were said. The undertaking was given, and to remove it causes a considerable problem. Whether he likes it or not, he has certainly changed the sense and, in a very real way, the value of the answer that he gave to Senator Reid. This is simply not acceptable. So for that reason-and with considerable regret, I might say, since I have a personal respect and liking for Senator Cook-we will be supporting Senator Chaney's motion. I hope that the Minister, or anyone else in this place for that matter, will not in future feel free to make changes of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA> I can imagine the pressure that can be applied to Hansard by the arguments that can be given by a staff member, a member of parliament or a Minister who feels strongly about wanting things changed, but it is important that we stand by what is said in here and that people do not feel free to make changes to words they regret having said, to words that they find afterwards are in fact not true or to words that are causing a bit of a problem for the Government at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope the President, therefore, will strictly enforce the usual conventions regarding changes, in particular additions or deletions, to the record of words spoken in debate where the sense could or would be changed as a result. Nobody in this place actually wants you, Mr President, to make sure that the Hansard daily, weekly or bound versions show exactly what is said in this place because that would only damage the credibility of the Parliament, but we cannot have the credibility of Government Ministers challenged or brought into disrepute in any way. We will be supporting Senator Chaney's motion. I hope that Ministers do not feel free in the future to take out words which they or the Government, on reflection, no longer feel comfortable with. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to join the debate only briefly. I am bemused by the information that has been given. I do not think the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) has explained what the true position is with this nutrition section. He now says that the words can be replaced and that they need not have been taken out. That really does make me wonder why the words were taken out in the first place, how they ever got into the statement that he read to the Senate, and why someone in the Department of Community Services and Health then felt the matter was sufficiently significant to ask a member of his staff to get them removed. That has not been explained. It is even more significant, given that there are job losses in that area and that the number of people employed is not the same as it was prior to the move.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Cook in a sense has attempted to suggest that it is all my fault that this happened because my question was not sufficiently explicit in the first place. He suggested that my question was a little political. If that is true, it would not be the first time that a question had been asked in Question Time that had a political overtone to it. In fact, some of the questions from the Government side to its own Ministers are of that nature. Having reread my question of 12 October 1988, I feel quite certain that what I was getting at was absolutely clear. It was clear what I was trying to find out and what I thought about what the Government was doing. I do not resile from making plain what I thought about that. The question contained statements and questions. It is interesting to reflect on the answer the Minister gave initially. His first reaction to my question was to say:</PARA>
<PARA>After a long preface-</PARA>
<PARA>he cannot suggest I did not tell him what I was on about-</PARA>
<PARA>the honourable senator asked three questions, all of which could be classified as `When are you going to stop beating your wife?' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the reaction I got to my question on the first bite at it. He then backed away from that fiery encounter and said he would seek a full reply from the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett), and he did come back at the end of Question Time. He did not at that stage seem to be confused by what I was asking, and he indicated that there would be some staff savings as a result of what was going on. Of course these staff savings, as Senator Cook called them, were confirmed when he came back again on 17 October with a prepared written statement, which he read into the Hansard and which included the words `however, the scientific positions will be retained'. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, you will not be surprised to know that I posted that reply to all of those people who had contacted me about the downgrading of the nutrition section, as the Government was seeking to use the funds to support the health advancement program. That was the point I was making. I question the integrity of the Minister's staff in indulging in this exercise. I shall not say much about Hansard because it is not in a position to answer in this place. I really do doubt that anybody could think that removing the words `however, the scientific positions will be retained' is not significantly changing the sense of what was being talked about. </PARA>
<PARA> The real issue, of course, is that the section has been downgraded. It is two positions down at present. The papers given to the union discussing this show quite clearly that the Government intended to reduce positions in this area-the area of scientific research within the Department dealing with the very important matter of food composition data, the information that tells people, other researchers, doctors, what is in the food we eat. Anyone who does not think that is very important is missing out on a very significant area of knowledge in medical research. The research involves the nutritional intake of Australians and fatty acids in the Australian diet-all absolutely vital. This is the area being downgraded as the Government seeks to move into the area of health advancement, with what I would call a glossy program of endorsement of what it says it wants to do. It is really a promotion of the Government itself rather than a concentration on the real issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I spoke about the matter again in the Senate on 28 November, in debate on the Appropriation Bills. I did not specifically refer to the Minister's answer, although I did refer to it when I dealt with the cutback in staff. That is recorded in the Hansard of that date. I did not know at that stage that the Minister had already corrected his answer. What I said then was based on his claim that the Government was not reducing numbers in this section when in fact it has. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three issues in this matter. One is the question of the Minister's responsibility which, as has been recognised and acknowledged, he has admitted. However, I am surprised that staff in a Minister's office would do what has been done in this case. I am surprised that Hansard acceded to the request. I say that the Government has downgraded the significance of the area that I was referring to, and I hope that the Minister will let us have further information about it. It is certainly not the last time that I shall mention the matter of research and nutrition in the Senate, but the question before us today is how we manage our affairs and present ourselves to the community. It is quite clear from Odgers' Australian Senate Practice that this alteration ought not to have been made. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>Senators may make necessary corrections to the typescript, but emendations altering the sense or introducing new matter are not admissible. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest most strongly that the deletion of the words in question clearly altered the sense of the answer that the Minister gave. I support the motion moved by Senator Chaney. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, that might be the only nice thing I have done this week. I enjoy the feeling. In terms of the matters which have been raised in this debate, the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) would be well advised to seek further information from his Department in light of the apparent difference between what he has now told us and what Senator Reid has said she understands the position to be with respect to the employment of nutritionists. I am sure that the last thing the Minister wishes is to have to face us next week on the basis of misleading the Senate. I ask him, therefore, to examine that matter and seek further advice from the Department. The concerns Senator Reid has raised are ones which she has been examining for some time, and there appears to be some difference between the version the Minister has given us and the view that she has put forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister in his response to this matter has confessed to and taken responsibility for what occurred. He has simply said that it is not a matter on which he should be censured. I wish to make a couple of points as to why we regard this matter as being of very great significance. The Minister's defence that in his answer he went beyond the question which was asked is not relevant to the matters we have raised. Ministers in this place often give answers to questions which have very little to do with the question asked. They use answers to questions, as Ministers have been quite open about this week, to make a statement about the Government's position on a particular matter. It therefore does not matter that a Minister has gone beyond answering the question that was put. The reliance of the Senate on the accuracy of all the information put before us is of significance, whatever the relationship of what was said in the answer to the question that was asked. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Haines also raised a matter which is of very considerable significance and which I certainly did not raise in my original speech. The whole status of the parliamentary record has been changed by the amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act, to which she referred. It is a matter of only recent history that the courts have been entitled to look to Hansard to help them to understand and interpret the statutes which are passed by this Parliament. In those circumstances, the record itself has a legal significance which it did not have before. Therefore, the strict rules which have applied to changes become even more significant because they may affect not only argument in this place and in the community but also the interpretation and application of the laws which are passed by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point which should be made with respect to the Minister's explanation is that if in a department there is a view that an answer or even a supplementary answer is not completely representative of the truth, does not give all of the relevant information or in some way has the potential to mislead, quite clearly the procedure to follow is the one which the Minister himself followed in this case, that of giving a supplementary statement. Only yesterday Senator Gareth Evans explained and corrected an earlier answer, about which there is never any complaint in this place. The Minister's point about there having been a glitch is one which we reject. This is not a case in which there was some unintentional technical error. This is a case of the removal of words which clearly had a clear meaning and added considerably to the sense of the answer. In that sense we reject the Minister's defence that this was a mere technical point. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the principle is important. We believe that the passage of the two motions is important to send a message not to the Minister, who I am sure will be the most meticulous Minister in these matters henceforth, but to staff and to departments that these matters are regarded very seriously by the Parliament and that, therefore, the most serious action will be taken by the Parliament in such cases. I commend the motions to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! As I pointed out to Senator Chaney, the Chair has the discretion to divide a motion. It is usually done by request and not by the Chair, and therefore I appreciate Senator Chaney's actions. I have asked Hansard to provide me with an explanation as to how this matter occurred as soon as I leave the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question is that the first motion moved by Senator Chaney, namely, that the Senate censures the Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, for the improper alteration to the Hansard transcript of 17 October 1988 to alter the sense of his answer to a question relating to nutrition services provided by the Department of Community Services and Health, be agreed to. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill contains proposed amendments to six Acts. </PARA>
<PARA> the Air Navigation (Charges) Act 1952;</PARA>
<PARA> the Airports (Surface Traffic) Act 1960;</PARA>
<PARA> the Australian Centennial Roads Development Act 1988;</PARA>
<PARA> the Broadcasting Act 1942;</PARA>
<PARA> the Interstate Road Transport Act 1985; and</PARA>
<PARA> the Telecommunications Act 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> The Air Navigation (Charges) Act provides for landing charges in respect of aircraft using Commonwealth airports or other airports for which Commonwealth financial assistance is provided, and for penalties for late payment of those charges. There is provision in the Act for the refund or remission of these charges and penalties but currently no appeal mechanism against a decision to refuse a refund or remission. The amendment provided for in Part 2 of the Bill will provide an appropriate appeal mechanism. In the first instance, an affected person will be able to apply to the Secretary of the Department of Transport and Communications for a reconsideration of the decision. If the affected person is not satisfied after that review, he or she may then apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for further review. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment of the Airports (Surface Traffic) Act is a purely technical amendment, which affects the repeal of section 16 of that Act. This follows advice to the Department of Transport and Communications from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions that section 16 is now entirely unnecessary. Section 16 was included in the Act to prevent unmeritorious private prosecutions for offences against the Act. It is now superfluous as the Director of Public Prosecutions has the power to take over and discontinue any unwarranted private prosecutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment to the Australian Centennial Roads Development Act 1988 honours an undertaking given by Senator Evans in the Senate on 21 December last year during debate on the Bill for that Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act provides for a program of financial assistance for land transport over the next 5 years. The funds are provided by a designated share of the excise on motor spirit and diesel fuel, known as the charge rate. The charge rate can be varied in a determination made by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Some concern was expressed in that debate that a determination of the rate should be subject to Parliamentary scrutiny. The amendment meets this concern by providing that such a determination must be tabled in the Parliament, and is subject to disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also includes an amendment to the Broadcasting Act 1942 to enable the grant of limited broadcasting licences which involve transmissions from transponders on an AUSSAT satellite. This will correct an oversight in the scheme for limited licences which was introduced by the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Limited licences allow streamlined licensing of a range of broadcasting services which, because of restrictions on duration, purpose, content or other aspects, do not raise the same public interest concerns as conventional broadcasting licences. For example, teletext services will be authorised under limited licences. As the legislation currently stands, only terrestrial transmissions can be authorised under a limited licence. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions in this Bill will allow existing Remote Commercial Television Service licensees to seek limited licences to broadcast teletext services to remote area homesteads which have satellite receivers. It would also allow licensing, if and when appropriate, of other limited broadcasting services by satellite to remote homesteads. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also amends the Interstate Road Transport Act 1985 to introduce a scheme for payment of the charges due under the Act by instalments. Senators may recall that Senator Evans, then Minister for Transport and Communications, made this promise to representatives of truck drivers during the blockade outside Yass last year. The amendment is a further indication of this Government doing what is within its means to reduce the impediments to efficiency in the long distance road transport industry and to alleviate the financial burden carried by independent owner-drivers in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also amends the Interstate Road Transport Act to clarify the validity of regulations which are now in place for the enforcement of vehicle and trailer mass limits. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Telecommunications Act in Part 7 of the Act aim to validate a number of routine zonal and telex changes which had been inadvertently implemented by Telecom without authorisation in appropriate By-laws. These errors were first detected by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances in early 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Committee which includes Honourable Senators Opposite, Senators Stone, Bishop and Patterson, picked up some errors in a number of Telecom by-law amendments in early 1988. The errors date back to May 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result, Telecom was asked by the Committee to investigate the extent of the problem and to seek advice from the Attorney-General's Department on an appropriate remedy. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequent advice from the Attorney-General's Department indicated that the only way of rectifying the errors was through validating legislation and that this legislation would need to be retrospective. </PARA>
<PARA> When this advice was conveyed to the Committee it asked that validating legislation be introduced as soon as possible and was reluctant to allow any Telecom by-laws until a commitment was given that corrective action would be taken. </PARA>
<PARA> This commitment was given by the former Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support and the Telecommunications part of this Bill is a fulfilment of that undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill enables Telecom to make by-laws to correct the errors. These by-laws will be subject to Committee scrutiny before coming into force. </PARA>
<PARA> Routine changes to Telecom's zoning arrangements typically arise when obsolete exchanges are replaced by modern exchanges and the boundaries of charging zones, which relate to the location of exchanges, are consequently changed. Zoning determines charges and changes to zones require amendments to the by-laws. </PARA>
<PARA> Most zoning changes without by-law authorisation have not been zoning changes for the purpose of varying existing charges but have arisen as a result of additional zoning points in existing extended zones or additional exchanges in existing zones. These do not alter the call charges applicable. </PARA>
<PARA> In the remaining cases, changed call charging arrangements were put in place between particular exchanges or occurred as a result of the installation of new exchanges and the consequent transfer of customers from closed exchanges. Telecom is unable to identify the precise effect on individual customers. The new exchange arrangements resulted in higher charges in particular directions offset by lower charges in the other directions. The net result would depend on the individual customer's calling pattern. </PARA>
<PARA> Investigation of the above issues has also revealed errors in amendments to the Telecommunications (Telex Charging Areas) By-laws. These errors have arisen from clerical oversights in the listing of new exchanges and deletion of closed exchanges in the by-law amendments. They have not altered the charges applicable. </PARA>
<PARA> Under new legislation which will be introduced later this session, it is proposed that Telecom's zonal and charging arrangements be subject to simplified administrative arrangements which should ensure that such problems do not recur. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was just getting to the point of rounding up my speech on clause 8 of the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1988. Regarding the question of defence exports I think that often people who are looking only at the financial aspect of exporting forget about the end use of the products they are promoting. I think that we should be considering the point of impact and the suffering of the ultimate receivers of these so-called defence exports which would more realistically be labelled as components of offensive weapons systems, as instruments of repression, whether items are in the form of hardware, training apparatus or military expertise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Surely Australians can think of more creative and positive ways of improving our exports record. I do not believe that it is either morally acceptable or in our best interests strategically to be encouraging militarism in any way. Some of our exports could actually rebound on us. In raising these concerns about clause 8 of this Bill, I speak for hundreds of thousands of Australians. They include people who are totally opposed to any increase in the level of Australia's arms exports, people who see the urgency for international arms transfers to be curtailed, people who consider it morally abhorrent for Australia to be contributing in any way to the movement of arms around the globe, people who see trading in weapons as a massive social injustice and a wrong ordering of our priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> A former military man who was a five-star general and President of the United States of America, Dwight Eisenhower, once said words to this effect: Every missile that is tested, every gun that is fired, every weapon system that is deployed is a theft from the poor, the hungry and the oppressed of this world. That applies whether the weapons are actually used or not. The use of weapons results in a massive deflection of brainpower and financial resources from more socially useful pursuits. Let us encourage the arms manufacturers in Australia who look forward to these relaxations in export guidelines to be more positively creative, to dream up schemes for exporting pumps and windmills and appropriate energy and agricultural technology to our developing neighbour countries. It is time we started seriously the business of feeding the people instead of feeding the arms race. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall be addressing that part of the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1988 which deals with the relaxation in arms exports from Australia. I have just been reading an article by Frank Walker in the Sun-Herald of 21 August 1988 where this debate was foreshadowed. The article touched upon the hopeless protests of the Australian Labor Party's left wing members against the relaxation of arms trade controls. In the article John Langmore, a member of Parliament from Canberra, is quoted as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We don't know if Australian-made weapons have been sold on to third countries despite a ban . . . Israel has very strong arms connections with South Africa and I want to know if Australian-made arms could end up in South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA>In the article Frank Walker concludes:</PARA>
<PARA> The few protests from Mr Langmore and his friends inside the Caucus room and Democrats and Nuclear Disarmament senators are likely to be drowned out by the big guns of the Labor, Liberal and National parties. </PARA>
<PARA>In this debate so far we have heard some of the big guns but the barrage has not really been all that impressive. We have not had a barrage from the Government yet. I suppose that Senator Button will provide that when he concludes for the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is extraordinary that no-one from the Government who supports the legislation has bothered to speak in the debate. Those who oppose it are not able to speak in the debate. Instead, the Government, as it did in the bases debate in November last year, has left its arguments on this matter to be carried by the Opposition, once again showing a bipartisan approach to defence matters. This happens with discomforting frequency on matters of defence. On 24 November, when the Government announced that it was going to renew the leases on the bases for 10 years, it left the rest of us to debate the issue and did not participate in the debate on the following day. A number of left wing members of the Government were left on the hop. They were not expecting that decision. When they went to the press about it they were extremely distressed, but it was closing the gate after the horse had bolted. There was little they could do about it at that stage. </PARA>
<PARA> When we debated this matter on a previous occasion we had a foretaste of the tenor of the arguments of the Government and the Opposition. We heard from the Government senators the same tired old arguments for expediency and observations that the world is not perfect. We are, it seems, already morally compromised so a little more compromise will not matter. But of course it does matter a great deal. Senator Newman was less circumspect. As well as the usual vicious and unwarranted personal attacks she actually presented the Government's case without frills or evasions-even though she is from the Opposition. This was a wonderful example of the bipartisan approach to defence matters that we have seen in the Senate time and time again. In her speech in the Senate on 8 March she referred to our `diabolical economic position'. I will read some of her speech into the record. She wanted to:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . draw attention to the fact that the effort that is put into trying to stop these legitimate exports is similar to the efforts that are being put towards the prevention of legitimate exports of paper pulp. The same sorts of groups are dead keen to see that Australia does not improve its balance of trade position with regard to wood pulp exports. There is a group of people in this country who have no recognition of our diabolical economic position and who would try to push their unrealistic economic views down our throats to the disadvantage of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA>I wonder to what lengths Senator Newman would go to sell off this country. The paper pulp comes from the forests of the New South Wales south coast. I do not want to address this matter today because we will be talking about it next week. At present the paper pulp comes from mature, old age forests in New South Wales which are an essential wildlife refuge. I, for one, do not mind being associated with the people who are trying to stop the rape of those forests, to turn them into wood pulp for a foreign company at the other end. Similarly, I do not mind being one of the group of people in this Senate who oppose an increase in Australian arms exports for a whole variety of reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Newman has not expressed any concern for a sustainable value added timber industry, as is the sensible approach to the forests of the south-east coast of New South Wales. It seems that she would be prepared to sell off all Australia's natural resources to make a quick buck, to right the diabolical economic position, as she calls it. I wonder whether economic considerations should take precedence over all other considerations, including ethical considerations. Certainly, on the basis of what Senator Newman says that is her position. It seems that it is the Government's position too. </PARA>
<PARA> Towards the end of Senator Newman's speech she referred to what is effectively an illegal arms transfer. She chafed at the fact that, during the Vietnam war, Sweden, which opposed the Vietnam war, refused to sell arms directly to Australia and we could get those arms only through what effectively amounted to an illegal arms transfer. Sweden sold the arms to England and England then passed them on to us. Midway through her speech she said:</PARA>
<PARA> We must do all we possibly can to see that never again are we in the hands of people who would defeat our war effort. </PARA>
<PARA>Them's fighting words, Senator Newman. Not even the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) these days talks about `war effort'. He is much more circumspect. He uses the word `defence' and tries to make it mean what it says. I remind Senator Newman that Vietnam was not only a moral disaster but also a military fiasco whose effects are still being felt today. Not just the Swedish people, but many countries and many people all around the world opposed that war. Certainly within Australia a massive number of people opposed Australia's involvement in the Vietnam war. They believed that we had no business being in Vietnam, that it was a civil war in which we should not have taken part. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not agree with the honourable senator at all. Our involvement in it was a terrible mistake of history. However, surprisingly there is one point that Senator Newman raised that I agree with. She asked that the much heralded guidelines should be published quickly. I cannot understand why the guidelines are not before us today. All we have are the guidelines to the guidelines. So much effort has gone into explaining and reinterpreting the guidelines to the guidelines that I think we would all be better off if the Government had prepared the real thing before presenting this legislation to the chamber. At least then we would know what we were debating. The regulations will not be issued until after the legislation is passed. This is extraordinary. Once again we are debating this matter in the dark.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I find the choice of terms in the Defence Minister's news release of 14 June quite troubling and even sinister. It is the news release to which numerous honourable senators have referred, particularly Senator Vallentine and Senator Paul McLean. I would like to ask whether my apprehensions are well grounded. I think I know the answer to that question. In section 3, `Policy Constraints on Defence Exports', Minister Beazley writes this:</PARA>
<PARA>Under the new policy circumstances precluding defence exports are more tightly defined in terms of . . . violation of human rights with exports favoured where there is no reasonable risk of using the equipment against the citizens of a country with a dubious civil rights record. </PARA>
<PARA>May I ask what a reasonable risk is? Is it one where people are thrown into gaol for only one or two days, or is it one where one takes a bet and uses the rule of thumb? I find that sort of terminology very difficult to comprehend. When one puts it next to a reply by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, in the Senate on 24 May 1988 one becomes even more worried. In answer to a question on 24 May last year in relation to this matter Senator Ray said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Government expressly reserves the right to prohibit the export of military goods to governments that seriously violate the human rights or constitutional rights of their citizens . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What does `seriously violate' mean? Is it okay to export military goods to countries which violate human rights a little, or which do not quite so seriously violate human rights? I would like to know exactly what is meant. The terms seem to be shifting, the definition is unclear and the way seems to be open for an unethical application of this part of the guidelines to the guidelines. If one looks at section 4 of the press release one will see that, apparently, these qualifications in relation to policy constraints actually mean something amounting to balance. Section 4 is called `Balancing Interests'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Under the old policy, a defence export application could be vetoed on general foreign policy grounds. Under the new policy, balanced consideration of Australian commercial defence and international interests is required. </PARA>
<PARA>The term `commercial' has primacy in the listing here. There is no mention at all of ethical considerations. The next section of the press release points out that commercial considerations have to be clearly outweighed for a sale to be vetoed:</PARA>
<PARA>Defence, strategic or foreign policy objections must be specific and must outweigh export benefits in a particular case. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 5, called `Clearer Responsibility', describes the exclusion of broader consultation on arms exports. The Minister for Defence will nearly always be the sole arbiter. The fast track 21-day decisions will accentuate the Minister's responsibilities. Under this legislation it is clear that the onus of proof will be on the Government if it wants to prevent exports rather than on the exporter to prove why goods should be sold, as in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the little ironies of this legislation is that the Governor-General, Mr Bill Hayden, by his title nominally holds the keys to the arms export chest. Section 112 (1) of the Customs Act states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Governor-General may prohibit the export of goods from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>He will be advised by the Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley. This is a situation, I imagine, that Mr Hayden might find somewhat galling if he is allowed to retain his judgment and moral scruples in his present position. Even if he were allowed to I doubt whether he would exercise his reserve powers even on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> How true it is that we really appreciate people only when they are gone. Now we see Mr Hayden walking in an air of glory. Before, we noticed the suits and the unmistakable cadences of the Hayden voice and, more recently, the luxurious abandon of his proto-vice-regal jaunt. Bill Hayden used to know what a principle looked like. He knew what value to place on Australia's international reputation and he also had a good understanding of the economic realities of the international arms trade. I shall quote reports about Bill Hayden that have not been referred to earlier during this debate. An article in the Australian on 16 June last year states:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hayden said that despite the relaxation in controls he would continue to fight against inappropriate arms sales, as he had done in the past to prevent big sales to regional hot spots. ``But there must be morality, there must be principle,'' he said. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to see Senator Button talk about that particular quote from Mr Hayden. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3K4">Senator DUNN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall be glad to repeat it for Senator Button. I will give him a copy of Mr Hayden's quote. The 1986 report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence-Disarmament and Arms Control-quoted Mr Bill Hayden speaking at the University of Western Australia, Mr Hayden asserted:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>we will be more active in the search for ways to reduce this flow of arms. Action will be taken aimed at stopping black market trade in arms. As I indicated in my speech to the UN General Assembly we consider these three goals are ideal subjects for consideration by the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA>In answer to Mr Beazley's assertion that arms exports would more than double to $500m per annum Mr Hayden said that the additional sales would be marginal and `it's unfortunate the media hype has given the impression that we are going to get out to the centre of the arms bazaar hollering what our wares are'. What he said when asked if it were possible to increase sales to $500m, is reported as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>I think that can be done either if you are prepared to wait long enough or if we have hyper-inflation or if the Australian exchange rate skyrockets. </PARA>
<PARA> We won't be selling much else (if that happened) and I find it very doubtful if people will be wanting to pay a huge increase in costs. </PARA>
<PARA>We know what happened to poor Mr Hayden and his principles; he got rolled in Cabinet. Mr Beazley is an interesting Minister. He is one of Labor's `new men'. He is bluff; he is pragmatic; he has his sleeves rolled up; and he is not afraid to get his hands a bit dirty. Moral relativism is at the core of his position. Honourable senators should listen to his statement referring to Sweden which he made at the Just Defence Conference in 1986:</PARA>
<PARA>If you don't like how we now look at a defence exporter think what we might look like if we went into a Swedish defence industry mode. </PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what worries me. Our hands could be much dirtier. The Department of Defence is effectively carving out an arms trade empire, perhaps to employ all those bureaucrats who used to shuffle papers backwards and forward under the system that Mr Cooksey criticised so scathingly. Is this change a Government decision or is Mr Beazley the creature of a subterranean Sir Humphrey in the bunkers of the Defence Department?</PARA>
<PARA> During my time in this place I have become much more aware of the independent agendas that are generated in particular departments out of their special interests and, in this case, international contacts. Under new guidelines the Department of Defence will be responsible for both generating the sales of arms and deciding whether those sales will fall within the guidelines. Some would argue that there is clearly a conflict of interest in this dual role. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some schizophrenic contradictions in Australia's arms trade position. It is not the only area of paradox, but on issues like nuclear deterrence the Government has the excuse that it will suffer repercussions if it deviates from our major ally's policy line. With arms exports Australia has a free choice. Mr Hayden was aware of these embarrassing contradictions when he complained in the United Nations:</PARA>
<PARA>I can't go to the United Nations special session on disarmament, as I did a fortnight ago in New York, (and) talk about our commitment in Australia . . . to work to try to cut back the arms trade . . . and then come back home and talk about a huge burst in the sale of conventional arms. </PARA>
<PARA>This quote should be repeated time and time again. It clearly shows up the hypocrisy of the present Government's position. No-one was placed in a more difficult position, as Senator McLean pointed out, than Mr Richard Butler, our former Ambassador for Disarmament. Among his other efforts he has been striving to persuade the United Nations to take up the issue of the conventional arms trade, especially its effect upon poverty stricken Third World countries. In a paper delivered at the defence conference at the Australian National University last December he commented upon the reception this initiative received. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>We have taken a new departure on the issue of international arms transfers and the international arms trade generally. The first thing that can be said of this stance is that it has been by no means popular. But the facts with respect to the impact of such trade on both security and economy are clear. We have steadfastly asserted that these facts need to be addressed by major arms exporters and importers, some of the latter of which are developing countries with major economic and financial problems, and by the international community generally. Opposition to this initiative including at the United Nations has been strong but at the current session of the General Assembly we succeeded for the first time in having a resolution adopted under which the Secretary-General would commence a process of examining and reporting to governments on the nature of and problems raised by international arms transfers. </PARA>
<PARA>With the information about the international arms trade that we have received since this matter was raised it is not hard to see why there was opposition. Mr Butler later enlarged on this theme, quoting Senator Evans addressing the General Assembly. Mr Butler said:</PARA>
<PARA>I have referred earlier to Australia's action in placing on the international agenda the issue of international arms transfers. This is an issue to which I believe we and the world community should give increasing attention. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts are multifarious and devastating. To use just two examples, between 1975 and 1985 when developing countries accumulated massive debt, presumably for development purposes, in fact 35 per cent of that debt was spent on the purchase of arms. At present, arms purchases by developing countries exceed the amount they receive in development assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>Again, speaking at the current session of the General Assembly Foreign and Trade Minister Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA> ``The quest for greater security through higher and higher levels of conventional arms is only too well know to us all. The international conference on disarmament and development provided ample evidence. It is a simple proposition that more arms do not equal greater security. They feed the appetite of instability and the coffers of those who choose to supply arms at levels that are well beyond those needed for self-defence.''</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Evans seems at least to pay lip service to the need for discrimination in this matter, but Mr Beazley unfortunately does not. Mr Butler continued but I will leave that quote since time is passing. </PARA>
<PARA> Already Australia has supplied a substantial quantity of materiel to Brazil, thus swelling our coffers while Brazil remains in a chronic state of financial distress. At least Senator Evans will not have to worry about soiling his digits with the arms trade, nor will he have the opportunity to apply his special competence in determining what an appropriate level for self-defence is. A close reading of the guidelines shows that the Department of Foreign Affairs is out in the cold and will be consulted only under special circumstances. It may be lightly consulted about policy guidance but, according to this document, the Minister for Defence is clearly responsible for developing and applying defence export policy. Interdepartmental consultation will be confined to denial of export permission or to particularly sensitive areas. I am opposed, of course, to the changes proposed by clause 8 of the legislation, but if I were given a choice-and it is not a palatable one-I would rather that Senator Evans and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had a major or at least an equal say in the destination of any Australian produced military materials. After all, he is the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. </PARA>
<PARA> In an article in the Australian on 16 June last year Mr Hayden revealed that he had stopped some arms sales, some patrol boats to one country and mechanisms for personal booby traps to another. I doubt that these were the only sales stopped. By inference, the Minister for Defence and his Department were prepared for these sales to go through. I have serious doubts about the ability of the Department of Defence, and particularly the Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, to be discriminating in the matter of arms exports. For example, the Department of Defence has had considerable involvement with the National Safety Council of Australia (NSCA). Indeed, many of the NSCA's employees were retired from the Australian defence forces. In an article by Wendy Bacon in the Sun-Herald of 26 March she describes very clearly the sort of involvement that the NSCA had with the Department of Defence. At the end of the article Mr Beazley is quoted as referring to the short time frame available to make a decision about why the NSCA got a contract above other people. He has once again imposed a difficulty upon himself by setting a 21-day period for decisions on arms export licences. He should take heed of his own experience in trying to decide major matters in a hurry. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no doubt that Mr Beazley will make decisions in relation to arms exports that he will regret, just as he is now regretting his involvement with the NSCA and another organisation called Parachutes Australia Pty Ltd, for all his attempts at justification. He wants to relax the arms exports controls, but is he aware of the shady deals that have almost been carried out by Mr Ed Crowther, an employee of Parachutes Australia? Mr Crowther used his position with Parachutes Australia Safety Equipment, a division of Parachutes Australia, to negotiate a deal with Colonel P.O. Wong in Fiji in 1987. He said that he could provide-and I read from the document-6,000 S.G. NATO assault rifles, available at a cost of US$450 each, to be ordered in quantities of 1,000 units only; 5,000 Beretta hand guns, US Army issue, at a cost of US$400 each; a certain number of Bell helicopters; and becoming available, S.G. 550 and S.G. 551 assault rifles straight from the factory, which are the very latest models. I would like Mr Beazley to tell us about these and to suggest where Mr Crowther thought he would get them from. If arms exports are going to be relaxed, will it make it easier for a Mr Crowther in future to export these rifles and helicopters?</PARA>
<PARA> I said when speaking to Senator Vallentine's motion in March that I cannot consider Australia's track record to be all that bad. However, I believe that these changes will open the way for Australia to become involved in some very dirty business. Australia has already sold to quite a number of countries and could become involved in the dirty tricks of the arms trade in which some of our allies have been involved. I read from an article by Frank Walker on 21 August last year:</PARA>
<PARA>The Iran-Iraq war has been a dream for the world's death merchants. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) found an incredible 27 countries sold weapons to the warring countries during the tragic conflict.</PARA>
<PARA> Not content with selling to one side, the US, the Soviet Union, China, France, Italy, Britain, East Germany, Switzerland, North Korea and Brazil all sold major weapons to both sides, despite several of them having bans. </PARA>
<PARA> It was thought all the gun-running to Iran from the US was being done illegally through third parties till the `Contragate' scandal revealed it was being done through a back room of the Pentagon with approval from the highest levels-</PARA>
<PARA>we are talking about our ally, of course-</PARA>
<PARA> While arms were falling off the back of US trucks to Iran, the US Government was telling Iraq how best to beat their enemy. </PARA>
<PARA>The new arms export conditions allow us to sell to all our allies without question. I ask: What is this going to get Australia involved in? I do not have time today to go into all the material on the dirty business of arms exports. We have to be very careful before we commit ourselves to what our allies are doing and before we surrender the sort of independence we would like to have and, I believe, should keep. </PARA>
<PARA> We should also question whether the aid we give to countries in the region is merely a precursor, a sort of show-room for future sales of arms, and whether in fact we really want to get involved in that rather than providing aid that is going to be much more useful internally to people of Third World countries. I would not want to be the one to cast the first stone, but I suggest that there are countries in our region whose human rights records are very poor. Even if Australia were to begin by selling these countries Mr Beazley's hydrographic equipment, once a sales relationship had been set up it would be very hard to exclude equipment that could be used to oppress a domestic population. We have to take heed of some very strong warnings on this subject.</PARA>
<PARA> More than a billion people in 60 countries are currently living under military rule. Nobody needs arms as much as a military dictatorship. The more proscriptions there are the more profitable the trade. We must bear this in mind when we look at the countries to which we are going to be selling arms. With all the military secrecy, it is difficult to know who we are selling what to. We need an open register which does not necessarily have to break industrial confidentiality. We must know what we are selling, to whom and in what quantities. There is an urgent necessity to be open about that. We are not really going to be able to compete on the market. Our First World allies already have the market fairly well sewn up. So the only markets that we are going to be able to sell to will be Third World markets. We must seriously question the ethical considerations of selling to countries which are spending much more on arms than on food and the development of domestic agriculture and industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The big budget items on our defence shopping list are the high-tech systems that we purchase from our friends. I do not suggest that all of these are unnecessary, but some of them certainly are. I would place in this category the FA18 fighters. The few crumbs we get from the offsets do little to reduce the net costs. We are still wasting money on totally inappropriate war games and the equipment necessary to turn out as a well-dressed player. Much of this expenditure would be better spent on equipment that is more clearly defensive.</PARA>

<PARA>CUSTOMS AND EXCISE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (2) 1987 AND CUSTOMS AND EXCISE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1988</PARA>
<PARA> We refer to our previous correspondence and our major submissions on these two Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> The Law Council of Australia has learnt from a report in today's Australian Financial Review that the Bills were intended to be introduced into the Senate last night. We have become aware that they are now scheduled to be reintroduced today. </PARA>
<PARA> The Law Council wishes to emphasise in the strongest possible terms that in our view these Bills are fundamentally unsatisfactory. The Law Council remains strongly opposed to the basic provisions of both Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> We consider that the Bills represent bad law. In our view, they are likely to generate considerable disputes and litigation. They infringe civil liberties unnecessarily and unacceptably. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's objective in preventing the avoidance of customs duty is commended. However, the Law Council believes that these Bills are not the correct means to achieve that objective. Our impression is that the effect of the Bills will be to increase, perhaps significantly, the cost to the community. Innocent importers may be hurt by the provisions of the Bills and the Australian Customs Service will gain unnecessarily wide and harsh powers of entry, search and seizure and the ability to impose penalty. (These matters are explained in detail in our submissions). </PARA>
<PARA> It has come to the Law Council's attention that changes have been made to the amendments to be moved on behalf of the Government (since the Law Council received copies of those amendments on 28 February). Some detailed concerns may be able to be met with such amendments, but the Law Council's fundamental concerns will not be able to be resolved by slight changes to this drafting. </PARA>

I think it is best that we deal with some of the matters raised by honourable senators when the Government's proposed amendments are moved at the committee stage. I do not want to go through all those matters at this stage because it would waste the Senate's time. However, I want to make a few brief comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Lewis mentioned the audit and verification of information powers in clause 22 of the 1987 Customs Bill and queried whether a power of entry without warrant on business premises proposed by new section 214aa of the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) contravened article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. That is a covenant which is concerned to provide protection against arbitrary or unlawful interferences in privacy. I assure Senator Lewis that during the drafting of the clauses, and on the advice of the Attorney-General's Department, both were drafted specifically to remain consistent with the covenant's requirements. The advice on this aspect to the Government from the Attorney-General's Department dated 22 February 1988 was shown to the Opposition spokesman on housing, customs and small business, Mr Downer, during the pre-debate briefings on the Bill provided to Mr Downer on 27 and 28 February this year. I would be happy to provide a copy of that opinion to Senator Lewis. A lengthy process of consultation has taken place with all parties and the Opposition and that opinion was presented to Mr Downer at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Regarding the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3), Senator Lewis, together with his coalition colleague Senator Boswell, sought an assurance that legislation lifting the sugar import embargo would not be brought forward before we received the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology on the sugar industry. I can assure Senator Lewis and Senator Boswell that the Committee's report will be taken into consideration before any further assistance measures are proposed for the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Boswell was a member of that Committee. As the member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) said in the House, it was a great thing that Senator Boswell was a member of that Committee because, as a Queensland senator, it enabled him to see some sugarcane. That was probably the basis of some other remarks made by Senator Boswell in this chamber. During the debate on that Bill Senator Boswell launched a tirade against the Government, Ministers and various members of parliament over the proposed removal of the sugar embargo. However, I make the point that in the coalition's policy document called `New Directions', which I have read--</PARA>

But I do not apologise for what I am about to say. Senator Boswell used the debate on the Bill to attack the Government about the sugar embargo. The coalition, in its document Future Directions, talks about a number of issues, which I will come to. However, the point I am trying to make is that, far from future directions, the Opposition in this country is really about the 1960s show. Senator Boswell is way ahead of the rest of them because he is really about the 1915 show as that is when most of this regulatory environment was put in place to protect the Australian sugar industry, at considerable cost to Australian consumers.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The May statement tariff cuts will benefit Australia's rural sector by between $350m and $450m. The National Farmers Federation estimates the benefits of the tariff cuts of May last year as roughly $2,400 per Australian farmer. Senator Boswell walks in here and says that that is all right and that it can happen to every industry except the sugar industry. He says there should be no changes to its level of protection; it must have an embargo to protect it. If any other country placed an embargo on Australian goods which we were exporting to it, Senator Boswell would be the first to object.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The coalition's policy document says that the Liberal and National parties support the general current reduction in protection and will continue this process beyond 1992. I am grateful for their support on that issue. However, when it comes to any test of their bona fides as an opposition, such as deregulation of the wheat market, when they have to face up to a decision, they run away from it, just as they did throughout the 30 years of Liberal-Country Party coalition government. They ran away from all the issues concerning improved efficiency in Australian industries and reducing protection. They can sit on the opposition benches without having to make any hard decisions and just complain about us. However, when they are confronted with a couple of real issues, because they have to vote on Bills such as the wheat deregulation legislation, they run for cover. They do so because they are scared to confront the issues just as they were when they spent 30 years out of the last 39 in government. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the sugar industry, Senator Boswell has defied the spirit of the Future Directions policy which Mr Howard, his so-called Leader, announced not so long ago. The coalition's policy is that it supports phased down protection and will continue this process. Senator Boswell says that the embargo should not be removed. He does not even like it being replaced with a high tariff because he has to look after his so-called mates in the Queensland sugar industry. The more intelligent of them know that he is wrong. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Hinkler has given Senator Boswell a bit of stick about this. He is a Labor member. He knows a bit about it. The coalition has a policy on deregulation. The sugar industry is the most regulated industry in Australia. Growers are even told where they have to grow sugar cane on their own land. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has estimated that 50 per cent more sugar could be produced in Queensland under a more appropriate regulatory environment than the one which presently exists. That represents a further $500m worth of sugar, at current prices. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics also states that $50m could be saved if more appropriate harvesting regulations were put in place, and that the uniform pricing formula costs the industry $130m a year. As I said earlier, it points out that most of those regulatory mechanisms date back to 1915. Senator Boswell is a clone of the Queensland Government, except at one stage last year when it changed Premiers and he did not quite know what to do, which person to support. We all know his position about the former Premier. We all know about those brown paper bags.</PARA></TALK.START>

We have all sorts of debates in this place about what is wrong with this country. I will hazard a guess which I think will stand the test of any examination. What is wrong with this country is that for years and years we had governments which were not prepared to face up to the problems of real deregulation. They were not prepared to face up to the problems of reducing protection to soft and flabby industries. They were not prepared to face up to any of those problems. That was terrible. This Government now has the task of getting the country out of that mess. It is very difficult. But it is a dreadful, horrible shame to have to say that those opposite did not learn from all of those years. Even now, when they are confronted with an issue such as wheat deregulation or deregulating the sugar market, people like Senator Boswell represent the dreadful past of this country.

What I said about guts is clearly illustrated by his request for Senator Lewis to take a point of order. He cannot even stand a bit of heat in this place, let alone make hard decisions about deregulating the sugar industry or anything like that. I referred Senator Boswell to the coalition policy's reduction in protection which will be continued. It does not say, `a reduction in protection except for our little closeted industries in Queensland'. It covers all Australians. It hurts me to say so, but what Senator Boswell said here the other day was a disgrace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said earlier, I thank honourable senators for the attention they gave these Bills. I make a couple of points about the Bills in general. I will not deal with all of the loony stuff raised by one section of the Senate about exports of weapons of death. This legislation has nothing to do with that issue. All of those speeches were a bit of a promo and window-dressing for the debate which will take place on those regulations when they are introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter referred to part of the legislation which relates to the warrant by telephone provision in the 1987 Customs legislation. For the benefit of other senators who have not considered the provision as closely as Senator Coulter has, it is a provision to enable an application for a limited search warrant to be made to a magistrate by radio, telephone or other means of communication. Those means of communication can be used in urgent circumstances. Senator Coulter suggested that warrants conveyed by telephone, for example, should include a telephone number nominated by the magistrate at which the magistrate may be contacted for the purposes of verifying the issue of the warrant. That is supported by the Government. It is a good suggestion and an amendment to that effect will be moved by the Government at the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter also raised two matters relating to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3). He drew attention first to the provisions in the Bill regarding worked ivory. He drew attention to the fact that the endangered species which provide these goods-I think it is elephants only, I think that is right, is it not?</PARA>

Perhaps he could tell us during the committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Coulter indicated his intention to move an amendment at the committee stage regarding the duty rates for solar cells and assembled solar arrays. I cannot accede to that amendment at this time. For reasons which I will deal with during the committee stage, the Government understands and appreciates the wider issues involved in that amendment. In fact, quite recently, in an identical situation in terms of principle, the Government made some amendments to excise regulations in the petroleum industry which had the effect of helping the recycling industry. The same principle applies. This question goes across a whole range of things. In that sense, we appreciate the spirit of the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a statement covering all the Government's proposed amendments to the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1987. I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard. It covers much of the ground that has already been the subject of debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1987</PARA>
<PARA> I move the Schedule of Amendments to be made to this Bill on behalf of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Schedule of amendments proposes a total of 45 amendments to the Bill as originally introduced in this Chamber during the 1987 Budget Sittings of Parliament. While many of the amendments might properly be characterised as minor technical drafting changes, substantive changes are proposed to address many of the points raised in written submissions received by the Government on the Bill, and in meetings with interested parties during the consultations which have been undertaken on the Bill. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those persons and organisations for their interest and helpful and constructive criticism during the consultative process. The Government believes the legislative package which is now proposed as a result of that process satisfies all the legitimate concerns which were raised during it. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall effect of the proposed Schedule of amendments which I have moved on behalf of the Government will reduce the Bill to two substantive elements only:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the redraft of Division 2 of Part VIII of the Customs Act 1901, relating to the valuation of imported goods (Clause 12 of the Bill); and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the audit and verification of information powers of officers of Customs and the complimentary provision relating to the requirement to keep commercial documents (Clauses 6, 22 and 25 respectively of the Bill). </PARA>
<PARA> I shall discuss the proposed amendments to these parts of the Bill shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining elements of this Bill have either been transferred to the companion Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1988 (which will be discussed following the debate on this Bill) or are not to be proceeded with. In particular, the proposed administrative penalty regime and the offence provision for the making of a false or misleading statement (Clauses 26 and 24 respectively) have been transferred to the 1988 Customs Bill by amendments 41 and 37. This has been done so that the complete package of proposed penal provisions for the making of a false or misleading statement, including the removal of forfeiture of one's goods as a sanction for such a statement, is presented in the one Bill. I will discuss this package in more detail in the Committee stages of the 1988 Customs Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Another change to the Bill, proposed in amendment 27, is the removal of Clause 16 of the Bill, which proposes an increase to three years of the current twelve months time limit for the recovery of short-paid duty. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has accepted the view expressed by many in the Community that in the interests of equity there should be symmetry between the time within which a person may apply for a refund, rebate or remission of customs duty, and the period of time within which Customs may recover duty short-paid. Given the overwhelming preference for the retention of the current twelve month time period for each circumstance the Government has decided not to proceed with the existing Clause 16. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning now to the amendments to the two remaining substantive elements of the Bill, let me first deal with the proposed Clause 12 (Valuation Division) amendments. It should be recalled that the focus of the Valuation Clause in the Bill was the rearrangement of the existing valuation Division of the Act, to not only exhaustively enunciate all those matters which may or may not be included in customs value, and all the methods by which the customs value of goods might be determined, but also to eliminate some known duty minimisation and avoidance practices which artificially reduce the Customs value of imported goods, to the detriment of desired industry assistance levels and consequential revenue receipts. </PARA>
<PARA> It is acknowledged that the proposed valuation provisions are lengthy compared to other similar pieces of legislation. Indeed, many compare these provisions with the comparatively simple and straightforward GATT Valuation Agreement which they are intended to give effect to. However, the GATT Agreement, like all international treaties, is cast in the most general terms. To simply incorporate the Agreement by annexure, as some have suggested, would only invite lengthy and costly litigation to give the general terms of the treaty judicial meaning in Australia; further, such a course does not offer any guidance to, or provide any certainty for importers in valuing goods for Customs purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The length too of the proposed Valuation Division redraft must be put into context. The proposed pages of legislation give effect to a complete valuation code, highlighting all the various methods by which the Australian Customs Service might determine the customs value of goods. Just over a third of those pages deal with valuation methods employed in less than 1% of all import transactions into Australia. Their inclusion in the proposed Valuation Division is for the purpose of completeness. </PARA>
<PARA> It should also be noted that in implementing an extensive valuation code, the Government has been mindful of its international obligations under the GATT. The Government is confident that the legislation proposed is consistent with the Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Clause 12 amendments include amendments 5 to 10, to delete references to ``storage or handling costs'' from the definitions of ``Australian inland freight'', ``Australian inland insurance'', ``foreign inland freight'', and ``foreign inland insurance'', and include such costs only when they are incidental to the transportation of goods (which is consistent with article 8 (2) (b) of the GATT Valuation Agreement) by altering the definition of transportation (amendment No. 14). Additionally, amendment 16 removes proposed paragraph 154 (3) (f) from the legislation, under which it was proposed to deem persons to be related to each other if they were trustees or beneficiaries of the same trust on the grounds that that circumstance is not provided for under article 15 (4) of the GATT Valuation Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also considered comments made on the valuation provision by interested members of the Customs community. </PARA>
<PARA> Principal amongst these is the addition of a new subparagraph 154 (e) (iv) proposed by amendment 12, to ensure that certain royalties and licence fees do not become dutiable when such are paid or payable on the imported goods after their importation into Australia. This will remove an area of confusion in the wording contained in the existing Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the definition of ``buying commission'' is amended to narrow the scope of the provision. In consultation with various industry groups and community organisations, the point was made that the proposed definition in section 155 of the Bill unnecessarily restricted buying agents. The amendment proposed in amendment 18 will now allow a buying agent to represent other parties in transactions unconnected with the import sale or the particular imported goods, without prejudicing the right to not include any commission payable to that agent in the customs value of the imported goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, amendment 20 deletes proposed section 159, which would have required an importer to give a statement containing valuation information of a kind and in a form approved by the Comptroller. Following representations from industry, the Government has re-examined the need for such a statement and agreed not to proceed with it. </PARA>
<PARA> Other technical amendments to the valuation provisions of the Bill are discussed in detail in the supplementary explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA> The second remaining substantive element in the Bill, relating to the auditing of commercial documents (Clauses 6 and 22) and the obligation to keep commercial documents (Clause 25), has also been the subject of some amendment as a result of the consultations and representations on the respective Clauses. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the document retention obligation in Clause 25 of the Bill, a minor amendment is proposed in amendment No. 38 to clarify the position that the only documents which have to be kept for the purposes of the Customs Act 1901 are those commercial documents which will enable imported goods to be properly identified, and, in the case of goods entered for home consumption, properly valued or rated for duty. In addition the amendment will permit the keeping of certified copies of such documents in circumstances where the originals are required to be surrendered by force of law, or in the ordinary course of business. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the audit of information powers in Clauses 6 and 22 of the Bill, it should be recalled that those provisions were intended to facilitate the post-entry verification of information supplied to Customs as part of the Customs process of allowing the quick clearance of imported goods. Such a clearance system relies upon the integrity of the information supplied under it. So that the reliability of information can be checked however, without commercially unacceptable delays in the Customs processing of goods, the Government considers post-entry audits of information are necessary. The audit of information powers proposed in Clause 22 of this Bill should be viewed in this context; they are quite limited powers. Proposed Section 214aa confers a power of entry onto business premises only by consent, and only for the purpose of inspecting (not seizing) commercial documents believed to be on those premises to verify information supplied in connection with an import entry of goods. Entry onto such premises, where there is consent, is only permitted at reasonable times, and is only to be made where relevant information is reasonably believed to be contained on the premises, and access is only available to commercial documents relating to information supplied in connection with the particular import entry of the relevant goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Where entry is refused, or access to the relevant documents is not provided, or the premises on which it is reasonably believed relevant commercial documents are kept are residential premises, to which entry is not consented to, a search warrant must be applied for, which will empower a prescribed officer to enter and search the premises for the commercial documents relating to the particular entry of the goods concerned, and to inspect and make copies of (but not seize) any such documents found. The Government has acknowledged the concerns about the appropriateness of Justices of the Peace to grant such warrants, and is therefore proposing in Amendment No. 2 the deletion of the expanded definition of ``magistrate'' which would have accommodated this. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Government is proposing in amendment No. 36 a facility to permit in circumstances of urgency an application for such a search warrant to be made to a Magistrate by radio, telephone or other means of communication. There is nothing untoward in this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> Customs field audits and inspections of commercial documents might realistically have to be undertaken in parts of the country where chamber Magistrates are not readily available, and in situations of urgency to preclude the removal or falsification of commercial records. The number of safeguards contained in the provision to ensure against improper use, and in particular, the requirement that a judicially trained magistrate must be satisfied that the situation is one of urgency adequately ensure that this provision cannot be used indiscriminately or improperly. Additionally I have indicated a further amendment from the Government to pick up the suggestion from Senator Coulter in the second reading debate concerning the facility to contact the Magistrate for the purposes of verifying the issue of the warrant.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally it should be noted that amendment 1 proposes that all elements of the Bill, including this schedule of amendments, will commence on 1 July 1989. This prospective commencement date will enable both the importing community and the Customs adequate lead time to become acquainted with and prepare for the new regime. </PARA>
<PARA> Other technical amendments to the Bill are discussed in detail in the supplementary explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Proposed new clause 23a, proposed paragraph 243t (1) (a), leave out ``whether knowingly, recklessly or otherwise'', insert ``whether knowingly or recklessly''. </PARA>
<PARA>It has taken us quite some time to get down to Government amendment No. 11 to the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1988. As this is the first chance I have had to speak in committee, there are one or two things I would like to say. Firstly, I want to correct something I said during my speech on the second reading. I inadvertently referred to new clause 243u at one stage-not repeatedly, as Senator Coulter kept interjecting-when I should have referred to clause 243v. I did so when I was addressing the new option, which provides that where the owner of goods is uncertain whether particular information included in a statement made in respect of those goods might be regarded as false or misleading, he may set out the reasons for the uncertainty at the time of the lodgment and no penalty shall be imposed under section 243. </PARA>
<PARA> I then went on to detail my belief that section 243 still raised difficulties. The context of my criticism would make it quite clear to any person reading the Bills at the time that I was in fact referring to new section 243v and not 243u. As Senator Coulter was at great pains to point out my error, I ask that it be noted that I was referring to section 243v when dealing with this particular difficulty for importers. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I wish to give praise to the departmental officers and in particular Mr Ken McInnes, the legal adviser to the Australian Customs Service. When I was responsible for this portfolio some 16 months ago, when the Government was introducing this legislation, he gave me great assistance by explaining what was intended and the particular clauses of the Bills, all of which are very complex. He has briefed my colleague Mr Alexander Downer, who is now the Opposition's spokesperson on customs legislation. Again this morning when I asked him what was, to me, a complicated question he was able to explain easily, in simple terms, the nature of the proposals so that I was readily able to understand what had at first sight appeared to present some difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to the provisions of sections 234, 243t and 243u. Under section 234 the court will be able to impose penalties when a person knowingly or recklessly makes a statement to an officer that is false or misleading in a material particular, or omits from a statement made to an officer any matter or thing without which the statement is misleading in a material particular. It is right and proper that that should come before a court of law. </PARA>
<PARA> But in addition the Government is introducing section 243t, which enables the Comptroller-General of Customs to impose a penalty. I have some difficulties about the Comptroller imposing a penalty which is in the nature of a fine. Under the Australian system, as adopted to date, in effect penalties of this nature for making false statements have been imposed by courts of law. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills draws to the attention of the Senate and all honourable senators the fact that, in addition to the legal penalties imposed in a court, penalties are to be imposed by the Comptroller. Section 243t provides that where a person, whether knowingly, recklessly or otherwise, makes a statement to an officer that is false or misleading in a material particular, or omits from a statement made to an officer any matter or thing without which the statement is misleading in a material particular, then the Comptroller may impose a penalty. Instead of repeating those words in detail, I shall in future just talk about people making a false or misleading statement. What then happens is that the Comptroller may:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . by notice in writing, require the owner of the goods . . . to pay, within a period of 90 days after service of the notice, a penalty equal to twice the amount of excess, or a penalty of $20, whichever is the greater. </PARA>
<PARA>The insertion in that clause of a specific penalty of $20 gives one the impression that it is not a matter of major concern. But the customs agents have assured the Opposition parties that in truth a penalty equal to twice the amount of the excess could prove to be tens of thousands of dollars. So the Comptroller really has been given extraordinarily wide powers administratively to impose a penalty on a person who makes a false or misleading statement in certain circumstances. Although, thanks to all the delays and representations that have been made during the term of the delays, there is now in the Bill provision for the remission of penalties and a provision that section 243t is not to apply in certain circumstances, the penalty being imposed is substantial. </PARA>
<PARA> What really disturbs the Opposition, what has disturbed the customs agents and what has disturbed the Law Council of Australia, a body that should certainly be listened to by parliaments, is that a person really has no defence to this penalty if he unfortunately has made a simple mistake. That is the matter that causes us greatest distress. Section 243t specifically provides:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a person, whether knowingly-</PARA>
<PARA>it would be not unreasonable for a penalty to be applied if he knowingly did it-</PARA>
<PARA>or recklessly . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Again, I suppose that if it could be established that he did it recklessly it may not be unreasonable for a penalty to be imposed. The Government has then added to the clause the words `or otherwise', which means that it is an offence in any circumstance, whether committed knowingly, recklessly or otherwise. In other words, it does not matter how the mistake happens; if it is made, the Comptroller, not a court of law, may impose a penalty equal to twice the amount of the excess, which we understand could amount to tens of thousands of dollars. I put it to the Government that that is unreasonable. The Government has rejected that assertion. The Australian Democrats could amend the legislation by supporting our amendment. Without our amendment, the clause is totally unreasonable, because it ensures that a person has no way of avoiding the penalty if he makes a mistake. </PARA>
<PARA> This morning the Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, said that officers of his Department had made a mistake in altering the Hansard. He said that was not his fault. In that case, a Minister of the Crown was prepared to admit that a mistake had been made. Anyone can make a mistake. Yet here we have a case of the Government saying that the Comptroller may impose a penalty on someone who makes a mistake. It is then completely within the Comptroller's power to remit the penalty, or otherwise. The Government might say that the case could go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for its consideration, but I put it that that is not an adequate defence and that the words `or otherwise' should be deleted from the proposal. That is the purpose of my amendment. If those words were deleted, the section would then apply to a person who knowingly or recklessly made a false or misleading statement. I put it to the Government and to the Australian Democrats that that is a very reasonable amendment and that it should be carried by this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will not support the amendment for two quite clear reasons. First, to exclude the words `or otherwise' would give two sections within the one Act which carry different penalties for precisely the same offence, namely, to do something knowingly or recklessly. That would be a peculiar result to achieve with that amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leaving that aside and comparing section 234 and 243t and the other sections that qualify 243t, it is quite clear that 234 is aimed at serious offences because it is those offences which are committed knowingly or recklessly. Clearly, they require a much higher level of proof in the establishment of the offence. As a scientist, I do not know how one would prove that someone did something knowingly. It is clearly a legal definition, but I do not know how that could be established. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly that simply highlights the difference between proof in a scientific sense and proof in a legal sense. They are quite different. `Recklessly' in both senses is a heavily qualified term and will depend upon a range of conditions being met. People will have different opinions as to whether something is reckless or not. Again, the level of proof required to establish an offence under section 234 is of a much higher order than that which is required under 243t. Correspondingly, the penalty is much higher. It is $5,000 and-I stress `and'-twice the amount of the duty payable. Senator Bishop, in speaking to this measure yesterday, asserted that penalties under 243t could be higher than under 234. I find great difficulty in seeing how that could be the case, because in the one instance the penalty is twice the amount of the duty payable and in the other it is twice the amount of the difference between the duty that was paid and the duty that should have been paid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Section 243t seeks to set in place a graded range of offences which go all the way from the most trivial mistake through to an error which borders on, but is not able to be established under, section 234. As I pointed out in debate on the second reading, it seems that customs agents, in particular, are setting themselves up as professional people and offering ostensibly a competent, informed service to the public. One therefore expects a high level of care. Certainly any other person in professional work-I think I mentioned doctors, lawyers and so on-is not exempt from penalty if he makes a mistake. The penalty certainly could be high in the case of an offence which involved the importation of a large value of goods, but correspondingly it is fair to say that if tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars were involved in that importation-and the penalty could be as high as that-one would expect that the agent concerned would exercise an appropriately greater level of care. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be stressed again that the provisions of 243v clearly allow a person who is genuinely uncertain to certify that he is uncertain, in which case no penalty shall apply. In conclusion, I simply draw attention to the provisions within section 243t itself: if a penalty is set which is considered to be unfair there are provisions for appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I suppose as a backing for that, if in relation to an honest mistake one were to detect that a comptroller or an officer working in that Department was applying penalties in any sense arbitrarily, there would always be an appeal mechanism to the Ombudsman. It certainly seems to the Australian Democrats that in moving these further amendments the Government has sought to satisfy the legitimate concerns which were expressed in relation to the original Bill. In view of the large amount of potential duty which can be avoided under these circumstances, we believe that the provisions of sections 234 and 243, with their qualifying subsections, are quite legitimate to be included in this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief because Senator Coulter has canvassed the issues. The distinction between the 243t provision and section 234 is simply that under section 234 the Australian Customs Service must be able to prove, on a criminal onus, that the person either knowingly or recklessly made a false or misleading statement. In the other section the use of the expression `or otherwise', which Senator Lewis's colleague, the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), has queried, is quite deliberately designed to catch all statements that are false or misleading in a material particular resulting in short payment or underpayment of duty. The provision is designed to catch somebody who knowingly, willingly, inadvertently, or in any circumstance--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Right. There are some good public policy reasons for this approach. The Customs Service has now adopted the greenline system of processing import entries. That means that in 90 per cent of cases Customs will rely on the information provided by the importer, giving the importer quicker access to the goods. It is really a system of trust, not only in terms of honesty but also in terms of accuracy. It is an honour system. Last year roughly $26m in revenue was lost or potentially lost because, for one reason or another, misleading entries were made. If that happens, government revenue is reduced. That is an important public policy point. But in some ways the more significant fairness point is that other importers competing in the same market who have paid the lawful amount and got their entries correct are prejudiced in the marketplace by the conduct of the person who is slack, dishonest, careless or inadvertent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> They are the essential public policy reasons for arriving at this conclusion. I understand in a conceptual sense the argument which has been put by Senator Lewis, but the circumstances of this situation are very different. That is why the deterrents have been proposed in the form that they have. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point that the Comptroller-General's decision to impose a section 243t penalty is discretionary. He does not have to do it. Secondly, any person filling in his entries who is uncertain about the accuracy of the information he is giving can write that on the form. He will then not be in any sense liable to a penalty even though it is discretionary in the hands of the Comptroller-General. Thirdly, the penalty duty demand is effectively stayed where there is a dispute as to the amount of duty payable on the goods. Finally, any decision by the Comptroller-General not to remit in full the section 243t penalty may be reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a case of a clash between the desire for efficiency and uniformity in terms of all users of the system and a desire for some principle of general application but not of application in these circumstances as a matter of public policy. The Government thinks this process as set out in the Bill is important and does not accept the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just mention to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commence (Senator Button) at this stage that during the course of the second reading debate I pointed out that it has taken the Government almost 16 months to bring this legislation back into the chamber. The Government claimed back in December of 1987 that if the legislation was not implemented and in force by 1 January 1988 many millions and millions of dollars of revenue would be lost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister has made reference to a claim that about $26m may have been lost or that this is the amount of revenue which might be addressed by this amending legislation. I wonder whether the Minister has any explanation at all as to why it has taken the Government almost 16 months to bring back, with amendments, a Bill which he told us back in December of 1987 needed no amendments. He said that we did not know what we were talking about and that we were attacking the revenue, yet he has introduced some 45 amendments. If we were attacking the revenue, why has the Government taken so long to bring this Bill back to the Senate? My recollection is that it will not come into operation until 1 July. I put to the Minister that he owes the Parliament some explanation for this delay. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the first time that I have regretted we have Question Time at 12 o'clock and not at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. At a later point today, or even at a later point in Question Time, it may be that I could give a full answer. I met with the Ombudsman yesterday. The normal process, of course, is that the Ombudsman puts out a draft report and then a final report to my Department. We discuss the report and see whether we can resolve the issues which are outstanding. If one does not resolve the outstanding issues, as honourable senators know, there are two other processes to go through. I met with the Ombudsman yesterday. We discussed a number of issues and clarified a lot of matters to the satisfaction of both of us. At various points we conceded we were both in error. Let me rephrase that; at various points we agreed that there was a difference of emphasis that we were willing to discuss-that is, not every aspect of the Ombudsman's report would necessarily hold true and not every attitude I have expressed in the past would necessarily hold true. Having gone through that very valuable process of meeting the Ombudsman and discussing these issues, it was agreed to draw up a head of agreement containing our solution to the problems. That is in the process-at least, it was half an hour ago-of finalisation to get it word perfect. I hope to be given an indication during Question Time that we have completed that agreement. I will then be able to release it, but I am bound, as is the Ombudsman, not to comment until that final text is available. I apologise for that but I think honourable senators will be able to understand the circumstances of wanting to get things accurate to the word.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion, may I say that I did appreciate the opportunity of meeting with Professor Pearce yesterday and discussing these particular matters.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Minister for Finance and Minister representing the Treasurer seen Paddy McGuinness's article in yesterday's Australian newspaper in which Mr McGuinness advocates a shift in Australia's tax mix away from income tax towards a consumption tax? Does the Government accept the argument that `it is complex and difficult' to evade consumption taxes? Further, does the Government accept the argument that this provides a compelling case for shifting Australia's tax mix?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1187" SPEAKER="Walsh Sen The Hon P.A." NAMEID="TJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remember that probably more than 10 years ago I wrote a letter to the National Times in reply to an article Paddy McGuinness had written which contained a rather serious arithmetic error. Mr McGuinness acknowledged, when the letter was published, that he had made an error and attributed it to `non-recurring seasonal factors'. That was just after Christmas. The article that he published this week was, presumably, written just after Easter. I do not know whether it also should be attributed to non-recurring seasonal factors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have seen the article. It points out-quite correctly, of course-that the introduction of the tax file number arrangements will make another major advance in combating the evasion of income tax. Mr McGuinness wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> The only kind of work that will escape taxation in this manner will be cash payments of the kind that are very common, for example payments for casual house-cleaning, child-minding and other personal services.</PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely correct. The article then starts to meander. It finally asserts that the major defect in the income tax system is that the most powerful pay the least, regardless of how high nominal tax rates are. He then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the only answer to this, as well as to the ability of those in the black economy to escape payment of income tax altogether, is a consumption tax. Consumption taxes can be evaded, but it is complex and difficult to do so by comparison with income tax.</PARA>
<PARA>The truth is that in regard to the particular examples that Mr McGuinness cited-casual house-cleaning, child-minding and other personal services for which payments are made in cash-it is equally as easy to evade either a consumption tax or income tax if a person is inclined to do so. Since Mr McGuinness identifies that as the major area of likely continuing tax evasion, whether the tax system is primarily or overwhelmingly dependent upon consumption taxes or income tax will make no difference to those sorts of unreported payments which ought to be taxable but which are untaxed because they are not reported.</PARA>
<PARA> To a somewhat lesser extent, the same sorts of arguments apply to small retailers. Unless one assumes perfect honesty on their part, one cannot expect perfect compliance from small retailers, whether it be in regard to income tax or a type of value-added tax. Whatever the arguments are, on balance, for or against a greater or lesser reliance on consumption taxes or income tax, the points raised by Mr McGuinness contribute little, if anything, to the case for a heavier degree of reliance on consumption taxes.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Justice and Minister representing the Attorney-General to his answer earlier this week to my question about the report of the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) on Rothwells Ltd, when the Minister advised that the decision to publish the whole or part of the report is for the Ministerial Council. I refer also to reports in today's Australian newspaper that the NCSC has obtained a legal opinion, signed by three counsel, including a leading Melbourne silk, which advises that publication would not have the effect of prejudicing the defence of any person or persons who might be charged with an offence as a result of the report. I ask whether the Minister or the Attorney-General have received copies of these opinions obtained by the NCSC. If so, will the Minister table those opinions for the information of the Senate? Has the Commonwealth sought independent advice on this matter? If so, what was the thrust of that advice? What position is the Commonwealth Government taking in today's vote by the Ministerial Council on whether the report should be tabled?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1188" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recall Senator Chaney's question earlier this week. I indicated that the Ministerial Council would have the ultimate responsibility of determining, after proper deliberation, whether-and, if so, in what form-to publish the report, by tabling it in a parliamentary forum. The report into the debacle surrounding the collapse of Rothwells is of great interest to all of us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Chaney asked whether the Attorney-General has received the opinion sought, I think I said, from Mr Walker, QC, assisted by two juniors. I assume that he has received it. I have not received such an opinion. It does not fall within my portfolio responsibilities. No doubt the Attorney-General has obtained such an opinion in his capacity as a member of the Ministerial Council. The Attorney would be seeking the advice of the Department. I do not know whether he has sought independent advice from a Queen's Counsel outside the Government, but I could check on that matter.</PARA>
<PARA> Advice proffered to the Ministerial Council is a matter for the Ministerial Council to consider. It will make its final decision on the basis of the opinion from Walker, QC, and such other matters as it takes into account in determining whether the release of the whole or part of the report would prejudice the course of prosecution and fair trial of those who might be subject to any charges. Therefore, it is really not for the Attorney alone to give an undertaking-I certainly cannot do so on his behalf-to release opinions which are provided to the Ministerial Council, or connected with the deliberations of the Ministerial Council. That would be a matter for the Ministerial Council to decide. In other words, I cannot give an undertaking on behalf of the Ministerial Council to release opinions provided to it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I remind the Minister that I asked him what position the Commonwealth Government is taking in today's vote by the Ministerial Council. I ask him to address that part of the question. I also remind the Minister, by way of supplementary question, that it is clearly and very credibly being put about that the report contains material which could prove highly embarrassing, and possibly damaging, to the Western Australian Government. I ask the Minister whether he agrees that in those circumstances the public interest requires the Commonwealth and those Ministers who are not directly politically affected to look very carefully at the public interest in seeing the disclosure of matters which may go to the credit of a government. In those circumstances, I ask the Minister to consider, and to advise in response to this question, how the Parliament and how the public are supposed to be satisfied that this matter is getting a consideration from a public interest point of view if the Minister is not prepared to table some of the advice which has been offered, bearing in mind that it has been freely put about that the Council has received advice that the document should be tabled.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to reveal the position which the Federal Attorney-General is taking in discussions with his colleagues on the Ministerial Council in relation to the deliberations which are still to be concluded. The question of the protection of the public interest relates to the necessity to ensure the fair trial of those who might be charged. That is the principal concern of the Ministerial Council. The question of the embarrassment or otherwise of a particular government, whether it be the Western Australian Government or the Queensland Government, will not in any way outweigh that factor, which is the key factor. The way in which Senator Chaney might gain some satisfaction that this matter is being looked at in a completely objective way, only with a view to securing the fair trial of persons in mind, is for me to remind him as I have, I think, on almost every occasion, that the Ministerial Council includes Attorneys-General from all Australian jurisdictions-those which have the good fortune to be governed by Labor and those which have the fortune to be governed by the conservative parties. If one looks at the article in today's Australian to which Senator Chaney refers one will see it is claimed that the Tasmanian Liberal Government has obtained an opinion from a QC in Melbourne to the effect that the report should not be disclosed. I am quite unable to say whether that report is correct. I take refuge in the belief that the composition of the Ministerial Council will ensure that this matter will receive the most careful and impartial consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware, with the help of Senator Maguire, of the International Herald Tribune report to which he refers and also of the statement by CIA Director, William Webster, that by the year 2000 at least 15 developing countries will be producing their own ballistic missiles and that 20 countries may already be manufacturing chemical weapons-alarming figures as they are. The Australian Government views the spread of chemical weapons as a major security and humanitarian problem. We believe that the most effective solution to this problem is through the conclusion at the earliest possible date of negotiations presently proceeding in Geneva at the conference on disarmament for a comprehensive ban on chemical weapons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In order to prepare the way for that treaty the Australian Government has been active in implementing a number of measures that will contribute to containing the spread of chemical weapons. They are only partial solutions and are in no way an adequate longer term substitute for a fully effective global ban. These measures include chairing the group known as the Australia Group of 20 nations which consults on the operation of export controls on the precursors of chemical weapons. During the past nine months or so we have launched a regional initiative to discuss in detail with our neighbours in South East Asia and the Pacific the threat posed by chemical weapons, how to avoid it and the implications for each of us of the chemical weapons convention. An important series of visits have taken place in this respect with officials of my Department and the Department of Defence in this exercise. Thirdly, the decision has been taken to initiate and host a major international conference here in Canberra in September this year to bring together governments and their chemical industries to establish a dialogue on how to avoid inadvertent diversion of industries' products to chemical weapons manufacture and generally to contribute to building regimes that will be necessary to make a universal chemical weapons convention effective.</PARA>
<PARA> I think all of us share the horror of chemical weapons that has become apparent in recent times through their use in the Middle East conflict. We share the alarm that has been articulated by Senator Maguire in reliance on information now readily available about the spread of not only the weapons but also the ballistic missiles to deliver them. It is a situation which is looming as perhaps the most significant immediate disarmament question with which the world's nations are presently obliged to grapple. Accordingly, it is appropriate that Australia has been able to play such a substantial and visible role which it will continue to play in trying to cope with this problem.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security. I would like the Minister to explain why pensioners on comparatively low fixed incomes are allowed to suffer a substantial reduction in income when the Australian dollar rises and the Department of Social Security does not change the notional exchange rate for some time. If the Ministerial response to another member of parliament is any indication, the notional rate is set and varied `from time to time'. The response does not say what regularity there is in regard to those changes on the basis of movements in the daily on-demand buying rate for pounds sterling cheques available from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA). The notional rates are varied when the movement in the CBA rates are relatively substantial and would appear to be part of an underlying trend. As a consequence of this, pensioners often receive less actual Australian dollar income without a compensating increase in their pensions. Given the Government's capacity to produce all sorts of complicated legislation and regulations on all sorts of other things, is it not possible to implement a better system of dealing with the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on pensioners by assessing the actual dollar value of foreign sourced income when it is paid into a nominated bank account, or at the very least, introducing a system where underpayments can be restored to pensioners to ensure they are not disadvantaged by a periodic over-estimation of the value of their foreign income?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some information for Senator Haines. I think the first point that should be made is that whereas we do have the capacity for detailed and intricate legislation, it does not necessarily always help. Foreign income must be converted to Australian dollars to calculate the rate of pension and fringe benefit entitlements. Senator Haines's question seems to refer to the 90,000 or so pensioners who receive sterling income.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The jackals on the other side of the House should be quiet for a few minutes so that Senator Haines can get an answer. The notional rate is changed when it differs too much from the CBA rate trend and the Department of Social Security automatically recalculates pension rates. There may be a delay of three to four weeks between the date when a new notional rate is approved and the pay day it comes into effect. The delay would be due to lead times requiring DSS processing mail times and bank processing. It should be noted that quite recently variations were made to the notional rate for the pay days of December 1988, 16 February 1989, 2 March 1989 and 16 March 1989. That indicates that there is a degree of flexibility in the system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Haines's question referred to the delay in converting exchange rate variations to the notional rate. I think we should also note in respect to this that the effect of exchange rate variations works in two different directions. If the value of the Australian dollar rises its theoretical effect in terms of the income test is to reduce the value of foreign source income and thus increase entitlement. However, if the value of the dollar falls the effect is in reverse and the entitlement is reduced. Thus, the averaging effect of the notional rate used by the Department is to smooth out variations. The Department aims to ensure that over a period no pensioner is disadvantaged. Measures such as the retention of fringe benefits for three months also help to protect pensioners from the effects of exchange rate variations. Finally, the alternative methods proposed for calculating exchange rate variations have involved considerable--</PARA>

Senator Vallentine asked me whether a prospective development would affect the greenhouse effect. Of course it will not. It will only have an impact on the greenhouse effect if the prospective development actually becomes a development. Senator Vallentine is asking me to agree that something on paper might have that effect. I am not going to agree to that, and it is right to say that that is a long bow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was then asked whether I am contradicting the Prime Minister. Of course I am not contradicting the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is absolutely right. In his typical, honest and blunt way, the Prime Minister is saying that coal-fired power generation has some contributory effect. That is true. The question, though, that I am being invited to assume is that it is the exclusive, major and whole effect. As I said yesterday in my answer to the question, CO2 emissions are half of the greenhouse gas emissions. The other half are spread across a range of other gases, including methane and chlorofluorocarbons. Of the CO2 emissions, coal is but a component of that. The Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, Mr Barry Jones, said yesterday that he believed the major cause of CO2 build-up was car exhaust emissions, which are from oil burning generation, not from coal burning generation. There is another view that one of the other significant causes is simply the world population explosion. The population of the globe is now heading towards six billion from about two billion 40 years ago. It is thought that the number of people just expiring is the cause of the build-up of CO2.</PARA>
<PARA> This issue is assisted considerably by getting the factual base right and being objective about what the causes are. A prospective coal mining and power generating operation in Western Australia is rightly called a long bow. It is not inconsistent with anything that we have said at The Hague.

That is a view which I also expressed to a large meeting of the CSIRO Staff Association. I do not resile from that view at all. I think that it was a comprehensive and balanced report, given the somewhat difficult circumstances in which it was prepared.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations, although it may be more appropriate to direct it to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Is the Minister aware of the difficulties and, therefore, delays that many low paid workers experienced in obtaining a 4 per cent increase under the second tier arrangements in the last round of wage negotiations, in many cases because they were in efficient industries and had very little to trade off? Is it a fact that those workers experienced a lowering in their standard of living by comparison with others in cost-plus industries who were less efficient and had more to trade off more readily? In addition, is the Minister aware of the figures that are available to the Government, including those of its own Institute of Family Studies, which show that low paid workers pay a greater percentage of their wages in tax now than they have for many years, and perhaps a greater percentage than they have ever paid? Is it true, as it seems to be from published reports, that the Government opposes proposals for a lift in the minimum wage of low paid workers? Will the Minister assure the Senate that the Government will agree to a new wages system in the restructuring discussions which will not disadvantage those workers who are in efficient industries and have nothing to restructure or trade off?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I concede that Senator Harradine's question has a serious purpose, and I will try to answer that, but I do not necessarily accept that on the basis of the 4 per cent wage round, those industries which were not able to give up particular benefits and so on were necessarily efficient. I do not want to enter into the efficiency or otherwise argument. The point of the question is really about lower paid workers. Whether they are in efficient or inefficient industries does not seem to me to matter very much. With regard to that part of the question, the Government has announced two intentions. Firstly, it will look at the tax question with a view to producing greater equity in the tax system. An announcement will be made about that next week. Secondly, the Government, in a submission to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, has put a position which agrees to wage increases on an award restructuring efficiency basis which will take place over a period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is also in the process of negotiations with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) about what is called the supplementary payments issue. This relates to that part of the honourable senator's question concerning low paid workers. In any Conciliation and Arbitration Commission decision, hopefully, as a result of agreement between the parties, they will be the beneficiaries of supplementary payments in addition to any other net benefits they receive from the revised taxation arrangements and award restructuring. Senator Harradine used the term `lift in the minimum wage'. The jargon about this issue changes from time to time, but the supplementary payments issue is designed to deal with that.</PARA>

Those rates will have to remain tight until there is a sustainable level of demand.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe this is a matter of great interest to honourable senators who engaged in a very vigorous debate on the merits of the Cash Transaction Reports Bill. I believe they would be interested to know what some of the results have been to date. When I visited the Brisbane office of the Australian Federal Police in February, before the start of the parliamentary session, I was informed that in late 1988 the AFP had become aware of irregularities with a bank account held with a branch of the Westpac Banking Corporation in Brisbane. Investigations revealed that an individual claiming to be unemployed had opened the account and that between May and September 1988 approximately half a million dollars had been deposited and transferred through the account by telegraphic transfer to an account with a foreign bank in Singapore. I am further informed that inquiries indicated that, although in different names, the two accounts were held by the same person. A search warrant was executed, information was obtained and the person involved was charged with two offences relating to the operation of an account with a cash deal in a false name, contrary to the provisions of the Cash Transaction Reports Act. I believe that all of those involved, both in the bank concerned and in the AFP, are to be commended on their very timely and speedy implementation of that provision of the Cash Transaction Reports Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It may be also of some interest that the individual has been convicted and sentenced to three months imprisonment on each charge. I have delayed informing the Senate of this because of the prospect of an appeal being lodged, but I understand that the individual has withdrawn his appeal against the severity of the sentence. I do not know that three months is really all that severe for what he engaged in. There is another aspect of this matter which I think would please Senator Walsh in particular: in addition, the individual concerned has been required to pay a taxation assessment amounting to approximately $1.6m. I believe that in getting at the proceeds of crime by raising tax assessments against those involved in criminal activity, one is beginning to have a very severe impact on those engaged in crime against the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the Cash Transaction Reports Act, together with the proceeds of crime legislation which was passed by this Parliament, one sees the determination on the part of this Government and Parliament that crime should not pay. It is one thing to imprison a person for a certain term, but if that person can enjoy the fruits of his nefarious activities, of course, he can endure a term of imprisonment. I believe that it is most important that the community gets back the assets that have been accumulated by those who are involved in the drug trade in particular and who feed off the degradation and eventual death, in many instances, of young Australians. I believe that the Parliament-of course, the Government takes credit for putting it before the Parliament-can take great pride in the operation of both the proceeds of crime legislation and the cash transaction reports legislation.</PARA>

Can the Minister tell me how many extra Soviet personnel will pass through Australia each year if these draft agreements are adopted? Is the Soviet Union seeking access to Tasmanian ports? If so, is he concerned that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) does not have an office in Tasmania? In light of ample evidence from around the world that Soviet fishing and scientific vessels are frequently used for espionage activities, and in light of documented cases of Soviet espionage in Australia, highlighted by the recent exposure of KGB spy Mr Valery Zemskov, whom the Government had allowed to remain in Australia for three years, can the Minister give any guarantee that Soviet ships allowed to enter Australian territorial waters and ports will not become involved in espionage affecting the security and defence of Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just heard from Senator Bishop a repetition of the extraordinarily paranoid and quite manic outbursts which came from her leader, Mr Howard, earlier this week. Those outbursts are quite a remarkable demonstration of how far out of touch the Opposition is with recent developments in international affairs. A further indication of this was given by its foreign policy-if that is the appropriate description for that policy-which was launched this morning and about which I may have something to say at a later stage. The Opposition's approach to the world is one which reflects the paranoia of the Cold War era and utterly fails to reflect or understand the new kinds of dynamics which operate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Against that background, let me respond specifically. The second round of talks with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) on the fisheries and commodities agreements concluded on 2 March. A draft fisheries agreement-it has no more status than that at the moment-was negotiated. It provides for limited feasibility fishing in the Australian fishing zone. Details have to be negotiated, but no more than two Soviet trawlers will be allowed in the first year in that respect. Secondly, the agreement provides for access to Australian ports for repairs. No decision has yet been made as to which ports are to be used for that purpose. It also provides access for Aeroflot charter flights to transfer crews.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will only agree to arrangements which bring clear benefits to Australia. In the context of the concerns which have been expressed by Senator Bishop, defence and security considerations will be obviously taken fully into account by the Government. It is the case that a number of other countries, including the United States, Canada, Singapore, Japan and New Zealand have similar port access arrangements with the Soviet Union. Soviet cargo and cruise vessels already enjoy substantial access to Australian ports. There were, in fact, 310 port calls in 1986-87, the last year for which I have full figures.</PARA>
<PARA> I am not able to respond, from the briefing in front of me, to the specific questions about the number of Soviet personnel who will be passing through the ports in question as a result of the arrangements, when they are finally bedded down. I will seek some estimates of that figure and advise the honourable senator accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA> I do suggest, in all good conscience, that the honourable senator try to mitigate some of the paranoia on this subject which is so obviously rampant throughout the Opposition ranks. This attitude is not only unproductive. I think it is totally counterproductive in terms of the effective pursuit of Australia's longer term commercial interests.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been a number of developments over the last 24 hours, which I hope will lead to the identification of means to resolve the crisis now facing the Namibian peace process. It is perhaps a little early to talk in terms of optimism. I understand the United Nations (UN) Secretary-General has put specific proposals aimed at restoring the ceasefire to the South African Administrator-General in Windhoek, to the Angolan Government and to the South West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO) in Luanda. Heads of government from the front-line states are meeting in Luanda to consider the situation. There are media reports that Dr Chester Crocker, who has been closely involved over a long period of time in negotiations for a settlement in Namibia, is flying to Windhoek today for an emergency meeting of the Joint Cuban, Angolan, South African monitoring committee. It has also been reported that a representative from the Soviet Union may be invited to attend. The British Prime Minister, Mrs Thatcher, is expected to raise the issue with Mr Gorbachev, during his current visit to the United Kingdom.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The difficulty is that the two major protagonists in the current situation are still adopting fixed positions. The head of SWAPO, Mr Sam Nujoma, has continued to state the SWAPO troops inside Namibia will not be withdrawn. South Africa, on the other hand, continues to insist that SWAPO should be confined to bases outside Namibia and that all SWAPO forces inside Namibia should withdraw north of the sixteenth parallel under United Nations Transitional Assistance Group (UNTAG) protection. South Africa has given a deadline of tomorrow for the surrender of the SWAPO forces. These recent developments may lead to an expanded role for UNTAG, if only to help escort SWAPO troops back to their bases. It is reported that the United States and Canada have offered to fly a battalion of Finnish troops to Namibia to strengthen 4,650 troops already agreed as the initial ground force.</PARA>
<PARA> At this critical time the Australian Government calls on all parties in this dispute to let commonsense prevail and to abide by the terms and the spirit of existing agreements. It also calls on all parties to work together in such a way as to ensure a speedy resolution of the unfortunate incidents which have occurred this week and to attend to the greater task of creating an independent Namibia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Newman asked me a question concerning an allegation that an officer of the Attorney-General's Department had given Mr John Friedrich access to discussions, briefings or documents, particularly those documents responsible for anti-terrorist planning, operations, and so on. I have caused inquiries to be made, and all available officers of the security division of the Department, excluding those on leave, have had their attention drawn to the question and all have denied giving such access. Former officers of the division who are still officers of the Department have been similarly asked that question and have denied giving such access. Efforts have been made to contact former officers of the Protective Services Coordination Centre who are now retired from the Public Service. That series of inquiries is continuing.

<PARA> There is one primary difficulty: we are finding it hard to focus exactly on what Senator Newman had in mind. During the discussion on the matter of public importance, which followed Question Time, Senator Newman purported to describe the document as the `National Security Plan'. Nobody in the security division of the Attorney-General's Department knows of such a document and is, therefore, at a grave disadvantage in following up her particular allegation. I believe that it is incumbent on Senator Newman to indicate more particularly how she came to give a document, of which she apparently has knowledge, that title. The fact is that during the matter of public importance by way of interjection on Senator Cooney, Senator Hill was induced by Senator Newman to wave a document purporting to be the `National Security Plan'. So Senator Newman apparently has some documentation. Unlike Mr Peter White who phoned me yesterday morning-as a result of that phone call I arranged for the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police to receive a document from Mr White-Senator Newman has not made such a document available either to my office or to the Australian Federal Police. If she does have such a document, I believe it is incumbent upon her-it is her duty as a senator-to make it available. I ask her to do so.

<PARA> On Tuesday I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) a question in relation to the greenhouse effect, basing the question on a full page advertisement which appeared in the Australian at the weekend outlining The Hague Declaration to which Senator Evans is a signatory on behalf of Australia, and on Senator Evans's statement in which he identified the greenhouse phenomenon as the most important problem facing mankind. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of this, it is disturbing to find the Government still pursuing policies of attempting to increase our production and consumption of fossil fuels. For instance, just yesterday we had tabled in this place a Bill-I guess we will discuss it next week-to continue further the exemption from duty of coal from certain mines in Queensland. Again, in view of the fact that coal is one of the major contributors to greenhouse warming, I find the path being taken by the Government in its industrial policies-which come under Senator Button-and those being pursued by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) and the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) to be somewhat in conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> The price of solar cells in absolute terms and relative to other ways of generating electricity has been tumbling in recent years. The latest developments which come from a joint project by ARCO in the United States and the United States Department of Energy indicate that it is now possible to generate solar power at around $3 per watt of capital cost. Interestingly, that compares with the capital cost of the latest nuclear power station, which was almost $9 per watt. Certainly, comparing the best of solar with the worst of nuclear, one can say that those costs have already crossed over and that direct solar conversion to electricity is well able to compete with nuclear. While the technology is certainly nowhere near the generating costs in Australia, which are running at around $1 per watt, quite clearly it is approaching that sort of level. It is a great pity that we are not prepared to exploit deliberately this technology in a much greater way, because it is a technology which approaches economic viability with respect to our generating capacity. It is a technology which does not contribute to greenhouse and indeed is an extremely benign technology. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also disturbing to find these tariff rates being imposed at a time when the Government, on its own admission, is moving to reduce the tariff rates and protections and so on in Australian industry. One could argue that there are small industries in Australia that are both manufacturing and assembling solar cells. It is, I suppose, a balancing act between some protection of those industries and the importation of these cells from overseas, but the developments overseas are really so exciting that we should be moving to exploit that technology as rapidly as we possibly can. For that reason, I suggest that we reduce that tariff duty to zero. I was pleased to hear the Minister give an undertaking earlier that the Government will be reviewing this matter. I hope that in that review the Government will see fit to reduce that tariff to zero per cent. I now formally move:</PARA>

He really asked whether there was any inconsistency in the existence of a tariff on ivory in this legislation and the endangered species legislation, which prohibits imports into Australia of ivory or anything else from endangered species. It might be difficult to explain, but there does not seem to be any inconsistency in those two things. The Australian Customs Service is responsible for administering the tariff system. I will give a hypothetical illustration. If a new government decided that the wildlife and endangered species legislation should not be used or should be replaced, then the tariff would apply, but only in that circumstance.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There probably is one, Senator. The rate of duty on solar arrays and cells is phasing down. Senator Coulter wants the duty removed instantly, assuming, I think, that something might follow in terms of use as a result of that. I am not sure whether that is true. But the Government cannot accept the amendment moved by Senator Coulter, for the following reasons. First, we cannot alter levels of protection without any form of industry review, such as a review by the Industries Assistance Commission. That would be contrary to longstanding practice, because that review process enables the local companies to have their say about that matter and they have a right to contribute to that process. There are at least three manufacturers of photovoltaic cells in Australia and a number of other firms are engaged in the assembly of solar arrays.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I mentioned that the duty was phasing down, and it is in that context that the Government cannot accept this request by Senator Coulter. As I said this morning, I am not unmindful of the concern behind the request. While the honourable senator was speaking I was wondering what any government in Australia would do if there were an enormous breakthrough in solar energy in some other country confronted with this problem. But I am certainly sympathetic to the concerns behind the request. As I undertook to do this morning, I will ask my Department to see whether we can review the tariff structure for solar cells in some context which might come up in the not too distant future. </PARA>

I, like everyone else, hope that ultimately it will in some way or another prove to be the major source of energy around the world. But, in the meantime, it is a small industry in Australia. In some areas it is developing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few brief remarks on clause 8 of the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1988. Yesterday, my colleague Senator McLean drew attention to this clause which deals with the defence provisions of the principal Act. The implication may have been drawn from Senator McLean's remarks that we were calling for this clause to be removed from the Bill. We have investigated this matter further and find that the Act gives the Governor-General, presumably through the Executive Council, the power to make certain regulations with respect to exports. Those provisions contain a number of regulations, one of which confers on the Minister for Defence the ability to invoke regulations with respect to exports of military-related equipment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clause 8 of the Bill seeks to extend the powers of the Minister with respect to those regulations to the extent that he can, under changed circumstances, refuse the export of military-related equipment. For example, under the present regulations, it would not be possible for the Minister for Defence to revoke the export of sporting rifles to Fiji in the event of a coup. The effect of the new clause 8 amendments is that the Minister will have that power, and therefore we support the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that in the near future the whole of the regulations which deal with the export of defence and military related equipment will be up for review. I put the Government on notice that we will then, when it is more appropriate, be looking very closely at the sorts of materials which Australia may or may not export and the conditions under which they may be exported. Therefore, while I accept Senator Button's remarks that some of the speeches that have been made in this debate are not appropriate to the legislation we are considering now, we will nonetheless be taking up those matters at a more appropriate time, which I believe will be in about a month. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I was not in the chamber earlier and had not had the courtesy of a call from Senator Tate that he intended to respond to my question of yesterday, so I did not hear all of his answer; but I did hear sufficient to cause me to wish to set the record straight today. My question to Senator Tate yesterday was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Has Mr John Friedrich been given access to any discussions, briefings or documents by any officer of the Attorney-General's Department, particularly those who might be responsible for anti-terrorist planning or operations or the protection of vital installations or VIPs? If so, what briefings, discussions or documents were they, who provided access, when and for what purpose, and on whose authority was such access granted?</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister answered yesterday that he did not know the detailed answer to my question but that he would get me the detailed information. Then the Minister proceeded to talk about a document which he said was prepared by Mr Holdich and which was the subject of some public reporting earlier this week. In the debate yesterday I told him the name of yet another document, the National Security Plan. I took the first opportunity in the debate to tell the Minister what I had learned from an informant. I had been informed that there were more documents than the Holdich report handed to Mr John Friedrich. </PARA>
<PARA> I had been informed that more than one document was handed to Mr Friedrich by an official in the protective services area. I had been informed that there had been some contact between these men, with the possibility of briefings. I was also informed that the Minister was to be briefed by the Attorney-General's Department on these matters and I therefore asked him my question. The Minister claimed that he had no further knowledge. I claimed that either he knew or he should have known. Perhaps his Department decided not to brief him. In response to his allegation that I induced Senator Hill to wave a document in the air during the debate yesterday, not only did I not do so but I did not even know that Senator Hill had waved any document in the air. Senator Tate stated that he would not respond to yesterday's question unless I produced this document and that he was unable to find a copy of the document to which I had referred. I believe that is Senator Tate's problem; it is not my problem. I am a member of the Opposition; he is the Minister responsible for the Department. If my informant is correct and the details which were handed to me appear to be sufficient to warrant investigation then the Senate is entitled to a full answer to my question. </PARA>
<PARA> These are security matters and they are too serious to be dismissed by Government Ministers. The cavalier treatment given to them by the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) and the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) reveals the need for a royal commission to investigate all allegations concerning the involvement of the Federal Government with Mr John Friedrich and the National Safety Council of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate now has before it the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1988. It is an extremely complex piece of legislation. The amending Bill itself is a Bill which runs to some 122 pages and amends most of the significant sections of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. The Bill addresses in general the following matters: to provide a fixed formula for the representation of Territories and new States in the Federal Parliament; to provide for the printing and distribution of the electoral rolls to senators, members and political parties no later than the end of the second year of each Parliament; to provide for the availability to specific persons or groups of the electoral roll in the form of microfiche and magnetic tapes and discs; to give all prisoners, excluding those convicted of treason, the right to vote and make provision for mobile polling in prisons-although one is tempted to say that these days it would be just as easy for prisoners in most States simply to walk out the front gate and vote as to provide mobile polling booths for them; to make provision for a clear distinction between votes issued pursuant to written application, to be called postal votes, and votes issued pursuant to oral application, to be called pre-poll votes; to tighten the provisions relating to the registration and deregistration of political parties; to enable the use of mobile polling in hospitals to be more extensive and allow mobile polling teams visiting hospitals to carry and distribute how to vote material; to provide that religious objection to voting shall be a valid and sufficient reason for not voting; to make a number of changes related to the system of reporting and noting the financial arrangements made in support of political parties under the disclosure provisions of the Act; to provide a full distribution of preferences in the House of Representatives election to take place, notwithstanding that a candidate has received an absolute majority of votes; to provide a new method for resolving deadlocks in elections; to make certain changes related to the way in which the Court of Disputed Returns operates; and, finally, to create the statutory office of the Australian Electoral Officer for the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the view of the Opposition, it is unfortunate that the Government has decided to proceed with this legislation prior to receipt of the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters looking at questions arising from the 1987 Federal election. It is our belief that that Joint Standing Committee will, as a result of its deliberations, recommend further amendments to Com- monwealth electoral legislation. In our view it would have been wise to wait until that Committee had tendered its report and to have incorporated changes at that stage so that in the next few months we are not faced with yet more changes to Commonwealth electoral legislation. Nevertheless, the Government has decided to proceed with this legislation and we will deal with it on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of matters which I wish to raise and a number of matters which will detain us for some time in committee. This will be a fairly complicated and technical debate when we come to the committee stage. However, at this stage I simply address my mind to matters related to some broad headings in terms of this legislation. The first of those matters to which I draw attention is the importance and integrity of the Commonwealth electoral roll. The electoral roll is an important document in terms of being a matter of public record, in terms of the use that is made of it and in terms of its integrity in relation to the actual procedures for the conduct of elections. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday in the Parliament of New South Wales a report was tabled by a New South Wales Government committee of inquiry which examined all aspects of the conduct of elections in that State. That committee made some observations to the New South Wales Parliament about electoral rolls which I find a little disturbing. For example, page 9 of the committee's report states:</PARA>
<PARA>While recognising that the Australian Electoral Commission has always been most cooperative in providing information in terms of the joint role agreement, the Committee considers that the State electoral office has been badly served so far as access to roll information is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>I am most concerned to seek from the Minister responsible for the conduct of the Electoral Act his response at the end of the second reading debate to the significant comments made in the report of the New South Wales committee of inquiry into this matter. Rather than detail all those comments at this stage I shall simply refer to some as we proceed. For example, in relation to multiple voting-which in many ways is related to the nature, efficacy and currency of electoral rolls-the New South Wales committee says:</PARA>
<PARA>Multiple voting, on the other hand, occurs with greater regularity-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, it occurs with greater regularity than fraudulent voting-</PARA>
<PARA>and has the potential to result in much more serious consequences. The opportunities for multiple voting have been greatly enhanced by the enactment of legislation which now enables people to vote at any polling place in the electorate in which they are enrolled. </PARA>
<PARA>We will be coming back to the question of subdivisional enrolment and to the loss of integrity in electoral matters by the move away from recording enrolments in terms of subdivisional enrolments and the practice of voting anywhere within the division. Undoubtedly, honourable senators will be aware of the claims made that, for example, at the last State election in New South Wales the committee found that multiple voting appeared to have occurred in nearly all of the State's 109 electorates, especially in the State division of Balmain, where one voter was suspected of having voted at least 15 times. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Schacht interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Schacht should not get too anxious: we are about to deal with some of these voting irregularities. The question of the integrity of the roll and its relationship to enrolment by subdivision is important. Let me give an example from Labor Party sources of the importance of the electoral roll. Senator Richardson and our new colleague Senator Faulkner both had an interest in the Labor Party preselection for the State seat of Liverpool. One of the factors which determined whether people were entitled to vote in the preselection for the seat of Liverpool was whether they were on the electoral roll. Electoral rolls are important not only for the conduct of Commonwealth elections but for the conduct of internal political party ballots. If one looks at the Sun-Herald of 26 February 1989 one will see that a person who believed she was entitled to vote in the Liverpool preselection, Mr Violet Goulden, was reported in these terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Pensioner, Mrs Violet Goulden, a lifelong ALP supporter, is angry at the way her vote for Mr Lynch was declared invalid. </PARA>
<PARA> She said the reason for her disqualification was that she was not on the current electoral roll. </PARA>
<PARA>Mrs Goulden has produced evidence to show she made three attempts to notify the Electoral Commissioner of her change of address. As a result of all that, as honourable senators will know, Mr Lynch had the Liverpool preselection stolen from him. Senator Faulkner, as he is now, was asked some questions about this. On the AM program on 2 March Mr Faulkner, as he was then, said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is conclusive evidence that two people in the Liverpool preselection ballot have been denied a vote improperly. Someone has rewritten a branch boundaries map, so the branch boundary instead of going down the Hume highway goes down a cul-de-sac and through a park and conveniently writes two people out of the preselection. </PARA>
<PARA>The interviewer asked him:</PARA>
<PARA>Is there any doubt, in your mind, who won the preselection?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Faulkner said:</PARA>
<PARA>Absolutely none. The preselection ballot was won fairly and squarely by Paul Lynch. </PARA>
<PARA>Question:</PARA>
<PARA>Who rorted it?</PARA>
<PARA>Answer:</PARA>
<PARA>I don't know who rorted it, except to say no individual rorted it, but I can best identify the New South Wales right-wing machine. </PARA>
<PARA>No wonder Senator Richardson hides his head in the papers he has in front of him. He is the expert in this matter. I simply make the point that it is important for a number of reasons that the electoral roll be kept fairly and squarely up to date. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one particular matter of some interest in terms of electoral enrolments which, after reading last year's annual report of the Australian Electoral Commission, I find quite fascinating. It relates to the extent to which variations occur over time between enrolments in the States. For instance, on 12 June 1987 in the State of Victoria there were 2,696,474 electors enrolled and on 24 June 1988 there were 2,678,015. In Queensland there were 1,706,902 enrolled on 12 June 1987 and 1,676,706 enrolled on 24 June 1988. These figures are important because they go to the question of whether a State should have a particular representation in the House of Representatives. What I found extraordinary and, frankly, almost unbelievable from a statistical point of view was that on 12 June 1987 the enrolment in the State of Tasmania was 300,463 and on 24 June 1988 it was 300,463. I must say I find it absolutely remarkable that in the course of a year and a week the electoral enrolment of that State did not vary by one vote one way or the other. It might be an interesting statistical anomaly but I find it somewhat curious. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not surprised. Senator Richardson knows a great deal about organising these things. The second point which arises in this legislation is that the second reading speech is actually quite misleading. The second reading speech states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill provides a fixed formula for the representation of Territories and new States in the Federal Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill actually says absolutely nothing about representation of new States. The reason is that the Commonwealth Parliament cannot provide for the representation of new States until such time as the new State is admitted. That is simply a constitutional requirement. It is a piece of extraordinary sloppiness to be told that a Bill is going to provide for something and then find that the Bill does not provide for it. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason the Bill does not provide for it is that constitutionally it cannot. Frankly, if the Electoral Commission cannot do better than put into a second reading speech that something is going to be in a piece of legislation and then find that it is not in the piece of legislation, the Minister ought to be asking some questions in that regard. When we come to those particular sections I will have cause to make some comments about the report of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform, report No. 1, of November 1985 entitled Determining the Entitlement of Federal Territories and New States to Representation in the Commonwealth Parliament and to indicate our support for the general thrust of those amendments, which, after all, very largely derive from the initiatives taken by the honourable member for Sturt in the other place, Mr Ian Wilson, who is from the same State as you, Mr Acting Deputy President. In discussion on the Commonwealth Electoral Legislation Amendment Bill 1983, it was he who first suggested in a parliamentary and legislative form the way in which the representation of the Territories should be fixed by formula. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point to which I wish to refer is the question of voting entitlements for persons in prison. At present the Commonwealth Electoral Act provides in clause 93 subclause 8 (b) that a person who has been convicted and is under sentence for an offence punishable under the law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory by imprisonment for five years or longer is not entitled to have his name on the electoral roll and, consequently, not entitled to vote. This legislation provides that anybody who is in prison, except for the crime of treason-and I cannot recall whether there has ever been an imprisonment for treason in Australia, although I stand to be corrected-is now entitled to vote. When we come to the committee stage the Opposition will move for the deletion of this provision in order to return to the provision that anybody who is in prison for five years or more shall not be entitled to vote. If that amendment is not successful, the Opposition will in fact vote against the entire piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the comments in Report No. 2 of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform, entitled The Operation during the 1984 General Election of the 1983-84 Amendment to Commonwealth Electoral Legislation, one will see this matter dealt with at some length. We will come to that in the committee stage of the Bill. However, I should draw attention to the fact that the question of the restriction of the voting rights of prisoners was a majority recommendation made by the members of the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats and that there was a dissenting report, on pages 218 and 219, submitted by the then Senator the Hon. Sir John Carrick, by the Hon. Michael MacKellar, MP, and Mr Charles Blunt, MP, in which the views of the coalition parties in opposition to this extension of voting rights to prisoners were clearly set out. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will also be seeking to make amendments in this legislation to the question of the use of mobile booths in terms of paying visits to hospitals. At present the Act precludes a candidate from entering hospitals, special hospitals, nursing homes or similar institutions in order to canvass for votes once the writs for an election have been issued. We will move to delete that particular provision. In essence, what the Act says is that a person who is in hospital, special hospital, nursing home or similar institution shall not be subjected to any candidate entering that particular institution from the date of issue of the writs. We believe that there should be some reasonable restriction placed on people on, say, polling day or in the week leading up to polling day. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we do not believe that candidates in a fair and open democratic election should be denied the right to canvass inside hospitals, special hospital or nursing homes from the date on which the writs are issued. We think that that is an unnecessary, unfair and improper restriction on the rights of candidates to canvass for votes in important institutions, particularly since those persons are among those most likely not to have access to electoral information provided in any other form. They are the people, apart from prisoners, most likely to have no access to electoral information other than that supplied by the Electoral Commission from the date of the issue of the writs. Therefore, we will seek to amend that by omitting from the legislation the clause which brings about that prohibition. </PARA>
<PARA> We will also move an amendment dealing with the processes of redistribution and, in particular, the fact that a situation can arise in this country where a party can win a majority of the votes, and indeed a majority of the votes on a two-party preferred basis, and nevertheless find itself actually losing seats. At the last general election the Liberal and National parties combined 46.07 per cent of the vote on a national basis. The Australian Labor Party 45.83 per cent nationally. Nevertheless, as a result the coalition parties lost seats and the Labor Party gained seats. For example, in Western Australia at the last election, the two-party preferred vote was 52.2 per cent for the Liberal and National parties and 47.8 per cent for the Labor Party. But the Labor Party was able to secure a greater number of seats. Therefore, we will move an amendment requiring that greater steps be taken in terms of Commonwealth legislation to ensure that a party winning in excess of 50 per cent of the votes is entitled to more than 50 per cent of the seats. </PARA>

<PARA> The final point I wish to make in a general summary of the issues which are canvassed in the legislation concerns the change in the formula to be applied inside the polling booth to the questions which are to be put to electors prior to their being issued with a ballot paper. At the moment the Commonwealth Electoral Act provides that the presiding officer or the poll clerk in each polling booth shall ask a series of questions of the elector. Section 229 (1) of the Act provides:</PARA>
<PARA> The presiding officer shall put the following questions to each person attending before him and claiming to vote in an election or elections:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) What is your full name?</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Where do you live?</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Have you voted before in this election? or Have you voted before in these elections? (as the case requires). </PARA>
<PARA>The new provision, which is to be found in clause 66 of the Bill, will amend that section to make it read:</PARA>
<PARA>The presiding officer shall put to each person claiming to vote such questions as the presiding officer thinks necessary to enable the person's identity and place of living to be established. </PARA>
<PARA>We do not believe that the formula should be, `such questions as the presiding officer thinks necessary'. We think that those questions should be specified in the Act and that they should also establish the elemental question, `Have you voted before in this election?'-not just, `Who are you and where do you live?'. There is absolutely no explanation given as to why the question, `Have you voted before in this election?' has been deleted. </PARA>

Senator Richardson has a concern about whether anybody has ever answered that question in the affirmative. That is not the point. We are not in the process-although Senator Richardson might well be-of writing New South Wales Labor Party rules into the Commonwealth Electoral Act.

As I say, we are not in the process of simply writing into the Commonwealth Electoral Act all of the tricks and techniques which have so characterised the Labor Party in New South Wales for a prolonged time and which Senator Faulkner denounced with such eloquent terminology when he was interviewed on a radio program a little while ago.

<PARA> Although we have indicated that the majority of changes which have been proposed in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1988 do meet with our approval, there are a number of threshold points to which I return. The primary point, the point to which the Opposition will stick in terms of its amendments-and if its amendments are unsuccessful it will oppose the passage of the Bill as a whole-is the extension of voting rights to people who are in prison for a term which is a term less than five years. We will deal with that in the committee stage. We will move other amendments. Indeed, we have given notice of those amendments. We will also support a number of amendments which have been proposed by the Australian Democrats, particularly those which relate to the placing of other words on the ballot paper for referendum questions, relating to the invalidity of a ballot paper if it contains words other than `Yes' or `No'. We will support the Democrats' amendment which is designed to prevent the expenditure by Government of money promoting the Yes or No case in a referendum, other than in the circumstances which are specified in the Democrat amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> We will be seeking some clarification of a number of matters, including the question of why-and what the expense involved will be-the Electoral Commission needs to issue badges to scrutineers, which is provided for in clause 77 to amend section 264 of the Act. We will ask why this absolutely unnecessary additional piece of regulatory nonsense on the part of the Electoral Commission is needed. Officers will issue badges to scrutineers. We have done perfectly well without having to plead with the Electoral Commission to issue badges. What sort of nonsense will occur if the Electoral Commission runs out of badges or does not have badges available? Scrutineers will be prevented from exercising their proper responsibilities because the Act will require, as is stated in the proposed amendment, `a scrutineer shall wear a badge supplied by the Electoral Commission'. If only the Electoral Commission would get its act together-goodness knows, it runs out of ballot papers from time to time at polling booths, let alone scrutineers' badges. We will come to whether people will be prevented from acting as scrutineers. </PARA>
<PARA> We will come to the question of the privacy of donors who, under the amendments to section 305 of the principal Act, will be required to give the names and addresses of the members of the executive committee, however described, of an association that makes a gift. Presumably, that means that if a trade union gives a gift to the Australian Labor Party, instead of simply recording that the gift is from the trade union, or if a company gives a donation to the Liberal Party, that the donation is from the company, it will be necessary to supply the names and addresses of the members of the executive committee, however described, of the association. This is an unnecessary intrusion into the private affairs of individuals and an unnecessary intrusion into privacy in a way which the Labor Party has pursued on a number of occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore indicate that there will be a long and quite interesting committee stage debate. The Opposition will have a great deal turning on the question of the amendment regarding the rights of prisoners to vote. We will be seeking some explanations from the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray). Otherwise, I commend other parts of the Bill to the attention of the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Puplick asked me at Question Time what the results were of my discussion with the Commonwealth Ombudsman. I had to say, at that stage, that the finalisation of those matters was very close at hand; it is now at hand. I propose to read, if I could, the statement put out by the Ombudsman and add two or three comments myself. The heading of the statement is, `Satisfactory Outcome for Ombudsman's Report on Immigration Review Fees'. The document reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Ombudsman, Professor Dennis Pearce, today welcomed the agreement of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, to refund certain Immigration Review Panel (IRP) fees collected without legislative backing and to fund two new programs for the benefit of migrants. </PARA>
<PARA> The Ombudsman and the Minister met on 8 April 1988 to discuss the Ombudsman's recent report concerning the IRP fees. They agreed on the following package:</PARA>
<PARA> persons who paid the $240 IRP fee at any time under protest can request a full refund;</PARA>
<PARA> the Government will advertise a refund of application to those who paid the IRP fee from 12 December 1988;</PARA>
<PARA> unclaimed IRP fees for that period will fund a new Campaign Against Racism;</PARA>
<PARA> an additional $250,000 will fund a new pilot program on migrant access to Government services;</PARA>
<PARA> the Commonwealth will not recover legal costs from a person who challenged the lawfulness of the IRP fee. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Pearce said that the agreement was a satisfactory compromise which met his main concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreement acknowledged that the IRP should have been supported by legislation. It also recognised legal, administrative and political realities:</PARA>
<PARA> there was probably no legal right to a refund for those who did not pay the IRP fee under protest;</PARA>
<PARA> the Department initially had real expectations of legislative approval of the IRP fee;</PARA>
<PARA> subsequently, the Department had legal advice that the IRP might be lawful;</PARA>
<PARA> it was not until 12 December 1988 that the Attorney-General advised that a legislative basis was necessary;</PARA>
<PARA> a full refund of the $2.7m now would prejudice other important programs for migrants;</PARA>
<PARA> the IRP fees had in fact been expended on providing an improved mechanism for review of migration decisions. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Short" NAMEID="DJ4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would rather read this statement first before I go to that point. It continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Professor Pearce said that he accepted the Minister's assurances that his Department had acted in good faith in collecting the IRP fees. The Ombudsman also welcomed the Minister's advice that the Government would continue to provide avenues for review of past and future migration decisions and for possible refunds of review fees. </PARA>
<PARA> ``In summary,'' Professor Pearce said ``the agreement takes into account the important principle that Government programs should be lawful. It achieves refunds for the least justifiable period of IRP fee collection. It initiates two important programs for migrants which would otherwise not be funded''. </PARA>
<PARA> The Ombudsman said that he appreciated the preparedness of the Minister to negotiate a practical resolution to what was recognised as a difficult situation. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the Ombudsman's statement on the matter. I would like to put on the public record my appreciation of the work that the Ombudsman has done in this regard. The draft report and the final report were matters for discussion yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess the most contentious issue that I had to discuss with the Ombudsman was the question of whether my Department knowingly collected fees that it believed to be illegal. From our discussions yesterday and the statement today I think one can see that the Ombudsman now believes that we did not collect the fees knowing them to be illegal. He might also have the view that we should have known, or that we should have used a judgment to that effect. That was my major difficulty with the Ombudsman's report and that has been resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of whether we should refund fees where the Department was in the wrong is a matter that we have clarified with the Ombudsman, and he now accepts that we do refund such fees and that that part of the report is no longer operative. In the end, I guess, one of the most difficult decisions that had to be made in these negotiations was the period in which the fee should be open to be refunded. Certainly, the letter from the Attorney-General to me on 12 December was used as the watershed in that regard. I think we both recognise that to have to refund $2.7m would impair other programs. Senator Short, by way of interjection, waved the magic wand and said that that just goes into general revenue, but approvals for pro- jects within my Department in the past and in the future are offset by that money. If I am to refund $2.7m it will be taken out of my departmental budget, not out of some mythical fund. I would have to reduce existing services which, I am sure, both the Ombudsman and I would be reluctant to do. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not trying to shift the responsibility, but I must point out that most of these matters were under way before I became Minister in this area. It has to be recognised that part of our thinking late last year was that we hoped that many of these issues would be covered satisfactorily in the new legislation. Much depends on the view of this chamber. I am pleased that we have resolved this matter without having to invoke the other necessary steps that an Ombudsman must go through if he cannot negotiate with a department. I found him very willing to be open and to admit on occasions that not all of his report was accurate. But also, under the compelling arguments he put, I had to concede that some of my previous arguments were not well founded. That is part of the process, to and fro, that goes on when these matters are considered. I again put on the public record my thanks to the Ombudsman for his interest in this matter, for the way in which he has approached it, and for his willingness to come to a practical solution that in the end will not penalise the very clients whose interests we both have at heart. </PARA>
<PARA> I just say this about the review system: the changes instituted in 1987 reduced delays by half, from 12 months to five months, and cleared up much of the backlog that had existed in this area for the previous 10 or 12 years. That was an important move-so much so that the extra panels established in Canberra have been wound down to virtually zero. That is quite an advance. I regret that the information was not available at 2 o'clock. I have explained that because of another case running at the moment in my Department these matters were not able to come across as expeditiously as I would have liked. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the answer. </PARA>
<PARA>I first of all thank the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) for his courtesy in handling this matter today. I appreciate his willingness to obtain the information and make it available to the Senate at the first available opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that there is to be at least some limited refund for the immigration review panel fee-limited, I understand, to those who paid the fee under protest prior to 12 December 1988. Undoubtedly there will be some quite interesting issues raised as to how one demonstrates that these fees were paid under protest. It seems to me that a majority of Australians pay all taxes and fees under protest; nevertheless they usually pay them with some degree of good humour. One wonders exactly how that will be demonstrated and, indeed, how departmental officers will know whether some person who made an expression in a language other than English was in fact simply saying `Thank you very much for charging me the fee', or was saying something that might be constituted as a term which indicated that that person was paying under protest. I am glad to see that the Government has indicated that it will not proceed with the collection of costs involved in the case brought by Ms D., from whose intervention in the first place a great deal of the Ombudsman's interest flowed. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to put clearly on the record the attitude the Opposition has taken to this matter. I can do no better than refer to the comments made by my colleague Senator Short on 9 December 1987 on the Migration Amendment Bill. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Rejection of clause 9 by the Committee will mean that the Government will have no legislative basis, let alone any moral basis for the $240 charge. It is a disgraceful and classic example of this Government's incompetence and maladministration that fees have been collected, as I understand it, since 1 October in anticipation of this legislation being passed. The Opposition assumes that the Government will refund these fees already collected, and collected not on any legal basis, and will certainly not collect any more. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Short emphasised that later, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Opposition assumes that the Government will refund the fees already collected since 1 October-fees that were obviously illegally collected . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I pay tribute to the interest Senator Short has taken in this matter over a period. He has continued to press the Government for the necessary rectification of the situation. I am delighted to hear the Minister say that the Government believes that all its programs should be lawful. The principle that Government programs should actually be lawful is a terrific one to put in place. I am delighted to have the Minister's assurance because, after all, the Ombudsman, in his report dated 17 March 1989, in his summary of conclusions and recommendations, said:</PARA>
<PARA> In summary, I have concluded that</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the Department's action in charging the IRP fee was contrary to law and based on a mistake of law;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the Department's actions in collecting the fee after 9 December 1987 were unreasonable;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) it would be unreasonable and oppressive for the Department to seek payment of its own legal costs from Ms D or from any party on her behalf; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the Department should be prepared to review initial decisions and this action should not await new legislation permitting the imposition of fees. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister has acted specifically on some of those recommendations. He has not acted on others and has indicated to the chamber this afternoon points of disagreement between himself and the Ombudsman in terms of interpretation. As I understand him-I was not able to take the details directly-it very much hinges on the question of whether the Department had knowingly proceeded on a certain course of action or whether, having taken that course of action, it did so on the basis that the matter was still open in its mind to some disputation one way or another. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not at this stage make any comment about the new campaign which is to be financed, a campaign against racism. We will be interested to have some further details on that, which the Minister undoubtedly will supply. In the course of the next couple of weeks we will undoubtedly have a very extensive debate on changes to the Migration Act which the Minister has introduced, so I will save my remarks about that campaign and the ongoing campaigns of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs until that stage, which I think would be a more proper way of going about things. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, I put on record our view that the 11,400 people who had this fee collected from them should all be entitled to a refund. It is our view that each and every one of them should automatically have been contacted by the Department. After all, the Department has plenty of written evidence as to who they are and where they reside, and proof that they have paid the $240. The $2.7m constitutes in this case a windfall to the Government to which it was not entitled. It has been taken out of the pockets of individuals in exactly the same way as the $5 arrival fee was taken out of various people's pockets and subsequently held to be invalid by the High Court of Australia. We have no idea whether the Government will simply pocket that money as well, or whether other people will get back any money. It is simply not good enough. </PARA>

If they all were as honest as he is, they would all have offered their resignations to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the course of the last couple of weeks. Nevertheless, we believe that as a matter of principle the fee should have been refunded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It will be extraordinarily difficult for the Department to establish who paid under protest and who did not because the people who paid the fee believed simply that they had no choice but to pay it. After all, a large number of these people would not be particularly competent in the English language. When a government officer tells them that they must pay a fee, they pay it because they are used to paying other fees for passports, other applications such as change of status applications and all the rest of it. They would have had no idea that there was a dispute as to the legality or otherwise of this fee and were therefore not in a position to be able to say, `The fee does not have a legislative basis'. There is even a dispute, and there was a dispute, between the Minister and the Ombudsman, between one Queen's Counsel, Mr Black, I think, who gave an opinion on one side, and another Queen's Counsel, Mr Sully, who gave an opinion on another side. There was disputation and disagreement between the Commonwealth Department and the Ombudsman. There was disputation and disagreement, as there always is, between Queen's Counsellors, depending, in part, on who happened to have briefed them and also depending on what their terms of reference were, which we do not know. How is it going to be established that ordinary citizens, particularly those who, as I say, might not have been particularly competent in English, should have known that they should have paid only under pressure? what is the application process for demonstrating that they did pay under protest; and are most people going to be able to find the records which demonstrate whether they paid before or after 12 December 1988, which I think is the cut-off date mentioned by the Minister in his statement? It seems to me that these are matters of considerable complexity. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the statement goes, we welcome the announcement of some refunds and the decision not to proceed with recovery of the costs which might have been proceeded against Miss D. We simply believe that, in Senator Short's words, the Government is clearly on notice-it has been on notice now for the best part of 18 months-over this matter. It is unfortunate that the Minister was simply not able to accept the Ombudsman's recommendations in toto, even if he disputed, and made a public statement that he disputed, the Ombudsman's reasoning or conclusions in law or the logic of the Ombudsman's report. Nevertheless, he accepted that the Ombudsman had made certain recommendations which should be acted upon. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad Senator Walsh is in the chamber because he undoubtedly will remember section 17 of the Ombudsman's Special Report No. 2 in the Industrial Sugar Mills case, involving the Department of Defence, in May 1986. On that occasion the Ombudsman recommended the refund of certain moneys as a result of what was bureaucratic incompetence by the Department of Defence. Senator Walsh refused to accept that recommendation. </PARA>

<PARA> The Committee recommends that the Minister for Finance reconsider his decision in the Industrial Sugar Mills case in the light of the further examination of this matter by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>The report was signed by Michael Tate, Chairman. If Senator Walsh wants to start slinging off about Senate committees, ombudsmen and all the rest of it, perhaps he would like to lean across the bench when Senator Tate is next in here-and Senator Tate's signature appears on the bottom of this report, which asks the Minister to take note of what the Commonwealth Ombudsman has said to him-and sort it out with him. He should do this before he comes in here screaming and yelling about whether refunds ought to be given, who is a bush lawyer and who is not and who is competent and who is not as far as the Ombudsman is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a pity that the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs could not accept the Ombudsman's recommendations. One will recall that just a few minutes ago the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs said he was pleased that the Ombudsman did not have to proceed further under the terms of the Ombudsman Act, because for the Ombudsman to proceed further would have required him to make a section 17 report to the Parliament. Then we would have to go through this whole business again, with Senator Walsh undoubtedly giving us the benefit of exactly what he thinks of this Commonwealth Ombudsman, in exactly the same fashion as he has told us in the past what he thought of a previous Commonwealth Ombudsman who had the hide to recommend that citizens who have been financially disadvantaged by the Commonwealth should actually get money back from Senator Walsh. The idea of Senator Walsh giving money back must be one of the most painful things he could possibly imagine. Undoubtedly he has some view about the $2.7m collected unlawfully from the 11,400 people to whom this matter refers and has told Senator Ray exactly how much he would have taken out of his hide if in fact that money had to be refunded.

I have been a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters since my election to Parliament in May 1987. All the amendments to the Bill come from recommendations of the Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I hope that they receive the bipartisan support of the Senate. The Committee's recommendations, as far as I am aware, were agreed to by all parties represented on that Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I deal with some matters in the Bill I would like to respond to some remarks made by Senator Puplick when he led for the Opposition in the debate on this Bill. I know that Senator Puplick is obsessed by the New South Wales Labor Party and its activities. I suspect this has much to do with the immense success over many years of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) in New South Wales compared with the lack of success of the Liberal Party in New South Wales other than in the recent State election. His remarks about the Liverpool preselection episode of the Labor Party as bearing some relevance to this Bill were strange indeed. If I recollect correctly, the only remarks he made that suggested that my new colleague Senator Faulkner and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, had been involved in some sort of rorting were to do with the ALP branch boundaries in the Liverpool electorate. Of course, these branch boundaries have nothing to do with electoral boundaries, subdivisional boundaries or electoral rolls. </PARA>
<PARA> For Senator Puplick to say that the New South Wales ALP is trying to rort the electoral system in this legislation because of the episode of the Liverpool preselection is a complete furphy. The dispute over the boundary between two branches in Liverpool has nothing to do with the legislation here. I am sure that even Senator Puplick would admit that, in the conclusion of the saga of the Liverpool preselection, the Labor Party endorsed an excellent candidate-in fact, such an excellent candidate that the Liberal Party was not game to nominate a candidate to stand against him in the by-election. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick could of course be a little sensitive on matters relating to the Liberal Party and the Labor Party in New South Wales and preselection. He has been through a very exhausting and, I suspect, emotionally debilitating preselection campaign with Senator Bronwyn Bishop from New South Wales from the Liberal Party for the next half Senate election. I can remember certainly, Senator Puplick's supporters making quite public their remarks about the unfair way in which Senator Bishop was conducting her campaign for preselection. There were suggestions of, I think, up to $20,000 being spent by Senator Bishop or her supporters organising cocktail parties, arranging for visits all over the State and so on. This was implied by Senator Puplick's supporters as being extremely unfair and a perversion of the Liberal Party preselection process. In view of the fact that Senator Puplick has been a victim of the New South Wales Liberal Party preselection process, he should address his remarks about preselection to the Liberal Party of New South Wales rather than casting stones at the ALP. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of Senator Puplick's remarks about multiple voting, the integrity of the rolls and so on, one cannot let pass the accusations that Senator Bishop made prior to the New South Wales election about 400 so-called dead people voting in the Castlereagh by-election in 1980. The Electoral Matters Committee received a submission from the Commonwealth Electoral Commission in October 1988 dealing with these accusations, and that has now been made public. I want to put before the Senate the findings of the Commission. I hope that at the end of my remarks Senator Bishop will have the good grace to apologise both to this chamber, where she made her accusations, and to the New South Wales electoral officials for her disgraceful attack. As I will point out to the Senate, the evidence is overwhelming that there was not a scintilla of evidence for her astounding accusations. Senator Bishop, as reported in the Hansard record for 17 March 1988, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The year 1980 saw the calling of the by-election for Castlereagh, a country seat which had been held by Premier Renshaw . . . In 1980, when that by-election was called upon the retirement of Mr Renshaw, 28,828 voters were enrolled. Of that number, 18,112 in fact voted. Those are most interesting figures. We can see that the margin by which the Labor Party won that seat was in the region of 660 votes. If one-half of those people had changed their vote, of course, there would have been a different result. </PARA>
<PARA>The Electoral Commission submission stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Bishop then quoted from a tape which she subsequently tabled of a speech allegedly made by one John Patrick Begg at Wyong Creek hall in 1984. This is what Mr Begg allegedly said:</PARA>
<PARA>I just sat down one day and I, you know, sort of got myself and I thought to myself-this is going to be close. Now, you know, I then went down-there's one office, the regional newspaper office, and Castlereagh started at Dubbo and went right through to Bourke-it was huge-big electorate-and I went down to the local thing and I went-it took me two days-and I went through twelve months and looked at the obituaries and I got everyone that died in the past 12 months and then I compared them to see if they were on the roll and there were 400 on the roll. So I sent little people out to vote for them on these blokes' behalfs and, do you realise, we won the seat by 330 votes. </PARA>
<PARA>The Electoral Commission went on:</PARA>
<PARA>The Electoral Commission is in no position to assess the authenticity of the tape or to suggest whether the apparent incoherence of Mr Begg in the extract resulted from difficulties in transcribing a poor tape or reflected on his condition at the time when the recording was made. What it can say, however, is that there are substantial flaws in the story, some of which have already been raised, such that it is astonishing that the Liberal Party submission endeavours to resurrect so discredited an anecdote, not the least in the same document in which it advocates a return to subdivisional voting. The NSW State electoral district of Castlereagh was that rare phenomenon, an electoral district in which the number of small subdivisions ought to have provided protection against the personation alleged to have taken place there in 1980. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission went on:</PARA>
<PARA>Each of the highlighted passages in Senator Bishop's statement will be considered in turn. Firstly, in 1980 when that by-election was called upon the retirement of Mr Renshaw, 28,828 voters were enrolled. Of that number, 18,112 in fact voted. That is the statement that Bronwyn Bishop made. The number enrolled at the by-election on 23 February 1980 was 21,828, not 28,828. The effect of misreporting the enrolment is to suggest that a poor turnout, 62.83 per cent, reflected a poor roll, whereas the actual turnout of 82.71 per cent which is shown on the return printed in the New South Wales parliamentary papers is unexceptional for a by-election. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Bishop asserted that the margin by which the Labor Party won that seat was in the region of 660 votes and that if half of those people had changed their vote there would, of course, have been a different result. The Commission commented:</PARA>
<PARA>The successful ALP candidate polled 9,327, the losing Country Party candidate 8,651. </PARA>
<PARA>So the difference between the two is 676 votes-indeed, in the region of 660. But the allegation is that 400 cemetery votes were cast, and these cannot be counted as changes transferred from one candidate to another as is the case, for example, with the miscounting of ballot papers. Even if 400 spurious votes cast in the names of 400 dead electors for the ALP candidate had been identified and disallowed, the successful candidate's vote would have fallen to 6,927 and he would still have won by a margin of 276. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Unless the supposition is that the 400 dead had not been voted by the Labor Party they would have been voted by the Country Party they can be counted only on one side of the equation, not both. Nevertheless in the face of the obvious arithmetic to the contrary the Liberal Party submits that paragraph 5 (iv) repeats the claim that Labor uses the names of 400 dead people to win the seat in a close election. </PARA>
<PARA>The Electoral Commission then looks at the submission in considerable detail in relation to the number of so-called obituaries in the local press in the electorate of Castlereagh. Mr Deputy President, I seek leave to incorporate the rest of that information in Hansard. </PARA>

I also draw the honourable senator's attention to a remark he made about cemetery voting and about the report tabled in the New South Wales Parliament yesterday. In the report of this in the Sydney Morning Herald today-I have not seen the full report, only the press report-it is stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The committee, which was chaired by Mr W. R. Cundy, a former State Electoral Commissioner, also found that:</PARA>
<PARA> The incidence of `cemetery votes' (votes cast in the names of dead people) was negligible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take your point, Senator Puplick, but I also believe that further confirms that the accusations made by Senator Bishop are without foundation. I quote further from the report in the Sydney Morning Herald:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although the committee did not find any `significant' instances of electoral fraud in New South Wales, it said there was potential for organised abuse of the electoral system. </PARA>
<PARA> ``Multiple voting has to be recognised for what it is,'' it said. ``It is electoral fraud . . . and every possible step must be taken to eliminate it.''</PARA>
<PARA>However, in looking at the press report-and I emphasise that I have not seen the full report-I find that it does not actually identify significant episodes of multiple voting. I look forward to reading the full report and coming back to this point in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I now wish to turn to some of the major points of the Bill itself. I think one of the most important reforms of this Bill deals with the area of hospital voting. I note that the Opposition has raised an amendment about allowing candidates some access to hospitals and prescribed institutions. Personally I think there may be some merit in that, but I would like to see the wording of that amendment and the regulations and arrangements under which it would operate. The particularly important reform in hospital voting is the proposal that as they go through the wards the staff from the Electoral Commission will have with them the how to vote cards from the registered parties. We have had this system in South Australia for State elections since 1976 and it has proved extremely beneficial to the voters. When they are in their beds or convalescing in institutions they may not have details of where they are enrolled, let alone who the candidates are. Once that is able to be determined they can be given a how to vote card on request to the officials, and that can assist them in casting a formal vote. That will improve on the present system, which relies on how to vote cards, if they are sent to the institution, being distributed by political parties. The staff of the institution are relied on to distribute the how to vote cards, which often leads to allegations that the staff are being politically biased in distributing how to vote cards for only one party or the other. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act also deals with the availability of electoral rolls to members of Parliament, both House of Representatives members and senators. There have been consistent complaints before the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and also amongst members of Parliament-who have raised the matter publicly-that the availability of electoral rolls has been limited. The Act now requires a set of electoral rolls to be provided once in every term of the Parliament. That is a very necessary resource to be provided to members of Parliament. Ancillary to that amendment is the preclusion of the use of the electronic rolls for commercial activity. This is to ensure-I hope no member of Parliament or any member of a political party would consider this-that the computer tapes of the electoral rolls are not sold to a commercial organisation, which obviously would be very beneficial to the commercial activities of direct mail companies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains a number of other amendments which will improve the procedures for the administration of the public disclosure and public funding provisions of the Act. That will further improve the Act. As time goes on we will get more experience of the effect of public disclosure and public funding and how to keep improving them. The Committee on Electoral Matters may make recommendations, in its report on the 1987 election, on further amendments to the Act to deal with public funding and public disclosure. I hope that we are able to deal with those recommendations before the end of this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Puplick mentioned an amendment to the Bill that the Opposition will move to change the provisions of the Federal Act regarding how redistributions are conducted. I have been able to have only a cursory glance at the amendment, but it seeks to direct the Electoral Commission to take account of the percentage votes cast for each major party at each election between redistributions. This is to be taken into account when boundaries are drawn up at the next redistribution. Senator Puplick said that in the last Federal election the combined first preference vote of the Liberal and National parties was more than the first preference vote of the Labor Party. That is indisputable, and I do not deny it. However, what Senator Puplick did not mention was that at the last Federal election the two-party preferred vote for the Labor Party approached 51 per cent. For the combined Liberal and National parties the two-party preferred vote was just over 49 per cent. The two-party preferred vote is the effective vote that should be measured-not the first preference vote before the allocation of preferences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Puplick should also take account of the various rules and measures that are used to determine whether boundaries are fair. I believe that the fairest system of judging whether boundaries are fair and reflect the will of the people is the use of the so-called cube rule. On the cube rule, on the two-party preferred vote, the Labor Party deserved to win the election. We may not have deserved to win it by the majority we did, on the cube rule, but we won with an increased majority because of the excellent campaign Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen waged in Queensland on behalf of his Party, which destroyed the coalition's chances in that  State. It meant that we won a number of seats--</PARA>

<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> 70. As it happens, there is no regional newspaper covering the area which then constituted the electoral district of Castlereagh. One of the problems which the then Australian Electoral Office's divisional staff responsible for the 2 divisional rolls which overlapped Castlereagh was that there was no regional paper which could be relied on for death notices (which would have been the source of information rather than obituaries). The names of the subdivisions of Castlereagh-Baradine, Bourke, Cobar, Coonabarabran, Coonamble, Gilgandra, Nyngan and Warren-indicate its scatter of settlements. However if there were to be any newspapers which might be called ``the regional newspaper'' of Castlereagh the only choices could be the (Dubbo) Daily Liberal and the (Tamworth) Northern Daily Leader. </PARA>
<PARA> I went through twelve months and looked at the obituaries and I got everyone that died in the past 12 months and then I compared them to see if they were on the roll and there were 400 on the roll. </PARA>
<PARA> 71. The 2 newspapers have been searched for 1979, the ``twelve months'' prior to the by-election. The Liberal for the whole year contained in total 182 death notices of which 141 were for addresses in Dubbo itself; only 11 gave addresses within Castlereagh, and at least one of those was of an infant. The Northern Daily Leader for 1979 contained 437 death notices of which 173 were for Tamworth itself, many others for nearby towns like Werris Creek (12) and Mailla (10), and only 1 for an address in Castlereagh. A further 73 bore no address for the deceased but is probable that most of these would have been for Tamworth and its vicinity in the light of the distribution of those carrying addresses. It would not have been possible to find the names of 400 dead electors of Castlereagh in either of the newspapers in question or any more than a handful of dead electors of Castlereagh in the pair of them. </PARA>
<PARA> 72. But then neither would there have been 400 dead electors available to be found on the roll unless there had been an extraordinary lapse in roll maintenance activities, which is presumably the gravamen of the complaint against the Electoral Commission or, in this instance, its predecessor the Australian Electoral Office. The most stable component of roll transactions, year after year and whichever Government is in office or administrators responsible for the keeping of the rolls, is death deletions. The authoritative input comes from the State Registrars of Deaths, and supplementary information is collected from death notices in local newspapers. Every month a typical division loses 50, 60 or 70 electors by death deletions. Occasionally batch processing may leave 1 month light and the next heavy but the likelihood that a Division (or the one-third of it contained in a particular State electoral district) could neglect death deletions for a calendar year is totally implausible. </PARA>
<PARA> 73. In 1980 (30/11/79 to 9/12/80) for example, the Division of Gwydir which contained all the subdivisions comprising Castlereagh save one recorded 657 death deletions; the Castlereagh subdivisions accounted for 212 (32.3%) of these just as they accounted for 26.2% of the Division's enrolment at the beginning of the period and 25.8% of its enrolment at the end. The remaining subdivision, Coonabarabran, accounted for 31 of the Division of Paterson's 677 death deletions of the year, some 4.6% when it had 5.1% of Paterson's enrolment at the beginning of the year and 5.0% at its end. </PARA>
<PARA> 74. Death deletions statistics by subdivision for 1979 have not been preserved so far as can be ascertained, and only the Divisional figures can be given. As Gwydir accounts for almost the entire State electoral district of Castlereagh its figures are more significant than Paterson's but both are shown in table 5 to document the basic stability of the operation. With barely one-third of a Division's population, Castlereagh should have had no more than 2-25 deaths per month and accordingly would have taken 16-20 months to accumulate 400. </PARA>

<PARA> 75. In the 12 months for which the death notices supposedly accumulated, death deletions were being recorded at their normal rate. Data from earlier years could be supplied, if this were thought necessary, but as the basis for the story of supposed abuses is the events of 1979 earlier statistics would only go to confirm the regular working of the system laid down in the Commonwealth Electoral Act in these Divisions and throughout the country. Should it still be thought necessary in the light of the evidence already supplied, the Electoral Commission could arrange for the (retired) Divisional Returning Officer for Gwydir to testify as to his regular compliance with the statutory provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> 76. Thus the story fails in 2 vital particulars. That many relevant names could not have been found in a newspaper that might conceivably meet the specification of ``the regional newspaper'', and there would not have been that many names of deceased persons on the roll for the by-election. That is not to say that there could not have been 1 or 2, or even half a dozen, electors of Castlereagh who died too close to the close-of-roll to be removed, or after it. That possibility is a matter which the Commission has raised with the Joint Standing Committee in regard to more recent elections. But 400 or a figure anything like it is impossible. </PARA>
<PARA> I sent little people out to vote for them on these blokes' behalfs</PARA>
<PARA> 77. If these votes had been cast as ordinary votes, then personation (and mainly of elderly electors for it is the elderly who are more likely to die) had to be extraordinarily risky. At the by-election only 7 polling places took more than 1,000 votes: Bourke 1,364; Cobar 1,785; Coonabarabran 1,809; Coonamble 1,839; Gilgandra 1,775; Nyngan 1,525; and Warren 1,410. The likelihood that someone could pass themselves off as a deceased elector at a booth of this size in the country is remote. The overwhelming number of booths took fewer than 500 votes. As the then Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon. Senator Robert Ray, said in the Senate (18 March 1988):</PARA>
<PARA> It is fairly inconceivable to me that, in a small country electorate with small booths, bodgie votes could be lodged. Nearly all the officials are locals. They know whether Mrs Smith or Mr Jones has passed away in the last couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA> 78. Senator Michael Baume interjected at that point: ``What was the absentee vote?'' Of course in a by-election the opportunities for casting an absentee vote are reduced compared to a general election and more use is made of postal voting facilities, but for what they are worth the figures for the 2 previous general elections and the 1980 by-election are given in Table 6. Only half the ``usual'' number of absentee ballots were cast, again unexceptional for a by-election. </PARA>

<PARA> 79. To the extent that the allegation was that a defective roll, bearing the names of 400 electors who had died in 1979, was supplied to the State, it is a federal matter as the Liberal Party submission says. To the extent that the administration of the State electoral legislation might have allowed 400 acts of personation, it is a State matter. </PARA>
<PARA> 80. On 22 March 1988 the then Minister for Home Affairs, Senator Ray, wrote to the Premier of New South Wales, the Hon. Nick Greiner, indicating his concern that the matter be investigated thoroughly, pointing out that breaches of State law were alleged, and offering the cooperation of the Electoral Commission in any investigations. On 31 March 1988 the Premier replied:</PARA>
<PARA> The new Government will shortly be instigating a review of the State Electoral Office. In the course of this review the specific allegations you refer to will be covered in addition to the general status of electoral rolls.</PARA>
<PARA> Your offer of assistance and co-operation is appreciated and I will ask the relevant officers to contact the Australian Electoral Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> 81. On 11 April 1988 the Minister for Home Affairs wrote again to the Premier, saying in part:</PARA>
<PARA> Because the allegations about the Castlereagh by-election made by Senator Bronwyn Bishop in the Senate on 17th March raised not only questions of administrative procedure but also breaches of the Electoral Act, I am not sure that a general review would be the most appropriate means of addressing the allegations. I would respectfully suggest that a more appropriate course would be reference, via the State Electoral Office, to the New South Wales police. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage, I have not referred the allegations to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, or to any other Commonwealth authority, as I believe it is a matter which the New South Wales Government has a more substantial interest in due to the possibility of State Electoral Act breaches. I would therefore appreciate an indication that a New South Wales investigation of possible breaches of New South Wales law will be initiated, to which a Commonwealth investigation could then be supplementary. </PARA>
<PARA> 82. It is the Electoral Commission's understanding that no reply to that letter has been received. The Commission itself has not been contacted by the State Electoral Commission concerning any inquiry into the matter which it might be conducting. One of the most helpful pieces of evidence to resolve the accuracy of the allegations, the certified list used at the by-election which could then be matched with deaths notified in 1979, is not available as these lists are not normally preserved after elections or by-elections, being treated as election documents subject to destruction once the time for challenging results is past. </PARA>

<PARA> In addition, the Department of the Treasury has advised it provided two grants of $15,000 each to AFCO to support its involvement in the price watch activities of the National Prices Network. The grants were paid in June 1987 and June 1988. Prior to renewal of the grant in 1988, an interim report on expenditure to the end of May 1988 was provided by AFCO. A final audited report on expenditure for the year ended 30 June 1988 was provided by AFCO in August 1988.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) During Mr Shevardnaze's visit to Japan in December 1988, the Japanese Government made it clear that there would be no fundamental improvement in relations, including trade and investment, without a political solution to the issue of the occupied territories. The Northern Territories dispute is a significant impediment to improved Japan USSR relations and meetings with Mr Takeshita and Mr Uno showed little sign of resolving the issue.</PARA>
<PARA> The USSR is currently undertaking considerable economic restructuring and is also revising joint venture laws to encourage investment in Eastern Siberia. This process may generate opportunities for several countries to invest in USSR resource projects. A number of Japanese consortia have negotiated with the Soviet Union on joint ventures including for primary industries. Similarly, Australian companies are looking at the feasibility of joint ventures with the USSR. At this stage, these joint ventures are regarded by Western companies as a means of supplying the Soviet domestic market rather than as export oriented projects. These developments are unlikely to have any significant impact on Australia's relatively small minerals exports to the USSR.</PARA>
<PARA> On the specific commodities raised by the honourable senator:</PARA>
<PARA>Coal</PARA>
<PARA> The USSR is the world's third largest coal producer after China and the USA and most production is used in the domestic economy with just over 30Mtpa available for exports. About 50% of USSR coal exports to Western countries are made under an agreement with Japanese companies for the development of the South Yakutsky coking coal project. Under this agreement, the USSR is to supply 84.4 Mt to Japan between 1983 and 1998 with 5.5 Mt yearly for 1985 through to 1998. The agreement was concluded in 1974 as part of Japan's strategy to diversify its sources of supply. Investments by Japan were made in Australia and Canada also at that time.</PARA>
<PARA> Exports of USSR coal to Japan have not been viewed as a serious threat to Australian exports. The USSR's market share for coking coal to Japan has increased from 5% in the Japanese financial year (JFY-April to April) 1985 to around 8% in JFY 1987 and JFY 1988, the increase reflecting Japan's investment in the South Yakutsky coal project coming on stream. USSR market share for thermal coal decreased from 4.8% in JFY 1985 to 4.1% in JFY 1987 but increased again to 6.7% in JFY 1988 due to tight supply in Australia and China.</PARA>
<PARA> By comparison, Australia's market share for coking coal has remained fairly constant at 42.8% for JFY 1985 and JFY 1986, increasing to 43.9% for JFY 1987 and dropping to 41.1% for JFY 1988. Our market share for thermal coal has been increasing, from 64.6% for JFY 1985 to 70% for JFY 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> It is unlikely that Australia's market share in Japan will be affected by further Japanese development of coal in the USSR if the current relative market prices between the various suppliers are maintained. USSR coal exports are currently not cost-competitive with Australian exports due to large transport distances and difficult climatic conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>Liquid natural gas and oils</PARA>
<PARA> Japan is about to become our first major customer for LNG from the NW Shelf with exports, after a build up period, of 6 million tonnes per year. Japan is bound to purchase LNG from Australia under a long term contract of 19 years. As an efficient supplier of resources, Australia is well-placed to deal with continued international competition.</PARA>
<PARA> A USSR-Japan joint venture was formed in 1974 with the aim of exporting LNG from Sakhalin. This project has had a difficult history and, despite considerable Japanese investment, has not moved beyond feasibility studies. If the Sakhalin gas project proceeded at some future time, it would be in competition with a large number of other possible projects, including expansion of the NW Shelf and development of other Australian natural gas fields.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia is not a competitor with USSR for oil exports.</PARA>
<PARA>Non-fuel minerals</PARA>
<PARA> The Soviet Far East region is reportedly highly prospective for a wide range of non-fuel minerals. The USSR is currently encouraging foreign investment in the minerals and metals prospects in the region, primarily for domestic consumption but possibly also for export to third countries.</PARA>
<PARA> Japan is currently one of the Soviet Far East's main foreign trading partners, and is potentially a major investor in the region, including in possible minerals and metals projects. Australia is also interested in the region's development, and Australian resource companies are examining joint venture opportunities in the region.</PARA>
<PARA> The development of the USSR's non-fuel minerals industry in the Soviet Far East is not expected to have a significant impact on Australia's mineral exports in the foreseeable future. Production for the USSR's domestic market is not likely to displace any existing or potential imports from Australia, and I expect that Australian industry will be well placed to compete with any USSR exports to third markets, including Japan.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) Did: (a) Mr Arnaudon draft a letter for Mr Punch to send to the Prime Minister, in which Mr Punch was to say, `I intend to quickly move to call a public tender for the acquisition of the Government's mining infrastructure on Christmas Island'; (b) if so, on what date was it drafted; (c) does it bear Mr Arnaudon's annotation of 21 April 1988, which says, `Mr Blunn, draft for discussion please'; and, if so, (d) what were Mr Blunn's comments on it.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Did: (a) a subsequent Departmental minute to the Minister, entitled `Christmas Island: Next Steps', bearing the annotation `overtaken by subsequent submission', propose 2 options to progress assessment of successor phosphate operations, either by open competitive tender or the use of the liquidator of the Government's Phosphate Mining Corporation; and (b) its author claim Mr Blunn had seen and agreed to this minute in draft form; if so, what was: (i) the date of this minute, (ii) the date of Mr Blunn's input, (iii) Mr Blunn's input, (iv) the reason this minute was not sent, (v) the date of the minute which overtook it, (vi) the name of the person who decided not to send it immediately, (vii) the significance of the annotation, ``Mr Arnaudon, AB 20/5'' at the top of the first page, and (viii) the origin and circumstances of the suggestion to use the liquidator as assessor.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Did a questions brief prepared for Mr Punch on 26 April 1988 say: (a) the Government had the option of using either open tender or the liquidator to assess successor phosphate operations; and (b) that, following advice from the Department, Mr Punch would discuss this with the Opposition spokesman.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Did it arise from a meeting involving Mr Arnaudon the liquidator, and representatives of the Australian Government Solicitor's Office and Department of Administrative Services on 26 April 1988 that a formal process for assessing proposals that could withstand public scrutiny might be able to be developed using the liquidator; if so: (a) who first suggested this; (b) suggested this at the meeting; and (c) invited the liquidator to this meeting.</PARA>

<PARA> (7) Did: (a) Mr Arnaudon send a minute, through Mr Blunn, to Mr Punch on 11 May 1988, to formalise the use of the liquidator as the `assessor'; (b) did the minute state that, while there were some legal complexities involved with using the liquidator in this role, these need not hold up the commencement of the assessment process; and (c) Mr Punch approve this minute on 13 May 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Did the Attorney-General's Department write to Mr Blunn on 12 May 1988 advising that the liquidator is concerned only with the winding up of the Government's Phosphate Mining Corporation and is not concerned with other matters such as the commercial viability of mining proposals and that, as advised orally on 10 May 1988, while there was no obstacle to the assessment of proposals being referred to the liquidator in order to determine which one would provide the highest return on the Corporation's assets, the liquidator was not able to undertake a broad ranging assessment with a view to establishing their viability; if so (a) was this letter received by facsimile transmission on 12 May 1988; (b) when did Mr Blunn and Mr Arnaudon see it; (c) was Mr Punch advised of its contents; if so, when; if not, why not; (d) was it forwarded to Mr Punch's office; if so, when; if not, why not; and (e) was it forwarded to the liquidator; if not, why not.</PARA>

<PARA> (4) (a) Yes; (b) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) No. The issue first arose at a meeting between DAS and DASETT officers on 22 April 1988 convened to discuss options for a formal process of evaluation.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) (a) Yes; (b) Yes; (c) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) (a) Yes; (b) No. The legal complexities referred to were a review of the Winding Up Ordinance and the Lands Ordinance and consideration of any other legislation that may be necessary in order to permit private mining on Christmas Island and the sale of the Government's mining infrastructure; (c) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The relevant sections of the advice received in a memorandum dated 12 May 1988 from the Attorney-General's Department addressed to the Secretary, Attention: Mr Arnaudon, are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(c) The Liquidator of the Corporation is concerned only with the winding up of the Corporation. He is not concerned with other matters such as the commercial viability of mining proposals, or the future of the Territory except in so far as those matters may impact upon the winding up of the Corporation.'', and</PARA>
<PARA> ``The Liquidator should not, therefore, be concerned with such matters as the economic or social development of the Territory, nor with the commercial viability of proposals for mining in the Territory, except in so far as such matters may affect the capacity of a potential purchaser to pay the Liquidator under proposed arrangements for the sale of the Corporation's assets, or otherwise affect the winding up of the Corporation. Accordingly, as advised by Mr Coe in a telephone discussion on 10 May 1988, there is no obstacle to the proposals for private mining received by the Commonwealth being referred to the Liquidator for assessment in the terms of the Ordinance: that is, in order that the Liquidator may determine which proposal would provide the highest return on the Corporation's assets. However, unless there are circumstances of which I am not aware that relate the long term commercial viability of the mining proposals to the winding up, the Liquidator is not able to undertake a broad ranging assessment of the proposals on behalf of the Commonwealth with a view to establishing whether they are so viable.''</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Yes; (b) Mr Arnaudon-12 May 1988, Mr Blunn-soon thereafter; (c) Yes; 13 May 1988; (d) Yes; 13 May 1988; (e) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) No. Mr Punch wrote to the Liquidator on 13 May 1988 and asked him to consider the possibility of selling the property of the Corporation to a party or parties who intend to recommence phosphate extraction from Christmas Island on a commercial basis. Mr Punch also asked the liquidator to give appropriate consideration to his 11 February media release and also drew his attention to the Western Australian Trades and Labor Council policy about preference for employment. This was consistent with the advice received from A-G's on 12 May 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) (a) and (b) The Liquidator recommended that proposal which would best maximise returns to the Commonwealth through both net payment and royalties, but was not concerned with such matters as the economic or social development of the Territory, nor with the commercial viability of proposals for mining in the Territory, except in terms of Mr Punch's request to the liquidator with respect to consideration of various matters, and in so far as such matters may have affected the capacity of a potential purchaser to pay the Liquidator under proposed arrangements for the sale of the Corporation's assets.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issues raised by the honourable senator relate primarily to functions for which I have direct portfolio responsibility. The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The claim that Government red tape is holding up the approval of the Cocos floating hotel project is incorrect. Consideration of the proposal cannot proceed until my Department receives a response to its letter of 15 December last year to the proponent, Cocos Island Resorts.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) On 30 October 1987, Cocos Islands Resorts was asked to provide initial information on the proposal to enable a preliminary evaluation of its possible environmental effects. A notice of intention was provided by the proponent on 26 April 1988. The processes then involved consultation with other appropriate Commonwealth agencies and the Cocos Community. Following evaluation of all the information, my Department came to the conclusion that, in accordance with the Administrative Procedures under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, it should recommend to me that the preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) on the proposal should be required. My Department wrote to the proponent on 15 December 1988 advising him of this conclusion and bringing to his attention several matters which it believed he should consider before it formally recommended that I direct an EIS. As indicated earlier, action on the matter now depends on the proponent's response to my Department's letter.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Government is aware that the proponent has indicated that the proposed floating hotel will be developed elsewhere if approval is not forthcoming by June and without an EIS being first required. The Government is committed to the development of alternative industries on Cocos. It believes tourism offers the best prospects for the economic future of the Territory. However, it does not believe projects of this magnitude should proceed before proper examination of environmental matters including social impacts has occurred.</PARA>
<PARA> (5)</PARA>
<PARA> Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> No.</PARA>
<PARA> Each proposal coming within the scope of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act is examined on its merits. Being land-based, the Direction Island proposal raises different environmental issues from those raised by a floating hotel. The proponent of the Cocos floating hotel was briefed in detail some time ago by Departmental officers on the requirements of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. An EIS was required for each of the floating hotel proposals for which Commonwealth approval has been sought to date, ie the John Brewer Reef project off Townsville and the Fitzroy Reef project off Gladstone.</PARA>
