<PARA> We are concerned about the increase in violent television programmes for children and particularly those programmes promoting violent toys that are available for sale in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you support the Broadcasting (Prohibition of Violent Programmes for Children) Act 1988 which has been presented by Western Australia Independent Senator for Nuclear Disarmament, Jo Vallentine. This act aims to prohibit the broadcasting of children's TV programmes that are violent and that promote toys modelled on characters, weapons or other war accessories which are also available for sale in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Senate assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate that the Government is about to introduce into the Senate, legislation changing health insurance. These changes will increase the cost of health insurance to members of employee based funds and will do nothing to help the elderly, as is being claimed. Big public funds will increase their surpluses by taking money from more efficient funds. People will be forced back onto Medicare, which will not help to maintain private health insurance.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce to the 19 per cent decline in automotive exports in 1988 as reported in the recent report of the Automotive Industry Authority on the state of the industry and also to the slowdown evident in growth of exports of manufactured goods generally since the June quarter last year. I also refer the Minister to the results of the Confederation of Australian Industry-Westpac survey of industrial trends for the March quarter of 1989 which reported a fall in export deliveries to their lowest level in three years. Is he concerned about this apparent stagnation in exports of manufactured goods and to what does he attribute the slowdown?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2042" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I recall the figures, the increase in manufacturing exports reached its height in 1987 and there was some decline in 1988 which is reflected in the figures to which Senator Chaney refers. There are a variety of reasons for that decline in performance in the increase in the rate of exports-which is what the decline is. It is a decline, as I recall it, from about a 30 per cent increase in the rate of exports in 1986-87 to some 8 per cent last year. For some industries the value of the dollar during 1988 affected their export performance. For other industries, particularly small firms, we have found as a matter of experience that they seem to have a capacity to increase their exports to the $3m to $5m level. This fact has turned up in the review of the export market development grants scheme being conducted by Professor Hughes. When they reach that level they run out of capacity to increase their exports further. That is why current investment levels are very much welcomed by this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question is more specifically directed towards the motor vehicle industry. In the second half of 1988, there was an unanticipated surge in domestic demand which led the industry to being quite unable to satisfy the domestic market and a considerable amount of resources was diverted into satisfying domestic demand rather than into export activity. I consider that not to be a long term decline and one which will be rectified within the next six months or so.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Has the Government received indications that the opposition of vested interests to key aspects of its micro-economic reform program, in particular the deregulation of wheat marketing, is jeopardising public support for these reform initiatives?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not believe there are any significant indications that vested interests are having an effect in generating public opposition to the Government's micro-economic reform agenda.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McKiernan, I am not going to compromise my National Party source by naming who leaked this letter to me. The letter states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In your deliberations this morning please take into consideration my sincere conviction that a change in leadership now would have catastrophic short term consequences.</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of the incidence of chronic criticism of Ian Sinclair amongst our financial members and particularly where the influence of agro-politics are felt.</PARA>
<PARA> Our public opinion surveys contradict the suggestion that this is indicative of his standing in the wider community and certainly does not identify our leadership as an impediment to an election success.</PARA>
<PARA> There can be no doubt a change in leadership in our Party at this time will give Labor their long awaited window-of-opportunity to go to the people on the basis of the disunity of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party's suicidal tendencies are no excuse for us to abandon traditions and values that have sustained this Party throughout its history.</PARA>
<PARA>It is signed by Douglas Moppett, State Chairman of the National Party of Australia. I table the letter, Mr President. It seems that not everybody-in the extra-parliamentary National Party anyway-was calm and collected as its new leader would have us believe. But I do believe, however, that even though there is no meaningful resistance to the Government's reform program in this area that Mr Sinclair's role in supporting or expediting a coalition policy in support of the Government policy was certainly the issue which brought him down in the National Party. I think it is a great pity that the best thing that Mr Sinclair has ever done in Parliament-indeed some people will probably go beyond that and say that it is the only good thing he has ever done in his 25 years in Parliament-brought him down as Leader of the National Party.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. I refer the Minister to the report last week of the Automotive Industry Authority and his own assessment that if he had been doing an examination and had presented his parents with such a report they would have been less than satisfied. In view of that comment, and the more critical appraisal of the independent commentators about the progress of his motor vehicle plan, I ask him: What are the factors which would give him any confidence that the 1992 report will be more satisfactory from the point of view of Australians who are paying relatively more now for their cars than when the Button plan started? What action, if any, is the Government planning to try to get the car plan back on track?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the difficulties about the car plan is that it has never been understood in the Opposition. Over the years I have had a series of questions about it, some suggesting that it is too interventionist and some, by implication, suggesting that it is not interventionist enough. The car plan is providing a framework for structural adjustment of the motor vehicle industry which it never had before under a series of Liberal governments. When a crisis emerged a firm went bad, sacked a few thousand workers, and off they went. Firm after firm disappeared from this country, having had a go at the market. It was a totally unstructured industry. That has not happened in the years of the car plan.</PARA></TALK.START>

We are not about intervening in the internal affairs of firms and telling them what people they should employ, what technology they should employ, what quality standards they should achieve and those sorts of things. Under the car plan those issues are left to the market. The market increasingly becomes more open as tariffs come down in the context of the car plan.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lewis understands what I am talking about, including my recent invitation to him. The two issues about which I expressed concern were the prices of motor vehicles and the question of quality. I must say that governments cannot make firms adopt quality standards which we would all like. That is the business of firms in the marketplace. We can exhort firms to do better. We can try to improve labour relations and structural adjustment within the work force. We can try to improve the conditions under which people work. We can try to reduce labour turnover. The Government is doing that in terms of labour market programs which I hope will yield results.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of prices let me say that the report which Senator Lewis referred to drew attention to the fact that for the fourth successive quarter the rate of price increase for both locally produced and imported passenger motor vehicles has been below the consumer price index, that is, four quarters of an improving trend. Certainly car prices are higher than they were when the car plan was introduced. The major reason for that is the devaluation of the Australian dollar. Firms embarked on some practices which from the national point of view I would not approve of in terms of following imported prices up. But the trend is now in the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lewis asked me what confidence do I have that we will not get the same sort of report in 1992. It is a measure of the integrity of the car plan that it is an authority appointed under the car plan that has been the most stringent critic of the industry in respect of these matters and has been quite frank in its assessment of what has taken place.</PARA>
<PARA> In so far as confidence in the 1992 report is concerned, all I can say is what I have said from the beginning of the car plan. If the industry does not get these issues right they will not be here in 1992 under this Government because we will not shift from what we have said about the car plan.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. The proposed legislation to deregulate the domestic wheat market has met with some opposition, not only amongst growers but also amongst politicians. Some have argued against deregulation on the grounds of its deleterious effect on organic growers of wheat. Can the Minister tell us the effect of the proposed legislation on organic growers of wheat?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2045" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="RESOURCES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of comments have been made about wheat deregulation on the basis of protecting the interests of organic wheat growers. In the main, the people making those comments have been the Australian Democrats. I think it is right to record that the wheat deregulation proposals that the Government will bring before this chamber shortly will advantage organic wheat growers. The present arrangements inhibit the growers of organic wheat and, indeed, impose on them a surcharge that they could well do without and do not need in the present circumstances. There is a very small amount of organic wheat grown in Australia-according to the Wheat Board, about 1,000 tonnes of it is harvested annually-but there is a strong indication that there is a black market in organic wheat, which indicates, so to speak, that growers vote with their sheaves by taking their wheat and selling it directly on the black market in the most unregulated way possible. I do not condone the black market proceedings-of course, I want to see these growers operate through the Australian Wheat Board while those arrangements remain. Nonetheless, the fact that a large number of them do work a black market is indicative of the fact that they perceive that their best interests lie in that direction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the moment the problem is that normal grain storage and transport usually involves spraying the grain with insecticides to protect it. Organic wheat growers do not store their grain; under a special provision of the Wheat Board, they sell directly to the millers. Nonetheless, they have to transact their arrangements through the Australian Wheat Board and have those arrangements sanctioned by the Board, which imposes costs on them for that purpose. They sell direct; they arrange their transport and their storage directly as well. Those services that the Australian Wheat Board provides-in their particular case, they are non-services-cost about $10 per tonne in 1987-88, and in some States bulk handling charges are about $5 a tonne. From those points of view there is actually self-interest in growers of organic wheat supporting the amendments, and not taking the view that some Democrat critics put forward-that the amendments are proposed in some funny way and that, somehow or other, they act against the interests of organic wheat growers. That is not the case.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is put in the context of Vice-President Quayle's timely warning to the Australian Government that protectionism is still immensely appealing to members of the United States Congress. Given the past tendency of the United States Administration and Congress to seek bilateral deals with countries such as Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, with which the United States is running a bilateral trade deficit, and given the dangers that this poses for Australia's own access to these important and growing Asian Pacific markets, what specific and additional steps does the Government intend to take to ensure that the reciprocal provisions of the United States Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act do not displace Australia's exports to those countries? Second, given the Minister's commitment last week to raise with the Prime Minister my suggestion of an all-party delegation to the United States to discuss trade issues, does the Minister agree that the use by the United States of section 301 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act is a further important issue that should be raised with the Administration and Congress?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First, on the subject of section 301-that is, the bilateral trade remedy provision which is designed to remove so-called unjustifiable or unreasonable foreign trade practices which are identified as such and targeted by the US-a recent report, the US annual national trade estimates report, derived some publicity when it was released a couple of weeks ago. It contains some criticism of Australia's tariff rates as being allegedly too high by a reference to the standards applied for the application of that particular provision. However, it is our belief that not only does Australia not deserve to be targeted under the provisions of the trade Bill to which Senator Macklin referred, but it is unlikely to be so targeted. Certainly, it has not been identified as a priority country because of the pervasiveness of its unfair trade practices, which is the description the US has given to countries like Japan, Korea, India, Brazil and Taiwan. I do not genuinely believe that there is much prospect of this weaponry being deployed against Australia. Of course, if that is to be guaranteed, it will take a continued and persistent lobbying effort by Australia in the United States of the kind we have been visibly engaged in now for a long period, in the context not only of these provisions, but also of export enhancement program provisions and other dimensions of the US farm and trade legislation with which we are concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is not much I can add at this stage to what I said last week in response to Senator Macklin on the subject of how that can best be done. I have certainly given consideration, as I said I would, to the question of the possible parliamentary delegation to target the congressional leadership, or congressional players, on this issue. Obviously, further opportunities will be taken with high-level visits to the United States coming up later in the year to pursue the issue with the administration. Equally, in the context of the Uruguay Round on multilateral trade negotiations, we will take every available opportunity both to defend our own trading practices and to seek to remove barriers elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA> That leads me to note, in the context of Australia's trade policy and our very active commitment to multilateral trade liberalisation, that I doubt very much if any similarly coherent approach could be expected under the new leadership of the Liberal Party. Mr Peacock's first substantive foray into policy issues this morning occurred in the context of his press conference when he embarked upon an analysis of the deficiencies in our present trade policy. I paraphrase when I say that he said we need to take a broader perspective to see Australia playing an objective role in the region:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to be taking beyond the mere talk of OECD type Secretariat for interchange of views. I would be looking for a trading arrangement as such in circumstances where Britain enters into the whole European, united Europe, if you like, United States/Europe after 1992 to misuse the term; where the Soviet Union herself is freeing up, where the Peoples Republic of China has ten years of that, and where the North American free trade arrangement has taken place. Trade is the lifeblood of this country and arrangements in the region have to be pursued with far greater vigour than they have.</PARA>
<PARA>That is totally incoherent, totally half-baked, or both. I am inclined to focus in particular on the half-baked dimensions in so far as what is clearly implied, from my reading of that tortured prose, is a commitment by Mr Peacock to a regional trading bloc arrangement to counter what he appears to be identifying as the problems of Europe post-1992 and North America. One thing is absolutely clear, not only to the rest of the world but also to the region and to any economic commentator who even begins to understand these issues: it is that not only is a regional trading bloc not a credible proposition, because of its incapacity ever to be delivered, given the diversity of the economies within this region and the incapability accordingly of drawing a ring around them in the way that one can credibly with Europe or North America; it is also a proposition that is manifestly at odds with Australia's interest as a trading nation in getting multilateral trade liberalisation applying around the world. If this is a signal of what is to come from the new leadership of the Liberal Party and if it is an example of the total incoherence of the approach of the new leadership to any important policy issue that this country has to confront-and I am sure it is-we on this side of the Parliament can rest easily, reinforced in the confidence that we have always had that we will be here for a very long time indeed.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In no way does the Government begrudge those costs. Every time we change a Minister, similar costs occur. There will be a variety of costs to be met by the Department of Administrative Services. The first cost will be incurred in simply moving offices. For instance, the former Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, will have to be moved from the eighth or ninth floor in Phillip Street to the top floor or he may, of course, choose to move back to his electorate-in which case the cost would be much higher. Obviously, we will have to upgrade the Melbourne office of the new Leader of the Opposition, Mr Peacock, to the status that the Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia would require. The former Leader of the National Party of Australia, Mr Sinclair, will have to move out of his Phillip Street office. He may choose to move upstairs or back to Tamworth where, in 1984, after 21 years, he finally established an electorate office. In any event, moving the new Leader of the National Party, Mr Blunt, into his office will not cost much. However, it may be difficult to get the key and the car park pass back. Apart from that, no great costs will be involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The biggest costs will probably be in termination payments. I do not think anyone treats this subject with much humour. Some 18 staff were attached to former leader Howard, each of whom is entitled to termination expenses. As well, as a former Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard will be entitled to an assistant private secretary. That will be no bother for the Government because the then former Leader of the Opposition and now Leader of the Opposition had that entitlement and will forfeit it. In actual fact, we will break even on those costs. We never recognised Mr Sinclair as a leader, in spite of six years of intense lobbying by him to get all of the rights to which he thought he was entitled. In 1975 he managed to deprive the Labor Party of those rights. Over all of those years he applied for those extra entitlements but we refused his requests, so the cost of his termination is nowhere near as expensive as it would have been had we been soft during those years. We now have the strange situation of not having a Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Representatives-yet.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very well. In those circumstances I would think that Mr Blunt is probably entitled to what the new Leader of the Opposition had before he replaced the former Leader of the Opposition today, and should be entitled to pick up what we denied Mr Sinclair. I have noted that Senator Chaney has always been a frugal Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, so his costs will not increase. We all know him, and there is no way he will double-dip his entitlement as Opposition Leader in the Senate and Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party. So there will be no increased costs there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The final cost concerns letterheads. Unfortunately, with a change of leadership we have to change a variety of letterheads. We will definitely be keeping Mr Howard's letterhead. We will not make the same mistake twice. He might be back in a few weeks, a few months or following the next election. Unfortunately we did not keep the letterhead for Mr Peacock. In a statement made immediately after the election of Mr Howard Mr Peacock, when asked, `Would you have not abandoned your ambitions?', said:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, I haven't. Maybe a decade or so hence.</PARA>
<PARA> . . . may take me another twenty years mightn't it. But the important point is that John Howard has to know that he can go to the next election and maybe beyond with the full support of his Parliamentary team.</PARA>
<PARA>Four pages later Senator Chaney endorsed that principle but, unfortunately, the late arrival of Senator Austin Lewis cut off the rest of his words for posterity. I would love to know what they were to be. Unfortunately, we have missed the boat with Mr Peacock's letterhead. We will not be required to supply very much more equipment as a result of today's events. However, I suggest that we send a polygraph to Mr Peacock's office so that when Senator Chaney goes there and professes his loyalty to the leadership he can at least be tested on the matter. One has to acknowledge that the costs involved in these matters are just part of political life. We will not be seeking additional appropriations. It would also be churlish not to congratulate Senator Chaney on his promotion to Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party but I remind him of the immortal words of Sir Winston Churchill that it does not take much courage to rat, but it takes a lot of courage to re-rat.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator STONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I may bring the Senate back to serious matters, I address my question to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I preface it by referring to the mounting concern among Australians about the sharply rising level of our foreign debt and also the growing concern about the large and rising level of foreign ownership of Australian assets including, but not only, land. I ask the Minister: Firstly, is it a fact that both these developments result from the need to finance the continuing massive deficits on the balance of payments which, for six years now, Australia has incurred under this Government's policies? Secondly, is it also a fact that the magnitude of our foreign debt and indeed the Australian dollar cost of paying interest on it will be increased even further by any fall which there may be in the value of the Australian dollar? Lastly, what is the Government doing even to halt, let alone reverse, the growth in the level of our debts to foreigners and/or the process whereby Australian land and other assets are continuing to fall into the hands of foreigners, or does the Government simply not care?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unlike Senator Stone, I regard leadership changes in the Opposition as quite serious matters. I do not think they are frivolous at all, although I suppose anybody who has been watching the attempt by the Opposition to turn such matters into a comedy over the last few years could be forgiven for believing so. The foreign debt, by definition, is the accumulated current account deficits, net of any current account surplus-and they have not happened too often in Australia's history. Off the top of my head I can think of only one year when we had a current account surplus, but there may have been others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Stone knows very well, and as anybody else who bothers to listen to what I say in Question Time or other public fora will know, I certainly regard the current account deficit as a serious matter. Senator Stone, however, seeks to put all the blame clearly on the present Government. The root causes of it, as Senator Stone knows very well, go back at least several decades to when the structural inefficiency of the Australian economy was being concreted by John McEwen and Senator Stone's other National Party predecessors with, of course, the supine acceptance of the majority Liberal Party in coalition governments of the day.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1982-83, the then Government managed to run up a current account deficit in excess of 4 per cent of gross domestic product in the middle of the deepest depression that we had seen for 50 years. It is clearly correct also that the current account deficit in this year will also be greater than 4 per cent of gross domestic product-and it is the proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) which is the more valid measure of a debt problem over a period of time, of course, than the absolute amount of the debt. The 4 per cent plus of GDP which this year's current account deficit will equal is incurred at a time of the biggest investment boom that we have ever recorded, and, while that is not the only factor, it is very clearly the major factor in increasing the current account deficit of the Budget forecast levels. It is relatively easy to incur a fairly big current account deficit when one is having an investment boom-the biggest investment boom on record, I believe-but it is pretty difficult to incur a current account deficit of that size when one is having the biggest recession for 50 years. But that is what the previous Government managed to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA> In regard to foreign ownership of land, I am surprised that Senator Stone has moved so far from, I would say, his intellectual integrity and rigour of his Treasury days. That statement does not mean that I have often agreed with a lot of the conclusions that he reached, because he was very dogmatic and had a very certain view of the world. But I am amazed and disappointed that he has moved so far from his attitude of rigour as Secretary to the Treasury towards the cheap populism of the National Party of Australia that he now represents.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I ask the Minister whether he will not agree that his initial response to my question was in error when he said that the level of net foreign debt represented the accumulation of balance of payments deficits and that, presumably, what he meant to say was that the net level of foreign debt plus the net level of foreign ownership represented the accumulation of balance of payments deficits. Having got that point established-and I hope the Minister will agree with the correction-could we also get it clear whether the Minister agrees that, if he is in fact comparing the policies of the present Government with those of its predecessor, we are looking at a situation in which foreign debt has risen from something like $22 billion when this Government took office to $95 billion at the end of last December? I am talking in net terms, of course. If he wants to have those figures in terms of percentages of GDP, to which I think he also referred, will he also agree that the figures also represent a rise from something like 10 per cent of GDP to something more than 30 per cent of GDP? Finally, will the Minister respond to the final part of my question, which was: What is the Government doing to stop the headlong growth in both the rate of our foreign debt and the rate of growth of foreign ownership of Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to get engaged in pedantry about jargon, but I think Senator Stone quoted me as allegedly having said that the foreign debt, by definition, was the accumulated balance of payments deficits. But I do not think I said that. I may have done. If I said `balance of payments deficits' I was certainly wrong, because, the balance of payments, as one of the honourable senator's former deputy secretaries once pointed out to Senator Messner at a Senate Estimates committee hearing, is always, by definition, in balance. If I did say `balance of payments' I should have said `the accumulated current account deficits'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that Senator Stone then went on to refer to accumulated balance of payments deficits, or current account deficits-I am not sure which one it was that he used-plus foreign ownership. That is not counted in foreign debt. Equity in Australia owned by foreigners is not counted as part of our foreign debt. The honourable senator knows that very well. But Senator Stone did point, of course, to another important variable which has emerged in the last few years, and that is that the amount of equity investment in other countries undertaken by Australians and Australian companies has grown enormously. I have forgotten the precise figures but particularly around 1986-87 there was a huge increase in the ownership of foreign assets by Australians. Had that not taken place one would have expected the current account deficit, and therefore what is recorded as Australia's debt, to have reduced commensurately. Having said all that, I do not pretend, and I never have pretended, that I do not see our foreign debt and our continuing current account deficit as very serious problems.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I got most of that. The first part of the question that I took down concerns what I understood to be an allegation that Harris-Daishowa is utilising unauthorised timber for woodchipping purposes. The export licences issued by the Commonwealth Government designate from what areas the woodchipper can extract timber for the purposes of woodchipping and for export. I do not think Harris-Daishowa is selling to a domestic market. That does not require export approval. That is the only possible area in which that company could be utilising timber from unauthorised areas. I do not think there is a domestic market to which it sells. If there is, it is very small. It would amount to nothing much at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not know of the allegation that Senator Dunn has made. I would require more information about that allegation before I could answer the question categorically. However, if the question refers to the residue left over from saw logging operations in the area of the south-east forests-the area of contention; Senator Dunn has asked several questions on this subject in the past-all that residue is being quarantined on the premises of Harris-Daishowa subject to finalisation of an agreement between the New South Wales Government and the Commonwealth Government on the areas of the National Estate and of the south-east forests which should be free of logging operations. More on that later. If the question refers to that, then that timber is not being utilised; it is being quarantined.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Dunn has asked for information about logging between 1982 and 1989, which coupes and how much was taken. We can give her that information. I cannot give the honourable senator that information now. If I could, it would take a lot longer than the rest of Question Time to give it.</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the honourable senator's other questions, one of which concerned areas in the south-east forest which are not on the interim list. I think it is probably worth taking a second just to make this point: the areas for potential future cutting approved by the Commonwealth are subject to an environmental impact statement (EIS), first of all. That environmental impact statement was carried out by the New South Wales Forestry Commission, and we have it before us. We are constrained not to move beyond the areas that have been subject to an environmental impact statement. For obvious environmental reasons we would need to make an environmental assessment before we decided to do that. The decision of the New South Wales Land and Environment Court in the Jurasius case prevents any cutting in areas that have not been subject to an EIS in the past.</PARA>
<PARA> I will refer quickly to the honourable senator's questions, if I can recall them. She asks whether I have requested information from my Department or the Forestry Commission of New South Wales. Yes, I have. She asks whether I am aware of my statutory obligation to find prudent and feasible alternatives. Yes, I am. The reason why I have requested that information is to be properly informed in order to make a responsible judgment on prudent and feasible alternatives so that when I have my next meeting with the New South Wales Minister for Natural Resources, Ian Causley, I am able to have the information base to assert the consideration of the prudent and feasible alternatives. The final comment I should add is that I hoped to have had a meeting with the Minister for Natural Resources in New South Wales before now. I hope that he is looking at his diary and I am looking at mine to find a date next week on which we can have that meeting and finally settle this matter.</PARA>

It was, of course, correct. We were not prepared to pay the sorts of environmental prices that Senator Puplick and his former leader, Mr Howard, were prepared to pay. We have some respect for Bass Strait. The first question referred to the difference between a kraft mill and a thermo-mechanical pulping mill and whether I am aware of it. Yes, I am aware of the difference and I am sure that the Government is aware of the difference as well. The second question referred to whether we were aware of the fact that a kraft mill which uses no chlorine bleach is still environmentally hazardous. Yes, I am aware of that too. I try to keep up a little bit with these processes. We have a team of Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) scientists, departmental officials and representatives from industry which is now looking at pulp mill processes in Scandinavia. The team will probably go on to Canada as well. We want it to look at the most environmentally acceptable processes so that we can develop the toughest standards and guidelines in the world.

Can the Minister tell the Senate who represented Australia at the recent conference in Helsinki, Finland, where, as reported in the Australian on 4 May, 80 countries pledged support for a proposal to eliminate chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by the year 2000? What position did Australia put at Helsinki in regard to Norway's proposal for industrialised nations to contribute 0.1 per cent of their gross national product (GNP) to a fund for assisting Third World countries to meet the CFC phase-out target? Given Australia's ozone protection legislation which falls far short of phasing out CFCs by the year 2000, will Australia be participating in a second conference planned for London next year and, if so, what positions will Australia be taking with regard, firstly, to the elimination of CFCs and, secondly, to assistance to the Third World countries in achieving this aim? Finally, in view of the urgency of the situation, as reflected at Helsinki, does the Government intend to revise the Ozone Protection Bill to bring it into line with international commitments to phase out the production and use of CFCs by the year 2000?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the reason Senator Richardson gave this question the flick is that it is such a boring answer which I am now obliged to respond with. Australia was represented at a meeting in Helsinki from 2 to 5 May of parties to the Montreal Protocol on the protection of the ozone layer. The Australian delegation comprised Mr J. A. Whitelaw, Assistant Secretary of the Environmental Quality Branch of the Department of Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, and Mr Patrick Cole, First Secretary of the Australian Embassy in Stockholm.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Early in the proceedings Norway proposed to commit 0.1 per cent of its GNP per year toward an international climate fund to provide incentives for developing countries to meet the strength and requirements of the Montreal Protocol. That is, of course, an extraordinary large commitment, and I note that, in the case of Australia, this sort of percentage would be just under one-third of our total annual overseas development assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> No other delegation made specific monetary commitments, and a number underlined the desirability of, first, closely examining, and perhaps strengthening, existing mechanisms for providing financial and technical assistance to developing countries. Australia intervened in the debate to indicate that we supported the principle of assisting developing countries in this area. We believed that assistance should stress the development of appropriate new technologies, and we prefer an open-ended review of the suitability of existing mechanisms for channelling the resources involved to relevant countries.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia will be represented at the second conference on the ozone layer, which will be held in London in 1990. It is too early to say what Australia's position on the elimination of CFCs will be at that meeting. As Senator Vallentine acknowledged, this matter does lie principally within the portfolio of Senator Richardson, but I understand that a working group of the Australian Environment Council is examining the potential phase-out dates for a range of CFCs which, I am advised, are expected to go significantly further than the requirements of the Montreal protocol and of existing Australian legislation.</PARA>

<PARA>SIR, According to Mr Don Cameron MHR, (AFR Letters, January 26), the Household Expenditure Survey being conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics is a ``new proposal'' which should have been tabled in Parliament prior to its commencement. Mr Cameron noted that the Commonwealth Ombudsman was investigating whether the ABS misled the Attorney-General's Department when seeking legal advice.</PARA>
<PARA> The Ombudsman has now reported that the ABS did not mislead anyone and was not wrong to implement the survey without tabling it. He also considers that ``the HES is not oppressive or unreasonably intrusive, bearing in mind the public interest in collection of the information and the protections for privacy''.</PARA>
<PARA> In another letter, Senator Patterson (AFR Letters, February 8), claimed that the ABS had ``failed to produce any convincing arguments as to the validity of compulsorily obtained information as against that offered voluntarily''. She said that extensive searches of the social science literature had shown no support for the ABS argument that the HES needed to be compulsory for valid data to be obtained.</PARA>
<PARA> In his report, the Ombudsman states that he is ``satisfied that there is a reasonable case for providing power to compel provision of information for an HES''. The ABS approach, which has been very successful, is to seek the willing co-operation of selected householders.</PARA>
<PARA> In the Ombudsman's view, HES results have very substantial value to the community. First results of the present survey should be released in September.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen reports of the Bill, which do not go as far as Senator Messner contends-that the Bill would bring in a regime of blanket price control in Victoria. The Federal Government's approach to prices has been very much one of freeing up the marketplace to ensure that competition has a very healthy and strong effect in terms of reduction of prices. In our aims to achieve that, we have recognised that in particular States at particular times there has been a need for further intervention. In fact, it is recognised that a number of States in Australia have an interventionist approach to prices. For our part, we have worked on a Federal level to coordinate the Government's approach in Australia to ensure, first, that each government knows what the other is doing and, secondly, that there can be an overall coordination of direction of pricing policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To that effect, together with the Prices Surveillance Authority, I have had a number of discussions over the last 12 months with State officials in order to ensure greater coordination of prices policy. It should also be recognised that not only is Victoria moving to intervene in terms of the pricing structures of some particular commodities and other services, but also the Opposition in Tasmania has for some time now been advocating a similar approach. It is one which, from all reports I have seen from Tasmania, has received a great degree of support from sectors of the community in that State. Fran Bladel, the shadow spokesperson in Tasmania, has been pursuing very strongly a policy which allows for some State government control in essential areas.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has been trying to coordinate its approach, which has been to rely much more on the competitive forces in the marketplace, to ensure that prices reach an acceptable level. However, we also have in place the Prices Surveillance Authority, an institution which has a role to play in ensuring that, when prices are increased, those increases are based on the premise of what can be generally classified as justifiable price increases. That authority has a very healthy role to play in terms of keeping a check on prices.</PARA>

The first is an answer to a question by Senator Bjelke-Petersen about what action the Government was taking to ensure that Australian servicemen who were posted overseas were receiving proper Australian social security payments. Amendments made to the Social Security Act on 22 December 1988 will prevent payment of the family allowance from 18 May 1989 to service personnel who are absent from Australia for a continuous period of three years. The legislation applies not only to service personnel, but to the total Australian community. The Public Eye newspaper acknowledged its error in stating that six months was the limit before payment of benefits ceased. Its retraction on 30 March 1989 gave the correct period of three years. Overseas postings for members of the Australian Defence Force rarely exceed three years in duration. However, the Department of Defence, in conjunction with other departments with staff overseas, is currently addressing means to ensure that such staff are not disadvantaged.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Boswell has asked a number of questions concerning phosphate mining operations in Christmas Island. I have examined the issues raised by Senator Boswell and can assure honourable senators that none of the statements I have made are inaccurate in so far as they go. When discussing the Elders Resources Ltd royalty payment during last Friday's debate on the Arts, Territories and Environment Legislation Amendment Bill and in referring to a comparison of percentages I included, on the advice of my Department, the $1 per tonne to be used for rehabilitation, which gave a $2.70 per tonne total royalty for the Elders offer. I am informed by my Department that this is the figure as it now stands as a result of the further negotiations envisaged in the liquidator's recommendations to the then Minister. It is not relevant, however, in the context of the liquidator's assessment and should not have been used in commenting on the original proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also quoted from the liquidator's report the fact that the Booth proposal offered slightly higher royalty payments. I have since spoken to the liquidator and to departmental officers. The liquidator has taken me through the calculations on which he based his finding that Mr Booth offered a slightly higher royalty payment. I understand how he says he reached that conclusion. I also said on Friday that the liquidator noted in his conclusions that the Elders proposal maximises the return to the Commonwealth both through net payments for assets and for royalties. In making that statement I was referring to the overall assessment made by the liquidator. I went on to refer to the slight difference in favour of the Booth proposal, and quoted from the liquidator's report.</PARA>
<PARA> The liquidator concluded that Elders was superior both to Century Metals and Mining and Booth in respect of financial resources, production and technical expertise, mainland support bases, research and development, and quality of submission. In effect he concluded that Elders was a major Australian public resources company and it had the expertise and back-up to deliver on its tender. That conclusion was consistent with the advice of the Attorney-General's Department as to the liquidator's responsibilities. In short, the liquidator identified those factors as being sufficient to offset what, in his opinion, was a slight difference in royalty payments. On this basis the then Minister had no reason not to accept the recommendations of the liquidator and I see no reason to change the current course of action as it has maximised the opportunity for the Commonwealth to obtain the greatest available return.</PARA>
<PARA> In his question on 3 May, Senator Boswell asked whether I was aware that, at current market prices, the Booth proposal could result in the Government's obtaining approximately 30 per cent more in royalties than in Elders' best case and at least 200 per cent more than in Elders' worst case. I must say that I am not really aware of the basis for these figures, but I am aware that the figures provided by Mr Booth in his proposal produced a result only slightly higher than the Elders proposal. I can say that the liquidator has informed me that the figure was closer to 3 per cent than 30 per cent on the basis of the information before him when he did his assessment. However, in an attempt to settle the differences in understanding, I have arranged for Mr Booth to meet my colleague the Minister for the Arts and Territories, the liquidator and departmental officers to discuss the matter in full. Until these discussions are completed, no contracts or leases with Elders will be finalised. I will inform the Senate of the outcome of the discussions and bring anything of substance to the attention of the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the answer. </PARA>
<PARA>I thank the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, for his explanation, but I believe that he has misled the Senate by asserting that the assessor of the Christmas Island mining proposal, Mr Yeomans, recommended a proposal which maximised financial returns to the Commonwealth. This misleading by the senior territories Minister occurred in answer to a recent question on notice, and was compounded by his answer to a question without notice last Wednesday, during the debate in the Senate on Friday, and in answer to a question without notice yesterday. I have continually warned the Minister to watch where he is going, but Mr Yeomans's assessment itself acknowledged that a Perth consortium headed by a Mr J. G. Booth was offering the same net payment and a slightly higher royalty payment than Elders Resources Ltd, the company that he recommended. The Elders proposal was a flat $1.70 per tonne royalty, whereas the Booth consortium offer was a 5 per cent rate based on selling price per tonne shipped. I repeat that at current market prices the Booth proposal could result in the Government obtaining approximately 30 per cent more in royalties than for Elders' best case, and at least 100 per cent more than for Elders' worst case.</PARA>
<PARA> On Friday Senator Richardson asserted that Elders' proposal maximised returns to the Commonwealth because it also offered rehabilitation to the value of $1 per product tonne shipped, and that this offset Booth's superiority on royalties. However, Mr Yeomans's assessment did not conclusively compare proposals on the basis of rehabilitation. Furthermore, it acknowledged that he made no expert assessment on the likely cost of rehabilitation. More importantly, the Booth proposal assumed an open-ended responsibility to rehabilitate all mined areas as an integral part of the extraction process where Elders' offer was limited to the value of $1 per product tonne. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson also asserted that Mr Yeomans acted in accordance with the Attorney-General's advice, that he would assess proposals on the basis of the best return to the Commonwealth-Senator Richardson has just admitted that that was not the case-and that he would not be concerned with the viability except in so far as it may effect the potential purchaser's capacity to pay. There was no question of the Booth consortium's capacity to pay. As Mr Yeomans's assessment acknowledged, members of the Booth consortium were experienced in mining and, viewed collectively, companies of substance. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that this is an extremely serious case of misleading the Parliament. While I certainly acknowledge that Senator Richardson has never deliberately meant to mislead Parliament, I believe that his Department has not informed him properly. The bureaucracy has long been aware of the contentious issues in this matter and I believe has not explained the whole basis of those issues to the Minister. I believe the Minister's Department has snowed him in some areas. To this extent Senator Richardson has been guilty of not exercising sufficient control over his portfolio and his junior Minister, despite my repeated warnings. This matter which I have exposed has obvious implications for the validity of the assessment of Christmas Island's future. Senator Richardson must apologise to the Senate, look at his Department heads and consult with the Opposition in conducting some form of reassessment. </PARA>

But, having said that, because I could not get from the liquidator an answer on the big differences which Senator Boswell claimed-which are very different to the small differences that the liquidator claims exist-I took the action of putting on hold the finalisation of any contract with Elders, with whom the Government has been negotiating for some time. I suggested-and it is now being arranged-that Mr Booth meet with Mr Holding, the Minister responsible, the liquidator and departmental officers to discuss the matter.

There were some minor problems, as could be expected when undertaking only the first submarine docking and the second warship docking at this new shiplift. These were also the first ever dockings of major RAN warships to be conducted in Australia using a shiplift. The third part of the question was: Were there difficulties getting the submarine onto the lift, necessitating three attempts instead of one? There were no difficulties getting the submarine into the lift. Two attempts were needed to sue-that is, to make first contact between keel and keel blocks-the submarine in the correct position both longitudinally and laterally. This is not unusual and results from slight movement of the ship or submarine at the moment of first contact under the influences of wind and waves. After docking a problem with the configuration of the docking cradle was observed and it was decided to reposition elements of the cradle necessitating redocking for the intermediate docking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fourth question was: Did the submarine move or slip on its blocks when it was out of the water, thereby causing hull damage? The answer is that the submarine did not move or slip in its blocks. Some minor denting of the external tanks, that is, not involving the pressure hull or watertight integrity, occurred due to discrepancies in the positioning of some bilge blocks on the shiplift platform. The submarine was undocked, the blocks repositioned and the submarine redocked before proceeding with the intermediate docking.</PARA>
<PARA> The fifth question was: Were periscopes and other masts damaged by foreign objects and needing repair because customary protection was not afforded them. The answer is that the periscope and one mast were affected by dust and grit blasting operations because the Navy had not taken normal precautions. Subsequently at HMAS Stirling Navy removed the periscope and mast for cleaning particulate contamination from lubricating greaseways. No mechanical damage had been done. The sixth question was: Who paid, the contractor or the taxpayer? The answer is that the cost of the ballast tank repairs was borne by the contractor. The task and the cost of cleaning the periscope and mast were carried out by Navy.</PARA>
<PARA> The seventh question asked was: Have Navy personnel been prohibited from discussing this matter? The answer to that is no. The ballast tank damage took the form of deformation of light plating. The damage was minor and the submarine could have operated without it being repaired. The slight chop on the water which made sueing difficult tends to develop in the evenings. Plans are being developed by the Western Australian Government to build a breakwater to protect the shiplift and wet berth from this sort of weather, starting in a few weeks and ending before HMAS Swan is due to undock at the end of her refit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The last question to which I wish to respond was from Senator Sanders, concerning jarosite dumping in Tasmania. In terms of jarosite dumping and sea dumping permits that exist, the Tasmanian Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia Ltd (EZ) holds a special permit to dump jarosite waste at sea some 60 nautical miles south-south-east of Hobart in over 2,000 metres or water. The permit is issued annually in accordance with the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act and following the requirements and guidelines of the international Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter-the London dumping convention. The dumping operation is governed by close specifications and monitoring requirements. It is the best monitored such operation in Australian waters and one of the tightest monitored in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Operations and monitoring results are reviewed annually by departmental officers, specialists of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and other experts. Dumping and monitoring have been carried out at the same site for 15 years. During this time no environmental detriment of any sort has been detected. Greenpeace is fully informed of the operation and is provided by EZ with copies of monitoring results. The highest international standards are imposed upon the operation and it is maintained under continued close surveillance by my Department.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, the Minister claimed in a very long and rambling answer, amongst other things, that I said, `Actually, what we need to do is sack half the lieutenant-colonels' and `Perhaps we should sack all the civilian advisers in the Department of Defence'. This is arrant nonsense. I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that the Minister has made these allegations before. On 8 March I responded as follows in the Senate:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In Question Time in the other place today, the Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, claimed that I had stated that I would sack half the lieutenant-colonels in the Army. It is Mr Beazley himself who has already sacked half the Army. He has cut back the Defence Force to the overworked force it is today. I would certainly sack both defence Ministers for gross dereliction of duty and I would take an axe to reduce the size of the Canberra defence bureaucracy. I have no intention of sacking half the lieutenant-colonels in the Army, despite the Minister's claims, and I have never claimed that I would do so. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister also claimed yesterday that I had made an attack on the integrity of the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Funnell. He also claimed that the Chief of Air Staff had been subjected to personal abuse. The truth of the situation, and the basis for the Minister's allegations, are as set out in the press release which I issued on 4 May. I will read it to the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> The recent effort by the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Funnell to enter the debate on the personnel problems of the Air Force will have a disastrous impact on the morale of his Force, the Shadow Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Senator Jocelyn Newman, (LIB, Tas.), said today. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Newman drew attention to the comments made in the Parliamentary Report into Personnel Wastage in which a serviceman is quoted in the Cross Report as saying that his peer group felt strongly that the current service chiefs are, `non-confrontationist, too easily influenced by politicians, have not ``stuck up'' for servicemen enough, are more interested in their own careers and vested interests than the ADF and do not have enough influence within the Defence decision making cycle.' The Committee said, `that general opinion was reflected in many submissions.'</PARA>
<PARA> It is very clear to me as I visit Defence establishments that servicemen are feeling that there is a tendency amongst some senior officers to try to defend the Government record instead of publicly acknowledging that there are problems which need to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> This extends also to acknowledging the implications of the personnel losses. </PARA>
<PARA> The Services have had a tradition that loyalty goes in two directions. The loyalty servicemen and women give to their superiors is expected to be returned. </PARA>
<PARA> By dismissing the detailed findings of the RAAF manning report, Air Marshal Funnell is in danger of showing his people that he is prepared to `sweep problems under the carpet' by claiming that the Opposition has given distorted information on the situation in the RAAF. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite apart from serious problems finding sufficient pilots to fill all the jobs which have traditionally been filled by pilots, new arrangements have had to be made to allow other officers to fill these positions. </PARA>
<PARA> Servicemen are well aware that inexperienced pilots are now being asked to do jobs they would never have been asked to do in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would prefer to read it, although it is a longer than usual press release, because I was particularly careful to choose my words so that Air Marshal Funnell was not subjected to personal abuse in this delicate matter so far as morale is concerned. The press release continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Only recently at the opening of Tindal RAAF Base the Squadron Commander, Wing Commander Fox pointed out that although he had 12 Hornets, he only had 8 pilots. Of these only two had experience levels which were satisfactory to him as a Commander and that it would take a long time to bring the other pilots to that level of experience. </PARA>
<PARA>Senior officers are also extremely concerned at the low experience levels of flying instructors who are going to training units at a very much earlier stage than they would have done in the past, and that this must impact in the future on those being trained. </PARA>
<PARA>The emphasis must not be allowed to continue simply on the shortfall in pilots. </PARA>
<PARA>The losses that the Forces have sustained throughout all specialist musterings are very serious. </PARA>
<PARA>Senior officers constantly tell me of their worries about maintaining experience levels amongst maintenance staff and I am always advised of the extremely long hours being worked by these people in order to keep the RAAF in the air. This was also referred to in the RAAF Manning Report which Air Marshal Funnell has dismissed as `distorted'. </PARA>
<PARA>As at the 30th June last year the Air Force admitted to a shortfall of: 14.4% in Signals Operators, 14.2% in Communications Electronics Systems Technologists, 14% in Telecommunications Technologists, 32.5% in Airborne Electronic Analysts, 13.3% in Flight Engineers, 16.6% in Air Photography Plotters and 17.8% in Air Surveillance Operators. </PARA>
<PARA>I am currently advised that the medical officers are now down below strength by approximately 20% and due to the heavy reliance by the RAAF on women (12%) there are shortfalls occurring in a number of areas where women are on maternity leave and the Forces are prevented from posting people into those positions by Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA>One Base has recently closed down three Messes because of a shortage of Cooks and Stewards. As RAAF recruits are now 45% women, this situation will only become worse. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that any thinking person would have to feel not only concern for the RAAF's ability to defend Australia but also for the RAAF's ability to continue the high safety standards for which it has been famed, if these low experience levels are allowed to continue. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not suggested by the Opposition that the men and women of the RAAF are not well educated and highly trained. The Opposition does believe however that the RAAF has been neglected, as is the Army and Navy and that the vital role which they fill is not appreciated by the Federal Government and that morale has suffered as a result. </PARA>
<PARA>It will not help that deteriorating morale if the most senior officer in the Air Force denies the serious nature of the problem and its safety and strategic implications. </PARA>
<PARA>Air Marshal Funnell should take care that by entering this debate he doesn't succeed in deflecting the heat which should remain on the Federal Government for its failure to give the ADF the moral and financial support which it so desperately needs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Capital Territory has an admirable public transport system, which is actually a rarity in this late twentieth century. In many cities of the earth the public transport system has been allowed to wither away and die and they have become choked with automobiles. Certainly this is the case in my native home of Los Angeles where it is impossible to move. Los Angeles has a situation called `gridlock'. Cars are proliferating at such a rate that it is difficult to move from intersection to intersection. Canberra still has a very fine rapid transit system which will serve us in good stead. As our fossil fuel resources run out people will be forced to come back to public transport. However, there are some difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a general enthusiasm from Canberra residents for the transport system. The drivers are courteous, especially to tourists. Prices are generally moderate, especially discount pre-paid tickets. I point out here that when I was a member of the House of Assembly in Tasmania a former traffic manager for the local metropolitan transport trust came to me with the proposition that it would actually be cheaper to run the buses free; in other words, collect no fares rather than collect them. He made a very good case; that when one collects fares one has to have a whole fare-collecting mechanism. It is also dangerous to the drivers because of the amounts of cash they carry. I will not continue along that line but I point out that there is still an argument for the free bus system. Anyway, the prices are relatively moderate in the Australian Capital Territory transport system. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that might be an improvement to the system is annual pre-paid tickets as well as the monthly pre-paid tickets which are now available. The routes are logical in the Australian Capital Territory but there is a difficulty in that all routes go through Civic, through the radial system. One proposal I might offer would be a perimeter system linking the townships. Perhaps a light rail service, as suggested by many candidates in the Assembly campaign, may be another proposal. Another proposal might be a rationalised ticketing service so that one ticket equals one journey. At present a new ticket is needed for each change of a bus at the Civic interchange. Another proposal is more frequent servicing of large diesel buses. This would ensure that they do not pollute the atmosphere with the black diesel smoke which is such a menace in the downtown centre of Canberra at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The after-hours services of the bus system are few and far between. This is not unusual for bus services around the world but as we profess to have one of the better bus services in the world it would be good if the services, especially to the outlying communities, could be more frequent. The situation is getting so bad that a teacher at Hall, which is at the northern tip of Canberra, gets a $1.61 daily allowance for driving her car because she works in an `isolated' establishment. Hall is not all that far out of town but the buses are irregular and the last bus leaves Hall at 3.05 p.m. She is, therefore, forced to use a car. </PARA>
<PARA> The unfortunate fact is that the Australian Capital Territory, like other communities, is becoming more and more besotted with the automobile. We have the bus system and we also have an area which is admirably suitable for bicycles. I suppose that human beings being what they are, it will take an increase in the price of petrol and the price of automobiles and servicing to force them to do what they should do and that is use our rapid transit systems. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will amend various taxation acts to give effect to matters announced on 12 April by the Treasurer in his economic statement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will declare the general rates of income tax payable by individuals and trustees generally for the 1989-90 and subsequent financial years. </PARA>
<PARA> It will also declare the rate of fringe benefits tax to apply from 1 April 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Other measures to be implemented by this Bill will increase the maximum levels of the rebates of tax available to taxpayers who support certain dependants and allow those rebates to be indexed annually. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also allow instalments payable under the quarterly provisional tax system to be reduced to take account of the reduction in tax rates. </PARA>
<PARA>PERSONAL TAX RATES</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the personal income tax rate measures contained in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The reform of the rate scales will be in two stages. </PARA>
<PARA> With effect from 1 July 1989 a five-step scale will apply and this will reduce to a four-step scale from 1 January 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> There is to be no change in the tax-free threshold of $5,100. </PARA>
<PARA> From 1 July 1989 the existing 24 per cent rate will be reduced to 21 per cent and will apply to income over $5,100 and up to a new threshold level of $17,650. </PARA>
<PARA> The 29 per cent rate will continue to apply, but in the altered income range $17,651 to $20,600. </PARA>
<PARA>The existing 40 per cent rate will be reduced to 39 per cent and apply to income from $20,601 to $35,000. For income over $35,000 and up to $50,000 the rate of 49 per cent will be reduced to 47 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, for income over $50,000 the 49 per cent rate will be reduced to 47 per cent from 1 January 1990. To give effect to this decision a composite rate of 48 per cent will apply to that income on assessment for the 1989-90 year of income. </PARA>
<PARA> These tax cuts will be reflected in lower pay-as-you-earn deductions from 1 July 1989 and, in the case of income over $50,000, from 1 January 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes to the rate scale will also affect non-residents with the rate of 29 per cent applying on income up to $20,600 and above that amount reduced rates will apply as for residents. </PARA>
<PARA> Other rates to be reduced include the rate on unearned income of minors which will be 48 per cent for 1989-90 and 47 per cent for all subsequent years, subject to shading-in arrangements for income just over $416. </PARA>
<PARA> Also the rate of tax on trustees assessed under section 99a of the Income Tax Assessment Act will be 48 per cent for 1989-90 and 47 per cent in subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost to revenue of the personal tax cuts and the increases I will outline shortly to dependant rebates is $4,900m in 1989-90 and $5,700m in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA>FRINGE BENEFITS TAX RATE</PARA>
<PARA> The rate of fringe benefits tax will be reduced to 47 per cent for the year of tax commencing on 1 April 1990 and subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost to revenue is estimated at $55m in 1990-91 and $60m in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA>DEPENDANT REBATES</PARA>
<PARA> Increased levels of concessional rebates for dependants are being made available for 1989-90 and subsequent income years. </PARA>
<PARA> As announced by the Treasurer, the dependant spouse rebate will be increased to $1,000, and to $1,200 where there is a dependant child or student. </PARA>
<PARA> Similar increases will apply to the rebates for a daughter-housekeeper or a housekeeper. </PARA>
<PARA> The level of the sole parent rebate is being increased to $940 and the levels of the concessional rebates for an invalid relative, a parent or a parent-in-law are also being increased. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be a flow-on of these increases to the zone rebates of tax for people in isolated areas. </PARA>
<PARA>INDEXATION OF CONCESSIONAL REBATES</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Bill will give effect to the announcement that from 1990-91 the concessional rebates referred to earlier will be indexed annually on the basis of movements in the all groups Consumer Price Index. </PARA>
<PARA>QUARTERLY PROVISIONAL TAX</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will permit the Commissioner of Taxation to reduce to an appropriate level the amount of a quarterly provisional tax instalment otherwise payable in circumstances such as these where tax cuts have been announced. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>WHEAT MARKETING BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to introduce new marketing arrangements for the wheat industry and thereby establish a sound future for one of Australia's most important export earners. </PARA>
<PARA> In a speech to the Annual Conference of the Grains Council of Australia last year, I invited the industry to take the opportunity of the need for a new Wheat Marketing Act and the Report of the Royal Commission into Grain Storage Handling and Transport to think seriously about the future structure of the wheat industry and its position in the Australian and world economy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of some regret that the GCA has been unable to articulate a vision for the future of its industry and has adopted a position of non-negotiability on the major issues. </PARA>
<PARA> While the GCA has been arguing for the status quo it seems not to understand that this is an industry which has been undergoing continuous and, in some cases, quite major change. For instance:</PARA>
<PARA> wheat growing is becoming part of a broader grains industry in which more growers are prepared to make changes in their cropping based on relative prices</PARA>
<PARA> the industry has recently weathered extremely unfavourable market conditions caused by heavy export subsidisation by the US and EC</PARA>
<PARA> wheat purchasers are becoming more specific about the quality characteristics they seek</PARA>
<PARA> the AWB's operations have changed significantly over the last decade. For instance the Board is now a significant offshore borrower. More recently the AWB has provided growers with more flexible delivery options through the introduction of pool cash out arrangements, warehousing and a special stockfeed segregation. </PARA>
<PARA> the domestic market has already been partially deregulated with the introduction of permits for feed wheat and continued black market trading. </PARA>
<PARA> growers have been getting more experience of alternative methods of selling their grain. Even the GCA has recognised this through its recent establishment of the National Grain Exchange. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry has shown that it can respond to the pressures for change. It must continue to have this flexibility. The wheat market is currently very buoyant due to a combination of crop shortages and a rundown in US stocks. However the mechanisms which encourage over-production in some countries remain in place. We are seeking through the GATT Uruguay Round to have these measures wound back, and I am very pleased that during recent negotiations in Geneva progress was achieved in setting out a long and short-term framework for liberalising agricultural trade. However, much remains to be done since Australia cannot compete with the treasuries of the US and EC. We can only respond to difficulties on the world market by ensuring that we not only grow, but also handle and market our grain as efficiently as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> This objective cannot be achieved while unnecessary regulation and controls limit the AWB's effectiveness and impose extra costs on growers and users of wheat. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains provisions to retain the AWB's export monopoly, but to open up more choice for growers by deregulating the domestic wheat market. In place of the compulsion contained in the current marketing arrangements the Government is introducing a range of measures to extend the AWB's commercial powers and flexibility to ensure that it will be able to compete effectively in a deregulated market. The Bill also gives effect to the Government's concern to minimise its own control over the AWB's operations and to extend the Board's accountability to growers. The AWB will not be weakened as has been claimed, but will be significantly strengthened. </PARA>
<PARA> Specifically, and most importantly, the AWB will have clear powers to buy wheat for cash. This will enable it to remain a force in the domestic market, but will also ensure that it has the flexibility to access particular qualities of wheat for export if these are not made available through the pooling system. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, while the AWB's principal objective will remain the marketing of wheat, it will have the scope to market other grains and wheat grown in other countries where this assists its wheat marketing effort. </PARA>
<PARA> Third, the AWB will still be able to pool returns but it will have flexibility in deciding how to conduct these operations. Under the current Wheat Marketing Act there is a single ASW pool with differentials established for other grades. This leads to inflexibility. Under the new legislation the AWB will be able to establish separate pools for separate grades or time periods. This, together with a wider range of payment options, will provide greater scope for responding to market movements. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also point out that the legislation does not make any specific requirements of the AWB regarding its pooling activities and the balance between these and any direct trading in wheat. This will be for the AWB and growers to decide in consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> The AWB will also have powers to enable it to establish subsidiary companies and to engage in other commercial activities such as countertrade, processing, storage and handling. To assist these activities the legislation will also provide for an industry fund to provide the AWB with a much needed capital base. I will elaborate on arrangements for the fund later in this speech. </PARA>
<PARA> To complete its marketing powers the AWB must be able to operate within States. The Government urges the State Governments to ensure that the Board is not weakened by the lack of appropriate facilitating legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition and the Grains Council of Australia have suggested that the Bill is deficient because it does not provide the AWB with powers to trade within States. The simple fact is that the Commonwealth does not have the constitutional power to legislate to this effect. The issue of facilitating the legislation was raised with the relevant State Ministers at the February meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council, for their own reasons some States have chosen to prevaricate. It is the State Governments, not the Commonwealth, who must now act on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> A significant issue for Australian grain producers is the cost associated with the storage, handling and transport of their product. The Royal Commission identified that in 1987-88 these costs were equivalent to around 22% of the fob price for wheat. It recommended a series of deregulatory moves which included the removal of sole receival rights for grain handling authorities, removal of restrictions on the transport of wheat in certain States and the disaggregation of charges for these services to enable growers to make informed decisions about least cost grain paths. The Royal Commission estimated that these changes could lead to potential resource cost savings of up to 10 dollars per tonne. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government has endorsed the broad thrust of the Royal Commission's findings and last year amended the Wheat Marketing Act to provide the AWB with the choice in contracting for grain distribution services and to disaggregate charges to growers. Much of the responsibility for putting the Royal Commission's recommendations into effect rests with the State Governments. However, New South Wales is the only State to announce a positive response. </PARA>
<PARA> If the AWB and other grain trading corporations are to realise the savings estimated by the Royal Commission, they must have the scope to use least cost methods of handling and moving grain. The amendments to the 1984 Wheat Marketing Act, which I have already mentioned, were a step in this direction. However, some States have chosen to deny growers the opportunity of benefiting from the potential savings by continuing monopoly practices in their handling and transport sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> May I provide some examples. In Victoria, Section 188 of the 1983 Transport Act restricts the mode of transport of certain goods. Bulk wheat, barley and oats are not to be carried by private road hauliers beyond a 60 km radius of the place of consignment unless the vehicle owner has been granted a permit by the State Transport Authority. Under section 10 (2) of the Grain Elevators Act, the Grain Elevators Board has the exclusive rights to handle grain in the State. </PARA>
<PARA> In Queensland, similar regulations effectively restrict to rail grain transport over distances greater than 120 km. Section 26 of the Grains Handling Act provides Bulk Grains Queensland with exclusive rights to the storage and handling of export grains shipped from Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> The AWB and other grain trading corporations must be not disadvantaged by this lack of action on the part of the States. The new Wheat Marketing Act provides clear powers for the AWB and other grain trading corporations and their service providers to enter into contracts for storage, handling, transport, port services for grain and marketing of wheat intended for interstate or export unencumbered by State regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> Following tabling of this Bill in the House of Representatives, concerns were raised about the inclusion of references to grain marketing in the sections of the legislation dealing with these powers. The Minister has made it clear that these provisions were not aimed at changing current arrangements within the States for the marketing of other grains. They gave the Government a reserve power in case the States tried to circumvent the Commonwealth's intention to enable unrestricted transport, storage and handling operations. However, recognising the concerns expressed by the States, the Government accepted an amendment in the House confining regulations on marketing to wheat. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the marketing provisions in this Bill. The Government recognises that world grain markets remain under the influence of distorting government policies. I have decided, in response to widespread concerns expressed by the GCA and growers generally, that the AWB should remain the single export marketer for all Australian wheat. The AWB will continue to be able to use private traders as principals or agents as it does now and it will be able to authorise the direct export of wheat if the Board and growers judge it in their best interest. While it continues to have this export monopoly, the AWB will continue to be the receiver of last resort. This will, however, not prevent it from setting standards for the wheat it receives. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no justification for continuing the AWB's domestic marketing monopoly. Wheat is the only industry subject to Commonwealth regulation which has this control. In its 1988 May Economic Statement the Government announced that domestic support arrangements for agriculture should be progressively reduced in accordance with the general reductions in protection and assistance across the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the domestic marketing of wheat to be freed up and this will be achieved through the removal of compulsory acquisition and termination of the arrangements for an administered domestic price. The objective of this move is to give growers greater choice in how they sell their wheat and when. Growers will still have the option of delivering to the AWB's pools, but in addition they will be able to sell their wheat for cash either to the AWB or to other buyers on the domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear that many growers want this choice. Some 90% of the wheat used for feed purposes is traded under the permit system. It is also a fact that wheat continues to be traded on the black market and, as indicated recently by the Flour Miller's Council, that milling wheat is being sold through the feed wheat permit system. </PARA>
<PARA> The essential point is that compulsory acquisition is no longer needed for an efficient marketing effort. I am confident that the AWB will remain the dominant force in a deregulated domestic market given its expertise and the additional commercial powers which I outlined earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> An important benefit arising from freeing up the domestic market will be the greater scope growers will have to arrange their own storage, handling and transport. These additional competitive pressures will assist in achieving the potential resource cost savings in this sector identified by the Royal Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Users of wheat, particularly feedlotters, will also benefit from a freer domestic market and the removal of the costs and red tape involved in the current grower to buyer and permit systems. </PARA>
<PARA> In the recent debate on wheat marketing much has been made of the effect of domestic market deregulation on growers' returns. The argument has centred on concern that when prices are depressed by heavy subsidisation on overseas markets, this will be reflected in the domestic market price. </PARA>
<PARA> This effect, however, depends on the level of subsidisation and also the size of the Australian crop. During the last season the smaller Australian crop and improved market opportunities meant that there was little need for the AWB to discount its prices, even though there was continued strong subsidisation by the US and EC. When market prices are rising rapidly, the domestic price arrangements can cost growers money. The inclusion of past prices in the formula can lead to the Home Consumption Price being lower than the free market price. </PARA>
<PARA> The AWB through its export monopoly will still control some 80 per cent of the wheat produced. Average export prices as reflected in the expected net pool return will put a floor in the market. Contrary to claims by the GCA no grower selling wheat outside the AWB system is likely to accept a farm gate price which is less than the price obtainable through the pool. </PARA>
<PARA> Estimates show that over the last four years, if none of the wheat sold domestically had passed through the AWB pools, the loss to the pools would be in the range of 0.23 cents per tonne to 2 dollars and 93 cents per tonne overall. This is the worst that could happen and, in my view, is highly unlikely to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> In a free market millers can be expected to continue to pay a premium to secure their special requirements for regular supplies and there will be scope for individual growers to achieve quality premiums within the ASW range, something that is not available to the AWB under the current administered domestic price. In addition, the potential savings through the use of more efficient storage, handling and transport facilities can be expected to more than outweigh any transient reduction in prices likely to result from subsidisation on export markets. </PARA>
<PARA> These new marketing arrangements will meet the needs of growers of specialty wheats such as durum and organically grown wheat. Currently these producers incur the AWB's pool costs even if they do not use its services. In future they will be able to sell their wheat freely on the domestic market and I would expect that the AWB will be able to accommodate the export needs of these producers either through its additional pooling flexibility, or through the scope it has to authorise the direct export of wheat. </PARA>
<PARA> While the AWB will have extended commercial powers and a continued export monopoly it should not abuse its market power. The Trade Practices Act will apply to its commercial activities. In this regard it will be important for the Board to keep its trading and pooling activities at arms length and for it to visibly and separately account for these activities. </PARA>
<PARA> Concern has been expressed that domestic market deregulation will affect Australia's ability to maintain its current high standard of grain hygiene and that this will affect our export effort. I do not believe this will be the case. The AWB will be able to enforce existing hygiene standards through its contractual arrangements with those providing storage, handling and transport services. The legislation will make the Board's powers clear in this respect. Wheat which moves outside the AWB will be subject to market pressures if it does not meet hygiene standards acceptable to buyers. Some growers may choose to store more wheat on farm, but this is unlikely to be extensive particularly since the option of warehousing is now available. </PARA>
<PARA> A guaranteed minimum price scheme has operated in the wheat industry for 10 years. This scheme has its drawbacks. Because of the averaging effect of the GMP formula, the GMP and, therefore advance payments, is not necessarily a good indication of expected market returns. For instance, because of the recent strengthening of the wheat market, the final GMP set recently for the current season is only about 80 per cent of expected net pool returns. The GMP has tended to be used as a market indicator but is clearly a poor one. The GMP arrangements have also been the source of rigidities in the operation of the current wheat marketing arrangements, particularly with respect to the AWB's pooling operation. </PARA>
<PARA> In all years the principal benefit of the GMP scheme has been the backing it provides to enable the AWB to borrow at favourable interest rates and pay a relatively high first advance to growers delivering wheat to the AWB pools. The Government will continue to provide this benefit via a specific borrowing guarantee. Essentially this means that the AWB's borrowings will continue to be underwritten by the Government. Should there be a call on the guarantee the Government will meet its obligation and will not seek repayment by the industry. This is a significant commitment and is indicative of the Government's willingness to continue to back the wheat industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In the initial year of the new arrangements this guarantee will be set at a level which will enable the payment of a first advance equivalent to 90 per cent of the estimated net pool returns in the current season. I would point out that because of the current rising market prices, this will result in a higher first advance than would have been available under the GMP scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1988 May Statement the Government announced that industry should progressively take over responsibility for funding the costs involved in reducing price uncertainty through underwriting schemes. Consistent with this intention the level of the borrowing guarantee will be phased down to 80 per cent of estimated net returns in year five of the new arrangements. The guarantee will be subject to review within five years. Should the industry wish to have a higher level of first advance than that available through the borrowing guarantee, provision has been made for it to introduce its own mechanism to make any additional payments. </PARA>
<PARA> Arrangements for setting the level of the guarantee will involve preliminary Ministerial determination (in consultation with the AWB and the Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics) of the estimated net pool return for the season by 1 October. As under the current arrangements, a final guarantee and advance could be established later in the season. It will be up to the AWB in consultation with the GCA to determine the actual level of first advance for particular categories of wheat delivered to pools which will be based on the level of available borrowings. The level of the Government's financial commitment, however, will be limited on an aggregate basis to the level of the borrowing guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA> I am aware that the averaging arrangements in the previous GMP scheme provided support to growers in circumstances of extreme market downturn such as in 1986-87. If such a crisis were to occur again the Government would need to give close consideration to special support arrangements for the industry. I would also point out that the Government is also providing drought assistance and national interest insurance cover to the wheat industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The financing arrangements I have just described relate only to the AWB's pooling operation. However, as I have indicated, the Board will have a broader commercial role and there is a need to establish a capital base for it. It is a source of major weakness to the industry that the AWB has no asset base despite its role as one of the country's largest marketers. The new wheat marketing legislation will provide the mechanism for the establishment of an industry fund through a levy on all wheat sold. The Government will also assist in the initial establishment of this fund through the provision over five years of a loan guarantee of up to 100 million for the purposes of the fund. </PARA>
<PARA> This will not be a stabilisation fund. It will provide finance for a range of activities which would include:</PARA>
<PARA> the AWB's commercial undertakings, including cash purchases</PARA>
<PARA> making advance payments above the level provided through the AWB borrowing guarantee</PARA>
<PARA> providing insurance on credit sales. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be for the GCA in consultation with the AWB to determine the specific uses to which finance from the fund will be put. </PARA>
<PARA> The fund will be a powerful new avenue through which the industry will be able to influence its future. Detailed arrangements for the fund are still being considered by the GCA and the AWB and will be incorporated in regulations. I would emphasise, however, that the Government would want to see a commercial relationship between the fund and the AWB and proper equity arrangements established for growers. The fund will only be activated if industry agrees to the introduction of a levy for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> Levy arrangements are the subject of separate Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> The AWB will be moving into a new phase of its operations and facing new challenges. It will be undertaking expanded commercial operations with a minimum of Government control but with Government borrowing guarantees. If the AWB is to perform effectively in this new environment it is essential that the best qualified people are appointed to the Board. It must be able to develop clear corporate strategies and purpose. The new Act will provide for Board members to have a balance of skills in the areas of production, marketing and finance. </PARA>
<PARA> It will also be essential for the AWB to have a highly skilled management team. It must have a Managing Director as the Chief Executive who the Board should be able to pay at market rates, free from the Remuneration Tribunal constraints which operate at present. </PARA>
<PARA> In principle I favour the appointment of a non-executive Chairperson who in the long term would be part-time. I recognise that the Board faces a challenging task in the transition to the new arrangements and that stability in its leadership structure is desirable. I have indicated to the GCA that the AWB will continue to have a grower Chairperson. </PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of grower concern about ``loss of control'' of the AWB. Let me emphasise that the Board will continue to be accountable to growers. However, this responsibility will be exercised through the the AWB Selection Committee and consultative arrangements between the AWB and GCA rather than through participation in the day to day running of the Board. </PARA>
<PARA> The new Act will make clear provisions for the AWB to consult the GCA on the performance of its functions. In particular, I would expect the AWB to consult the GCA on such issues as the establishment of subsidiaries, pooling arrangements and general policy on trading in other grains and wheat of other origin. While the Act provides for a minimum of one consultative meeting each year, I would expect the AWB and GCA to consult more frequently than this. </PARA>
<PARA> Given its continuing role as a statutory authority, the AWB will also continue to be accountable to the Minister and the Parliament. The Board's Annual Report, Corporate Plan and Annual Operating Plan constitute important avenues of accountability both to the Government and the GCA. </PARA>
<PARA> The current arrangement under which the cost of shipping wheat to Tasmania is funded through a levy on domestic wheat sales will be terminated with the deregulation of the domestic market. The Government has, however, undertaken to continue funding this assistance from Consolidated Revenue. The exact amount of this assistance has still to be worked out but in 1989-90 I expect it to be close to the average level of about 3 million dollars which has applied in recent years. The assistance will phase down by 25% over the five year period commencing in 1989-90 and the scheme will be subject to review within five years. </PARA>
<PARA> There are no other direct financial implications arising from the legislation, although the Government is committed to assuming contingent liabilities under the proposed borrowing guarantees. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this new legislation will set the Australian wheat industry on a clear path for a prosperous future. It provides for a commercially strong AWB, free from unnecessary regulation and with clear lines of responsibility to growers. The marketing arrangements will provide more flexibility and choice to growers and an opportunity for both growers and end users to keep costs down. These changes together with the introduction of new financing arrangements for the AWB will ensure that the industry is in a strong position to meet competitive challenges into the next century. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to Senators. </PARA>
<PARA>WHEAT INDUSTRY FUND LEVY BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill and the associated Levy Collection Bill is to enable the wheat industry to impose and collect a single ad valorem levy on wheat, for distribution between the Wheat Research Trust Fund and any industry fund which may be established under the provisions of the Wheat Marketing Bill 1989. This latter Bill is the basis for the whole legislation package covering new wheat marketing arrangements to apply from 1 July this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The levy will be paid on wheat that is sold, delivered or processed by or on the growers' behalf from 1 July this year. This will enable the continuation of the current research funding arrangements based on grower and matching Commonwealth contributions, from that date. </PARA>
<PARA> The Grains Council of Australia will determine the rate of levy, based on a percentage of sales value, for payment to the research fund. This percentage which will be set by regulation cannot be less than 0.25% and this compares with the current rate of research tax of about 0.35% of value. The industry has already indicated a preparedness to increase its contribution to research over a three year period in order to move towards the ceiling of the Government's matching contribution of 0.5% of average gross value of production. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry fund provided for under the Wheat Marketing Bill to finance a number of commercial activities by the Australian Wheat Board will only be activated if the industry through the Grains Council determines that a percentage of the total levy to be imposed under the Levy Bill is to be used for this purpose. This percentage of sales value cannot be less than 2% which is equivalent to about 3 dollars and 80 cents per tonne for standard quality wheat. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to implement an ad valorem levy to replace the previous fixed rate per tonne wheat taxes, which were imposed for research purposes and the operation of the stockfeed permit scheme, was designed to make the levy as equitable as possible. For example a tonne of prime hard wheat is more valuable by about 35 dollars than a tonne of feed wheat and therefore an ad valorem levy will distribute the levy burden more evenly among growers of different qualities of wheat. </PARA>
<PARA> The amount of revenue collected for wheat research purposes under the new levy arrangements is not expected to vary from current estimates which reflect the industry's agreement to increase its contribution to research. Revenue is expected to increase to 11.8 million dollars by 1991/92 from the current level of around 10.5 million dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that if the industry fund is activated the component of the levy for payment to the fund would initially be set at 2% of sale value. This would result in revenue of an estimated 55 million dollars in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> Administration of the levy collection arrangements will be undertaken within the existing resources of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>WHEAT INDUSTRY FUND LEVY COLLECTION BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to provide the machinery necessary for collecting the levy imposed by the Wheat Industry Fund Levy Bill 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill should be read as one with the Levy Bill and is to come into operation on the same day as that Bill becomes operative. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill specifies the liability of purchasers and receivers under the scheme, outlines penalties for non-compliance and provides appropriate powers of enforcement. </PARA>
<PARA>There are no financial implications other than those covered in the Second Reading Speech for the Wheat Industry Fund Levy Bill 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>WHEAT (TERMINATION OF TAX) BILL (NO. 1) 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to terminate at 30 June 1989 the current research tax arrangements imposed on wheat delivered to the Australian Wheat Board. After that date an equivalent research levy will be imposed on wheat under provisions of the Wheat Industry Fund Levy Bill 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>Those sections of the principal Act, the Wheat Tax Act 1957, covering payment of tax monies already collected will remain in force to enable finalisation of these arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>WHEAT (TERMINATION OF TAX) BILL (NO. 2) 1989</PARA>

<PARA>Provisions of the Wheat Tax Act 1979 covering payment of tax monies already collected will remain in force to enable finalisation of these arrangements. </PARA>

<PARA>WHEAT (TERMINATION OF PERMIT TAX) BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to terminate at 30 June 1989 the tax imposed on permits issues by the Australian Wheat Board for stockfeed wheat sold outside of the pooling system. </PARA>
<PARA> This permit scheme will no longer operate under deregulated domestic marketing arrangements provided for under the Wheat Marketing Bill 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>WHEAT TAX (PERMIT) COLLECTION AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has not advanced the reasons for this further delay, and I would remind the Senate that this is the second time we have considered the deferment of the particular report of Senate Estimates Committee E. This matter has been totally in the hands of the Government, and the delay was occasioned by the need for Senate Estimates Committee E to meet with officers of the Auditor-General's Department. In the course of the conduct of the Committee, very significant differences between the Auditor-General's Department and the Aboriginal Development Commission arose. It was necessary for the Committee to convene a special meeting on Wednesday, 3 May. As a result of those deliberations, of course, the preparation of the report of the Committee has taken some time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would remind the Senate that this is in respect of the Departments of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Administrative Services, the Attorney-General, and Aboriginal Affairs. Whilst many of the issues relating to the first three of those departments were easy to resolve, once again the issues resulting from the consideration of the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio were particularly difficult. It is a matter of concern that Government members have not been available to meet formally as members of Estimates Committee E. This is despite the offer of the coalition members of the Committee to be available last Friday and on Monday. This matter has, of course, been continually deferred by order of the Chairman. It was concerning to note that the Senate has given leave of absence for this week to a member of the Estimates Committee E, Senator Morris. However, last night, in a very sneaky sleight of hand, without any consultation whatsoever with the Opposition, almost at the death knell of the Senate-almost 10.30 p.m.-the Government sought to alter the membership of the Committee, and Senator Maguire replaced Senator Morris as a member. As I have said, this was obviously for the purpose of facilitating a majority report, with a stacked Committee in favour of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, this is an occasion on which, in respect of the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs, the Government is manipulating a Senate committee for its own ends. This will result in reports contrary to the weight of evidence that has been presented to that very important Committee. It needs to be understood very clearly that the Government is seeking once again to obtain an artificial majority report on Aboriginal Affairs. Given the important consideration that this matter has had in the Parliament in the last year, our objections are that a particular senator-Senator Maguire-is being asked to sign a report without having heard the evidence, the considerable evidence over four days, and the considerable debate and consideration of some hundreds of questions and answers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition members of the Committee will therefore be forced to prepare a minority report containing the substantive issues and criticisms that are so necessary. It is a real pity that the Labor Party cannot accept its responsibilities on Senate Estimates committees without stacking them and seeking to control them in this undue manner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This group comprises a large number of Bills-I think 13-and it is fair to say that, combined, they constitute the largest single package of legislation ever introduced into this Parliament. They are also critically important in that they provide the Government's proposed framework for corporation and securities law for this nation. They are very radical in their composition, in that they propose a new nationalised system of corporate and securities law to replace the existing cooperative scheme, which, honourable senators on this side of the chamber believe, has served the nation well for the past nine years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition opposes the corporations package, except the Close Corporations Bill, which, as I indicated last year when the package was referred to a joint select committee, we support. Therefore, what I am saying is that, notwithstanding the considerations of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation, the Opposition has formed the view that it is not in the best interests of Australia to move at this time to a nationalised system of corporate and securities law. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth reiterating, I believe, not only that this is a massive package by volume, but also that, upon presentation of the Bills in the other place last year, the Government itself introduced, and had passed, some 280 amendments to its own proposed legislation. We had presented to us last night about 30 pages of Government amendments, which it seeks to have passed in this chamber. In addition, we have just received amendments from the Australian Democrats. It is obvious, therefore, that the committee stage of these Bills will involve a difficult and complex debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the chamber that when the Senate referred the Bills to the Joint Select Committee on 14 October last year we sought much wider terms of reference for the Committee than were granted by the Senate. As a result of the more limited terms of reference, very serious questions remain under debate in the business and legal community-questions that are not specifically addressed by the Joint Select Committee's report. The most critical of those relates to the doubtful constitutionality of the whole package and, therefore, the potential disastrous consequences if Australian business and commerce were to rely upon a new legislative package which, in due course, was found to be constitutionally invalid. We regret that the Joint Select Committee did not look further at that matter. I think we demonstrated adequately at the time of the debate leading to the referral of the Bills to the Joint Select Committee that there is very serious doubt as to the constitutional validity of the package. There could be no more serious question to be addressed in detail than that. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the terms of reference were narrow, there was the very basic question in principle of whether it would be in the best interests of Australia if we abandoned the federal system existing at the moment, which has existed through means of a cooperative scheme, and moved to Commonwealth legislation administered and controlled by the Federal Parliament. I have to concede that, although the terms of reference did not allow that consideration, the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen), by letter to some of the States that were interested in the issue, said that he would have no objection to those arguments being put before the Committee. Therefore, those arguments were addressed by the Committee. Nevertheless, I think it is fair to say they did not receive the type of debate that would have eventuated if they had been the focus of the Committee's report. Rather, the focus of the Committee's report was on how the details of the package could be improved, were it to be accepted. As is the case with many of the reports of parliamentary committees, it is a useful document which helps in that constructive purpose. It is our regret that the Committee was not allowed to consider in greater depth the basic questions that needed to be determined before one could get to the detail of the package. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, we oppose the Bill because we believe that the existing cooperative system has basically served Australia well. We also oppose the Bill because of the very widespread opposition to it which exists within the community, in particular, from all States of Australia; from within the legal fraternity; from business and commerce generally. I will draw to the attention of the Senate in due course some specific examples of that opposition. It is fair to say that the national scheme, apart from the support it has from this Government, now has very little support from within the community, from the professions and business and, as I have said, it has a total absence of support from State governments. If the Commonwealth were to take over a scheme of doubtful constitutionality from the States, it would have been well served to obtain the support of the States before doing so. It has not done so. The States continue to be opposed to these proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> The third reason upon which we base our opposition is the very doubtful constitutional basis of the law and the calamitous consequences which could follow if the law were found to be invalid and, therefore, to varying extents, invalidating a mass of business or commercial transactions based upon that invalid law. I have said that the Opposition would prefer to retain the cooperative scheme. We do not say that the cooperative scheme does not require updating and amendment. In fact, it does. The Opposition has now settled upon the changes to the cooperative scheme it would look to achieve to enable it to meet properly the structural necessities in this field of law for the next decade or so. We therefore seek to have an amendment passed to the Australian Securities Commission Bill which I will move and which indicates our position in this debate. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> Leave out all words after `That', insert `the existing co-operative scheme has served Australia well and should be retained with appropriate amendments, to enhance the scheme in the light of experience since its inception and to update and strengthen its national regulatory role'. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition believes that the Government's dismantling of the existing cooperative scheme is a clumsy attempt at centralisation. It is also against the will of every State and Territory and the vast majority of business organisations in Australia. The coalition strongly supports the current cooperative model, which has not been in existence for nine years and which, generally speaking, has served corporate Australia well. Our objective is to provide commercial and individual access to an efficient and streamlined regulatory framework whilst ensuring adequate investor protection. Upon coming to government, we will therefore retain the current cooperative scheme of company law, whereby the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) administers companies and securities law through State corporate affairs commissions subject to the control of the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities. We will do so, in part, because of the wide acknowledgment that the checks and balances inherent in the cooperative arrangements provide a truly bipartisan forum where individual States can respond to the wide range of requirements of local business and professional communities. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned a moment ago, we do, however, accept that after nearly a decade of operation the current scheme is in need of overhaul. That is why we propose our enhanced cooperative scheme as a clear alternative to the Government's proposals in relation to a corporate and securities law for this nation. That enhanced cooperative scheme is designed to allow greater flexibility while fostering more efficient administration. We stress that under our alternative scheme the States will continue to play their role in the regulation of companies and securities and will continue to collect funds on the current basis. In government, however, we would undertake a comprehensive review of the workings of the cooperative arrangements. To this end, the recommendations of the management committee of the Ministerial Council should, in our opinion, be considered immediately. The Ministerial Council has already approved a newly defined set of functions for the NCSC and the States to remove any duplication or overlap. Staffing and funding are also being examined. The experience of the members of the Ministerial Council will provide valuable input into the enhancement of the cooperative scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, the following changes would be supported by the Opposition to enhance the role of the Commonwealth Parliament and to speed up decision-making through the Ministerial Council: first, in order to provide the Commonwealth with a larger role in the formation and amendment of legislation, it is our view that the Commonwealth should become the permanent chair of the Ministerial Council. Secondly, consideration will be given to allowing the Federal Attorney-General a weighted vote on the Ministerial Council. Thirdly, we support the establishment of a parliamentary standing committee on corporations and securities to which the NCSC would report. Because I am a realist, I know that it is likely to pass debate in this chamber during the course of the next few days. In fact, we will be looking for some changes to that to give the Parliament a more effective capacity for scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, in our opinion the Federal Parliament should be vested with the clear right to debate legislation approved by the Council and to refer legislation back to the Ministerial Council for immediate approval or amendment. This whole area has, of course, been one of the great frustrations for those of us in the Senate who have debated corporate law over the years knowing that in fact the chamber can have little role beyond that of a rubber stamp. You would be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs report which, in many ways, reflected the view that has been stated by honourable senators over the years-that the lack of capacity of proper ministerial accountability and capacity to amend is a great frustration. Our proposal does not totally resolve the matter but we believe, in this cooperative federal environment in which corporate law must exist, a step further is worth while and our proposal is in fact for a step further. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth detailed change that I put to the Senate is that we will put guidelines in place to ensure that the administration and management of the State Corporate Affairs Commissions are standardised and streamlined across Australia. Again, the Senate Standing Committee expressed some frustration with the submissions that have been made to it as to a lack of standardised administration in this area of law. </PARA>
<PARA> Sixthly, we would provide a new funding procedure and cost recovery system for the National Companies and Securities Commission. In particular under a Liberal-National Party Government the NCSC will receive adequate funding through a combination of direct funds and the user pays system. It will be imperative that any funds collected by the NCSC under a user pays system be used to enhance the cooperative scheme. The Senate will be aware of the frustration of the operation of the NCSC under inadequate funding in recent years, and of the submissions that have been made by officers of the NCSC to Estimates committees of this Senate expressing that frustration and incapacity to meet properly its statutory responsibility under the restrictive funding that has been provided. </PARA>
<PARA> The seventh policy that we would implement is that State governments would retain the power to collect fees as they relate to services provided in the administration of companies and securities law. However, certain incentives will be provided to ensure that the States maintain adequate funding to their corporate affairs offices. </PARA>
<PARA> Eighthly, the NCSC also will be allowed greater staffing autonomy in order to facilitate the recruitment and retention of highly trained professionals. Rather than being regarded as a stepping stone the NCSC must, in our opinion, be in a position to offer a career structure with adequate rewards-a matter that was in fact discussed by the Joint Select Committee and that no doubt will receive further attention during the course of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Ninthly, in our policy the NCSC will be given greater powers to coordinate and direct the activities of the Corporate Affairs Commissions of the States and Territories. This may mean that the NCSC is vested with the discretion to decide whether an investigation should be conducted by the State or is more appropriately carried out by the NCSC because of its national character. </PARA>
<PARA> Tenthly, we would move to expedite the implementation of full computerisation of company records by gaining a firm commitment from all States and Territories to cooperate. Finally, under our Government, work will continue towards further harmonisation of regulatory requirements between Australia and other countries. This will build on the memorandums of understanding already signed with Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Harmonisation will ensure reciprocal recognition of fundraising and takeover documents as well as financial reports. What we are seeking to do is to set up a clear and detailed alternative to the Government's national scheme, which it is seeking to put through the Parliament at the moment, our scheme being referred to as an enhanced cooperative scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a couple of matters that I should not let pass without dealing with them in a little more detail. The first is our concern with the doubtful constitutional basis of this legislation. I raised these matters in my speech to the Senate on 14 October 1988 in reference to referral of the Bills to the Joint Select Committee. I regret that the Government does not seem to have answered the very serious and widespread concerns that have been raised throughout the legal profession in this regard. I would have thought that, at the very least, as it is some six months or so since the time of reference of those Bills, the Government would have come out with further information to justify constitutionality beyond the opinion of Sir Maurice Byers, which is well known to the Senate and which was referred to in the previous debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned at that time that the worries about constitutionality have been sought to be overcome on a number of occasions through the referendum process. The proposals, which would have given corporation power clearly to the Commonwealth, were put and defeated in 1911, 1913, 1919 and 1926. In 1929 the Royal Commission on the Constitution recommended that the Constitution be amended to confer power on the Commonwealth in legislative form in this area. In 1959 the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review recommended that the Constitution be amended to grant the Commonwealth concurrent legislative power over corporations. As late as 1987 this Government's advisory committee to the Constitutional Commission on Trade and National Economic Management recommended constitutional reform to overcome the doubts that existed as to the constitutional competence of the Commonwealth Government to support legislation of this type. So what we have seen throughout the history of the Commonwealth is a recognition by learned bodies that there is considerable doubt existing as to the constitutional interpretation upon which this legislation is based. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that the Government's last advisory committee, which I mentioned, included senior lawyers and businessmen and in fact reported after the Senate Standing Committee report, which included the opinion of Sir Maurice Byers. No doubt it was taken into account; nevertheless it remained in question. On the previous occasion the Attorney-General's Department itself, in its submission to the Senate Standing Committee, expressed concern about the constitutionality of a full takeover of the law in this area and therefore advocated a split scheme with the Commonwealth taking over the securities law. Nevertheless the Australian Government has, as it turns out, been much more ambitious in its grab for power in this area and has disregarded the concern and based the whole of this scheme upon a doubtful constitutional power. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, I also mentioned on the last occasion the joint memorandum of the Solicitors-General of the States and the Northern Territory, produced as a result of a meeting on 9 March 1988, in which they unanimously question the Commonwealth's legal competence in this area. One could go on and consider the submissions that have been made by the Law Institute of Victoria, such eminent legal firms as Mallesons Stephen Jaques and the Law Council of Australia. I repeat a relevant paragraph of the Council's advice to the Parliament, dated 31 August of last year, in which it said that it believed it would be irresponsible for the Commonwealth to legislate on the basis of its existing constitutional powers. It also said that the Commonwealth should not legislate unless and until the Constitution has been appropriately amended. That is advice from the Law Council of Australia, the pre-eminent representative body of lawyers in this Commonwealth, which I would have thought should not be readily dismissed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has an exotic scheme, I understand, whereby it proposes that the laws be passed and we then wait upon a challenge from one or more of the States to resolve the constitutionality. We on the Opposition side of the chamber do not believe that is the appropriate way in which to determine the correct interpretation of the Constitution. We believe that in such an important area as setting up a totally new framework for the constitutional and securities base for this country it is irresponsible to legislate upon unclear and, certainly, doubtful constitutional opinion. </PARA>
<PARA> I said a little earlier in my address that many business organisations and professional organisations in this nation are opposed to the scheme that the Government is proposing. They remain opposed. In fact, despite the six months since the matter was referred to the Senate committee, all that can be said is that their views would seem to have been reinforced by further debate and consideration of this matter. We have here a package of law which is critically important to this nation, which nevertheless is being put to this Parliament without the support of business and professional organisations, which is based upon doubtful constitutional interpretation and which lacks the support of any one of the States or Territories of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances we do not believe that it would be responsible for this Parliament to pass the package. As I have said, we would rather advocate the alternative of a new enhanced cooperative scheme which can achieve all the objectives which this Government claims to be achieving through its nationalisation of law in this area, but in a way in which the constitutionality is unquestioned; in a way which would involve the cooperation and goodwill of the States, which we believe is so critical to effective law in this area; and in a way which would be supported generally by commerce and the legal and accounting professions. </PARA>
<PARA> One is really at a loss to understand why the Government has chosen this path rather than the path we have outlined, which would receive such widespread support throughout the Australian community. Nevertheless, the Government seeks to do so, presumably to try to justify the position the Attorney-General has advocated in this area, perhaps as a parting gesture-some legacy that he will leave-because there is no logical reason, objectively assessed, that we can see to support the direction that this Government has taken. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated, we will be dealing in detail in the committee stage with each of the chapters of the report and the amendments that the Government and the Australian Democrats have put up. Therefore, in this speech I will not address the detail of the Committee's report. The Opposition, as I said, opposes the package, except for the Close Corporations Bill, for the reasons that I have outlined and will seek the support of the Senate for the amendment that I have moved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are discussing yet again the corporations package of Bills. The history of this legislation is now quite extensive. It goes back to the Federal Government's announcement in 1987 that it would proceed with a national scheme to replace the present cooperative scheme. This national scheme, of course, has been thoroughly debated and examined. Indeed, it is difficult to think of a recent package of legislation which has been more subjected to detailed scrutiny and examination across the board.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Federal Parliament, I am happy to say, has played a leading role in helping the debate on this issue. The need for a national scheme was recognised first in this Parliament, and in this House, by the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange, the Rae Committee, in 1974. That Committee concluded that it was vital that the national character of activities being regulated be recognised. The Rae Committee opposed the concept of a regulatory body reporting to several governments. Since the Rae Committee report, the business environment in and Australian securities and financial markets has changed rapidly, yet the mechanisms for dealing with this have hardly changed at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems associated with that lag were again recognised in April 1987 by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, a committee of which Senator Hill was a member. Its report, entitled The Role of the Parliament in Relation to the National Companies Scheme, concluded that the cooperative scheme had served the needs of the 1970s but had failed to meet the needs of business as we head into the next century. That is a very important stance to take. When one looks at the cooperative scheme one can see that it has been a useful device in bringing us to the point where we are now. However, one can see that it is a creaking device and a device which progressively is becoming less adapted to the new environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs recommended that the Federal Parliament develop and assume responsibility for the national companies and securities scheme, something with which Senator Hill also agreed at that time. The Committee's report has had considerable impact on the present legislation. It is also worth emphasising that the Committee's recommendation at that time was unanimous, supported by members of the Labor and Liberal parties. </PARA>
<PARA> The package of Bills with which we are dealing will replace the separate State and Territory legislation on the cooperative scheme with a single system of law for companies throughout Australia. It will replace the current scheme, and replace the current National Companies and Securities Commission with the Australian Securities Commission (ASC). The basis of the Australian Democrats' support for a national scheme rests, first of all, on the position adopted in the 1987 report, on the need for a scheme looking into the future. Secondly, it rests on two other major matters. One is parliamentary and ministerial accountability, and the other is the attitude of business to the regulatory mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look first of all at parliamentary and ministerial accountability it is obvious-and Senator Hill alluded to this in his speech-that every time we had legislation before us with regard to the cooperative scheme it was said by one honourable senator or another that we needed a particular amendment here or a particular amendment there, but we never amended any such legislation, and for a very good reason. The reason is that under the creaky cooperative scheme one had to manage to get all of the States and the Commonwealth to agree-and, of course, in Australia to get all of the States and the Commonwealth to agree to anything is almost a superhuman task. So the thought of actually amending that legislation and putting the whole thing back to the starting point was too much for most honourable senators to contemplate. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, we were willing and almost had to pass pieces of legislation that this chamber saw as deficient and that were, for example, running foul of a number of reports from our own committees with regard to the rights of Australians. So the Scrutiny of Bills Committee regularly reported adversely on those pieces of legislation coming before us. If this chamber had had its way, it would never have passed those pieces of legislation in the way it did. We did it only because the thought of getting all of the States in this country to agree to anything probably overwhelmed us, and we thought, `We had better grab it it now. The chances are not likely to come again'. Indeed, as somebody pointed out, and I think it is quite true, it is a lot easier to get the countries of Europe-countries which have spent the last 300 or 400 years fighting one another almost to the death-to agree on something than it is to get our States to agree to something. </PARA>
<PARA> The important thing that this Parliament has on its plate is this nation's future. We must have in place good company law which looks to the future of our economy. On my own behalf and that of my Party, I express the view that we do not believe that it is possible through the cooperative scheme to have in place the type of regulatory operations that are needed in the rapidly changing environment of the securities and futures markets. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of ministerial accountability, of course, no single Minister had the responsibility for this particular scheme, and effectively nobody was in charge. Even Senator Hill obliquely recognised this problem when he said that under the Opposition's scheme the Commonwealth would be a permanent chair of the committee. Indeed, honourable members opposite were even looking at the possibility of having a weighted vote. I would give it a weighted vote-a vote of 51 per cent. We might get something done. Senator Hill probably has not read all of the transcripts of the inquiry of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation, but it is interesting that three of the four issues that were first raised with respect to the cooperative scheme are still not solved. That is one of the things that led business to support this particular scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I listened carefully to what Senator Hill was saying. He might have been technically correct in saying that the majority of the organisations have expressed opposition, but the majority of business is overwhelmingly in favour. That can be easily demonstrated by the fact, for example, that the small business association spoke glowingly of this particular package. That gives us the overwhelming majority of businesses to start off with-well over 90 per cent of all businesses in Australia. On top of that, of course, the Business Council of Australia-representing the dominant companies in this country's economy; those which in fact have the overwhelming trading operations in this country-was also in favour. I think that when those two ends come together-small business and the biggest business-one has to pause and ask, `How is it that there can be that alliance between those groups which one would imagine would have such disparate views?'.These organisations said quite frankly that they were looking for a single, definitive, cooperative scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> In passing, I make reference to another point raised by Senator Hill, that of funding his scheme. He said that he would have the users pay. I interjected, `The users already pay', and that is the problem. The users pay and they do not get value for money, because what the users pay will prop up State Budgets and State Budget deficits. That money is being paid by business for a good scheme of regulatory operations in this country, but it is in fact being siphoned off at State level into State government coffers and other things are being done with it. If that money were in fact put towards the regulation of business-that is, if it were put towards the purposes for which it is currently paid-we would probably have a far better cooperative scheme than we have had. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there is absolutely no way of getting the States to agree to part with that money, because it is an important funding exercise. In other words, business, through the regulatory mechanisms, has become a milking cow. Let us be very clear about it. States are interested in keeping control of this area for the money. They are not interested in keeping control of it so that we can have proper regulation in this country. When this scheme came before us, knowing that we were dealing with what has already been referred to as the largest package of legislation introduced into this Parliament since Federation, we thought it was very clear that an inquiry would be needed. Indeed, I met with the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) on 29 July in Sydney and put it to him that when this legislation came to the Senate we would move for a committee inquiry, not to look at the general ideological dispute-that is, whether we should have a scheme-but rather to look at the question of what such a scheme should be like and whether this was the best we could have. So admittedly the committee inquiry was limited and focused. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not agree at all with Senator Hill that we should have spent more of our time juggling with whether this was constitutional. Quite frankly, a greater exercise in futility I could not imagine. The committee on which Senator Hill sat earlier had already done that and its members unanimously agreed. The Joint Select Committee, on which I sat, could have dealt with that matter and agreed unanimously or otherwise; it would not have made one iota of difference to the constitutional standing of this package of Bills, because the correct body to decide on the constitutionality of Bills is the High Court of Australia, not a committee of this or the other chamber. Indeed, I had some harsh words to say about the Attorney-General's interference in the Committee's inquiries with regard to writing to the States inviting them to give evidence on something which was not in our Committee's terms of reference. I do not know why he took it upon himself to do that. But I have put it on record that I did not accept that that was a proper function for us to be engaged in. It was none of the Attorney's business to write to the States and ask them to come and talk to us about things that neither this chamber nor the other had asked us to inquire into. In fact, it was improper. I have said so and it is on the record of that Committee inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tate could say that, but we actually had a vote in this place on what we were going to do. The vote dealt very specifically with whether we were going to look at those constitutional matters, and this chamber decided that we were not going to do that. Despite that, we had to sit through hours upon hours of fairly standard rhetoric from people coming from the States talking about the ideological propositions. They are fair matters of dispute; I am not contending that they are not. But these general ideological propositions are really matters for the political parties in this place to contend with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I was hoping the Committee would do-and in fact, what it did do-was to take evidence over six months from Australians, business organisations, businesses, lawyers and other groups that were interested in this area right around the country. We had an innovative approach to this matter, one which I have already mentioned and recommended we might use in future. A representative from the Attorney-General's Department, from the National Companies and Securities Commission and from the Australian Stock Exchange went with us and provided us with absolutely invaluable expertise and information on a day to day basis. In fact, I picked up that idea from the Joint Committee on Electoral Reform, on which we have used much the same device with the electoral commissioners. It is a very useful device and it was enormously helpful to us in our deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, as a result of this Committee inquiry, a very large number of people in Australia realised that this particular package would proceed and that this was what they would have to deal with. In contrast to what occurred on the previous occasion, people were more willing to come forward and express their views. A lot of work was put into the submissions to the Committee, and some excellent work was done. We received an extremely valuable input from individuals and organisations with regard to technical matters in the legislation. As can be seen by the amendments proposed by the Government, by the Democrats and probably also by the Opposition, much of that inquiry was very productive. </PARA>
<PARA> In January the Democrats suggested that one of the important issues we were dealing with in the Australian Securities Commission Bill and the corporations Bills-the two major parts of this package-was the independence of the Australian Securities Commission. A number of organisations had quite correctly observed that, whatever the failings of the cooperative scheme, one valuable consequence arose from it, that is, it was rendered politically neutral by the fact that no one Minister had responsibility for it and no one Minister, therefore, effectively could make directions which might be detrimental to business in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result I believed that the best course at that point might be to have a parliamentary committee. I was encouraged in that view by the fact that there would be two major beneficiaries of such a committee. One would be the business community in general. It would have an all-party organisation to which it could refer. Hence it would not necessarily be beholden simply to the Attorney-General or to the Attorney-General's Department. Problems that might arise and issues that might come forward could be ventilated by the committee. Hence there would be an ability to let off steam. The committee would also be able to monitor the operations of the new ASC. The other beneficiary would be the Parliament. Ten people, five from each chamber, would spend a considerable proportion of their time outside the chamber working within the committee on issues concerning Australian financial markets, the securities markets and the futures markets. The expertise that those members and senators would gain would be invaluable in subsequent debates. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposition was acceptable to the Committee and to the Government. The Government's response appears in its amendments. We believe that it will remove the problem that did not exist under the cooperative scheme but that could have existed under the single scheme, that is, the possibility of political interference. That would not exist under these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> A large numbers of matters were not able to be dealt with by the Committee. At that stage what we were about was to try to make sure that any obvious errors that might have crept in or problems that existed could be rectified. There are a whole range of problems. One problem is that of the shield of the crown which this chamber has resolved to look at through another committee. There are the problems associated with insider trading and a whole host of other matters, some of which have already been the subject of inquiry and recent reports. Obviously, most of them were not able to be incorporated in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the size of the legislation one rapidly realises that there will be amendments to it over time. We were seeking to get the basic structures in place so that we could proceed and on the basis of a learning experience. We realised that amendments would become necessary in a year or two as the Government, the parliamentary committee and business in general learned how these items worked. I draw the Senate's attention to what happened to the large number of amendments that were made by this chamber unanimously with regard to the electoral laws. In a subsequent inquiry and in the hindsight of their operation during an election it became obvious that certain problems appeared that had not been recognised. We were able to amend the legislation in a subsequent Bill. I believe that the same situation is likely to occur with regard to this legislation. It is not possible to foresee all the problems that will arise. Hence adjustments will need to be made. It will also, hopefully, be a function of the committee to make sure that those adjustments are made rapidly and with due information and understanding. </PARA>
<PARA> The range of Bills we will be dealing with in committee is extensive and detailed. During the second reading debate I do not wish to go into those details or into why we are looking at amending some of the Government's amendments or moving some amendments the Government has put aside from the Committee's report. I believe that the major thrust will be agreed on, that is, that this legislation is a comprehensive attempt to come to grips with the future of business in this country and the future of Australia as a trading nation. Australia has peculiar problems as a significant trading nation with a very small population. Those types of problems do not emerge in countries such as the United States that have a very large domestic market. We do not have such a large domestic market. Unfortunately, in many of the debates we have in this place the ignorance or non-recognition of the fact that we are a trading nation without a major domestic market leads people to make erroneous comparisons between Australia and other countries about the way we can structure our organisations for business. </PARA>
<PARA> I cite an example that does not appear readily. It is in the primary industry area. It is an issue which we will be debating shortly and on which a committee reported yesterday, the sugar industry. The sugar industry is a very large exporter. Sugar is Australia's second major rural product, after wheat. Eighty per cent of our sugar production is exported, which means that we are exposed to the world price in a way that no other country on earth is exposed to it. Other major producers and exporters of sugar do not export anywhere near 80 per cent of their sugar. The percentages they export are very low. So they can have a stable domestic price for their product. The fluctuating world price is only a small factor in the total take of their sugar industries. That is not the case with Australia. We have to look to structures and organisations that take into account the fact that we live on exports and are vulnerable to fluctuating world markets. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to structure ourselves in a way that is readily understood by other countries, that is not opaque or based on entities a very large number of which people think are merely places one visits as a tourist. Other countries do not understand that our federal system gives the States such enormous powers. They expect to be able to deal with our nation in a unitary way. It was clearly understood in the constitutional debates that Australia going into nationhood would require a single, corporate power. Written into our Constitution was the power with regard to trading corporations. It is clear that that power is handed to the Commonwealth Parliament. When we read the constitutional debates we see that that was acknowledged by people in the last century. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has undoubted power with regard to trading corporations. Nobody has disputed that. There is a legitimate dispute on how extensive that power is and whether it covers 100 per cent, 90 per cent or 85 per cent of what needs to be covered. We probably will not know that until the High Court tells us. It is undoubted that prior to 1901 the vast bulk of the area was envisaged as coming under the control of this chamber. This is not a grab for power by the Commonwealth, it is merely assuming the power that has been there and was acknowledged in the early constitutional debates before we became a nation. If we go back and look at those discussions, we see that many were far-sighted. They saw us operating as a nation. I hope that the future progress of this legislation will be viewed in that light. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the report of the Rae committee of 1974. It was presided over by a senator who is now a Minister in the Gray Government in Tasmania-at least he will be till Saturday, if not beyond. I thought that that committee made an excellent contribution to the early debate. I think it is a pity that it was not followed through at that stage. This particular group of Bills might not go forward to fruition and so not be implemented for some reason. We might have an early election and the conservative parties might win, on the basis of today's exercise-though one would have to say that their thrust for power has been thrown aside; there has been a hiccup on the way to the station. If that occurs, I would predict that a future conservative government would very rapidly come to the position where it would want to introduce this structure of legislation. Undoubtedly there are large numbers of reasons why it would want to do that. It is a sensible next step. I would imagine that the Minister for Finance would be Senator Puplick. He would be looking through his accounts and would suddenly discover that the leaching of untold millions of dollars by the States from the business which had been paid for on a user pays principle for a good regulatory system in this country was being used to prop up State budgets. The Treasurer and Finance Minister would soon come to the conclusion that this was no longer on. I am quite sure that the system Senator Hill told us about where we would have a weighted vote for the Commonwealth would very rapidly move, as I said at the beginning of my speech, to 51 per cent so that the Commonwealth could get something done in this area. If those opposite did not do that, I think they would find themselves so far offside with business in a very short number of years that they would be back out of government again. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an imperative behind this legislation. I admit that 1989 might not necessarily make it so sharp that one has to give in to it, but within five years it will be such an overwhelming imperative that whoever is in power would reintroduce this legislation in an almost identical form. I think it is far better for us to introduce it now. There will be some bleeding in the changeover. I believe that we should do it now and get it over with. We want to put this country on a sure and single footing so that people are clear when they deal with any corporation in this land or wish to come into joint ventures with anybody that there is a single piece of legislation to which they can refer. The legislation is clear, and independent of political interference. I think the legislation should be supported by the people who wish to look ahead. I think that it is being supported for all the wrong reasons, but it will be supported eventually. Let us get on with it now. It has the support of all those people in business who can look ahead and see this country as a single nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The package of Bills that we are debating, the corporations legislation, is the largest package of Bills ever introduced into this Parliament. The Bills deal with matters of fundamental importance to the future of this nation because they deal with the whole question of the regulation of the companies and securities industries in Australia and they are, after all, the very lifeblood of our economy and in many ways our society. The speakers list for this debate contains only nine names, including the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray), who will be summing up. I regret that. I think that it is a matter that well and truly warrants a much wider range of speakers. Perhaps in the committee stage we will get a much wider contribution to the debate from members of both sides of the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The major importance of the proposals-which Senator Hill has already said the Opposition will be opposing, with the exception of the Close Corporations Bill-has led the Opposition to adopt the relatively unusual procedure for this chamber of moving an amendment to what I believe is the key Bill; namely, the Australian Securities Commission Bill. The amendment has the effect of totally negativing the proposals contained in that Bill. I very strongly support Senator Hill's amendment to the motion for the second reading. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Leave out all words after `That', insert `The existing co-operative scheme has served Australia well and should be retained with appropriate amendments, to enhance the scheme in the light of experience since its inception and to update and strengthen its national regulatory role'. </PARA>
<PARA>In the words of the amendment there are two or three key aspects which I believe have been completely ignored, deliberately or otherwise, by the Government and by the Australian Democrats, certainly from what Senator Macklin has said today, in their support for the proposals to completely do away with the cooperative arrangements between the Federal, State and Territory governments that have existed and served Australia very well now for almost a decade; to sweep away all that carefully nurtured and developed expertise and cooperation which has occurred, and replace it with a centralist body called the Australian Securities Commission, to replace the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC), and a ministerial council that operates as the linchpin of the cooperative arrangements. The Australian Securities Commission will be centralised and all power, in terms of the regulatory process for the companies and securities of Australia, will be centralised in the Federal Government, in one Minister, the Federal Attorney-General. The power will be essentially centralised in the bureaucracy here in Canberra. That is a quite fundamental change because we will be getting rid of a system which has enabled a very wide ranging input from all State and Territory governments along with the Federal Government over almost a decade now which has had its roots out in the marketplace and in the various States of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> All that will mean in essence so far as the policy making and the advising role is concerned is that it will all be swept away. What we will find, as I said earlier, is a centralised, bureaucratic, Canberra-based organisation. We have seen throughout our history what happens to organisations which, with the best will in the world, start off in that guise. The inevitable result of that is a continuing accretion of power to the Federal Government at the expense of the States, not just in a governmental sense but also in terms of the role the States, the business community as well as the governments play in the affairs of our nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The biggest danger facing Australia as we move towards the end of this century is a building on of what has happened under successive governments but, particularly, under Labor governments throughout our history, that is, a centralisation of power in Canberra. Power does corrupt. We have seen that time and time again. We have seen it in the case of the Rothwells exercise in Western Australia with the Western Australian Government. That corruption within the corporate world has occurred despite the fact that we have had the cooperative arrangements. I accept that point. The point I make from that proposition is that if we centralise the regulation of companies and securities we will greatly increase the scope and prospect of corruption creeping into the regulation of our companies and securities industries. I am sure no-one in this country would regard that in any way other than disastrous. </PARA>
<PARA> Historically, in Australia we can be rightly proud of the lack of corruption in public life. This move, particularly in such a sensitive area as the regulation of companies and securities and all that goes with it, towards abolishing the cooperative arrangements that have served us well over a decade and preceding that period and replacing them with a centralised power is of extreme importance. It poses a great danger for this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Various things said about the proposals are simply not true. The package of 16 Bills was introduced into the House of Representatives in May last year. It was said then by the Government, and it has been said consistently since then, that this legislation was devised, prepared and talked through only after the fullest consultation with interested parties in the private sector. The basis for that statement is that the Government, before it prepared its Bills and as an essential part of the preparation of the Bills, set up a steering committee and consequently a consultative committee of people from the private sector to assist it in its deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Government omits to say is that that steering committee and the consultations that the consultative committee undertook were extremely narrowly based. The Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation, which this Senate in its wisdom set up towards the end of last year to consider the Bills and report on them to it before the debate took place, found time and time again evidence presented to it to the effect that the consultative process had been minimal. Any idea that the Government in reality consulted widely in the preparations of these Bills is an absolute mistruth. Indeed, the body with the most experience and expertise in the whole area of companies and securities regulations in Australia is the existing regulatory body, namely, the National Companies and Securities Commission. Yet the NCSC was not formally consulted and did not engage in any consultation on the details of this package of Bills that was introduced last May until July 1988, two months after the Bills had been introduced into the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The NCSC had no input into the thinking and development of those Bills. In the very valuable evidence it presented to the Joint Select Committee, of which I have had the privilege to be the Deputy Chairman, the NCSC made it quite clear that it had fundamental objections to the contents of the Bills, not just because it was being put out of existence itself, not just because of the centralisation of the scheme and the proposals contained in the Bills, but because it had fundamental objections to many of the details and contents of the Bills, particularly the Corporations Bill which, of course, is the major regulatory Bill of the package. The consultative process was minimal at best. In the response that the Government tabled last Friday to the Joint Select Committee's report there are some statements which are simply not true. The Government says in its response:</PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that most major business groups fully support the implementation of this legislation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That was not the experience of the Joint Select Committee. Indeed, it is correct that the Business Council of Australia, the major big business organisation in Australia, supported the proposals. But the more widely based major business organisation in Australia, the Confederation of Australian Industry, opposed the legislation, as did the organisation that represents small business in Australia. The Law Institute of Victoria opposed the Bills; as did virtually every professional practitioner that appeared before the Committee; and as did the six States and the Northern Territory Government. The six States and the Northern Territory Government are bitterly opposed to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The implication in the Government's response, tabled last seek, to the Joint Select Committee report that there is widespread support for this legislation is simply untrue. The Joint Select Committee received 25 submissions which dealt with the desirability or otherwise of the centralisation of the regulatory arrangements and 17 of those 25 submissions were strongly opposed to the basic thrust of the Government's proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> What we really have here is the fact that the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) has announced his retirement. Lionel Bowen is retiring from the Federal Parliament at the end of this Parliament after a very long and record level of service to Australian Labor Party governments in this country. The Attorney-General desperately wants a memorial to his attorneyship enshrined in this legislation. He tried to do it last year with the four referendum Bills. We all know the fate that befell those referendum Bills. They were rejected, and rightly so, by the Australian public by the largest majority ever recorded against referendums in Australia. The corporations package is his last chance to erect a legislative memorial to his time in Parliament. That is what we are really looking at. That is why we are seeing a grab for power by the Federal Government; an attempt to concentrate in Canberra all these regulatory processes. That is why we are seeing insufficient reasons given for them. That is why we are seeing an obfuscation of the truth in terms of the argument and the reasons for the proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another flaw in the arguments that have been put forward. Senator Macklin fell into this trap, as did many members of the Australian Labor Party and, I must say, the business community. It is being put about that we do not have a national regulatory scheme for companies and securities. That is simply untrue. Since the outset of the cooperative arrangements, we have had a national regulatory scheme in the sense that any decisions taken by the Federal, State and Territory governments in relation to the regulation of companies and securities has to be reflected in Federal legislation, mirrored in the legislation of the States and of the Northern Territory. Whilst it is true that there is no single Act in relation to regulation, the fact is that there are eight Acts that mirror each other in relation to legislation. That is as much a national scheme as is any scheme that is centralised in one piece of legislation passed by one parliament. The contention that we must have the proposals now being introduced by the Government in order to achieve a national scheme is another mistruth that has been put around. </PARA>
<PARA> It is said also that we need the new arrangements because Australia is now part of an increasingly international market, that world markets are becoming increasingly globalised and that there will be problems for Australia in operating in this international and increasingly competitive environment if we do not have a centralised national scheme. Presumably the implication of that is that Australian companies, operating here or abroad, are somehow having problems with regulatory processes under the existing arrangements, but not one skerrick of evidence, not one word was produced to the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation to indicate that that was the case. So the Government has really set up a straw man-its case has no substance at all in reality. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also been arguing that a centralised scheme will somehow make uniform the administration of the regulatory process throughout Australia in a way that does not now exist. That too is incorrect. The Joint Select Committee received virtually no evidence to that effect. It received virtually no evidence that the existing arrangements cause efficiency, delays in administration and in getting necessary approvals from the regulatory authorities and so on. First, there is no evidence to suggest that there are problems now; secondly, the evidence, including that of government witnesses, was overwhelmingly to the effect that the actual administration of the scheme on a day to day basis under the new proposals would be little, if any, different from the administration that exists now. So again a straw man has been set up-a case with no substance at all. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the chamber accept that the cooperative scheme needs improvement. There is no doubt that significant improvements could and should be made in the existing arrangements. We would have no difficulty, for example, in accepting that the chairman of the Ministerial Council should permanently be the Federal Attorney-General. At the moment the position rotates between the Attorneys-General throughout Australia, and there is no particular virtue in that. However, there could well be virtue in having a permanent chairman, and if there were to be a permanent chairman it would be entirely appropriate that the position should be occupied by the Federal Attorney-General. But that is very different from saying that one centralised body is necessary. The whole beauty of the cooperative arrangements, and their underlying and essential strength, is that there is an input from governments around Australia, which are in day to day touch with a much wider range of the community, including the business community, than could conceivably be the case if everything were centralised here. So that is an improvement that could be made. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Hill has said on behalf of the Opposition, we would be prepared to consider giving to the Federal Attorney-General more than just one out of eight equal votes. We would be prepared to consider the Federal Government being given a weighted vote in any arrangements that might be made. We would also be prepared-more than prepared-to see established a parliamentary standing committee on corporations and securities to oversee and monitor the work of the regulatory agency, which, from our point of view, would continue to be the NCSC. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other proposals that could well be considered to strengthen the existing arrangements. But the point to which I cannot refer too often is that it is almost unanimously agreed by all political parties and those in the business community that achieving the desirable strengthening of and changes to the regulatory process does not require the abolition, the sweeping away, of the cooperative arrangements and input role for State and Territory governments and the business community throughout Australia. We do not need to make fundamental structural changes to achieve the desirable changes in detail. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many matters of detail in the 16 Bills that are before the Senate. Of course, only three of those Bills-the Australian Securities Commission Bill 1988, the Corporations Bill 1988 and the Close Corporations Bill 1988-are principal Bills; the other 13 are machinery Bills relating to financial regulations, and so on, associated with the three principal Bills. The Opposition supports the Close Corporations Bill. We do not hold out much hope that that Bill will be a panacea or any great shakes so far as its being snapped up and used by the smaller corporations in Australia is concerned. However it will provide them with an alternative mechanism to go about their incorporation and reporting arrangements, and so on, and there appears to be nothing wrong with the proposal, even if, as would appear likely, it is not going to be used all that much. </PARA>
<PARA> We reject the other two fundamental Bills-the Australian Securities Commission Bill 1988 and the Corporations Bill 1988. We reject the Corporations Bill not so much because of its content, much of which amounts to a sweeping up of the existing codes, supplemented by many changes that the Government has proposed, which we agree are desirable and worth while. As I understand it from the Government's response, it would be prepared to make further amendments based on the Joint Select Committee's report which would further improve the Corporations Bill. We will be voting against the Corporations Bill because it is part of a package which is integrally related to the Australian Securities Commission Bill, which is the Bill of the greatest danger and concern to the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I will leave my further comments until the committee stage of the Bill. I would hope that the committee stage of the Bill would be a very carefully considered process, because there are some very important proposals contained in the details of these Bills-for example, the question of where the power should lie to make declarations of unacceptable conduct on the part of a company. It is a somewhat esoteric question, perhaps, to those who are not directly involved, but in real terms it is a matter of very great substance. There are many other matters of similar importance if we are to have a regulatory system in Australia for corporations and securities which will work efficiently and smoothly in the national interest and, at the same time, meet the needs of the users, the corporations and the securities industry, and also provide the necessary regulation to enable investors in Australia to have confidence that the regulatory processes in this country are right and proper.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to address two of the points made by Senator Macklin in his comments. He seemed to complain that the Joint Select Committee-and, by inference, this Parliament-ought not to have been as concerned as were some of the coalition members of the Committee, and as I hope the Senate will be, about the constitutional validity of the legislation. There are very real doubts indeed as to the constitutional validity of this package. They can only be resolved by putting the Bills to the test in the High Court of Australia. It does not seem to have been worked through as to how that would actually happen. What would appear to be quite certain and unavoidable, though, is that the constitutional doubts about these Bills are such that the testing of them will be a long and protracted process. That, therefore, will lead inevitably to a lengthy period of uncertainty for investment in Australia at the very time when we need the opposite. At a time when we need investor confidence in this country, we are talking about sweeping changes to the structure of the regulatory process which will destroy investor confidence and will not allow it to be restored for a lengthy period because of the legal uncertainties involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I also find it extraordinary that the Government has not put in train any specific transitional arrangements to get us from the present system to the proposed new system. In its response to the Joint Select Committee's report last week, the Government intimated that those transitional arrangements would not be necessary. I find the response we have received to date quite unsatisfactory. I hope, before the debate proceeds too much further, that the Government will be able to give us some clearer and firmer details as to why transitional arrangements will not be necessary. They are matters for consideration at further stages of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat on behalf of the Opposition that we are totally opposed to the abolition of the existing cooperative arrangements for the regulation of companies and securities in Australia. Those arrangements have served us well over many years. Certainly they need improvement and can be improved, but the improvements which need to be made can be made within the existing structural framework. It is a very dangerous thing indeed to accept the Government's proposals that in this vital and very sensitive area we need to centralise all power and policy-making in Canberra. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support this timely and appropriate package of corporations legislation. I had hoped that the Opposition might have reconsidered its position of opposition to this proposal in the light of its change of leadership. I would have thought that perhaps a more progressive view might have prevailed. Unfortunately, today we have heard a reiteration of fairly fundamental conservative arguments. It is fairly standard, in a conservative position such as that, to endeavour to make the obvious obscure and the clear confused and to try in the process to create a climate in which fear of what might occur can be put forward in contrast to rational argument. I found in the course of my service on the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation that the arguments about the national scheme and its merits were, in the broad, with some minor qualifications, quite clear and simple. Some of the obfuscation that was put forward in an endeavour to make the possibility of a national scheme seem somehow threatening, dangerous and subversive was extraordinary and extremist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two separate issues: one is whether we should have a national scheme. The other is whether this would be the appropriate national scheme. Let me address what is perhaps more of a second reading argument, and that is whether we ought to have a national scheme. I also wish to deal with the appropriateness of this particular package. It is interesting to note that it was the unanimous view of another Senate committee that the Senate, as mentioned in that report, should enact comprehensive legislation covering the field currently occupied by the cooperative scheme. That recommendation was made unanimously by a committee, three members of whom of course still sit on the Opposition benches and two of whom are on the front bench. However, they have now changed their minds. They are not saying, to my regret, that they now support a national scheme, as they did two years ago. They are not saying, `The Government has the formula for the national scheme wrong, and we therefore are proposing a series of amendments'. They are saying, in the face of all the evidence, `The cooperative scheme is working wonderfully; let us only tinker with it and keep this flawed model, this antiquated machine'. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept that the cooperative scheme, when it was introduced, was a significant advance in the legislative framework for corporations and securities law in Australia. It was a significant advance, but time has moved on and the legislative framework needs to be modernised to deal not with what was a sound initiative in 1980, but with what is required in the 1990s and beyond. It would have been open for the Opposition to put forward proposals to say, `This is the sort of national scheme which we want'. I have to say that the Opposition members on the Joint Select Committee made some constructive suggestions, some of which are incorporated in the report. Many of the suggestions were unanimous and are now incorporated in the amendments which substantially improve the original legislation. However, Opposition members never, in my view, coped with the fact that they now are trying to concoct an argument which says a national scheme is in some way dangerous. They are very frightened of democracy. It is their view that the people who are elected to govern should not have power because that might in some way lead to a terrible nightmare. Even Senator Short, in his contribution, was forced to acknowledge that of course those things about which he was concerned were matters currently operating under the existing cooperative scheme. The fatal flaw in the Opposition's argument is exposed on any reasonable analysis of its amendment. It says that the existing cooperative scheme has served Australia well. That is arguable but I think it was an advance. The Opposition thinks it should be retained with appropriate amendments which are subsequently being discussed. But the very problem is that the Opposition cannot guarantee that those amendments will ever be carried. The flaw in the cooperative scheme is that it does not matter how progressive, sensible and competent the arguments of the Federal Government or of a State government for a particular piece of business law reform are, we do not have the capacity independently to get that legislation amended and we may wind up with a flawed scheme forever. It is the old problem of the lowest common denominator. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the amendments that the Committee unanimously recommended in the report, which were supported properly by Opposition members, cannot effectively operate under the cooperative scheme. They need a national scheme to operate effectively. The parliamentary committee recommendations and the annual report recommendations cannot operate without proper accountability. Questions have been asked in this chamber during the brief period that I have been a member of it seeking information about the operation of the NCSC, and we have been confronted with the problem that nobody is properly accountable. No Minister is finally accountable for the NCSC, and the Parliament is not able to pursue a Minister in the way that it will be able to when there is a Minister to whom the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) is responsible. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that that was the unanimous view of the Senate Committee, and now we have the position where it is all right to advocate a reform or write a report saying that something is a good idea, but we must not dare do it; we must not act upon the recommendation of that committee for comprehensive legislation covering the field currently occupied by the cooperative scheme. It is all right to write a report about it, because nothing changes. But if somebody actually proposes to act, it is all too terrible to contemplate. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Joint Select Committee recommended, a need does exist for a national scheme to meet developments in international trade and practices. The marketplace is changing and we need to change with it. We want Australian business to have the capacity to operate effectively within Australia and internationally, and it wants a national scheme. The development of a national and more international structure of company and security activities is highlighted by the support given to the Bills by the Business Council of Australia, which we welcome and which is entirely appropriate. We need a single, responsible, political locus of responsibility to give effect to a national priority for effective, efficient and proper administration of companies and securities. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to create a situation in which we can avoid the current problems in conducting companies' activities from one jurisdiction to another in Australia and where business may need to be carried on under different forms of regulation in different States. So the internationalisation of the marketplace and the rate of change that is going on in the marketplace require a capacity to respond more quickly to those changes, a capacity for one government to act and to be responsible for its actions, rather than have a shadow of a cooperative scheme behind which it can hide and say that it is not its responsibility. It needs to establish accountability. It should not be frightened of democracy; it should build in some checks and balances as this proposal does. First of all there is the fundamental question of accountability to the Parliament and, second, the question of the proposed Joint Standing Committee on Companies and Securities, which is an entirely appropriate initiative. It was not a proposal that I, or so far as I know the Labor Party, initiated. However, it is an entirely appropriate initiative and a unanimous recommendation of the Committee. The interstate nature of business does require a substantial reform of business regulation legislation, and this is one example of that. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall move now to the changes that have been made to the Bill by the Joint Select Committee. I shall not deal with them in detail. That is appropriate for the committee stage when we will be dealing with various amendments that the Government is initiating. I wish to talk broadly about the principles that they address, why I think they enhance the Bill and why I support them and their philosophical content. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, there is the whole question of the introduction of the panel. I thought the argument for that was encapsulated by the very impressive witness who was commented upon and quoted at length in the report. He was the Sydney lawyer, Mr Green, who said it was true that the panel was a bit of an innovation and that it was possible to see arguments for and against it, but that it was worth a try because, if it worked, it would be a very cost efficient, quick and respected mechanism for making declarations of unacceptable conduct. I think he is entirely right. </PARA>
<PARA> There is the question of the balance between regulation and deregulation. The Bill is enhanced by the changes made to it in response to the report of the Joint Select Committee, and I congratulate the Government for its speedy and positive response to those recommendations. There is a need to strike a balance between investor protection and an efficient market. That is what the Bill is trying to do. It weighs a number of important questions. It has changed the balance. I think the legislation is excessively regulatory in protecting people from things that they did not need to fear, impairing efficiency in the process. It is also important to recognise that this is not a typical market. It is not a market in which one finds the lower to middle income players, who would be consumers in a normal marketplace. If what was being exchanged was bread and cheese there would be entirely different players in the market. It is not like the labour market. It is very skewed towards the upper income groups and the big players. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, it does typify the reason for the need for the regulation of markets. It comes down in this instance to the question of unequal access and unequal financial resources-although that of itself is not a case for it. Considering the various aspects in which either the regulation which currently exists is sustained, and which I understand is supported by the Opposition because it supports the retention of the existing scheme, or where it is enhanced in the proposed Bill in response to the Joint Select Committee's report, there are areas in which there is unequal access to information. That is quite evident in the financial market from day to day, even though financial reporting is of a very high standard. Often in Australia people can get access to that information before it is published or can get information in addition to that which is published. Financial resources give unequal access to adequate professional advice and of course there is unequal distribution of power and influence-the capacity to influence the market and the capacity to influence decisions that are made. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to some of the other principles in and improvements to the Bill that have been made in response to the Committee. Some of those principles to which I wish to refer include transparency, efficiency and-I just referred to this-the balance between protection and efficiency. The Committee has improved the Bill, I think, by making more transparent the way in which the ASC and/or the Minister act; providing protection against any possibility of inappropriately political interference by requiring the tabling of ministerial directions, which is a fairly standard requirement in most pieces of legislation and which is appropriate to be introduced here; specifying the criteria for the annual report, which will mean that annually there will be a mechanism effectively to review the operation of the ASC; and establishing the Joint Parliamentary Committee. Those things, together with the pre-existing requirements, create an adequate transparency and an appropriate one. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of efficiency, we have the proposal adopted from the Committee report for establishing a full time president with some interlocutory powers. There are reforms with regard to the operation and management of what were previously defined as dormant companies. I am very pleased to see the adoption of a number of initiatives consistent with the profits of crime approach which the Government has taken in other areas, so that people operating insider trading or in the marketplace without appropriate licences cannot profit from so doing. </PARA>
<PARA> I compliment my colleague Senator Alston for the initiative he took in some of those areas on the Committee. This was an example of the bipartisan operation of the Committee in questions of detail which significantly enhance this Bill, even though there were serious disagreements of principle about whether the Bill should proceed. Of course, I strongly disagree with the minority report on that matter, and I am pleased to see that on present indications the Bill will proceed and receive majority support in this House and in the House of Representatives. I accept that members of the Opposition, particularly Senator Alston, took initiatives which substantially improved the Bill. I hope I have not done his political career too much damage at this crucial time by giving him that endorsement. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also appropriate that the Bill, in its amended form, clarify the power of the ASC to publish recommendations which it might make to the panel about unacceptable conduct. I am not sure that there was ever any doubt that it had that power but, if there was, it is appropriate that it be clarified. The report raises that matter, and the Government adopts its recommendation. Similarly, with regard to the powers of the ASC to engage in commercial settlements to bring about satisfactory conclusions to investigations where it is concerned about the proper operation of the market-a power which has been effectively used by the NCSC on a number of occasions, and about which there was concern that it might not be available to the ASC-the Government reviewed the matter and in its response to the Joint Select Committee's report establishes, at least to my satisfaction and I think to the satisfaction of most, that that power exists. </PARA>
<PARA> There is the additional question of the balance between protection and efficiency. It is a very difficult balance, as I said previously. We have the extension of pre-vetting of prospectuses and the reintroduction of the pre-vetting part A statements for takeovers. There has been a bit of exaggeration about the extent to which the pre-vetting of prospectuses was changed by the Bill from the existing practice and the extent to which it is changed back in response to the Committee's report. Nevertheless, it is appropriate that that extent of pre-vetting should be modified in the way that the Bill, in its final form, proposes. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the Government and the Joint Standing Committee will want to monitor that matter to see whether the balance which has been struck in response to the Committee's report is appropriate and whether a more deregulatory thrust as was originally imposed in the Bill, or a more regulatory thrust as in the existing Act, is more appropriate. I think that on the evidence available the balance being struck is the best that could be struck, but this is a controversial matter and needs to be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally controversial is the question of the pre-vetting of part A statements with regard to takeovers. Those who undertake a close scrutiny of the report of the Joint Select Committee, who I suspect will be very few, will find that I had some reservations about the majority report-by eight of the 10 members of the Committee-that part A statements should be pre-vetted. I would prefer that that were not the case. Eight of the 10 members disagreed with me. The Government has accepted that majority view. I say: let us give it a try. I accept that that is the majority and prevailing view. I accept that the majority might be right, but I would certainly say that it is a matter that requires close monitoring. In my view, two or three years down the track-five years, because I do not want to see this legislation changed too often-the reform proposed in the original Bill will be reintroduced, and I will be pleased to support it at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> There was controversy on the Committee concerning the respective roles of the panel and the ASC concerning declarations of unacceptable conduct and whether the Securities Commission itself, in addition to its investigatory powers, should have power actually to make a declaration of unacceptable conduct or whether it should simply have power to make a recommendation to a panel which would finally adjudicate. I was in the minority view on that matter. I supported the existing proposal, which is retained in the Bill as it now stands, that there should be a separation of those responsibilities. I am very pleased that the Government has accepted that minority view. It is interesting for people to note the bipartisan nature of that division; people from different parties were on both sides of the divide. It is a difficult issue and I believe the Government has taken the appropriate course. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also appropriate to try the recommendations of the Committee for the protection of small shareholders in the compulsory acquisition of shares in the mopping-up at the end of a takeover bid. I know there is concern amongst members of the Government that this is an unnecessary restriction. It may prove to be so, but it is appropriate when moving into a new area of regulation that we are conservative in such matters. We should take the more modest course and review its activities to see the consequences of the alternative structures, and act accordingly in a review conducted by the Advisory Committee and the joint parliamentary committee, which will inevitably take place from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> There are reforms of companies and securities legislation which still remain to be done. Three were referred to specifically in the Committee's report and they are important. However, it was not appropriate to try to do everything in one swag of reforms. It is clear that the Government's predominant view was that the establishment of a national scheme should have priority, and the breaking of new ground in the area of reform should wait for more considered legislation in a context in which the national Parliament will have the capacity so to legislate, because there will be a national legislative framework. </PARA>
<PARA> The three areas I particularly want to refer to, although not in any detail, are the areas of insider trading, insolvency and shield of the Crown. In all those areas action is under way-on insider trading, by the House of Representatives committee; on insolvency, in the consideration of the report previously brought down; and, on shield of the Crown, in the examination by the Senate Standing committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> For all those reasons, in this second reading debate, without dealing in detail with some of the amendments which will come up in the committee stage about which I may wish to make further detailed comment, I support the Bill. This Bill is a further step forward from the cooperative scheme, which in itself was a step forward. It reflects the structure of companies and the the nature of corporate activity, the changes within them, and the changes that seem reasonably likely to occur. As those changes take place corporate law needs to change, and this is an appropriate and timely reform. I support the package of legislation and look forward to its speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this opportunity to speak on what is certainly a very important package of legislation. Despite the fact that the Opposition disagrees with the ultimate position adopted by the Government in pursuing a national companies scheme, it is fair to say that the work undertaken by the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation was of great value in identifying a number of important areas for reform. Ultimately the effectiveness of that work in the daily commercial operations of the market will be a reflection of the very assiduous work undertaken by the members of the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to commence by saying that I certainly appreciated the opportunity to serve on the Committee. I appreciated the cut and thrust of the many non-partisan discussions that Senator McMullan has mentioned. I certainly thought that between us we were able to identify a number of areas for improvement. However, in respect of the fundamental need for a national companies scheme, I think that a lot of propaganda has been put around to justify what I think is ultimately a quite dangerous course of events. One of the virtues of the cooperative scheme was that there was a diffusion of responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> I noted that Senator McMullan talked about accountability, and I suppose that, in one sense, this could be a sophisticated rerun of arguments about centralism because, quite clearly, one wants to know where power resides. But, in an area as sensitive as this, where there is a great capacity for people to intervene, improperly at times, and where the stakes are enormously high, there are overwhelming temptations to bring political pressures to bear. We saw that in relation to the Rothwells matter where the Commonwealth Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Bowen, declined to intervene on the spurious basis that it was a matter for the Western Australian State Government-although he well knew that a State election was imminent and, of course, nothing was done until afterwards. We know also that, because the National Companies and Securities Commission does not have an office in Western Australia, its delegate was the local Corporate Affairs Commission, and that there were certainly instances of even the Chairman of the NCSC being prevailed upon not to disclose the name of Mr Laurie Connell, to approve the rescue package without publicising all the details, and in many ways, I think, to provide preferential treatment to one who would have been best brought undone much earlier. That should ring alarm bells for us because it means that we should be vigilant in the extreme. If there are virtues deriving from having a cooperative scheme with a diffusion of power and responsibility, then that may well be a very important safeguard. But what is proposed by the Government in this centralised scheme is effectively a concentration of power which will enable both the Attorney-General's Department and ultimately the Commonwealth Attorney-General to exercise what could well be unhealthy influence. </PARA>
<PARA> I noted that Senator McMullan and others have said that transparency now derives from the fact that one can require the tabling of a ministerial direction. But I am sure that we are all aware that influence can be brought to bear in many subtle ways, and certainly where it is possible for a Minister to give a formal direction it is equally possible for him to indicate in advance that that is his intention, and in such a situation it is not hard to envisage that people might well back off. Certainly, I think that is a matter for concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the way in which commercial settlements have been achieved in a number of instances leaves a lot to be desired. I am one who is less inclined to favour plea bargaining in this area. I think there is a very significant demonstration effect, and ultimately a deterrent, when corporate players know that the watchdog has the necessary powers and is prepared to exercise them. But if the NCSC is starved of funds and is under great pressure not to waste money on expensive litigation, the temptation for it to seek to achieve a so-called commercial settlement can often be at the expense of either a conviction or an investigation being taken to its proper conclusion. The Bell-Bond-State Government Insurance Corporation (SGIC) saga was probably the classic example of that. The difficulties were compounded by the fact that the shield of the Crown hovered like a sword of Damocles over all of the litigants and ultimately was able to be exercised to the benefit of not only the SGIC but also the Bond Corporation itself. I think one can say that there were very good grounds for suspecting that if the shield of the Crown had not been a factor, the NCSC may well have gone much further than its tentative view that Bond and the SGIC had been guilty of unacceptable conduct. Nonetheless, I think it is necessary to have that ultimate power to achieve a commercial settlement, and we should support the recommendation of the Committee that any obstacles that might inhibit that should be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the panel system, I must say that, as I understand it, at present the Government is accepting the minority report which proposes that there be a separation between the Australian Securities Commission (ASC), as the investigator, and the panel as the adjudicator. As one with some legal training, I am very much aware of the need to achieve that separation of powers; it can indeed be an overwhelming temptation at times for an over-zealous prosecutor to seek to intimidate those whom the prosecutor believes have been guilty of some wrongdoing. In many ways it is a fundamentally important part of the legal process to have this separation of powers-to have a safety valve and not simply a regulator which is able to threaten that its preliminary view will be confirmed by itself unless certain action is taken. </PARA>
<PARA> The concept of natural justice is certainly very fashionable these days, but the essential ingredients of the principles of natural justice are that one has a right to be heard, and to be heard by a tribunal free of bias. It is very difficult, where the prosecutor is the judge and jury, for a litigant to get a fair hearing. I think there is a very real danger-although there is not very much evidence of it to date-that where the NCSC or its successor body is out to make its mark and where it believes there has been some reprehensible conduct, it will in effect use its powers in terrorem and will seek to achieve commercial settlements and various other arrangements that should not properly be its province but should ultimately be decided upon by an independent body such as the panel. For my part, I must say that I am still attracted to the virtues of a panel that is separate and distinct from the investigating body. </PARA>
<PARA> There was some considerable concern and constitutional doubt about the legitimacy of the Commonwealth approach. As time went by, the legal opinion of Sir Maurice Byers assumed the status of holy writ, and there were very few who were prepared seriously to take issue with it. In fact, it was very late in the day that the Committee received a submission from the Law Institute of Victoria which I thought raised some very serious doubts about matters which went to the heart of the opinion. For example, the question of whether a company is a trading corporation or a financial corporation needs to be determined on a case by case basis. Byers himself concedes that the ambit of `companies' would not extend to recreational, scientific, educational or charitable companies, and clearly there would be doubts surrounding listed companies which were merely holding companies. Similarly, there would be other unincorporated associations, building societies and friendly societies which would not be susceptible to even this extended definition of the corporations power. So the notion that somehow a national scheme will encompass all of these bodies is quite misguided. The fact is that there will continue to be a need for State legislation to regulate the activities of a whole range of corporate and semi-corporate bodies and, of course, there will need to be transitional arrangements to ensure that those that are properly amenable are dealt with fairly. There is a conspicuous absence in the legislation of any such transitional provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> As I think I said earlier, we have heard quite a deal of hyperbole. I recall Senator Macklin claiming that the principal justification for this national approach what that, as the Business Council of Australia would argue, it is unrealistic to have a cooperative scheme when we are aspiring to operate in an international business environment. In the evidence before us we did not come across any examples of Australian corporations that experienced difficulties in the international arena as a result of any failings in the cooperative scheme. Certainly Elders might complain about the United Kingdom Monopolies Commission or Bond might blame a range of other factors but no-one at any stage suggested that our ability to operate internationally is impeded by the form of companies and securities legislation in this country. So the minority on the Committee found talk of that type of internationalisation of the financial community as essentially sloganistic and misleading in this context. We all recognise the need to have an international and export-oriented approach, but that is not the same thing as saying that we need to have national companies legislation. In many ways that proposition is a red herring. </PARA>
<PARA> The second major argument that is often advanced to justify a national scheme is that it is necessary to have accountability to parliament and to ensure that there is direct responsibility for the action of regulators and others. The Committee did not have provided to it any examples of actual or proposed changes in Commonwealth power which were necessary in that regard. Indeed, I do not think one can really point to any examples of why parliaments currently are not fulfilling their role. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of constitutional traditionalists, I think, who express concerns that somehow the Parliament is being frozen out of the process, but I think that is a little precious. The primary concern should be whether the community at large is agitated about the speed of the process, about the accountability and administration of companies and securities law. We simply did not get any submissions that expressed concern on that basis. It was really a lawyer's point. I do not think that is sufficient reason for saying that somehow the ability of the Commonwealth is non-existent and that the States are rubber stamps. The Ministerial Council constitutes a diffusion of responsibility. If it wants to seek amendments to the legislation then it must bring them before both Commonwealth and State parliament. In that instance I think there is the capacity for legislative intervention and, ultimately, parliamentary supervision. </PARA>
<PARA> The notion of a joint standing committee on corporations is very valuable. It predates Senator Macklin's recommendation, as I recall it. I do not know whether it goes back to the Rae Committee, but I seem to have read about that suggestion some years back. Nonetheless, it was well picked up by Senator Macklin. It will go a long way towards allaying some of the concerns people might have about the way in which the Ministerial Council might have operated in the past or the way in which the Department or the Minister might operate in the future. There will be opportunities to voice concerns without too great a period of delay because, after all, time is often of the essence in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The third area of supposed justification for having a national scheme was that somehow there is currently administrative duplication and general inefficiency. I thought that concern was greatly overstated. The examples that were given to us were essentially trivial. Again, I could not see how it could be said that the efficient operations of companies and securities law in this country is currently impeded. </PARA>
<PARA> In this day and age, with fax machines able to operate around the world and certainly interstate, there is no reason why people cannot get all that they require from the State corporate affairs commissions. Certainly, with a computerisation of their corporate data bases there should not be any difficulties in obtaining all the information that might be required by way of company and business name searches. Again, I think that concern was overstated. Since these were, I thought, tendentious propositions that did not really address the way in which the system operates at the moment, taking the range of submissions into account I think one could say that by and large the system works pretty well. </PARA>
<PARA> I will say a few words about takeovers. I find myself in a minority of two with Senator McMullan in respect of the requirement for the prevetting of takeover documents. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Richardson" NAMEID="4E4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I presume that Senator Richardson is an expert in this field. It depends on what one regards as important. At the moment all we are concerned about is corporations. The discussion about the virtues or prevetting was very interesting. It is probably a classic case of the Government going to water. It has a number of analogies in the current drive for micro-economic reform where the Government holds itself out as the big deregulator but where all it is doing is reregulating. We will be debating the telecommunications Bill shortly-a classic example of setting up a structure that has all sorts of unnecessary licensing provisions and regulatory arrangements, all designed to protect Telecom's monopoly rather than to promote competition. I think it comes through again very much here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's initial proposal was that there was no need for prevetting in relation to either prospectuses or takeover documents, simply because there is a capacity in others to do the work that is currently done by administrative officials. I ended up thinking that there was something to be said for an independent review of prospectus documents. Quite often there are fly by night operators who do not operate under the same constraints as publicly listed companies which might engage in takeover operations and which want to be around for the next game. </PARA>
<PARA> Prospectuses are in a slightly different position. People can make overblown claims in the hope of making a quick quid and disappearing. So there is a justification for retaining prevetting in that area, but when it comes to takeover documents the Government started out with the right approach, and that was that the target company is the one that is perfectly equipped to find fault with the part A statement. If it is motivated to dispute the matter it will take it to court. It should have the carriage of the action and it should decide the extent to which it wants to disagree with it. But there should ultimately be an ability in the regulator, in this instance, I suppose, the ASC, to intervene if necessary in the public interest. If minority shareholders' rights are not being protected then clearly there is a need for a watchdog to intervene. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is no need at all in my view for it to be necessary to have every document scrutinised. All that does is give lawyers a parachute ultimately to pass the buck but still charge vast amounts of money. I think that is unnecessary. It does not really add much to the process. It certainly slows matters down a bit because someone else has to plough through the document, and as with all bureaucrats there is often an irresistible temptation to justify one's existence by coming up with some matters that need attention. Ultimately, as I say, it is regrettable that the Government went to water on this issue because it involves a bit of intestinal fortitude to throw the matter open and to remove the shackles. Ultimately, I suppose the Government was afraid that one mistake might be made and someone would squeal that there should have been government supervision. That then becomes the justification for doing it in every instance. That is the height of inefficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> I will say a few more words on shield of the crown, which I think is still a very important issue. I am very pleased that Senator Cooney's committee, the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, will be investigating it. In an era of increasingly commercial activities by government business enterprises it becomes imperative when they get into the marketplace and engage in takeovers, joint ventures and other commercial operations that they be subject to the same benefits and disbenefits as other players. That is manifestly not the case at present. The Government has a strange reluctance to do anything about it. Certainly the States have been paranoid about any suggestions of removing the shield and, hopefully, when the Senate Committee has had the opportunity to demonstrate why there does need to be reform in the area, the Government will be prepared to bite the bullet. But I am sure that it will have to be driven to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Ultimately, therefore, I conclude by saying that I think there are quite a number of areas where sensible reform can be achieved, where an enhanced cooperative scheme can be made to work even better and to accommodate the concerns of not just State administrations but State corporations that have voiced very real objections. The opportunity was there for the Government to have accommodated all those concerns, but instead it chose to adopt this centralist approach. Whether it is a monument to the Attorney-General or simply a desire to accumulate more power in the hands of a Minister or a department we will never know, but the end result I think is one that is unnecessary. It may well throw up some very real concerns about concentration of power and influence. I think it is certainly unnecessary on the evidence before the Committee. I join with my Opposition colleagues in opposing the Government amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Proposals to establish a national companies and securities scheme I suppose go back 20 years or more. They really resulted from the fact that the company laws in Australia had traditionally been those of the States. Of course, there were a lot of differences between them. The first movement occurred in an endeavour to obtain-sometimes successfully-a uniform companies law. That coincided with the very major changes in securities markets in Australia. They were becoming far more national. When Australia was hit with a stock market boom at the end of the 1960s, a great many tensions evolved as a result of which the Senate set up the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange. The Committee took several years to investigate the stock markets, their operation and the adequacy of the laws of Australia, and that resulted in the recommendation for a national watchdog to sit above the existing administration of company and securities laws. Changes in the law were not finalised as a result of the defeat of the Whitlam Government. The Attorney-General introduced national companies law but that was never even debated in the Senate; it went off to a committee and the Government lost office before anything further was done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That was the background to the establishment of the present regulation of companies, securities and stock markets known as the cooperative scheme. That scheme established the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC), which is the national watchdog envisaged by the report of that Senate Committee. However, the scheme is a much more elaborate one than that because it sought to marry the attempts at uniform company law throughout Australia thereby obtaining the benefits of a national law, while leaving the major administration of company laws with the State governments, which had developed what was known then as companies offices but which I think are now called corporate affairs commissions. They sat, as I said, above them all, gaining more experience, with greater influence coming from the National Companies and Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> For eight or nine years we have had a scheme in Australia for the regulation of companies, securities and stock markets that has worked, I believe, reasonably well. There has certainly been some criticisms of it and many have been misinformed. Some of the criticisms made by the present Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) in the proposals that he has now brought into this Parliament, and which we are debating in this Senate, are very strange indeed. The Attorney-General, referring in his second reading speech to the establishment of the present scheme, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The then Federal Government-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Fraser Government-</PARA>
<PARA>was more intent on leaving State governments with control of companies and securities within their jurisdiction than it was with meeting the needs of the wider Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an entirely false and misleading statement about what the reasons for the cooperative scheme were. As I have already indicated, there is a long history of State regulation of companies and securities and of State laws on the subject. There was in place well experienced State administration, but there were certain deficiencies; namely there was not a national watchdog, and the scheme provided for that, and there were, and still are, very serious doubts as to whether the Commonwealth Parliament can cover the field of companies and securities law. To characterise what the Fraser Government did in this way I believe is not only offensive, but also quite untrue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General has also endeavoured to make a case that the operation of the scheme has been deficient and that it has not been able to meet the challenges of recent years. I suppose he is referring to the very firm establishment of a national market which was clearly in place 20-odd years ago; it is not something that has happened in recent years. He also seems to have found some reason why Australia's markets are not able to satisfy the needs of its international position. That argument has been well and truly dealt with by the previous speaker, Senator Alston, and by the minority report of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation which is also available for us to debate this evening. Certainly there is no evidence to suggest that Australia's regulation of companies and securities is in any way impeding the operation of our participation in the international markets in this arena, and that should be laid aside as a reason of any substance. It may be that it could be described as deficient in some respects but those deficiencies could be rectified within the current structure of the scheme. There was a rather amusing comment in the second reading speech of the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), who represents the Attorney-General in the Senate, where he said:</PARA>
<PARA>There has been community concern that markets have been manipulated. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Attorney-General believes that his scheme or any scheme will prevent some market manipulation, he has either a great deal of optimism or he has access to some greater wisdom than he reveals in anything he said or in the legislation he has brought forward. Certainly market manipulation was one longstanding problem in the period of which I have been speaking. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Companies and Securities Commission was set up to provide a national response by way of its investigatory powers that would result in prosecutions. That, of course, will be an ongoing problem. Indeed, it is one of the major reasons why there has been so much concern about the operation of the new Australian Securities Commission proposed by this legislation. There will always be problems in this area and we must have laws to deal with them. </PARA>
<PARA> The other argument of the Attorney-General seems to refer to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs which in 1987 reported on the role of the Parliament in the national companies scheme. According to the Attorney-General, the Committee concluded that the scheme had outlived its usefulness. That was about the third Senate committee which had looked at these matters. It reported critically on the lack of what it perceived as ministerial accountability to this Parliament in respect of the cooperative scheme. As its name implies, that scheme set up a council comprising the Commonwealth Minister, whoever he happens to be-it is the Attorney-General at the moment; it has been other Ministers in the past-the State Ministers, and the Northern Territory Minister responsible for this area of the law. This ministerial council, the body which has the responsibility for the oversight of this scheme, is the body to which the National Companies and Securities Commission is responsible. It also is the body which recommends any changes in the law which are required. It does not administer the scheme in detail because that is done, as I have said, by the Corporate Affairs Commissions of the States. But it is certainly an unusual and unique form of providing accountability. The agreements which set the council up place an obligation on the Commonwealth Government to give effect to the decisions of the Ministerial Council in the form of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The only laws which are needed to amend the scheme are laws of this Parliament which are introduced after they have been approved by the Ministerial Council. As I said, this means that there is a grave weakening of ministerial responsibility under this scheme. Clearly there are problems associated with the question of ministerial responsibility and the power of Parliament in relation to it. In my view-it is a view which I have expressed on several occasions in recent years in this chamber-those problems are not in any way insurmountable. They certainly do not justify throwing out a scheme which has a great many benefits simply because it presents problems of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA> On 16 November 1983 I made a speech in the Senate on the Companies and Securities Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 1983 which was one of the early Bills that were brought in. I think it was the first major Bill to amend in detail the scheme after various pieces of legislation had been passed over previous years to bring it into operation. The Minister in charge of that Bill said that, as all the amendments had been approved by the Ministerial Council following wide consultation, therefore this Parliament must pass it. He said that we could not amend it and that if we rejected it we would be rejecting the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> That was an old standby that had been used by State Ministers when the uniform schemes were in operation. State parliaments were told that they could not really change in any way and certainly could not reject Bills to give effect to amendments to the uniform scheme. It is simply not true that that takes away the responsibility of this Parliament for passing the legislation. If the worst came to the worst and the Parliament amended it in a way which was unacceptable to the Ministerial Council or, indeed, rejected legislation proposed by it, that would not necessarily spell and end to the scheme. It undoubtedly would be a problem which would have to be faced. As I said in my speech on that occasion in the course of the committee stage of that Bill, the benefits of the scheme were so considerable that the States would certainly be most reluctant to abandon it simply because there was a difference of opinion between this Parliament and the Ministerial Council. I have no doubt that if faced with a situation like that further negotiations would occur in order to save this scheme and also give effect to at least some of the views of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, in essence I do not believe that this scheme necessarily involves, by any means, an abrogation of ministerial responsibility or the powers of Parliament. I put that aside as a good reason for abandon- ing the present scheme simply because it has difficulties in the way of the smooth operation of the principles of ministerial responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The great merit of the existing scheme is the doubt about the powers of this Parliament to cover the field. They are set out in the Constitution which gives the Parliament powers to make laws with respect to:</PARA>
<PARA> (xx) Foreign corporations, and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth:</PARA>
<PARA>It is well known that there are various forms of corporations which may not be trading corporations or financial corporations. Questions arise as to whether the Commonwealth's powers extend that far. Clearly holding companies have always been an example where there could be doubts as to the ambit of the Commonwealth's power. When one looks at the wording of this power of the Commonwealth, it refers to such corporations `formed within the limits of the Commonwealth'. There has always been a doubt as to whether that means that such corporations can in fact be formed by a Commonwealth law or whether they can apply only to those companies that have already been formed under some other law, whether a foreign law or a law of a State of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Maurice Byers, on whom the Government relies so solidly and who impressed so much the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, believes that the High Court of Australia would overcome those difficulties. But he has indicated that there are some areas that would not be able to be covered, namely, companies which were formed for recreational purposes, or scientific, educational or charitable purposes. Sir Maurice Byers recognises that the constitutional power is deficient at least to that extent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner, I was referring to the doubts and problems that arise under Commonwealth power in relation to this area. Those doubts were fundamental to the decision to enter into the cooperative scheme. To recapitulate in that regard, I point out that the cooperative scheme provided constitutional certainty about its operation. That has never been challenged and it is unlikely it ever would be challenged because it was very carefully planned to cope with this fundamental problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The scheme has enabled all the powers of the Commonwealth and the States to be utilised. In that regard, it has provided a certain basis for the scheme and has also delivered a uniform law. That uniform law has been able not only to sweep up the traditional areas of companies and securities, but also to bring within its ambit a whole lot of matters which are described in legal jargon as `prescribed interests', which I do not intend to go into. A good example of that is the futures industry. Futures interests, whatever they may be, are certainly not shares in companies. They cannot be brought within that concept of company law. They have now been brought under the cooperative scheme because of the growth of futures markets, both national and international. Attempts are being made to bring them under this new scheme; they may succeed. At least it can be said they have to be brought under this present scheme in an artificial way. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the existing cooperative scheme there has been certainty, a most important consideration-perhaps the most important consideration for the business community. It is very interesting to note that despite initial support by the business community for the concept of this national scheme, business interests and their professional advisers deserted the scheme in droves once they realised uncertainty would be created. I do not have time to quote the number of people who have commented on this. Probably the most telling remarks of all are those put forward by Mr John Green, a Sydney corporate lawyer. His views are quoted in the dissenting report of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation. On page 200 of the report of the Committee he is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>If I can deal first with the Bowen plan, I must say that I regret that his radical, but I believe well conceived, plan for Australia's corporate regulation has gone off the rails . . . If the Bowen plan means that the new federal laws are brought in with State opposition I would, I must say, withdraw my support for it . . . If some sensible compromise is not reached between the Commonwealth and the States and the Bowen plan becomes law I fear that corporate Australia will be besieged by what I believe will be an era of greater uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition to the benefits that I have mentioned, the cooperative scheme has provided in the National Companies and Securities Commission a most invaluable corporate watchdog. It was established under the leadership of a very distinguished Australian, a lawyer of the highest ethical and legal standing in Melbourne, Mr Leigh Masel, who gave it a magnificent start. The standards he set have been followed under the leadership of Mr Bosch. Although the NCSC may have made a slow start and lots of legal problems had to be overcome in such a field, as time has gone on it has certainly developed greater expertise and authority. The NCSC is now widely accepted in Australia as a body which can be trusted as the national corporate watchdog and one which can tackle those manifold problems that have been presented. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth benefit delivered by the co- operative scheme was decentralised administration. All the proponents of national laws on this subject seem to overlook the fact that the vast majority of companies in Australia are small, mostly private companies, which operate within one State. They are not national companies. There is a very great distinction indeed between the national market in which the big players operate and that in which the small companies operate. Despite the so-called limitations of the cooperative scheme, big companies are operating more and more in international markets. Overwhelmingly, company law administration is dealing with small companies. We do not want national administration for this vast majority of companies in Australia; we do not want them to have to deal with the administrative minutiae that are involved in that exercise. The existing scheme is very well suited to decentralised administration; I fear that decentralised administration will be lost under a national scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Coming back to the question of the national markets, I point out that under the existing scheme the best possible proof of the way in which it has developed as a national body is the fact that in recent years the stock exchanges of Australia have themselves formed a national stock exchange. In recent years, the face of the stockmarket in Australia has changed out of all recognition. It has done so under the aegis of the existing scheme. That is the picture that we have. Then we have this legislation foisting this scheme on the Australian business community and the large numbers of people who are concerned with its successful operations. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be legal uncertainty and constitutional challenges which may or may not clarify the situation. A test case will have to be set up early because the States will not lie down and accept this scheme just because it has been passed by this Parliament. Even if we can have some test case, which will be very difficult to mount, there will still be constitutional uncertainties and areas which cannot be controlled by this Parliament, as Sir Maurice Byers himself has pointed out. Therefore, there will always be the need for some State laws in this area. There will be a need for cooperation between the Commonwealth and the States, no matter how wide the High Court may grant Commonwealth power, and that is very much in doubt. </PARA>
<PARA> Without continuing the NCSC, the Government is to set up a new Australian Securities Commission which is to be not only a national watchdog, but also the one national regulatory body. It will do all the work that has been done by the NCSC and the State Corporate Affairs Commissions. If it succeeds-and it has the power to-it will be concerned with all that administrative detail. It will not provide decentralised administration, even if the States were cooperative which, by all accounts, they will not be. The Government will have only the same sort of decentralised administration it has under other purely Commonwealth bodies such as the Australian Taxation Office, the Social Security Appeals Tribunals and so on. We will lose that great benefit that the existing scheme has had in decentralised administration. That is really what the State issue is about. It is not about money-the Commonwealth has already offered them monetary compensation, but they still have not been bought off. They have not been bought off because they are responding to their own constituents who want to have ready access, in their own cities, to advice. They want ready access to the negotiating position the professional advisers are able to give in the administration of this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I come back to the question of ministerial responsibility. Although, as I have admitted, there are some difficulties about that, they can largely be overcome-in the first place, by the establishment of the parliamentary committee. That notable recommendation of the Joint Committee has been accepted by the Government. I am very pleased about that, and I congratulate the Government. It is something that I have advocated in the Senate since 1983, and it has been adopted by the Opposition as policy since 1984. A very important way of overcoming the difficulty in the existing scheme would be to have a parliamentary body which would become expert in this area, and to which the Ministerial Council would ultimately have to justify its recommendations for new laws. Another way in which the difficulties could be overcome would be for the Commonwealth to assume the permanent chairmanship of the Ministerial Council. I am sure that the States would be prepared to agree to that. </PARA>
<PARA> So there are ways of overcoming the difficulties in the present scheme. In my view-and I am pleased that the view of the Opposition is the same-it is far better to overcome the difficulties and deficiencies in the present scheme that can be overcome than to embark upon the very grave doubts, indeed the lottery, that we would be embarking upon if Parliament were to agree to this new scheme. For those reasons I am opposed to the legislation, and I trust the Senate will reject it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition's opposition to this package of Corporations Bills is based on its view that they are not constitutionally viable. I understand that the Opposition is happy with the rest of the issues that are before the Senate. In other words, the general thrust of the legislation, so far as the Opposition is concerned, is good. Honourable senators opposite say simply that it should be left to the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities, that the Ministerial Council has all the wisdom in the world, that there is nothing wrong with it, that it is a group of reasonable men and women who go round interested in only one thing: cooperation and getting ahead with administering the corporate sector of this community-a most important sector indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was all very interesting when the Senate Select Committee on Corporations Legislation that looked into this Bill was going round Australia and talking to all sorts of people. It was accompanied by Mr Brian O'Callaghan, who is in the chamber at the moment. He gave the Committee considerable help. We discussed the issue of cooperation with various Attorneys-General. During those discussions the Attorney-General for South Australia, Mr Sumner, and the Attorney-General for Victoria, Mr McCutcheon, said that the cooperative system could be, and should be, maintained on the basis of more power being given to the Commonwealth, and that if the Commonwealth could not come to an agreement with the States on such issues as mergers and takeovers, the Commonwealth would prevail-but only after discussions with the general Ministerial Council. That seemed a very reasonable proposition. Indeed, some of us on the Committee thought that perhaps it was the way we ought to go. If we had had Senator Durack's assurance that all these men-I think that they are all men-are reasonable people, perhaps that is the way we could have gone. </PARA>
<PARA> But what happened? When this suggestion was put to the Attorney-General of New South Wales he moved back several feet, metaphorically speaking, and said, `No, we can't have that sort of movement'. Anyone looking at the track record on this issue will see that the sorts of agreements that one might want for a perfect, or near perfect, system are lacking, and one does not get the sort of agreement that has been lauded so much today by honourable senators opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> This reminds me very much of how the Co-operative Scheme Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 comes before us. It is a very thick Bill indeed, going to 160 pages. Of course, legislation which should have been passed long ago was forthcoming only when the threat of Federal legislation was seen. In other words, the Co-operative Scheme Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 finds its way into this chamber in the context of the Commonwealth wanting to move and, as I will indicate later, move properly to bring some better sense and some better effect to the law governing corporations in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what has happened with the Ministerial Council and at what happens with the States. There is reason for concern that the cooperative scheme would not have worked as well as it has been suggested today it would have worked in the past. Indeed, when the Senate Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs considered the role of parliament in relation to national companies schemes, that Committee, which began its work in 1986, was very ably-indeed brilliantly-chaired by Senator Michael Tate and then by Senator Bolkus. It had before it evidence about the cooperative scheme. Criticism of the cooperative scheme came from the then chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange Ltd, Mr Ian Roach, who said this:</PARA>
<PARA>There is only one market for securities in Australia and it is part of the global market . . . it is essential that we pool our resources and one united stock exchange . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, that has happened: there is one stock exchange in Australia, operating in all States. Mr Henry Bosch, Chairman of the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC), had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>1985-86 saw a number of striking developments. Perhaps the most remarkable were the steps towards the internationalisation of the financial community. Links between stock markets and futures markets were created and strengthened, Australian shares and financial instruments were traded in increasing volumes on foreign markets. Many financial institutions established or developed branches or connexions overseas. Flows of information and funds have become almost instantaneous and financial markets are becoming increasing interdependent. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Robert Gardini, who represented the Confederation of Australian Industry, tabled letters before the Committee. One of those commented:</PARA>
<PARA>It would be accepted that the regulation of companies whose business transcends State borders can only be satisfactorily achieved through Commonwealth legislation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There are other quotes to that effect. The reality is that times have moved, technology has moved, and the stock market has moved. It is now not only national but international, and it is proper that the Government which represents Australia in the international field-the Commonwealth Government-has the carriage of the legislation which will affect the law governing corporations. Indeed, that is hardly a new idea. The Opposition has come into this chamber and said, `Look, this mad move towards Commonwealth legislation is all revolutionary'. What is the situation? One should go back to the National Australasian Convention debates, between the founding fathers, which took place in Sydney from 2 March to 9 April 1891 and look at the contribution by Mr Munro on 3 April 1891. When talking about the suggested words to be put into the Constitution, which read `the status in the Commonwealth of foreign corporations and of corporations formed in any State or part of the Commonwealth', he said this:</PARA>
<PARA>We have agreed to subclause 13, dealing with the incorporation of banks, and I do not see why a similar provision should not be made in regard to the incorporation of companies. Why should they not be under control of federal offices? At the present time the law as to incorporation is different in different colonies, and the result is extremely unsatisfactory in many cases. I do not see why we should not make the same provision in regard to the incorporation of companies as we have made in regard to the incorporation of banks. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement was made 98 years ago. Unfortunately, the Opposition seems to be living back then-or even before then, because if it had been living 98 years ago it would have seen the merit of Mr Munro's statements. So it must have been living at a time prior to that; well over 100 years ago. Sir Samuel Griffith, a great jurist, cavilled at that a bit. He said he did not think that the suggestion put forward by the previous speaker, Mr Munro, should be accepted in its full sense. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think we should. There are a great number of different corporations. For instance, there are municipal, trading, and charitable corporations, and these are all incorporated in different ways according to the law obtaining in the different states. </PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA>What is important, however, is that there should be a uniform law for the recognition of corporations. </PARA>
<PARA>Sir John Bray went on in the same debate to say:</PARA>
<PARA>If it is desirable to entrust legislation as to the incorporation of banks to the federal government, there is no reason why we should not say that the registration of financial companies doing all the business of banks should be dealt with in the same manner. </PARA>
<PARA>There are a few things arising out of that. One is that it was certainly in the thoughts of the founding fathers of the Commonwealth that companies should be dealt with. They certainly expressed the desire 98 years ago that there should be uniform laws. The period of 98 years since then has shown more and more just how sensible our founding fathers were. However, when an attempt is made to incorporate into the legislation a Bill which will solve the problems they were talking about then there is great opposition. As I understand the Opposition's proposition, it is really that this Bill has been put forward, as Senator Short has said, for the sole reason of giving some sort of memorial to the Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Bowen. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will tell the Senate why he has adorned the office. He has struggled hard to bring about much-needed reform in this country. Let me explain that. A country moves with its history and history produces needs as it goes along. Great governments and great Ministers seek to meet those needs. The Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Bowen, has seen the needs-and his vision will be borne out as time goes by-and has moved to meet them. I have no doubt that if this package of Bills is defeated, similar ones will be back before this Parliament within a fairly short span of years. They will go through unanimously, because with the development of world trade, with the development of electronic gadgetry, with the need for laws to be made quickly and to be changed quickly at times, there is a need for a decisive government to be at the centre of these things and the Federal Government is the appropriate one for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is much talks about the difficulty to be faced before the High Court of Australia. People say, `Look, because there might be a challenge to the High Court, we ought to abandon any scheme to regulate companies properly'. If that were the situation, we may as well give the federal system away. We ought to at least have a centralised government or go back to six or seven separate countries, or colonies. Of course there will be disputes before the High Court. That is exactly what the founding fathers envisaged. That is why they set up chapter 3 of the Constitution. That is why they set up a system of law. That is why they set up the judicature. That is why the Judiciary Act has been passed, to provide a mechanism whereby the issues arising between States and between the States and the Commonwealth can be resolved. After all, it is not the most frightful thing in the world to go before the High Court. If one went up to the library and saw the number of volumes that learned judges have filled over the years, one would see that many a person and many a government on many an occasion have gone before the High Court and come out alive. Therefore, to simply say that there are going to be High Court challenges seems not to meet the point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course it would be difficult to give physical birth to a statute and its commentaries of that size. But size is not what counts. Whether it is a Commonwealth or a cooperative scheme, there will still be the same amount of paper to carry around. The Commonwealth scheme is in volume 1 of the CCH and, of course, CCH has published more than one volume on company law. We have to go beyond the fact that this legislation is an alleged monument to the Attorney-General and that it is big. No matter what happens, the legislation will be big and we must get down to the question of who is to run the scheme. It may be a tremendous idea to have a parliamentary committee to oversee the future development of company law, but what effect will a parliamentary committee have on the Ministerial Council? We can have either a Ministerial Council and no effective parliamentary committee or an effective parliamentary committee with the legislation on companies being put through one parliament, namely, the Federal Parliament. It would have been a more democratic way of going about things to have it before the Federal Parliament because in reality, with the corporate scheme, there is no way that any parliamentarian-and we are all parliamentarians here except Senator Tate, who is a member of the Executive and likely to remain so for a long time-will have a say. If Senator Bishop wants to have a say in this legislation as a parliamentarian, she had best vote for this Bill because she will not get that ability through the cooperative scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The founding fathers contemplated that the Commonwealth would play a central role in company law. Later there was a decision of the High Court of Australia at the time of the reserve powers doctrine which unfortunately put back the development of this area for some time until the Rocla Pipes case in which the High Court repudiated what had gone before and helped lead on to the present situation. In my view, the legislation is worthy of passage through this Parliament. It should be passed. The difficulties that arise in terms of uncertainty or in terms of disputes that have to be resolved by the High Court become peripheral when balanced against what will be gained. The central point is that we will have very good legislation to help the corporate sector develop along with Australia's economic development in future. If we are to be a vibrant and vigorous economic entity we need a vibrant and vigorous corporate sector, and we are more likely to have that and have it in greater abundance under this scheme than under the cooperative scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the report of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legis- lation and to the setting up of a panel which will have the power to make declarations of unacceptable conduct. At present that is done by the NCSC. Under the Bill, the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) will have the ability to collect evidence and having collected it to put it before the panel. The majority of the Committee, on a casting vote, said that the ASC should also have the ability, in addition to collecting evidence the panel and to its other powers, to make declarations. I heard Senator Alston speak on this subject and I agree with him that matters of propriety, civil liberties and tradition require that the investigative and the prosecuting functions be separated out from the judging function. It is appropriate that I quote the Vice-Chancellor, Sir Knight Bruce, in Pearse v. Pearse when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Truth, like all other good things, may be loved unwisely-may be pursued too keenly, may cost too much. </PARA>
<PARA>The submission made, I think by the NCSC, that the proposed ASC should have the power to make a declaration failed to take note of the warning given by the Vice-Chancellor on that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> I say finally that a good deal of the material that is in the Bill came from the report of the Senate Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. It is good to see that recommendations from reports by parliamentary committees do at times find their way into legislation. Some of the recommendations were: the use of plain English, and there has been an attempt to do that in this Bill; that comprehensive Commonwealth legislation be enacted and that has happened; and that the administration of company law be looked at, and that has also been done in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that this Bill ought to be passed. If it is not passed now it certainly will be passed in similar form in the future. As I understand the Opposition's approach, the constitutional power is its one major objection to the legislation. If it were constitutional and if it were appropriate for the Commonwealth to administer it, it would, in the opinion of the Opposition, be good legislation. All that is stopping its passage is this very timid approach to constitutional power. In those circumstances, it is a pity that a little more courage could not be shown to allow this very important legislation to be enacted so that the economy of this country and the administration of the corporate sector which is so essential to it could go from strength to strength. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In his final words, Senator Cooney said that it was all a matter of lack of courage to seize the constitutional issues and to run with them as the Government is purporting to do. The fact is that it is not a matter of courage but a matter of principle, and the Opposition is opposed in principle to the seizing of centralised power in the corporations area to the detriment of the operations of business in the States. Let us look at the history of how this great pile of documents was born-some 3,000 pages to be digested, interpreted and argued before the courts over a long period of years before they have any final and definitive meaning. Senator Cooney said that he wanted a vibrant and vigorous business section. He will not get a vibrant and vigorous business section if it is laden down with many legal problems. Despite the fact that they may well be said to be a growth industry for the lawyers, these Bills certainly do not assist in making business vibrant and vigorous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, let us take a look at the history of what this huge pile of paper, which looks as though forests may have died for it, has gone through. First of all, it was introduced into the other place on the last sitting day of the autumn session last year. It is the largest piece of legislation ever to come into Parliament since Federation. As I said before, there are some 3,000 pages. Debate occurred in the other place on 28 September last year. The Government introduced 280 amendments. The Opposition received a copy of those only the night before. It was then necessary to refer the matter to a committee to sort out the mess, and that committee's report was tabled last month. Consultation with the business sector has been deplorable. Indeed, after those 280 amendments went through the House of Representatives, the Government refused to reprint the amended Bills because it would have cost $40,000 to do so. So, this highly complicated legislation was left in an amended and bitty state to be dealt with-even consumed-by the business community. </PARA>
<PARA> This week, all of a sudden, the legislation is back in the Senate. This time there are another 87 amendments, which we received only in the last two days. Does that augur well for a good understanding and digesting of what is in these enormous tomes? What is the thrust behind the urgency for these Bills to present themselves, as a matter of some haste, in this chamber for debate again? It certainly does seem that it is part of this Government's own secret agenda to centralise power more and more. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned the referendums by way of interjection for two reasons. First was the thrust of the referendums-which, again, would have centralised power in Canberra-and, second, these Bills come with the same aim. Certainly the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) would have liked to have left this place with these Bills as his memorial, saying, `These are the great achievements that I have introduced and been successful in getting through the place.' Not so, and not to be so. The referendums, finally, after real grassroots politicking, were rejected outright by the electorate. It was the most massive defeat of any referendums in Australia's history. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, these Bills are relevant to the referendums for another reason which is that the main opinion that was relied upon by the Government in pushing its referendums case was that of Sir Maurice Byers. The Bills before this chamber tonight are here very much as a result of an opinion of Sir Maurice Byers. Sir Maurice has been a distinguished lawyer. He has now entered into the political arena. He is now acting as a politician, no longer as the lawyer. During one of the referendums debates that went on for some time the Attorney-General, when we were discussing the defence of government schools (DOGS) case said, `Let us hear from Sir Maurice Byers. He knows all about that, and the definite way that the High Court may or may not interpret that.' I said, `But, of course, Sir Maurice has been known to be wrong.' Gough Whitlam said, `Name me a case.' So I did. He said, `That is only one case. Name me another.' So I did. Those cases were the Collector of Customs v. Brian Lawlov Automotives Pty Ltd, and Clunies-Ross v. the Commonwealth. On each occasion, we see that the Government has chosen to rely on the opinion of a well-respected lawyer; but, like all other lawyers, he is right only sometimes. </PARA>
<PARA> The referendums having failed, we now see these Bills back on the table. Little does it matter to the Government that all State and Territory governments oppose these Bills. Little does it matter to the Government that it could only find a single, big business voice to give it any backing, and that was in the early stages. The majority of people in the business sector reject the Bills outright. The Law Council of Australia rejected the legislation outright and said very simply:</PARA>
<PARA>The Law Council supports the principle of uniformity of law and administration in this field, but it is concerned about certain aspects of the present proposals. A basic concern is the doubt that exists as to the constitutional power of the Commonwealth to cover all the classes of corporations that need to be covered. </PARA>
<PARA>It stated later:</PARA>
<PARA>Some corporations which are at present governed by the State Acts will fall outside those categories. </PARA>
<PARA>Even if the powers are upheld. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>This means that there will continue to be a need for State legislation to deal with those corporations. The prospect of co-existing Commonwealth and State legislation on corporations is a daunting one. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, there would need to be many cases fought before the courts before any certainty of meaning was achieved. The letter from the Law Council that was put out at the end of the last year went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it would be irresponsible for the Commonwealth to legislate on the basis of its existing constitutional powers. The Commonwealth should not legislate unless and until the Constitution has been appropriately amended, for example, in the manner recommended by the Advisory Committee to the Constitutional Commission at page 137 of its report ``Trade and National Economic Management''. </PARA>
<PARA>Was that one of the referendum proposals that this Government sought to put before the people? Certainly not! Why not? If the constitutional powers that it purports to rely upon fail, how does the Government think that it will still get this package through? There is a way, of course. If one looks at the way in which these Bills have been couched, one will find that should the heads of power that it purports to rely upon fail, of course, there is always the external affairs power. Should we have the necessary agreement between New Zealand and Australia, following up the harmonisation of regulations between the two countries pursuant to closer economic relations, and we have a treaty, guess what? These Bills could come in under that head of power. The Government has quite deliberately taken the route of being prepared to test the corporations power, and other powers set out in section 51, but in the event that that fails there is always the external affairs power. How typical of this Government to find this power which is so convenient to circumvent the Constitution itself. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to consider what the implications for the States and Territories are and how they perceive those to be. First of all, there is a loss of ability to influence policy. That would be a plus for a centralist government, but it is not a plus for those who believe in federalism. There would be a loss of ability to promote local business development. If I might return to those referendums, when I traverse the States of Australia, particularly Western Australia, I understand the hostility felt towards those dreaded people who live in the east, particularly those who live in Canberra. I understand also the sense of frustration that people feel that their individual rights to carry on business in their States is being directed by a bunch of people whom they never see. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, possible Commonwealth control of statutory or government corporations as well as credit unions and building societies is a concern for the States themselves. The States were so concerned that they sought a joint opinion from the Solicitors-General to comment on the scope of the Commonwealth power relied upon and to point out the difficulties, as their best legal advice could do, which would mean an impediment to the passage of these Bills. They did not deal with the external affairs power because at that stage it had not become evident that that was a reality. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the opinion of the State and Territory Solicitors-General, the following three points were important: firstly, the Commonwealth clearly cannot rely upon its corporations power to legislate in respect of corporations which are not trading or financial corporations; secondly, there is doubt as to whether the Commonwealth can rely upon its corporations power to legislate with respect to the non-business activities of trading or financial corporations; and, thirdly, those parts of the existing scheme relating to incorporation, internal regulation and trading in company shares are probably not within the Commonwealth's power. </PARA>
<PARA> There were also doubts as to the applicability of the Commonwealth's power to prescribe interest schemes, trusts, non-trading holding companies, and for the regulation of certain parts of the securities and futures industries. The Solicitors-General believe that no scheme could operate effectively which did not cover the interrelated matter of incorporation, internal regulation and trading in company shares. The Solicitors-General believe that there is a reasonable prospect that the High Court will conclude that the corporations power of the Commonwealth does not and should not extend to these matters, and that a dual regulatory system would need to be set up in each jurisdiction with the State or Territory concerned enacting complementary legislation and establishing administrative structures. As I said, the opinion that does not agree with that of the Solicitor-General is that of Sir Maurice Byers, QC. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Gerry Peacocke, who is the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs in the Greiner Government in New South Wales, said in a speech dealing with this question at the end of last year that he believed the issues dealing with this matter fell into four categories. Firstly, there were the political concerns; secondly, the legal aspects; thirdly, the implications for the States; and, fourthly, the reform proposals for the cooperative scheme. On those political realities he said:</PARA>
<PARA>As has most often been the case when the Hawke Government wants reform, it has been initiated from within the Government to meet its own agenda rather than overcoming any real problem which may exist as a result of the operation of the current system. </PARA>
<PARA>The simple reality is that this legislation is, again, Government driven. It is not designed to meet a need as perceived by the business sector, but rather to meet the Government's own internal agenda. The Liberal Party, in its policy, has said that it supports very strongly the cooperative scheme as it exists, but notes, of course, that it has impediments; that there is need for reform. Not only does it acknowledge that but it has definite policies to deal with it-but in consultation with the States. I return to Mr Peacocke's address. Mr Peacocke set out very strongly the opinion of the Solicitors-General, as I set out a little earlier, and said further that they were concerned that the High Court was becoming increasingly centralist in its philosophy and is more likely to permit the Commonwealth to take over most of the companies and securities field now than it was in the 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA> Fairly recently in this place we had a conference on regulations and ordinances-dealing with delegated legislation. In a most erudite paper that was given at that conference there was quite a deal of discussion dealing with the lawmaking powers of the High Court and its tendency to become more radical in the exercise of that function. </PARA>
<PARA> From a States point of view, areas in which it is believed improvements could be made to the current scheme include: the introduction of procedures to enable the Commonwealth to play a larger role in the formation and amendment of legislation; the appointment of the Commonwealth Attorney-General as the permanent Chairman of the Ministerial Council and to make the National Companies and Securities Commission directly responsible to him; the establishment of a management committee, comprising the heads of the State and Territory commissions and representatives of the NCSC and the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department, collectively to determine, for the approval of the Ministerial Council, the respective roles of the NCSC and its delegates; and common objectives and strategies for the scheme as well as issues such as priority allocation and resource utilisation. </PARA>

Our fundamental decisions, and one with which I certainly agree, is that the current scheme, which has many of its aspects settled, known and certain, is by far the preferable route to travel than the adoption of this enormous set of proposals encompassed in the legislation before us.

<PARA> The spectre of a wholly national companies scheme is of fundamental importance and consequence to business in this country. It is of fundamental importance to our economy and it is of fundamental importance to everyone in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are discussing a package of Bills, and the key aspect of this package, of course, is the Australian Securities Commission Bill. We in the Opposition oppose this Bill because it is unnecessary and, of course, unwanted. It destroys an effective, federalist, cooperative scheme for no good purpose except to advance the centralist ideology of the Australian Labor Party and provide an ego trip for a fading politician. It is well understood that, as many of my colleagues have said in this debate, the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen), before he retires from Parliament, wants to leave some legislative memorial behind him. Of course, this is his final attempt, as he was none too successful, as we all know, in changing the Constitution in last year's referenda. Given the expense of that exercise, and the far greater damage that this Bill would do to the business regulation in Australia, we would all do better to build him a statue beside Lake Burley Griffin or something of that nature, because it would be a darned site cheaper to the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill is not wanted by the State governments, which were not properly consulted prior to its introduction but, of course, that begs the question: Who was? Of course, the second reading speech to this Bill really reflects what this Government feels about State governments. I quote from that speech:</PARA>
<PARA>The then Federal Government was more intent on leaving State Governments with control of companies and securities within their jurisdiction than it was with meeting the needs of the wider Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister says that rather derogatorily of previous coalition governments, and how dreadful it would be to have State rights. As we all know, that is what this is partly about. The Labor Attorney-General of South Australia has affirmed support for the uniformity achieved under the present federalist scheme and has supported the opposition of the local business community to this new scheme. The New South Wales Consumer Affairs Minister has spoken of `the need in a democratic country for checks and balances in all that we do'-despite any supposed advantages that larger States might expect to gain from centralisation. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill has absolutely no support whatsoever in my State of Western Australia among business and professional groups. It is opposed by the Western Australian Branches of the Institute of Directors and the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Law Society of Western Australia, the Confederation of Western Australian Industry, the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Chamber of Mines of Western Australia, the Western Australian Council of Trustee Companies Association and the Perth members of the stock exchange. I do not think there could possibly be a more comprehensive list of those who are opposed to this Bill and yet once again we see tonight, as we see so often, that no Western Australian Labor senators are supporting their constituents in this proposal. The more detail that has emerged regarding this legislation, the less support it has received. But this Government simply does not want to know about that. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently the Government has attempted to bulldoze this legislation through the Senate because it does not want the public to be made aware of what it is trying to do yet again. Last July the Confederation of Australian Industry-the ultimate representative, I might add, of 100,000 Australian businesses-withdrew its earlier support and informed the recent committee of inquiry that reform should be effected within the current structure. But that has also been ignored by this Government. It is only the representatives of the big corporations who have supported a Federal Government takeover. It is the very large firms that have the resources to deal directly with the Federal Government bureaucracy. Once more we have a clear example of this Labor Government caring only for the major firms. Leaping into bed with big business and the unions is the daily practice. Australians, unfortunately, are learning the hard way that there is a big difference between a government that is pro-business enterprise and one that is corporatist. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an excellent rule of thumb, which fortunately for those in the Government is disregarded by the Labor Party, that unless it is necessary to change, it is necessary not to change. The Hawke Labor Government must prove that the cooperative scheme for the regulation of companies and securities in place since 1979 has somehow failed and needs to be replaced. The reasons advanced have all been shown to be spurious and misleading. The Government has done nothing to show that there is any change needed or requested. </PARA>
<PARA> It is claimed that a centralised scheme is essential to enable Australia to compete in an international arena. The Government, however, consistently fails to point to any firm that has been disadvantaged in any way in its international dealings on account of the current scheme. It simply cannot give chapter and verse as to any of the practical difficulties that are purported to be inherent in this legislation. It is a falsehood to talk about the need for a national scheme of regulation as a euphemism for a Federal takeover. There could be nothing more truly national than the regulation of business law through a ministerial council of all Australian parliaments. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of accountability is another notable red herring, with the Ministerial Council being supposedly less answerable to the Parliament. In effect, according to this reasoning, the cooperative system is wrong because it restricts the ability of the Federal Parliament to amend it. Again, we have to ask what necessary changes have been frustrated. No necessary changes have been frustrated. That, yet again, is a figment of the imagination of this Labor Government. It is also highly likely that this Parliament could so legislate, just as it is the right of any State to withdraw from the scheme. Rather, evidence is increasing that the diffusion of power for present regulation is positively healthy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is highly unlikely that the Ministerial Council will ever reflect the views of only one side of politics. The system provides a guarantee against ill-conceived change made for party political reasons so that company law would be subject to passing political whims. How easy it would be for this, or any other Labor government for that matter, to pass anti-business legislation to keep the Left of the Australian Council of Trade Unions happy. How the Australian Democrats would love to further their insane hatred of our major corporations through legislative grandstanding. I think it is a great shame that in this day and age we are seeing political parties that are simply so narrow-minded that they will not concede that what they are attempting to do is wrong and unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent months we had a taste of likely political manipulation of the regulatory system by this Labor Government when the Attorney-General himself failed to exercise his power to order a special investigation of the Rothwells Ltd collapse prior to the Western Australian State election. If that is not party political intervention of the highest order, what is? Were it not for the need to proceed in agreement with the Ministerial Council we might wonder if any information would have seen the light of day. Only last week we saw the interim report on Rothwells showing what a disaster that whole episode has been and how much the Western Australian Labor Government had been involved in spending taxpayers' money. A single government and parliament simply cannot be trusted to have full control of the regulation of business in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The third argument for change is the allegation that the federalist system produces administrative duplication and inefficiency. This is a well tried criticism of any federal institutional system. However, unfortunately for the critics we still live under a federal system, with the express approval of the voting public. If the Government needs to be reminded of that, it should think back only as far as last year. </PARA>
<PARA> The only major criticism of current arrangements is being rectified by the computerisation of the public corporate database. Indeed, the 1987 report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs that recommended change admitted that `the scheme performs remarkably well'. In 1989 the Labor Government is saying that the scheme no longer works remarkably well, but it has failed to explain either to us in the Parliament or to the electorate why it is no longer working remarkably well. In any case, clause 102 (4) (c) allows for the local administration of legislation so that in a purely administrative sense there may not be change, invalidating the Government's own argument. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly it would be hard to find any desire for a Federal takeover in Western Australia, where 90 per cent of companies registered with the State Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) do not trade interstate and where $10m on company registration accounts is contributed to State revenue. Yet we have a Federal Labor Government which is trying to impose its whims and wishes on a State that does not want a bar of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Western Australian Corporate Affairs Commission has built up a most valuable local expertise in a State where oil and mining are of such significance. It has provided the essential service of prompt rulings and decisions, backed by local knowledge, in a very personal manner. Any moves towards a centralised bureaucracy that cannot provide equality of service to a smaller and remote State, imposing additional costs and a basic instability are, in my opinion, to be deplored. The statement of the Acting Commissioner of the Western Australian CAC quoted in the dissenting report of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation is an eloquent testimony as to the efficiency of the cooperative scheme. This Government cannot refute the statement of Mr O'Connor that such major changes as the growth of the futures industry and the greater internationalisation of business have been successfully accommodated under the present system. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government in its arrogance-there is no other word for it than `arrogance'-chooses to ignore the argument of the Law Institute of Victoria that true uniformity of companies and securities law can be maintained only through a cooperative scheme because of the real legal doubts and problems occasioned by unilateral Commonwealth action. Without the continued cooperation of the States the legal certainty that now exists in companies and securities-and, I might add, that is so essential to business life-will simply disappear. How any government in its right mind, with sane thinking people who do not have an ulterior motive, could possibly propose that absolutely bewilders me. This brings into focus the greatest weakness of the Hon. Lionel Bowen's corporate law takeover-its dubious legality. We heard Senator Hill only this evening talk about that dubious legality. The Federal Government has based its right to legislate on a legal opinion by Sir Maurice Byers. We heard Senator Tate interject earlier tonight that he was a most efficient and effective member of the legal profession. I grant that; I grant that he has a distinguished legal record-I would be silly if I did not-but he is not the repository of all legal wisdom, and the Government would be even more silly to believe that he was. Moreover, he is a committed centralist who, in the wake of the rejection of the referenda last September, demanded that the Federal Government keep trying to impose centralist solutions to our economic difficulties. That is simply not the answer, yet this is the opinion of Sir Maurice Byers on which so much weight has been placed. </PARA>
<PARA> However, last August the Law Council of Australia expressed real doubt as to whether the Commonwealth had the power to cover all classes of corporation that need to come within an effective regulatory system. According to section 51 (xx) of the Constitution, as the relevant Commonwealth power is confined to foreign corporations, and trading or financial corporations fall within the limits of the Commonwealth, some corporations will inevitably fall outside this definition. There will be a need for complementary State legislation, which will not be easy to achieve after the Federal Government has acted in this unilateral and irresponsible manner, and uniformity will be all but impossible to achieve. There could be endless litigation as to whether particular corporations were covered by Federal or State legislation, quite apart from the general likelihood of a High Court challenge to the validity of this Bill. Whatever the final outcome of such a challenge, business would be in for a very long period of uncertainty. I do not believe that that is in the best interests of this country or in the best interests of the States. It is a measure of the shallowness of this Government that its 1,200 pages of legislation and its 280 amendments railroaded through the House of Representatives last year after a few hours' notice to the Opposition-which I might add was tried again today-do not provide for effective transitional arrangements. Business will be left to pay the bill and that is just unacceptable. I am left wondering why the Government continues to railroad these packages through and tries to bluff the Opposition at every turn, particularly when the legislation is of such importance to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Law Council has warned this Government that it would be irresponsible to legislate without amending the Constitution. This Government dares not proceed to such an amendment when the Australian people have shown exactly what they think of centralist constitutional vandalism. However, legal uncertainty is but one disastrous effect of this Bill. I have already touched upon the danger of centralising companies and securities regulations under one source of political power. That course of action cannot be trusted. </PARA>
<PARA> On a more mundane but equally important level the new Australian Securities Commission (ASC) would suffer the defects of an essentially bureaucratic organisation controlled by the Attorney-General's Department. Business would encounter a decision-making body slow to react because of its removal from the realities of the marketplace, unlike the present National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) and the State CACs. The ASC will be staffed under the Public Service Act, which I suppose could be described as a formula for atrophy. There are solid grounds for believing that despite its centralised authority the ASC will be a far less effective corporate watchdog than the present NCSC. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most dishonest actions of this Labor Government throughout this whole exercise is the claim that the NCSC is not up to the job, having forced it to operate, I might add, on a shoestring budget of $6m, with the effect that talented staff continually and rapidly disappeared into the private sector. The fact that its staff numbers are now to be increased is, I hope, at least a recognition of previous neglect. Nevertheless, the NCSC has played a most vigorous role to the limits of its resources in exposing the antics of corporate spivs who may just happen to be good mates of some Labor politicians. No wonder powerful sections of the Labor Party resent Mr Bosch's use of the media and would love to see him replaced by a faceless bureaucrat. We should take very seriously the claim of Mr Bosch on 2 February this year that `this is a Bill for a weaker watchdog' and that `the present Commission is regarded as too powerful and a positive attempt has been made in this Bill to convert a powerful and independent watchdog into a lap dog of the Attorney-General's Department'. Is it any wonder that the Government does not want to see Mr Bosch there when he is saying things of that nature? Confidence among investors will not be strengthened by the loss of expertise that will occur through the replacement of the NCSC and the downgrading of State CACs. Any responsible government would simply increase the resources of the NCSC to enable it to recruit able professional staff to oversee Australian corporate activity. More realistic fees, as highlighted in the minority report of the Select Committee, would provide greater financial resources through the user pays principle. </PARA>
<PARA> In opposing this Bill, I do not suggest that it is in any way the view of the Opposition that all aspects of the present cooperative regulatory system are perfect. Many reforms may be desirable-I emphasise the word `may'-and changes will always need to be made to adapt to different realities, but do we need to be a bull at a gate and make changes for change's sake as opposed to making changes for necessity? I should probably say: should we be making changes for the Attorney-General's sake and the sake of the ideology of the Labor Party in terms of going to an election within the foreseeable future, or making a change for necessity? What is clear, however, is that these reforms can be made through the present cooperative mechanism, whereby at the end of the day complete national uniformity and certainty can be guaranteed. </PARA>
<PARA> One area that requires the most careful examination and change is crown immunity. That is now so open to abuse as statutory bodies, such as the Western Australian State Government Insurance Commission, intervene in the corporate sector to an unhealthy degree. Private business has been given an undesirable incentive to involve crown instrumentalities in their dealings to avoid proper regulatory scrutiny. It would be too much to expect this Labor Government to turn its energies to genuine reform in place of expensive legislative centralism. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is not about reform or better administration but about the centralisation of political power. It simply will not benefit the great majority of Australian businesses and in time will add greatly to their costs. I support wholeheartedly the Opposition amendment, which proposes:</PARA>
<PARA> Leave out all words after `That', insert `the existing co-operative scheme has served Australia well and should be retained with appropriate amendments, to enhance the scheme in the light of experience since its inception and to update and strengthen its national regulatory role'. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill ought to be rejected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I sat here listening to Senator Knowles and I did not interrupt. I expect that in that spirit she will do the same. What we are presented with today is a plan that has been discussed not only in the last few months but in the last few years. It is a plan for an adequate response by government in Australia to the needs of corporate regulation in this country. It is a plan that was mooted initially a number of years ago. It is a plan which conceptually was agreed to by a unanimous report of the Senate in 1987. Members of all parties in the Senate came together and agreed that conceptually the best way to approach the whole system of corporate regulation in this country was to take a national approach to it. That is precisely what this Government is doing with this legislation now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Any reflection on the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) on a personal level or on a political level is a very shallow one; it is a very inadequate one; it is a poor one. Those who make such a suggestion know it to be so. They know that what drives the person behind this legislation is the fact that we in Australia and in particular the Attorney-General recognise that for us to be able to compete now and in the future we must approach this particular regulatory problem on a national level. </PARA>
<PARA> The old scheme has not worked. It is undisputed that it has not worked. The Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs unanimously agreed that it did not work. People in the corporate sector and in the regulatory sector all agree that the old scheme did not work. Once again on this side of the Parliament a Minister has been prepared to seize upon the issue, to tackle it and to give the Australian community a response that we require. We are no longer dealing with the horse and buggy days of corporate regulation. We are not dealing with six minor economies spread across this country. We are dealing with the demands of national economic planning. That, together with the demands of international competitiveness, means that what we should have in this country is a system of regulation which can respond very quickly and adequately to those demands. What we have at the moment does not do that at all. </PARA>
<PARA> In the deliberations of the Senate Committee in 1987 it became abundantly clear that the existing system of the cooperative scheme was inefficient in terms of meeting the demands of the modern economy in an international financial framework. As I said, the Senate Committee unanimously concluded that the cooperative scheme had outlived its usefulness and that the Commonwealth should assume total responsibility in this area. There were some fundamental defects. We on that Committee recognised that they were there. We on that Committee recognised that the current scheme had outgrown its present phase. We also recognised that some of the problems were insoluble. </PARA>
<PARA> For the Opposition to come before us today with a proposal that says that we need to improve the current cooperative scheme by, for instance, giving the Commonwealth a weighted vote just shows how out of touch the Opposition is. It just does not see that the inherent flaws in the system cannot be met with this sort of proposal. Even the person who gave birth to this proposal, the former chairperson of the Ministerial Council, recognised that such a proposal was dead. </PARA>
<PARA> All this proposal does-I am sorry to say that it reflects very badly on the shadow spokesman in this place, Senator Hill-is underscore the fact that those on the other side are totally irrelevant to the mainstream economic and regulatory debate in this country. The problem is not faced on the Government side by an ideological or political response as has been suggested by other speakers. It has been recognised across the board, both in business and in politics, that the current scheme is inadequate. Even Mr Tony Hartnell, a former Acting Chairman of the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission who was appointed by the Greiner Government to oversee the operation of that Commission, has called for the abolition of the cooperative scheme and the introduction of Commonwealth legislation. Even Mr Bosch, who is now revered by those on the other side, in his submission to the previous Senate Committee which I chaired, recognised that there were problems in the current scheme that were insurmountable. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the major problems put to the Committee and one of the major problems that no enhancement of the cooperative scheme can address is the administrative inefficiency and inconsistencies between States in Australia. We can have one law but we can never guarantee that administratively it will be applied in the same way. That evidence came before us time and time again. It is that sort of evidence that those on the other side insist on ignoring when approaching this particular resolution to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a national economy. We have national markets. We have a security market which no longer operates as a separate State based market. Individual stock exchanges have now formed into one Australian stock exchange. Company operations no longer end at State borders. Yet all these particular parts of the corporate sector are being asked to comply with laws that are being differently administered in each State. What does this do? It imposes unnecessary burdens on business. In my area of consumer affairs alone I quite often get calls from people in the corporate sector who say, `Look, we're one national economy but we've got to comply with six different approaches. Can't the Federal Government do something about it?'. Using this approach we are actually doing something about it. I do not dwell on the point that no longer do we have a national market but rather a market with international dimensions. Those sorts of dimensions place greater needs on particularly the corporate sector, the securities market and finance sector. We need to have a system which is much more responsive. This is precisely what the Government is doing. </PARA>
<PARA> Speakers on the other side have mentioned the problem of crime and said that by introducing this system we would be somehow running away from our obligations in terms of pursuing corporate crime in Australia. There are some major authorities in corporate crime in this country. Even as recently as 1986 those authorities concluded that the cooperative scheme was inadequate to deal with the investigation of corporate crime. They call for a national scheme. They were no lesser authorities than Dr John Braithwaite and Dr Peter Grabowsky in their book entitled Of Matters Gentle: Enforcement Strategies of Australian Business Regulatory Agencies. We have to contend with corporate crime not only domestically but also on an international level. Anyone who has actually dealt with other countries in this particular area is confronted continually with a problem and poses the question: `Why can't you run your corporate system on a Federal level?'. How can authorities be expected to deal with six, if not eight, different and differing jurisdictions in Australia when they recognise that our market is very much a national one, if not an international one?</PARA>
<PARA> During the second reading debate, a few complaints were raised. We were told that we are persisting with this proposal in the face of opposition from the business community. It is a fallacy to say that; it is total ignorance to submit that that is the case. Once again, that ignorance reflects very much on the point of view and the understanding of the real issues facing Australia of members opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> I will list some key business groups who support the proposal. The Business Council of Australia does so, but in latter days, the Liberal Party has said that it is too close to the Government. We have been told that only big business supports the proposal. However, the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, COSBOA, supports it. The Institute of Chartered Accountants supports it, as do the Australian Society of Accountants, the Company Directors Association of Australia, the Metal Trades Industry Association, the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors, and others. More recently, the Australian Merchant Bankers Association has called for prompt action to establish the Australian Securities Commission (ASC). I say `more recently' because it did not support it in the past. It has seen the light. All those organisations reflect one particular point that needs to be stressed time and again. Members opposite are locked in the politics of the 1960s and no matter what changes have happened in the Liberal Party that sort of locking in to days of old has not changed, and will not change. </PARA>
<PARA> We were told that we have not consulted widely. As I mentioned earlier, 1987 was the time of the first major consultative process, when a committee of the Parliament discussed the concept of national legislation. We heard a host of submissions. Such was the overwhelming weight of those submissions that honourable senators on all sides of the Parliament agreed to a national approach at that time. A small number of vocal groups in the smaller States now oppose any form of national legislation. They have been indulging in a campaign of deliberate misinformation, particularly in States such as Queensland and Western Australia. These groups are out to do nothing more than protect local vested interests at the expense of the national interest. Once again, as with every other micro-economic reform issue facing this country, the Opposition bows down to them. It bows down to them all the time, only to be kicked in the guts every time it does so because business time and again has supported it. </PARA>

<PARA> Leaving aside that Senate Committee, the Attorney-General has consistently and continually consulted with industry and the community in order to accommodate the legitimate concerns of the community. As I said, big business and small business alike support this proposal. State governments and their advisers have had access to these drafts for quite some time. They have been circulated for almost 18 months, if not two years. They were laid on the table of the House. Two parliamentary committees received submissions. </PARA>

There is no doubt about the constitutional validity of this legislation. Even State law officers when raising problems with it do not go to the heart of the constitutional problem. They go to the peripheral issues. They will go through their charade, but it should also be noted on the record that the Attorney-General has bent over backwards in terms of accommodating the States' legitimate claims.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The allegation of political interference has been made. If Senator Puplick had any weight in his Party, he would not be floating around in the wind with the direction of his environmental policy, as he has been. Let us return to the basic issue. In terms of independence from political interference, the claim has been made that the responsible Minister will be able to give the ASC general directions about the policies it should pursue or the priorities it should follow. That has been put forward as a major point, but it is not a major point; it is in the legislation. We are saying that the Minister will have no power to give specific directions about a particular case. In that respect, the ASC should be free from political interference in performing its functions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are also saying that those policy directions will have to be in writing; they will have to be gazetted; and they will have to be tabled in Parliament. We are not running away from the fact that we believe in parliamentary scrutiny. This legislation makes the whole corporate regulatory system directly accountable to parliamentary scrutiny. In the past, those on Senator Hill's side of the Parliament and those on our side have been frustrated continually by the fact that problems have arisen-problems that we could never meet with any great degree of responsiveness and flexibility because we have always been confronted with a compact which has been agreed to by State and Federal Attorneys. </PARA>
<PARA> This Parliament's role, like that of every other Parliament, has been recognised as being that of a rubber stamp. With this legislation, we are making the whole system directly accountable to the Parliament. Any degree of political interference will be directly accountable to the Parliament. The ASC chairperson, for instance, will have the opportunity to discuss with the Minister the need for direction and the Minister will be accountable to the Parliament for any directions that he or she gives. </PARA>
<PARA> The other basic part of this point that should be recognised here is that the proposal has emanated from the Joint Parliamentary Committee's recommendations, but we will have a parliamentary committee oversighting the implementation of the legislation and the running of it. That is also a great advance, something which does not take place at the moment, something which could not be met in terms of the existing corporate scheme. The other claim that has been made-and I think that I should dwell on this in order once again to highlight the lack of understanding both of the need and of the proposal put forward by the Government-is that the Australian Securities Commission Bill provides only for the employment of staff subject to Public Service pay limits and that, as a consequence, we will be losing staff from the structure, from the ASC and from the pre-existing National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC). That claim has been made in a press statement by Senator Alston. It is a statement that has been put out irresponsibly everywhere. Not only will the ASC, like the NCSC, be able to appoint staff on Public Service terms and conditions; not only will it be able to engage consultants on terms and conditions, as the ASC determines under clause 129 of the Bill, but in addition the ASC will have significant new capacity-and I hope that Senator Hill will listen to this because it is for his education as much as for anyone else's-to employ, under contract, such staff as it thinks necessary. This power will enable the ASC to determine the terms and conditions of the employment of those persons subject to the Minister's overall agreement. So it will give the ASC greater capacity to employ high level staff from the marketplace and with knowledge of the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not need to say much more other than that once again we have had today an instance in which, when we talk about macro-economic reform, when we talk about cost to industry and when we talk about cost to the economy, this Government recognises the need to streamline the processes. This Government recognises the need for more flexible and responsible systems. Once again, however, the Opposition is locked into its small sectoral interests and resisting any degree of change-despite the fact that in the past it has agreed with the concept. It is regrettable that speaker after speaker on the other side, short of rational argument, has dwelt on the role of the Attorney-General in this process. The Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Bowen, has been in this Parliament much longer than most of those honourable senators opposite-in some cases, since before they were born. They have made allegations about his personal motivations and so on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is nice to know that Senator Bishop did not want to finish her comments, because they were not making a great deal of sense up to that point. It is also heartening to see such a good audience in the House for my speech on this seminal Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1988. The Bill proposes amendments flowing from the consideration by the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform of the 1984 election. It has been suggested by Senator Short and by some other senators on the Opposition benches that the Bill should be withdrawn and resubmitted to include consideration of the 1987 election. That has some superficial appeal, but in reality it means that no reform will be achieved before the next election. We might be well into the next term before any reform would be possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw the attention of honourable senators to the fact that it is not the Government which is delaying Bills. This massive backlog of Bills is a problem for the Opposition, not for the Government. It would be very easy for the Opposition to bring on this Bill at a much faster rate, along with many others. Most of the comments which have been made seem to refer to the integrity of the rolls. I must say that the comments that have been made are causing an immense amount of damage to the electoral system in Australia, with wild and unsubstantiated claims about cemetery voting, multiple voting and impersonation. These claims are damaging because they affect people's faith in the integrity of the rolls and in the integrity of the system itself. I believe that Australians have good reason to be satisfied with the reliability and integrity of the electoral system in this country. I agree with Senator Macklin's earlier comments that we have much to be proud of in the electoral system here. He said that it was a system which was the envy of many other comparable countries. However, there is no doubt that constant baseless criticism undermines the credibility of this system, despite the fact that this credibility deserves to be much higher. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not as if the Liberal Party had any substantive evidence for the claims it has made. In both the Senate submissions in this debate, and in formal written submissions made to the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Matters, the Liberal Party has admitted that it has only anecdotal evidence, at best, and very little of that. In its written submission to the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Matters, the Liberal Party gave no indication whatever of the nature of the information it was claiming was so damaging to the electoral system. It admitted in writing in that submission that the evidence it had, such as it was, was anecdotal. Clearly, for those of us who read it, the evidence was very superficial. Yet, under parliamentary privilege, the Liberal Party is prepared to run with it, regardless of the accuracy of the statements it is making, in the full knowledge that talk-back radio, which seems to enjoy peddling ignorance and hysteria, will pick it up and that this will in some way damage the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this process is reprehensible and damaging to the system under which we work. It undermines the perceived integrity of the system, as I have said. Perhaps, as importantly, it directly criticises officers of the Commission and, because this goes back further than that, to 1984, and before that to accusations relating to New South Wales State elections, it also criticises Australian Electoral Office staff and State electoral office staff in New South Wales who are unable to defend themselves against these attacks. The Federal Electoral Commission, in its response to the Liberal Party's submission, made a telling and accurate comment in assessing the value of the allegations. At page 796, the submission of the Commission, in its response to the Liberal Party submission, states:</PARA>
<PARA>Nonspecific and unauthenticated allegations of multiple voting (and other breaches of electoral law) are made at most elections as part of the process of denying the legitimacy of an unwelcome outcome. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is at the base of the criticisms being made without substantiation from the Opposition benches. In the same response, and having examined the scant evidence provided, the Commission drew a conclusion at page 799 of that same report. It referred to multiple voting, because that is where most of the attacks had been made. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>Multiple voting is not thought to be a significant problem; it is not a threat to the integrity of election outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA>Having looked at all of the evidence, that is the conclusion arrived at by the Commission. The references that have been made by Senator Bishop particularly but by others also to the Castlereagh New South Wales case amaze me. I am simply amazed that she has the gall to come into this chamber and repeat allegations that have been demolished point by point not only by Senator Schacht earlier in this debate and by Senator Robert Ray in other debates in this chamber but also by about seven pages of submissions by the Electoral Commission, in response to her allegations. This response tore her allegations to shreds and made nonsense of them. Yet she repeats them. Despite the fact that letters have been sent by the Minister to Premier Greiner asking him to look into the allegations that have been made, because it is after all a State matter, and the fact that no response has been received to those letters, Senator Bishop still feels free to come back into this chamber and repeat allegations that, as I said, have been demolished point by point on several occasions both in this chamber and outside it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill, having again made vague allusions to the integrity of the roll, then draws the red herring of the New South Wales inquiry into the operations and process of the conduct of State elections, the so-called Cundy report. He neglects to mention that that report made little of many of the accusations. It was not studying the same accusations that have been made by Senator Bishop or by others here. It was looking at the whole question of fraudulent voting and it concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>Much has been written and spoken about votes being cast in the names of deceased electors (cemetery voting). While it is known to have occurred it has been on such a minor scale that it has had no effect on election results. Impersonation of electors falls into much the same category as `cemetery voters'. </PARA>
<PARA>Even where it refers to multiple voting to which it gives slightly more credence and about which it is a little more concerned, it can come up with only two accusations or instances of multiple voting in recent years. They could find no evidence about one of them. The other, which was handled by the Electoral Commission at the Federal level, was the case of a Mr Haantjens who in fact admitted the offence in order to show up the system. He had voted some 15 times in order to make a fool of the system. That is the only case that the report mentions although, as I said, it gives slightly more serious attention to it. In the other two areas of cemetery voting and impersonation, it discards them as relatively unimportant although not totally absent from the system, yet much is made of these things by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Of most interest in all of this are the Liberal Party suggestions for overcoming what I believe is an imagined problem. In its written submission to the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters the Opposition suggested a number of ways of overcoming this imagined problem. Let me go through some of them because they show up the fundamental difference in the attitude of the Liberal Party on the one hand and that of the Labor Party consistently on the other hand. </PARA>
<PARA> The first suggestion is that we go to a totally computerised system offering total integrity. That sounds fine until questions are asked about what is meant by that. What is meant, for example, by a system of total integrity? If it means that it will be impossible to cast more than one vote, it would have to involve a whole range of things. It would certainly need the provision of an on line computer that would link every polling place with a central storage and processing unit. Such an online system would have to be capable of remaining operational continuously and at the 8,200 polling places from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on polling day. No such facility has ever been attempted, nor is it likely to be because of the cost and the unreliability. One breakdown in the whole system would be enough to throw the whole election out and we all know the propensity for even modern and reliable computers to break down. </PARA>
<PARA> If on the other hand it were to have total integrity, it would have to be coupled with some sort of unique identifier such as the proposed Australia Card, an internal passport or something similar. What has happened to the Liberal Party's great concern for individual liberties when it suddenly believes that we need some sort of individual identifier of that sort? It was not prepared to countenance one in relation to tax rorting but it is prepared to countenance one when it comes to people's rights to vote. I suggest that that is because it would prefer people not to vote rather than to vote. If there is a theme in their responses, it is to limit rather than extend the franchise. The theme in everything the Labor Party has done is to extend, not limit, the franchise. </PARA>
<PARA> The second suggestion made by the Opposition is a return to subdivisional voting. The idea behind it is that the number of electors attending a particular polling place will be so small as to make recognition possible by the polling staff, scrutineers or somebody else. There is nothing unreasonable in principle in that system. In fact it is applied in some countries but, in those countries that do insist on electors voting at designated polling places, the total number of voters is usually set at between 500 and 1,000 at each polling place, and a number of 750 is common. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1983 general election, which is the last election that was organised on a subdivisional basis, and that is what the Liberal Party is suggesting in its submission that we go back to, fewer than one in six electors was located in subdivisions of 5,000 electors or fewer and more than two in five of those electors were in subdivisions of over 10,000. Does anybody on the Opposition benches seriously suggest that a polling official, scrutineer or anybody else in a polling place could recognise, with a degree of accuracy, 5,000 to 10,000 people by sight? It is a nonsense. The idea of going back to subdivisional voting is a nonsense. If Opposition members want to reduce the numbers, they will have to go far lower than that and I would suggest that the cost would be substantial not only in terms of reducing the number of polling places and having to pay the additional necessary staff but also in training voters that they will have to vote at a particular polling place from then on. It is a recurring cost because it will have to be done again at every election. What will all this be for-to satisfy the imagined irregularities identified by a group of people who are having difficulty coping with losing elections. That is the crux of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The third suggestion made in the Liberal Party submission is that electors should be required to provide corroborating documentary evidence of residence and address, and that this might involve the enrolment being witnessed by justices of the peace. This is really true to character for the Liberal Party. Again, as I have indicated, it is an attempt to restrict the franchise, to reduce the number of voters. It is quite opposed to the sort of position the Labor Party has been taking consistently and has taken in the various Acts passed by this Government, which have exactly the opposite effect of enhancing the franchise, of enhancing the number of people able to vote. </PARA>
<PARA> I well remember being involved in the 1977 Kimberley campaign when I assisted Ernie Bridge, the Labor candidate, in that disgraceful election where the Liberal Party, in a sustained effort, attempted to stop Aborigines from voting. The Liberal Party had a variety of techniques for this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crichton-Browne knows all about this.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NE4">Senator BEAHAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. One of the ways it did this was to send lawyers there to try to badger and intimidate the Aborigines into feeling that they could not go ahead with the process of voting. Other ways were less subtle, such as getting Aborigines drunk or delivering 44-gallon drums of port free of charge to Aboriginal settlements. That failed. There was a court of disputed returns and the evidence raised there was a damning indictment of the Western Australian branch of the Liberal Party, from which that branch is still suffering. The Liberal Party cannot raise a fraction of the votes that we can from Aboriginal communities because Aboriginal communities, with all the difficulties they might have with the Government from time to time, cannot bring themselves to vote for the Liberal Party because of the disgraceful events of 1977.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result, because the Liberal Party failed to stop Aborigines from voting, Sir Charles Court, who was an expert on limiting franchises, attempted another way. What he tried to do is what the Liberal Party is now suggesting for Federal legislation. The Liberal Party tried to make it more difficult for Aborigines to enrol. If all Aborigines are going to vote, and the Liberal Party could not stop them from voting by intimidating them with lawyers or trying to get them drunk, it would stop them from enrolling. It was made mandatory to have the signature of a justice of the peace (JP) or a policeman on an enrolment form. That was difficult for people in remote communities in the Kimberley, the Central Desert region and elsewhere. Where would they find JPs? How many Aborigines would be comfortable about going to policemen, particularly in those days, to get a signature on an enrolment form? The whole attempt was to restrict the franchise and stop Aborigines from voting. It was a shameful attempt which we undid when we got into government later on. </PARA>
<PARA> Other things can be said about the use of JPs' signatures. One is that they are unevenly spread. They are not as easily found in one place as in another. Secondly, they are politically appointed. In some places they are much more openly politically appointed than in others. </PARA>
<PARA> The Electoral Commission's response to the Liberal Party's report quotes an article which is quite telling about JPs. Page 8 of the Electoral Commission's response refers to an article in the Courier-Mail of 12 October 1988. I will read this because it is a very good example of the difficulty with JPs, particularly in some parts of this country. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>A large number of Queensland's estimated 43,000 Justices of the Peace receive their commission as a political reward, according to Queensland's foremost JP.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Keith Tronc also said about 35,000 of Queensland's JPs have made false statements about their willingness and competence in statutory declarations submitted as part of their applications for appointment. Dr Tronc, a solicitor and professional educator who was asked by the State Government Justice Department to write the manual for Queensland's JPs, said political rewards were common and deplorable. </PARA>
<PARA>I know this because MLAs have on numerous occasions said to me, `I nominate everyone who seeks to become a JP and I offer nominations to everyone who helps with my electoral campaign-it's a sure-fire winner', he said. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Tronc said he had replied to the MLAs, whom he refused to name, that a JP's job was difficult, complex and training was needed before nomination. ``To which comment some of our honourable members have replied, `That would be unnecessarily restrictive','' he said. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Tronc said some people were nominated as JPs for handing out how-to-vote cards. </PARA>
<PARA>That gives an idea of how, in at least one State in this country, becoming a JP is not a big deal and having a signature on a nomination is not particularly substantial. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth suggestion that is made in the Liberal Party's submission is that some form of substantiation might be produced to prove that the person who is voting is who he or she claims to be. In the original case referring to computers, it might have been an unconscious call for the return of the Australia Card or some sort of internal identifier. This is a much more open, clear and unambiguous call for the introduction of an Australia Card or similar identifier. Again, I wonder what has happened to the Liberal Party's concerns about privacy and individual liberty. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Short expressed concern about some of the comments in the report of the Electoral Commission's response to the Liberal Party's submission, and said that the officers of the Electoral Commission were unprofessional in their approach to this submission. I was quite amazed that he should quote part of that submission which, I think, was quite damning to the Liberal Party's submission. I will refer to the quotation which Senator Short used, and re-read it as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The submission's contribution to the perception in the minds of many voters that the administration of the electoral process is not adequate by repeating such an extraordinary collection of quarter truths and total fabrications devalues its protestations of concern about the consequences to the vanishing point. </PARA>
<PARA> That is enough said about the Liberal Party's submission. It is a written submission to a joint committee of this Parliament and, frankly, it is a disgrace when compared with the other submissions that were put to the Committee. I notice that Tony Eggleton did not appear to give evidence to the Committee in support of the submission despite the fact that it was above his signature, but that a junior official from Canberra was forced to answer some difficult questions from members of the Committee who shared the conviction that it was a dreadful submission. </PARA>
<PARA> Some comments were made earlier in this debate about the Western Australian election. Certainly Senator Chaney, not in this debate but at other times, has complained about the fact that a claimed 52 per cent of the vote-I cannot be precise about the figures-was gained by the Liberal Party in the Western Australian State election, and yet it did not win the election, and the Liberal Party thought that this was unfair. It is interesting that the Liberal Party in Western Australia has a sudden, renewed interest in the concept of one vote one value. It has shown absolutely no interest in the concept before now. I would like to know, for example, what Senator Chaney was doing, if he is so interested in this concept, in 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1987 when the Labor Party attempted to pass Bills which would redress that difficulty and introduce one vote one value in Western Australia. The 1983, 1984 and 1985 attempts were thrown out holus bolus. We did not get past first base because we had no support at all from either the Liberal or National parties. The 1987 Bill did go through with the support of the National Party, but with the trenchant opposition of the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney waxes and wanes on these issues in any case because, while he is complaining about that fact now and giving tacit support to one vote one value, it was only about a year ago in the old Parliament House that he was defending the malapportionment which previously existed, which was even worse than the malapportionment which currently exists. He was defending it in discussion on the referendum Bills. I will quote him from Hansard as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>I made the point that if one had any comprehension of the geography and population of that State, to deny the right of the State of Western Australia to have any degree of regional representation in the upper House is absolutely pathetic and absurd. If one looks at the discrepancy between the Kimberley and the South West Land Division, and the South West Land Division and the metropolitan area, to argue that one can have nothing akin to a regional representation of the sort that Australia has for the whole of its nation is, in my view, not a tenable proposition. </PARA>
<PARA>What Senator Chaney-this paragon of virtue, probity and rectitude-is doing there is supporting malapportionment. He is supporting a grossly rorted system, as it was in those days, a system which is slightly less rorted now because the National Party assisted us in getting rid of the worst of the rorts. He has turned full circle, not out of any sense of principle or probity, but out of a sense of self-interest for his political party, and now he is supporting the concept of one vote one value. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of that differential in the vote-the fact that the Liberal Party did not win, even though it got more than 50 per cent of the vote-can be explained for those who know anything about electoral matters in a whole range of ways, apart from the concept of one vote one value and the current malapportionment. </PARA>
<PARA> Western Australia is made up of single member constituencies, and we will always get some distortions with a single member constituency system. It is only with a system of proportional representation that one's support base is very close to exactly reflected in the representation one gets. But Western Australia has a preferential system with single member constituencies and so we are bound to get some discrepancies because of that. Secondly, it is drawn up to a design of the National Party of Australia. Of course it was put together by independent commissioners, but according to a set of rules that were forced on us by the National Party because we had to get the support of the National Party in order to carry the Bill in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> The third consideration, is that the results in marginal electorates vary from the results found in electorates generally. Marginal seats are less inclined to big swings than non-marginal seats. There is nothing unusual about that. This is partly related to the Australian Labor Party's capacity for very effective targeted campaigns, but it is also partly related to the fact that marginal seat electors know that they are in marginal seats and they are very much more careful about their voting because they know it will have a real impact on the outcome of the election. The other side of this, of course, is that Labor members in the Western Australian election tended to win their seats by smaller margins than did Liberal and other Opposition members, who won their seats by larger margins. That, again, describes part of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, another factor is the current malapportionment that exists in Western Australia. By `malapportionment' I mean that some electors have a much more powerful vote than that of other electors. For example, voters in rural electorates have much more power in their vote because there are much smaller numbers of voters in their electorates, whereas city electorates have much bigger numbers and the vote of each individual is correspondingly less powerful. That malapportionment, while it was largely ameliorated by the 1987 Act, was not totally got rid of because the National Party still wanted a distortion to exist so that country electorates would have an over-representation in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not the National Party that wants to change that now; it is the Liberal Party in Western Australia that is toying with the idea. It will be very interesting to see whether the Liberals can bring themselves around after so many years of opposition to the principled position that one person deserves a vote that is equal with that of every other person-a position that is consistent with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and with every other civilised electoral convention. As I said, if this is done, it will not be done out of any high degree of principle but out of a sense of survival because they think that the only way they can survive is with a system of one vote one value. I do not believe it is that easy, and I think that at the next election in Western Australia they will find it equally difficult because they have not yet come to terms with the fundamentals of campaigning, selection of candidates or, I suppose, of consistency in the principles they stand for so that people can judge them over time. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Senator Baume</PARA>
<PARA> As you know I have just returned from southern Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's reputation remains high in Africa and this is no doubt the result of the active assistance by the Fraser and Hawke Governments and the very effective work being done by Australian agencies. When Africans hear that you are from Australia they don't hesitate ``to put out the welcome mat'', as Senator Gareth Evans so readily found on his recent visit. </PARA>
<PARA> It is especially distressing that southern African nations again face serious famine and savage disruption to their societies and economies. </PARA>
<PARA> One country in particular is in awful distress and that is Mozambique where for example, over 350 children of each 1000 will not reach their 5th birthday this year. Together with Afghanistan that is the worst situation on earth. </PARA>
<PARA> Details are set out in the 1989 State of the World's Children Report which was sent recently to every parliamentarian. We also have the latest edition of ``Children on The Front Line'' which we have sent to the Parliamentary Library. </PARA>
<PARA> Because we sometimes hear from the uninformed that Australia's foreign aid program should ``turn its back on Africa'', I am enclosing a copy of the E'Mail note I received today from Mozambique on the rapidly deteriorating situation. I hope you can share this with your colleagues so Mozambique's women and children will receive the compassionate assistance they so urgently need. </PARA>
<PARA> The note sets out so clearly why Mozambique's women and children and UNICEF's program must remain a priority, and I'm sure you will be actively working with Prime Minister Hawke, Foreign Minister Evans and Opposition Leader Peacock to achieve this. </PARA>

<PARA>8 May 1989</PARA>
<PARA>MOZAMBIQUE I</PARA>
<PARA>Mozambique is gripped by an emergency of appalling dimensions. Destabilization war and its cumulative effect continue to plague a country already affected by repeated droughts and shortages of basic goods. </PARA>
<PARA>According to a recent situation report famine is threatening many districts in Nampula, Zambezia and Niassa provinces. Hunger related deaths are on the rise, in Memba alone they number 5,200. A cholera outbreak has been reported in Tete for which UNICEF has financed an airlift of some 11 tonnes of medicine and hospital equipment. Urgent food airlifts are required for the affected provinces; in some totally isolated areas, the government is considering air dropping of relief supplies. </PARA>
<PARA>In spite of major humanitarian efforts by the international community for the past several years, the suffering of the affected population of Mozambique continues unabated. Armed attacks appear to be increasing in many provinces causing further destruction to the fragile productive and social service sector. Following a UN interagency review of the emergency programme, a renewed two-year appeal for emergency support to Mozambique was issued by the UN Secretary General for US$380 million, replacing the March 1988 Appeal. </PARA>
<PARA>Within the context of this revised appeal, UNICEF is now seeking approximately US$18 million for 1989-1990 to meet the basic needs of the emergency affected population, especially vulnerable women and children. </PARA>
<PARA>NATURAL DISASTERS AND WAR: MAIN CAUSES OF MOZAMBIQUE EMERGENCY</PARA>
<PARA>Underdevelopment was the legacy to Mozambique at independence in 1975. Since then the country has been facing reported droughts and a long destablization war which have caused the overall production to fall dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA>National and local food supply and distribution systems have come close to collapse and physical infrastructure has largely been destroyed. Acts of sabotage against factories, farms, railway lines, convoys, roads and bridges have hampered the recovery of production and transportation of goods to markets both inside the country and abroad. </PARA>
<PARA>The Economic Rehabilitation Programme (PRE) introduced in 1987 has succeeded in restoring 4-5 percent economic growth. But this is not enough. Internally marketed food production still remains under 10% of the requirements for the urban and emergency affected population. Large numbers of displaced people moving from insecure rural areas to larger and small towns have increased the population in many areas putting pressure on supplies. Many urban families who shelter relatives fleeing from the countryside have greater difficulty in affording basic foods. </PARA>
<PARA>Basic public services no longer exist in many parts of the country. Health facilities, schools, water and road systems are not functioning in many areas. According to Government estimates 36% of the rural health facilities have been affected. Moreover, the capacity in terms of trained manpower and appropriate materials to provide basic services has been lost. </PARA>
<PARA>On the economic side, exports in 1988 remained at less than 15% of the already low levels of imports, and the country's annual debt service obligations continued to exceed, although by a lesser amount, its export earnings. The income per capita has dropped from over US$200 in 1975 to US$125-150 today, and is estimated to be one of the lowest in the world. </PARA>
<PARA>EMERGENCY AFFECTS OVER ONE THIRD OF POPULATION, ESPECIALLY WOMEN AND CHILDREN</PARA>
<PARA>Approximately 37% of the total population is affected by the continuous emergency situation: some 1.6 million people have been recently displaced within the country, a further million have fled to neighbouring states and more than 2.87 million are currently suffering from food shortages due to drought, breakdown of transport systems and other factors. More generally over 50% of the population presently depend on food aid. A threat of famine is reported today in many districts of the country and the number of deaths from starvation is on the rise. </PARA>
<PARA>Along with food shortfalls, the affected population commonly experiences almost complete lack of access to clothing, footwear, clean water supplies and basic household utensils for cooking, shelter construction and production activities. </PARA>
<PARA>Child malnutrition is very serious. According to estimates from the Ministry of Health, the rate of acute malnutrition among children is 10.3%. However it reaches 48% in centres for displaced people, the rates being particularly high among recent arrivals and where resettlements and resumption of farming has not yet been possible. </PARA>
<PARA>Child and infant mortality rates are estimated to be among the highest in the world (350 per thousand and 200 per thousand respectively). They are the result of easily treated conditions such as diarrhoea and respiratory infections. The incidence of deaths from measles and malaria is believed to be rising rapidly in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA>Indications of increased malnutrition among women have come from the rise in incidence of low birth weights as measured in maternity wards in the main hospitals. Such levels have reached over 25% in some places. </PARA>
<PARA> Large numbers of orphaned, abandoned, traumatized and disabled children are a particular feature of the Mozambician emergency situation. Children who have lost their parents in the process of displacement or who have fled alone during village or school attacks, children who have seen their parents killed and who have been psychologically affected or physically disabled by war-related experiences. The total number of these children is estimated at approximately 250,000. </PARA>
<PARA>UNICEF'S RESPONSE SINCE 1984</PARA>
<PARA> Since 1984 UNICEF has initiated 35 projects to address the emergency situation. These projects fall into three basic categories: immediate, short-term relief to war and drought affected populations; medium-term measures designed to stabilize household productivity and income, and to improve access and delivery of basic social services; long-term development efforts, particularly capacity building. The latter is explained by the fact that the Mozambique Emergency Programme is structurally integrated with the regular on-going Country Programme of UNICEF's assistance to Mozambique. </PARA>
<PARA> About half of UNICEF's inputs have been devoted to immediate relief measures. Specific activities have included provision of cooking, utensils, clothing, medicines, vaccines, medical equipment, and other basic supplies. Transport facilities have also been provided including airlifts to isolated regions requiring urgent assistance. In a few critical situations, UNICEF has provided food relief primarily with in-kind donations received from external donors for this purpose. UNICEF has been involved in both shallow water and tubewell projects. </PARA>
<PARA>UNICEF'S EMERGENCY PROGRAMME OF ASSISTANCE 1989-1990</PARA>
<PARA> Basic health care-total funds required: US$6,407,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, more than 30% of the health units in the country are not functioning due to direct attacks, poor accessibility, assaults on staff or lack of supplies. </PARA>
<PARA> Rehabilitation of basic health facilities and services, and supply of vital drugs and surgical materials are the main points of this component. </PARA>
<PARA> UNICEF is concentrating its assistance in three provinces: Tete, Manica and Sofala. Funds are already available for the programmes in Tete and Manica provinces which aim at upgrading and rehabilitating services of the regional health system through an integrated approach. A provincial programme of a similar nature is to be implemented in Sofala province. An adequate minimum of supply of the most important drugs and medical equipment has to be ensured, the most urgent needs being for ``vital medicines'' used for the treatment of people injured or otherwise affected by war. </PARA>
<PARA> Children in difficult circumstances</PARA>
<PARA> Another important part of the emergency programme will focus on assistance to the estimated 250,000 children in difficult circumstances. Broad-based approaches are to be used to successfully deal with such a large number of children. One of these approaches is the use of primary schools as a means of reaching and organizing appropriate activities and attention for these children. Low-cost community based pre-school can be established for younger children. </PARA>
<PARA>The project will include training of pre-school organizers, construction materials, development manuals, and provision of equipment for children activities. The project will also support the strengthening of capacity, both at national and provincial levels of the Social Welfare Department of the Ministry of Health. This agency is responsible for the collection of data on children in difficult circumstances, liaison with communities to assist vulnerable groups, tracing of families, support to institutions such as creches and orphanages, and assistance to street children and delinquents. The project will focus on training of personnel and on equipment supply. </PARA>
<PARA>Primary education-total funds required: US$4,038,000</PARA>
<PARA>In the last year, as a result of the war, the number of primary schools functioning has dropped dramatically. By late 1987 it was estimated that in some provinces, such as Maputo, Niassa, Sofala, Zambezia and Tete, between 50% and 81% of primary schools were not functioning. A total of half a million children are estimated to have been denied access to minimum conditions of primary education. </PARA>
<PARA>A reconstruction and rehabilitation programme has been initiated by UNICEF focusing in 1989 on the priority provinces of Zambezia, Tete and Nampula, and extending in 1990 to three further provinces: Niassa, Inhambane and Maputo. The programme has two parts:</PARA>
<PARA>reconstruction and equipping with basic school materials of classrooms in areas of high concentration of displaced families, and where school infrastructure has been damaged. The reconstruction programme will rely almost entirely on local materials and community self-help inputs. </PARA>
<PARA>training programmes for teachers to provide special attention to war-affected children of primary school age and provision of a research and programme development capacity in the Ministry of Education for increasing the use of primary schools as means of reintegration and assistance to war-affected children. </PARA>
<PARA>Drinking water programmes-total funds required: US$1,190,000</PARA>
<PARA>The water component of the programme is composed of two drinking water projects in the Province of Sofala and of an ongoing project aiming at strengthening central management capacity in the rural water supply sector. </PARA>
<PARA>Many displaced people are established and continue to concentrate in the Beira Corridor, a relatively secure zone due to the presence of Mozambican and Zimbabwean troops. Two projects are being implemented in the area. The first one is an ongoing project which aims at providing potable water for war-affected and displaced population along the Beira Corridor and to the rural drought-affected population at large. The project will benefit approximately 47,500 people. It will also support the provincial water-supply community participation and education programme. </PARA>
<PARA>The second will focus particularly on providing drinking water to Nhamatanda, hardly a small town until a few years ago, now counting some 12,000 inhabitants due to large resettling of displaced population. Drinking water distribution to the increased population of the town is a major problem, further complicated by the existence of only scarce and salty groundwater which has made impossible the implementation of rapid schemes such as shallow wells and deep tube-wells. </PARA>
<PARA>The project aiming at strengthening central management capacity was originally financed by the Swedish Government through UNICEF. It was formulated to help meet the managerial and technical demands of the rapidly expanding rural water supply programme. </PARA>
<PARA>Phase II of this project will continue to support-through technical expertise and equipment-the national agencies working in rural water supply; particularly the National Rural Water Supply Programme (PRONAR) whose Head Office is responsible for the co-ordination of all rural water supply activities throughout the country. </PARA>
<PARA>Logistics support-total funds required US$1,380,000</PARA>
<PARA>The objective of this component is to replenish the air transport fund which as of mid 1985 has allowed the provision of essential commodities such as medical equipment, vaccines, blankets and therapeutic foods to unreachable areas. Funding is required to carry on airlift operations as many provinces remain out of reach by road due to continuing insecurity and now to the rainy season. As of February 1989 the Funds for the Emergency airlift were completely exhausted. </PARA>
<PARA>Relief and survival item-total funds required US$2,100,000</PARA>
<PARA>The large war-effected displaced population faces acute shortages of the most basic items for everyday's life, such as soap, clothing, shelter etc. These precarious conditions often result in higher infant mortality and disease conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>The relief and survival items supply effort will concentrate mainly in the province of Tete, Manica and Zambezia. Items required include, clothing, shoes, blankets, soap, cooking utensils, hand-tools for house constructions as well as tents and water tanks. </PARA>
<PARA>As part of this component, a ``Quick Action Fund'' will be established by the Government in Maputo, by retaining a small stockpile of the most essential items, as a means to be able to respond quickly to emergency needs as they arise. Part of these stockpiles will be kept in the three provinces of concentration of UNICEF support to this sector. </PARA>
<PARA>Agricultural and rural rehabilitation-total funds required US$685,000</PARA>
<PARA>Since the start of the Emergency Programme in 1984, UNICEF has been carrying out integrated projects for the resettlement of displaced and returnees and for the rehabilitation of household incomes and production following drought. Family self- sufficiency is sought through the development of agricultural production and non-farm family incomes, and the provision of essential health, education and water services to the communities. An element of institutional strengthening of local authorities is also included. </PARA>
<PARA>These integrated projects have been implemented primarily in areas of high concentration of displaced in the provinces of Manica, Tete and Zambezia. The number of displaced and returnees has continued to grow especially in Manica (Espungabera and Beira corridor) and in Zambezia (Ile District), and is expected to grow further. The integrated rural projects will therefore be continued in order to give the growing population the means to providing to their own needs. </PARA>
<PARA>Institutional support-total funds required US$2,090,000</PARA>
<PARA>This component is made of two parts:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) Strengthening the national and local emergency structures. The objectives of this project are: to rapidly upgrade the capacity of the Department for Prevention and Combat of Natural Calamities (DPCCN), a national body established in 1987 for improving the decision-making and management of the short-term relief and logistics components of the national emergency programme. </PARA>
<PARA> And to strengthen capabilities of the Provincial Emergency Commissions (CPES), which were established for co-ordinating and planning for emergency response, as well as for collecting and analyzing information and assessing emergency conditions at the local level. </PARA>
<PARA> Activities will include staff training in emergency management, technical assistance and the supply of basic materials for planning and operations. They will be concentrated in the Provinces of Zambezia, Manica and Tete as continuation of activities already begun in 1988. NGOs are expected to assist similar projects in other provinces. </PARA>
<PARA>(2) Covering staffing, administrative and logistical costs of UNICEF's Emergency Programme of Assistance over the next two years. This programme is managed and co-ordinated by an Emergency Unit operating within UNICEF's office in Maputo. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rose in this chamber on 12 April to speak of continuing police brutality in Murray Bridge in South Australia, despite the findings and recommendations of the Muirhead Royal Commission into Aborigonal Deaths in Custody up to this point. In that speech I referred to several incidents which occurred in February of this year. One of the accounts I quoted from was a statement by Alan Chirpy Campbell, who described an incident on 7 February when two Aboriginals were manhandled by the police. Another of the accounts that I read from was a statement by Tiny Rankin, who described an incident on 21 February in which his brother Tony, who is 18 years old, was kicked and dragged along the ground by police officers King and Jenkins, whom I named in that particular speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am very concerned that, subsequent to that speech-and possibly because the speech was widely publicised in South Australia-Alan Campbell has received a death threat which is couched in the vilest and most foul language from an anonymous writer who identifies himself only as a police officer. I am not able to verify whether or not the author of this letter is a police officer, but if he is, if he is found to be a police officer from the handwriting, then it is quite clear that he ought to be dismissed immediately and charged with using threatening language. The letter was received by Chirpy Campbell's brother, John Campbell. The post office stamp is marked Clare, South Australia, post code 5453, dated 26 April 1989. The Committee to Defend Black Rights (CDBR) holds the original copy of the letter-both pages of it-and it was passed on to Commissioner Hal Wootten on 8 May 1989. The letter arived only two days before Alan Campbell was due to give evidence at the Royal Commission hearings into the death of his brother, Peter Campbell, which commenced in Sydney on 1 May. The Commission is still sitting today. </PARA>
<PARA> I am a bit embarrassed to read this letter into the record. The language is pretty vile, and while I know the Senate chamber is not unused to imaginative and colourful language, I think that this language may offend some honourable senators present.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The background of the letter is this: it was actually addressed to Alan Campbell. Mr Campbell has been active with the Committee to Defend Black Rights. He is a member of that Committee. He commonly acts as a spokesperson for that Committee and for the Ngarindjerri Aboriginal community in Murray Bridge. Since the incident of 21 February of which I spoke he has been particularly active in highlighting a series of police attacks on the Aboriginal community in South Australia. In a press release he says that police intimidation and bashings of Aboriginal people have increased markedly since the first four findings of the Royal Commission were handed down. These findings did not recommend that any charges be laid against any custodial officers involved in the first four deaths in custody which were investigated by the Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of the work of Alan Campbell, other Ngarindjerri people, the CDBR and myself in highlighting the police brutality in Murray Bridge, the South Australian Police Minister launched an internal police investigation into racism in the Murray Bridge police force which is currently under way. I must say that I have doubts about police investigating themselves and would be far more inclined to trust an external body investigating the police, as I would under any circumstances for anybody. I hope that there will not be a whitewash in this case. However, what really concerns me in this case is that it has been reported to me that, while this investigation into police bashings has been going on more bashings have been taking place, in particular the bashings of Gary Rankin and Tiny Rankin. I am presently arranging to get statements from these two people. I will read them into the record as soon as I receive them. The Committee to Defend Black Rights also put out a press release.

<PARA>THREATS TO ABORIGINAL PEOPLE'S LIVES CONTINUE WHILE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WASHES ITS' HANDS OF BLACK BLOOD</PARA>
<PARA> As Aboriginal &amp; non-Aboriginal people throughout Australia voice their outrage at the violent &amp; senseless taking of an innocent Aboriginal life in custody (that of David Gundy), the Federal government announced only days before (May 2) that it will cease investigations into any more Black lives lost in custody after May 31st, 1989. Meanwhile another death threat to an Aboriginal witness in the Royal Commission has been made (text enclosed). </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Warren Martens, spokesperson for the National Committee to Defend Black Rights (CDBR) said today: `The Federal government's cut off date is a clear example of the administrative arm giving it's prison &amp; police forces the green light to make further brutal attacks on Black lives'. </PARA>
<PARA>`The Federal government knows that the result of their inaction is further Black deaths. It has failed to take action to stop the continuing intimidation, bashings, internment &amp; deaths of our people in custody. So it is using the Royal Commission to deflect its' ``cost efficient'' disregard for the lives of its' citizens &amp; wash its' hands of Black blood'. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Martens continued: `Today's receipt of yet another death threat, presumably by police, towards a relative of one of the victims of a death in custody, who is attempting to give evidence to the Commission, demonstrates the necessity of continuing investigations by the Royal Commission &amp; of urgent Federal government, legislative action to implement measures to stop Black deaths in custody'. </PARA>
<PARA>`Instead however, the Federal governments' answer to the alarming human rights abuses of the most powerless of its' citizens is to turn back the clock to pre-Royal Commission days. Now when these abuses occur, the perpetrators have only the corrupt coronial system to answer to. Like in South Africa, the perpetrators &amp; those involved in the cover-ups can again be confident that they can get away with ``misadventure'', ``heart attack'' &amp; ``death by natural causes'' verdicts. They will not have to face investigation by the Royal Commission'. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Martens continued: `This death threat is only one example of the alarming increase in racist brutality towards our people at this time. It demonstrates how vital it is, that the persons &amp; institutions responsible for Black deaths in custody continue to be made answerable to the Royal Commission until the issues that gave rise to the Commission are altered; &amp; until such a time, when the threat of a night in the lock up, does not mean the threat of a death sentence for our people'. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3K4">Senator DUNN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly support the call within the press release for an independent inquiry not only into the black deaths in custody but also into the recent Gundy case. I have great sympathy for the relatives of police officer Alan McQueen. I believe that that was a terrible tragedy. But I also believe that the institutionalised and widespread violence against the Aboriginal people by police in this country is a disgrace that cannot and should not be tolerated by a community that calls itself democratic and humane.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The estimated number of persons of age pension age in Australia, at 30 June 1988 (latest figure available), was 2,169,000. The number of persons of age pension age paid by the Department of Social Security at September 1988 was 1,357,710. (An additional 190,123 service pensioners of age pension age were paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs at the end of September 1988.)</PARA>
<PARA> The breakdown of social security pensioners who are of age pension age by pension type is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Age pensioners: 1,330,640</PARA>
<PARA> Invalid pensioners: 6,830</PARA>
<PARA> Widow pensioners: 20,180</PARA>
<PARA> Other (Sheltered employment allowees and Supporting Parents): 60</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The number of persons of age pension age receiving a pension from the Department of Social Security at the full rate, as at September 1988, was 1,003,300.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The number of pensioners of age pension age receiving a pension from the Department of Social Security at September 1988 with other assessed income (that is, after allowing deductions for dependents) was 1,147,400.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) It is not known how many people have assets precluding them from pension entitlement, but in the year ended 30 June 1988 2,860 persons applying for age pension had their application rejected because of their assets. Corresponding figures for invalid and widow pensioners of age pension age are not available.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) The number of Social Security pensioners of age pension age whose stated other income was not sufficient to reduce their full pension was 825,000.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) The number of Social Security pensioners of age pension age receiving part pension by reason of their stated other income at September 1988 was 354,400 (26 per cent). This figure includes 6,000 pensioners receiving part pension because their income from earnings was above the free area limit. (The term `earnings' refers only to income from the remuneration of labour and does not refer to other sources of income such as from investments.)</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The number of Social Security pensioners of age pension age with pension reduced by assets at September 1988 was 11,280.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Not applicable.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) The estimated total amount by which pension is reduced is:</PARA>
<PARA>$m</PARA>
<PARA> Level of income...645</PARA>
<PARA> Level of assets...17</PARA>
<PARA> TOTAL...662</PARA>
<PARA> These figures are for all pensioners of age pension age paid by the Department of Social Security. They do not include instances where no pension is paid.</PARA>
<PARA> The figure for income includes savings of $10m due to `earnings'. This term refers only to income from the remuneration of labour and does not refer to other sources of income such as from investments.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) For the year ended 30 June 1988 expenditure on age pensions (including allowances/pensions for wives/carers, guardian's allowance, additional pension for children, rent assistance and remote area allowance) totalled $6.9 billion.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) $3.1 billion in addition to current costs. This estimate includes service pensioners and all social security pensioners of age pension age.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Australian Taxation Office estimates the figure for the 1986-87 financial year at $1.8 billion.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Ongoing estimates of savings due to the pensions assets test are not calculated. However, it is estimated that in 1987-88 combined savings due to the over 70's income test and the assets test were in the order of $450 million a year.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) It is not possible to estimate the number of pensioners who would work to earn additional income if they could do so without affecting their pension. Such a decision hinges on a range of factors apart from the income test itself: for example, labour market conditions, the availability and sources of other income, the attractiveness of the consumption relative to leisure in each individual case and so on.</PARA>
