<PARA> That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on 19 March 1989, of the Hon. Nelson Lemmon, a member of the House of Representatives for the division of Forrest from 1943 to 1949, and a Minister of the Crown from 1946 to 1949, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to the members of his family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>I think there are one or two honourable senators on the Government side of the House who would like to say something about Nelson Lemmon, and for that reason I will be very brief. I think the important thing about Mr Lemmon was that he was the last survivor of the Chifley Government and a very respected member of that Government. I had the opportunity of meeting him on two occasions, and I must say that he struck me as a person of great commonsense, dignity and decency. It was a great pleasure for me to have that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> He was born on 22 March 1908 at Williamstown, Victoria. His father was a politician too, holding the Victorian State seat of Williamstown for 51 years until 1955. Nelson Lemmon himself was educated at Williamstown State School and Longerenong Agricultural College. He was married and he had a son and a daughter. He moved to Western Australia as a young man and was active in local government and farming activities and was a member of the Wheat Stabilisation Board of Western Australia from 1943 to 1944. John Curtin took an interest in the young farmer, as he then was, and worked to get him into Parliament. He entered the Federal Parliament in 1943. His maiden speech in the Parliament reflected a vision for a better Australia, a vision that was the hallmark of the Chifley Government in the postwar reconstruction era. He had a sincere commitment to caring about the poor and unemployed, he stressed the importance of opening up tertiary education opportunities to all those with the necessary ability, and he saw the importance of restructuring rural industry in the aftermath of World War II. </PARA>
<PARA> I have indicated that it was in his time as a Minister in the Chifley Government that he made his mark on the history of this country. He was Minister for Works and Housing and the Minister responsible for the commencement of the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme. He also foresaw the importance of environmental protection long before it became a political issue, and sought to minimise ecological damage in the scheme's planning. As part of his portfolio responsibilities he also put into operation a plan for the construction of war service homes. As well as being Minister for Works he assisted the Treasurer from 1946 to 1949. It is an indication of the regard in which he was held that he was given this important additional role. </PARA>
<PARA> He left the Parliament in 1949 and re-entered it briefly in 1954 as the member for St George, Sydney, amid press speculation that he was a likely contender for the Labor leadership. This was, of course, the period when Labor's political fortunes entered the trough they were to occupy for a long time. He lost his seat in 1955 and retired from public life at the age of 47. He returned to his occupation as a horse trainer and breeder and owner of a property in Robertson, New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Lemmon had a very short career in public life but it was a very distinguished one, given the time that he served in Parliament and as a Minister in that important postwar Government, particularly as the Minister dealing with postwar reconstruction issues. Ben Chifley regarded him as a potential future leader of the Labor Party. He was certainly regarded as one of the best debaters in the House. He died as the last surviving member of the Chifley Ministry and in that sense his death marks the end of an era. On behalf of the Government I extend to members of his family our sincere condolences in their bereavement. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Western Australia-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Leader of the Opposition)</ROLE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition I join the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) in support of this motion and in extending the sympathy of the Opposition to the family of the late Nelson Lemmon. The Leader of the Government has given a good outline of the services which were provided by the Hon. Nelson Lemmon in his parliamentary and government capacities. I have little to add to that, except to say that with respect to the speech which the Leader of the Government referred to, the first speech made by Mr Lemmon in the House of Representatives, it is interesting to note just how much Australia has changed and how much the perceptions of what Australia's problems are have changed. Mr Lemmon, in his speech, expressed some positive views about immigration, saying that he realised that it was the obligation of the country to carry a greater population. He made this point:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . before we can take many migrants, we shall have to re-organize the whole of our rural industry, for we cannot feed people with the nuts and bolts of secondary industries. </PARA>
<PARA>The thought of there being some concern about the capacity of Australia to feed its population, and a population augmented by immigration, is one which seems very strange today. More significantly, there was a reflection of the idealism that Mr Lemmon brought into the Parliament when, in an earlier part of his speech, he lamented the outcome of the First World War and the failure of governments after that war to provide adequately for the population and for the men who had returned from war. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>We well remember what happened after the war of 1914-18, which was to have been a war to make Australia a land fit for heroes to live in. </PARA>
<PARA>He pointed out that after that war-and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . many Australians went short of the necessaries of life . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I think that Mr Lemmon's generation-not only those who were part of the Chifley Government but also those who formed the subsequent Menzies Government-can take very great satisfaction from the fact that the life which was provided for Australians in postwar Australia was significantly superior to that which was provided after the First World War. There was a much greater degree of success in managing not just Australia but the whole world. In that sense one of Mr Lemmon's premier ambitions was met. I think Australia in the post war period was a land fit for the people who had fought for Australia to live in. That ambition of his was certainly realised. I am sure that the people who are most grieved at the death of Mr Lemmon are his family. Again, the Opposition extends its sympathy to them and its thanks for the contribution made by Mr Lemmon. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs)</ROLE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Button has alluded to the historic nature of this individual, Mr Lemmon, as he was the last survivor of the Chifley Government to have served in the Cabinet. There are still some survivors of that Government. He was a Victorian. He was born in Victoria, and we take some pride in that. His father represented the seat of Williamstown in Victoria from 1904 to 1955. His grandparents were caretakers of the Trades Hall Council in Victoria. So it is fairly clear to anyone that Mr Lemmon and his family had a long history in the Labor movement. Like several other Victorians, such as Curtin, he represented the Labor Party in Western Australia. In Federal Parliament he represented the rather volatile seat of Forrest from 1943 to 1949. Subsequently, like Theodore and others, he went to New South Wales to seek a seat to return to the Parliament, which he did for some 18 months from 1954 to 1955. He served as a Minister for Works and Housing in the Chifley Ministry from November 1946 to December 1949. It is this public service which I think has attracted the most public attention surrounding the sad occasion of the death of Mr Lemmon. Obviously, the Curtin and Chifley governments occupy a fairly special place of respect among people in the Labor movement, somewhat akin to the Menzies Government to those opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I never had the pleasure of meeting Mr Lemmon, although I did invite him to the fortieth anniversary of Australian citizenship ceremony this year. It was only with great regret that he declined owing to problems with health. It is always difficult to speak about someone one has not met and to go only on the written record. Nevertheless, Nelson Lemmon was obviously a talented and very respected politician. It is no mean feat, even today, to be elected as a member of Cabinet at the age of 38, having spent only three years on the back bench. In the era of Menzies and Chifley, youthful achievement was rare. It shows how highly the Labor Party regarded Mr Lemmon. According to Chifley's biographer, Mr Lemmon, together with John Dedman and William Scully, constituted a farmers' union caucus within the Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> Although he was born and raised in Williamstown, Melbourne, Nelson Lemmon was by occupation a farmer, first in Ongerup in Western Australia and later in Robertson in New South Wales. I note that newspaper reports quote him as saying, `Politics was something I did, but farming was my life'. According to the journalist Don Whitington, writing in 1955, both Nelson Lemmon and John Dedman were briefly members of the Young Country Party. Given Mr Lemmon's family background, I am not sure whether that report is right. It just shows the appeal that the early Country Party had at the time to some forward-looking young farmers. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly Nelson Lemmon had a big passion for rural development. In 1949 he was appointed, as Senator Button has indicated, the Minister in charge of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority. It was a scheme that he pursued with as much vigour as possible, and it remains a testament to him and others. Mr Lemmon as Housing Minister was also responsible for the implementation of the war service homes housing loan scheme, again an ambitious scheme on a scale unprecedented in Australia's history. The close association of Nelson Lemmon and Ben Chifley was only one of a number that the then Labor Leader formed with younger parliamentarians in whom Chifley saw great potential. Together with Tom Burke, Fred Daly, Kim Beazley and others, Nelson Lemmon was identified by Chifley as someone who could be of vital importance to the future of the Labor Party in Australia. In Mr Lemmon's case that apparently went as far as Chifley seeing in him a future leader of the Labor Party. With Chifley's support, I understand, Mr Lemmon in fact topped the Caucus ballot for the Ministry in 1946. Following his defeat in Forrest, Mr Lemmon was apparently encouraged by Chifley to move to New South Wales in order to re-enter politics. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately for the Labor Party and Parliament, Mr Lemmon had only a relatively brief stay in Canberra, although in later years he seems to have given every indication of being glad to be out of it. Certainly the Labor Party in the doldrums of the 1950s and 1960s suffered from the absence of talented people such as Lemmon and Burke, and the political isolation of others like Beazley and Daly. It is one of the imponderables of politics to know what impact one of these players may have had on politics if they had continued in it. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I appreciated his continued and intelligent assessment of politics until the time of his death. A recent newspaper report quoted Mr Lemmon as saying that the current Government had `the ablest and smartest Federal Cabinet in Australia's history'. I am not sure everyone in the chamber will concur with that. I am sure that I speak for all honourable senators in extending this House's condolences and respects to his widow, Ada Mary, whom Nelson Lemmon married in 1930, and to his son and daughter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Justice. Is it a fact, as reported, that both the National Crime Authority (NCA) and the Australian Federal Police (AFP) have received information within the last two years raising concerns about the operations of the Victorian Division of the National Safety Council of Australia (NSCA), including an approach in November last year from the Council's Chairman, Mr Max Ieise? What was the nature of that information, from what sources did it come and, in particular, were allegations made that the NSCA and its missing Chief Executive, Mr John Friedrich, had been involved in international arms dealing and paramilitary training? What action did either agency take and what action are these agencies currently taking to investigate these claims?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was trying to be helpful.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought it was a serious question. The National Crime Authority has advised me that it became aware of certain allegations concerning the Victorian Division of the National Safety Council of Australia in October 1987. These allegations concerned possible involvement in arms deals in Third World countries and other arms dealings. That information was passed the same month to the Australian Federal Police because it was not relevant to matters being investigated by the National Crime Authority. In order to complete the picture on the National Crime Authority, which has not played a very great part in this, in late March 1989-in other words, just recently-the NCA received information concerning the possible whereabouts of Friedrich. That information was passed both to the Federal Police and the Victorian Police.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The main question is as to the matters raised in October 1987. I have indicated that the National Crime Authority passed those particular allegations concerning arms dealing, the employment of former military personnel and other activities apparently indicative of unlawful conduct to the Australian Federal Police. Those sorts of allegations were taken extremely seriously by the intelligence division of the AFP over the period October 1987 to March 1988 but nothing was found to substantiate those particular allegations.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Federal Police was first informed of possible fraud at the National Safety Council of Australia on 16 October 1988 when Mr Alex MacArthur, a former director of the NSCA, Queensland division, spoke with Assistant Commissioner Antill in Brisbane. MacArthur was advised that the matters raised were not for the AFP to investigate but should be referred to the Victorian Police if evidence of fraud was uncovered. It was indicated that perhaps independent auditors might be sought and it would be perhaps appropriate for the President of the NSCA to brief fully the Commissioner of the Victorian Police.</PARA>
<PARA> In the following weeks it was indicated that the Chief Commissioner of the Victorian Police had been briefed by the NSCA President, Mr Max Ieise, and new auditors had been appointed to look into the company's affairs. On 1 February 1989 Mr MacArthur again called on Antill and told him that he was concerned about information relating to John Friedrich's background and previous employment not checking out. For example, there was no record to confirm Friedrich's birth in South Australia as listed on his curriculum vitae.</PARA>
<PARA> Having regard to possible security implications, Antill then arranged for MacArthur to meet with the Queensland regional director of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). The meeting took place on 2 February 1989, with Antill present. Documents were handed to both Antill and the ASIO representative which showed that Friedrich was born in Germany. I believe it was a self-generated document in the sense that it was a marriage certificate.</PARA>
<PARA> No investigations into the alleged fraud were undertaken by the AFP because no Commonwealth offences were disclosed. Advice had been given to bring the matter to the attention of the Victorian Police. On 23 January 1989 Ieise met with AFP officers in Melbourne in relation to his concerns about Friedrich's activities. He was again advised that the matter was one for the Victorian Police. None of the information given by MacArthur or Ieise disclosed offences against Commonwealth laws. The matters appeared to fall within the jurisdiction of the Victorian Police and that is why the continual references were made to perhaps the Victorian Police or that the Chief Commissioner might be the person to approach. The Australian Federal Police, as honourable senators will know, offered every assistance to the Victorian Police in their investigation of the matter. That offer of assistance has been made continually to the Victorian Police.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister for Resources inform the Senate of the current stage of the North West Shelf gas project and, particularly, whether there are any indications of when the first export shipments will be made for this project? Further, can the Minister inform the Senate whether any formal decision has been made regarding the go ahead for the Goodwyn A development of North West Shelf gas?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="804" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="RESOURCES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Beahan for this question. The first shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) off the North West Shelf were, according to plan, due to commence on 1 October this year. The joint venture partners for the project have advised us that they will be ready to ship from 1 July this year. That is well ahead of the original date for shipment. Indeed, a compliment must be paid to them for their management of the development of the project and to the work force with whom they have gone about that development in being ready so far ahead of schedule. The date of actual shipment is not yet designated. Price negotiations for the export phase are current, and when those price negotiations have been finalised and the export approval has been issued by the Government a firm date for export will be available. So in terms of that part of Senator Beahan's question, I think we can say that this project, which is arguably at the present time the biggest single resource project in the world and certainly the single biggest resource project in Australia, has proceeded remarkably well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second part of Senator Beahan's question concerns the Goodwyn A platform. Honourable senators will know that discussion has been raging for some time as to whether Goodwyn A will be given the go-ahead by the joint venture partners. As I recall, that decision was to be made in February this year, but at that time the decision to give the go-ahead for the Goodwyn development was deferred. I can now announce that at 1300 hours Western Standard Time-I am announcing this ahead of the formal announcement-the joint venture partners, who have given their clearance for me to say this, will be announcing the go-ahead of the Goodwyn platform. The value of the Goodwyn A platform will be $1.63 billion. It will be the biggest single offshore platform facility in Australia since the mammoth North Rankin platform was constructed. Taken together with the commitment by the joint venture partners for the construction of a third LNG onshore processing train, it will take their total commitment over the last month to this project to $2.53 billion in total, which I believe is a commendable and, indeed, in anyone's terms, a massive commitment to development of our offshore gas and condensate reserves.</PARA>
<PARA> The Goodwyn A platform will be precisely located to take advantage of gas finds by the joint venture partners in the general vicinity of the North West Shelf and to maximise gas and condensate productions. It will feed the contracts they already have with Japanese utilities and with the State Energy Commission of Western Australia. It will have the capacity to produce 900 million standard cubic feet of gas per day and up to 80,000 barrels per day of condensate, making the project, as I have said, one of the most significant contributors in terms of Australia's liquid hydrocarbon production until the early part of the next century. Eventually 26 production wells will be feeding off the Goodwyn A platform. It will be completed in 1993 and it will eventually become necessary to have additional onshore gas facilities.</PARA>
<PARA> While I am on the subject, that is a remarkable vote of confidence by the joint venture partners not only in Australia's ability to manage its offshore production but also, given the very high Australian content in manufacturing and design that has gone into the production of the whole North West Shelf facility-some 73 per cent is sourced in Australia-in our ability to meet the demands of such a huge project.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the world market for LNG is very much on the rise. I visited Japan early in January. What is quite clear from the Japanese end is that they are seeking as an energy resource much more utilisation for power generation of LNG. It seems that in Japan there is some domestic concern about the problems of generating nuclear power. There is a desire to diversify their energy source mix away from coal as well. LNG, in terms of the Japanese power utilities, is seen as a growth fuel for the early part of the next century. It is premature to make speculative predictions about whether we will have a growing capacity to meet a growing demand from Japan because in the oil and gas exploration area one needs to be somewhat cautious about making predictions. In view of the oil finds in the North West Shelf area it is true to say that it seems that we have a fair reservoir--</PARA>

The potentiality of that field is to be, with further exploration, further proven up. I hope that we will make discoveries which will enable us to take part in exporting even more natural gas in the future from facilities such as this.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would not be known with any certainty when and where Mr Friedrich entered this country. Obviously we have been searching the files for some evidence of that but, of course, that presumes that he entered under the name of Mr Friedrich or some other known alias, and he may not have. The best possibility at this stage is that his entry to the country may have been on a transit visa for 72 hours. We are following up the leads and I do not want to explore them until we have some firm evidence. If that was the case security checks would be of a most minor nature. We should bear in mind that we are dealing with something that probably happened 14 years ago. It was quite common in the period from 1974 to 1976 for temporary visas to be granted while one was in transit, provided one could prove one was leaving the country with an outgoing air ticket, without any substantial checks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the third matter, a search of our files has not revealed that Mr Friedrich had Australian citizenship or was granted Australian citizenship. Senator Short would understand that there is some difficulty involved in searching records where at least three or four dates of birth are involved. We have found no evidence that Mr Friedrich was an Australian citizen. As I understand it he was not on the electoral roll and did not have a driver's licence or a passport. Investigations are continuing from our end but, again, I cannot guarantee that we will be able to find that material because we will not know, until Mr Friedrich is apprehended, how he arrived in the country.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In reply to the last part of the question, I do not think one fact in isolation proves anything, but it is clear evidence that the economic policies of Mrs Thatcher, whom I understand Mr Howard admires so much, have managed to produce inflation of the order of 8 per cent a year, in spite of an unemployment figure which I think is still in double figures, even after the UK Government has consistently fiddled the unemployment figures for about four years in succession. I have seen the article by Robert Hadler, and Mr Peacock is reported as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The implicit price deflator of gross non-farm product, a broader measure of inflation than the CPI, increased by 8.9 per cent in the year to the December quarter.</PARA>
<PARA>That seems to imply that because of that figure Australians should not receive income tax cuts on 1 July. The figure which Mr Peacock has used appears to have been taken from page 11 of yesterday's national accounts release. I have not had an exhaustive look through that release, but if Mr Peacock had taken the trouble to look at page 11 properly he would have seen why the figure for the implicit price deflator was so high when the figure for private consumption expenditure was just over 7 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> The figure was pushed up, or the discrepancy was accounted for, by a number of things. One of the major components was the increase of nearly 16 per cent in the housing price component, which refers to new housing only, in the gross domestic product deflator, and the second was a massive increase of nearly 23 per cent in the real estate transfer expenses component of the GDP deflator. Real estate agents, whose payments tend to be tied to house prices rather than the cost of the service delivered, were obviously major gainers during 1988 from the increased housing prices. Of course they are not wage and salary earners; they are by and large outside the wages system. But because housing prices surged in 1988 and real estate agents' incomes surged with them, Mr Peacock is proposing that ordinary wage earners who have abided by wage restraint policies should do without their tax cuts or make further sacrifices on the wages front. There does not seem to be very much sense in that.</PARA>
<PARA> The only other thing I would like to do is to canvass the possibility that Mr Peacock has received a limited and possibly misleading tutorial from Dr Hewson on the interpretation of the December quarter national accounts, and that until Mr Peacock learns how to interpret these accounts himself he should seek some other source of advice than Dr Hewson.</PARA>

Rather than canvassing those publicly at this stage, I have arranged a meeting with the Ombudsman this week-I think that meeting will be held on Thursday-in which we will discuss many of the issues that Senator Jenkins has raised today. Certainly, I can state, as a general outline in answer to the honourable senator's question, that we have ceased to collect the fees. We are currently finalising the regulations for the second application. I expect those to be in operation within two weeks. As to any question of refund of previous fees or legal costs incurred by one particular litigant, I will discuss that matter first with the Ombudsman before I canvass it publicly any further.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What information can the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade provide about the recent incidents in Namibia, apparently involving a serious breakdown of the cease-fire agreement? Can the Minister explain the implications of these developments for the contingent of Australian troops committed to the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG)?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="807" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say by way of background that the cease-fire arrangements under Security Council resolution 435 provide for the confinement of South African and insurgent forces to bases while arrangements are set up for elections and the transition to an independent government. Those arrangements also envisage the deployment of United Nations (UN) Transition Assistance Group forces to ensure the disarming and monitoring within those bases of the former combatant forces. The transition period began formally three days ago, on 1 April, but since then serious clashes have occurred between elements of the South African Defence Force and Namibian police and forces described from South African sources as belonging to the South West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO). The SADF and Namibian police elements have intercepted groups said to be moving across the Angolan border into northern Namibia in some of the most intense fighting that has occurred in the area for several years. According to South African figures, over 120 insurgents and 20 police have been killed in clashes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The South African Foreign Minister, Mr Pik Botha, has held talks through the UN special representative in Namibia, Mr Ahtisaari, which resulted in an agreement with the UN Secretary-General that SADF personnel who, under the UN plan, were to be, as I have said, confined to their bases in advance of their withdrawal, may be used in support of the Namibian police as an interim measure to contain the situation. In a message addressed to me on 2 April the South African Foreign Minister has drawn attention to the serious situation and asked the Australian Government to condemn the alleged SWAPO incursions.</PARA>
<PARA> The situation on the ground in northern Namibia since 1 April is confused and the full facts on the reported incursions are still very unclear. The critical element that we have been waiting for, as I have said publicly, is the report of the UNTAG investigation team which visited the area on 2 April and which has forwarded its results to the UN Secretary-General. I am able to advise the Senate that informal consultations have just concluded in New York between the Secretary-General and Security Council members. I do not yet have the details of their outcome, beyond a short statement issued by the Council Chairman from the Soviet Union. That statement does not provide full information on the incidents and their origins and it is becoming apparent that it may be some time before complete accounts become available.</PARA>
<PARA> However, while reserving final judgment in expectation of further information, may I say quite explicitly for the record that the Australian Government does condemn any acts which are in breach of the agreements reached in the context of Security Council resolution 435 and which could lead to the breakdown of the cease-fire at this delicate stage. The transitional arrangements in Namibia can work only if all parties strictly comply with their provisions, particularly in a situation where the UN at the moment does not have sufficient personnel to observe and monitor all aspects of the arrangements until its three infantry battalions are deployed.</PARA>
<PARA> Incursions by armed elements moving south across the Angola-Namibia border, to the extent that they have occurred, are to be deplored. Against this must be set the possibility that the lack at this stage of full UN deployments in the north may have resulted in some confusion in the situation and the absence of a clear understanding as to where armed elements should report. It may take some time for the UN to untangle this delicate situation, and all elements for a solution may not be in place until full UNTAG deployments are effected in the north.</PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, while appreciating the need to ensure basic security in the area, on behalf of the Australian Government I call on the South African authorities-as I already have in speaking yesterday to the South African Ambassador-to act with restraint and in full cooperation with UNTAG in restoring the situation. Likewise, I call on the former resistance forces to comply strictly with the accords and with the UN's efforts to bring the situation under control. Above all, it is in their interests that this plan should succeed.</PARA>
<PARA> I am sorry that this is a long answer, Mr President, but I need now to quickly address the final part of it, which relates to the implications of this for Australian forces. As to the question of whether this initial breakdown in the cease-fire will have longer term implications for the future of the transitional arrangements and UNTAG's role in them, I can only say that the Australian Government will keep the situation closely under review. An officer of my Department is currently in Grootfontein and we have established a liaison office in Windhoek to enable the Government to have first-hand information on the situation. Of the advance contingent of 80 Australian troops, none has been affected by the clashes of recent days. All of them are currently based in the town of Grootfontein in northern Namibia. The main contingent of 225 Australian forces is due to arrive in Namibia over the period 13 to 16 April. At this stage there are no plans to vary arrangements for the deployment of the main contingent.</PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps I should say finally that during my visit to New York two weeks ago I discussed the role of the UNTAG force with the UN Secretary-General, Perez de Cuellar, including the question of the size of the force. As a result of pressure from permanent members of the Security Council on budgetary grounds, a total deployment of 4,650 was authorised in the first instance as against the original upper ceiling of 7,500. However, the Secretary-General has retained the right to increase the force to the original number if he is satisfied that the situation on the ground requires it and I am sure, on the basis of my discussion with him, that he will be both able and willing to exercise his own unfettered judgment in this respect.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Justice. I remind him that on 9 March in answer to a question from Senator Archer he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The fact is that we believe the Australian Federal Police has the capacity to absorb the cost of that-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Winchester investigation-</PARA>
<PARA>operation within the moneys that are appropriated for their particular purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday the Government granted for Australian Federal Police (AFP) operations an additional $500,000 in funding which, according to the Minister's press release, is in part to alleviate pressure arising from the Winchester investigation. Is it not the case that the Minister knew on 9 March that other policing functions were having to be curtailed as a result of the cost of the Winchester and other major investigations? Why did he let the position develop so that, for example, one recent drug surveillance operation in Sydney ceased at 11 p.m. when the force ran out of overtime? Why did he not provide the funding on the initial advice of Commissioner McAulay rather than wait for the police to have to commence unprecedented industrial action before taking action? If the Winchester reward of $200,000 now offered by the Government is claimed, will it come out of Australian Federal Police funds, or is the Government making a genuine commitment?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="808" SPEAKER="Tate Sen The Hon M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is making a very genuine commitment to the future operations of the Australian Federal Police, the premier law enforcement agency at the Commonwealth level, operating throughout Australia. Indeed, it has been very pleasing to have the support of my Cabinet colleagues in obtaining extra funding for the Australian Federal Police which will enable some relief to be obtained from the restrictions which were in place. I have never denied during the last several weeks nor in this place that some rather severe curtailments of overtime and consequent penalty rates were put into place by the Commissioner, directing the various managers of the Australian Federal Police, in order to achieve the proper management of the budget that the AFP was given.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is, as I say, that the Cabinet decided yesterday to make an additional half a million dollars available in funding for the operations of the Australian Federal Police around Australia. The difficulties of the Australian Federal Police in relation to its budget were twofold. One was the failure of the management of the Australian Federal Police to achieve the offsets in savings which were required under the second tier arrangements. There was a requirement, for example, that rosters be reorganised and that allowances which depended on position rather than performance be done away with. These matters, because they were not dealt with by management as speedily or in as timely a fashion as they should have been, led to some of the problems in the budget. Also, considerable resources were devoted to the investigation into the killing of Assistant Commissioner Winchester.</PARA>
<PARA> Because of those strains, the AFP naturally sought some relief and the Federal Government was pleased to respond. Indeed, the Commissioner has now been able to put out a statement indicating that he found the injection of an additional half million dollars very welcome and that it would `ensure that important operations which were in accord with the Government's priorities would continue to be met'. As I emphasised at the time, I had sought and received the advice of the Commissioner to the effect that no major operations of the Australian Federal Police nor the safety of its members were imperilled by the particular stringencies which he imposed in the various regions and in the Australian Capital Territory. The Australian Federal Police Association, in its response yesterday, said in relation to the Government:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . speaks well of their commitment to the AFP and to the public.</PARA>
<PARA>So I believe that the Government, not only in relation to the particular matter that has arisen over the last few weeks but also over the last three or four years, has shown a quite unequalled commitment to ensuring that the Australian Federal Police achieves the focus and attains the goals that have been set for it. For example, the Government approved an extra 294 staff for the AFP under the force development program over the three years 1985-88 at a cost of $9m per annum. A further $3m was allocated in 1988-89 to provide up to 85 additional staff under a new force development program. That is just one instance of many that I could give of the commitment of this Government in budgetary terms.</PARA>
<PARA> The final question was about the reward offer, which is still in place. The reward is a very important element of the investigation into the killing of Assistant Commissioner Winchester. It has three elements. The first is the money, the second is the offer of protection to an informant, and the third escapes me for the moment. But the reward offer, in so far as it embraces a money element, is to be funded separately if it is called upon by the Minister.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator will have to wait a few minutes while he listens to this answer. It is going to take a little while.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am telling everybody that investment is taking place; that is all I am saying. Business investment in equipment grew by 19.6 per cent in the quarter and, relatively speaking, consumption growth has been moderate. This pattern of growth is consistent with what the Government has been saying. Close examination of the data reveals that the strong growth in demand and in imports is generated by productive investment that will enhance Australia's industrial capacity, especially in the export and import competing sectors. By way of illustration, I will outline how this strong overall investment performance is influencing some key sectors such as the metals and engineering sector. The Metals Trades Industry Association recently released the results of its 1989 national survey of the metal and engineering industry which showed that over 80 per cent of firms are operating at busy or very busy levels of activity. The survey is the largest and most comprehensive of its type in Australia and covers more than 1,000 companies employing more than 150,000 people. The data shows a further improvement in the state of the industry as well as demonstrating an improvement in export sales. It confirms that the industry is actively restructuring and investing in new plant and equipment to provide a case for increased productive and export capacity. At the same time, Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows that the engineering construction sector's output rose by 15 per cent in the December quarter. A large proportion of that increase was in the heavy engineering sector, buoyed by the strong investment activity in the mineral based industries, especially in oil--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose Senator Walters wants me to compare it with the United States or the United Kingdom as she did last year. I will do it for her if she wants. A large proportion of that increase was in the heavy engineering sector, buoyed by strong investment activity in the mineral based industries, especially oil and gas refineries, coal processing facilities and chemical plants. Of course, the Government is concerned about whether strong overall economic growth may not be sustainable over the long term because of the pressure this generates in balance of payments and prices. The composition of this demand, concentrated as it has been in capital expenditure, no doubt has been beneficial for economic restructuring. The correct mix of tight monetary, fiscal and wages policy is in place and will be maintained to address this pressure.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Justice. Is the Government seeking to resolve its Australian Federal Police funding problems by withdrawing the AFP's airport security function and transferring that role to the State police?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Any decision by the Government to transfer the uniformed policing role of the Australian Federal Police at airports to State or Northern Territory police forces would not be undertaken with any budgetary motive impelling such a decision. It would be taken because the anti-terrorist report provided to the Government by Mr Holdich in 1986 indicated that the functions of uniformed policing conducted by the Australian Federal Police at certain security designated airports were threefold: one was community policing, which obviously could be well undertaken by State police forces; another was to act as something of a deterrent just by their mere presence; and the other was a holding operation in case of a terrorist incident. The advice to the Government in that report was that it would be better to have integrated lines of command with no difficulty whatsoever in transfer of responsibility for resolving an incident. A much clearer integrated response could be achieved if the uniformed police force conducting the holding operation was the police force that would actually help resolve the incident. It was in order to get that continuity that the advice was given that we should seek to place the State or Northern Territory police forces in the airports concerned. It would be those motives which would impel the Government to such a decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> May I also point out that there is a separate operation by the Australian Federal Police at major airports, called Portswatch, which, as Senator Archer would recall, is a non-uniformed police presence which, of course, would not be affected by such a decision. Those are more detective type functions, rather than the community policing or anti-terrorist type holding operation functions in respect of which, as I say, the advice received by the Government back in 1986 was to the effect that they would best be undertaken by one integrated, uniformed police force.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under arrangements of, I think, some four years duration, the States and Territories are eligible for natural disaster relief payments for such things as cyclones, floods and storms, subject to certain criteria. The arrangements recognise that the States have the primary responsibility for limited disasters. Consequently up to a threshold level, which I think is 0.225 per cent of a State's total annual budget sector revenue and grants two years earlier, the States accept all the responsibility. For the tranche-I am going from memory here-equal to 75 per cent of that amount, the costs are shared dollar for dollar between the State and the Commonwealth. Beyond that second tranche of payments, the Commonwealth pays $3 for every State dollar.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are guidelines which are agreed for the declarations of those disasters or adverse storms, floods and so on which qualify for relief. The relief includes grants for the relief of personal hardship and distress, that is, for the provision of emergency food, clothing and accommodation; and concessional loans to farmers and small businesses, and needy persons and voluntary non-profit bodies whose assets have been significantly damaged and who have no reasonable access to commercial finance. I might say at this point that that particular condition appears to have been repeatedly breached by the Queensland Government over a number of years, not so much with respect to flood or storm damage to my knowledge but with respect to so-called drought. There are also grants for public undertakings for restoration of essential public assets such as roads, buildings and bridges. But the guidelines do not normally include damage to State government business enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth will continue to apply these conditions for the current flood and storm damage in Queensland and New South Wales, but as yet I am in no position to make an estimate of the payments that are likely to be made-although in the case of Queensland I understand the second tranche of the cost sharing arrangements has already been passed and any additional payments in this financial year will be shared $3 Commonwealth dollars to one Queensland Government dollar, which is of course a quite generous arrangement. The Commonwealth will stand by those commitments for the present flood and cyclone damage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the article in today's Australian Financial Review headed `Timor Gap remains off limits'. I think there is a fundamental misunderstanding by the writer of what the Government did. Yesterday I announced the release of oil exploration acreage for bidding for oil exploration companies, and the bids are now open. Maps and seismic data are available from the Department. Those areas for bidding are in the Timor Sea, Bass Strait and western Tasmania. The purpose for those biddings is that they are areas of reasonable prospectivity. It is part of our annual program to release, sequentially, areas of offshore Australia for private companies to bid for the right to explore for oil. The basis of determining those bids is on which company is going to put together the best work program which would justify us releasing those areas for their exclusive exploration for the particular period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is a normal, regular and routine procedure by the Commonwealth. To confuse that with the Timor Sea joint development zone between Australia and Indonesia is to make a fundamental error. The negotiations for the joint development zone with Indonesia are on track. They were never thought to be available for exploration by this time. It was announced in October last year that it was hoped that within 12 months the negotiations would be concluded. The expectation is that the negotiation will be concluded this calendar year. The negotiations are proceeding well and the prospect is that we will meet that target. There is this fundamental misunderstanding because the speculative hype that has been developing over the Timor Sea has obscured the fact that there are still a lot of offshore areas available for exploration which should be taken up by Australian or overseas companies to explore for oil, and they hold reasonable prospects of finding oil or hydrocarbons. That should not in any way be confused with the Timor Sea.</PARA>

Last year Esso approached the Commonwealth for a reduction in excise because the price of oil had fallen. The price of oil was looking as though it would fall below $10 per barrel. We are now seeing, for West Texas Intermediate, a benchmark crude of above $20 a barrel. We offered Esso a reduction in excise because of the falling price last year. Esso knocked back that reduction. What it is now doing is advertising that the tax regime should be reduced or lessened in some way in order that there be an incentive to encourage it to do more. What Esso would be better doing, rather than wasting its money on a non-productive advertising campaign, is to spend some of that money on doing some of the things that it said it would do if the excise were reduced. It has had its opportunity to get a reduced excise. It refused that, and now the price of oil is so sufficient as to not require the Commonwealth to make that offer a second time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. It refers specifically to the full-page advertisement that the Government had placed in the Australian at the weekend dealing with the declaration at The Hague. Did the Minister say at The Hague on 11 March, `Climate change and the protection of the atmosphere is the biggest problem, the biggest challenge, faced by mankind in this or any other age.'? Is the Minister aware that climatologists predict that, as a result of greenhouse warming, tropical cyclones are likely to become more intense and move further south in Australia? Is he, therefore, aware that the cyclone presently approaching the Queensland coast is consistent with greenhouse warming and that this phenomenon is likely to become more intense and more frequent? Does the Minister still support Australia's strong and continued dependence on coal and forest exports? In the light of his expressed concern that this is the biggest challenge faced by mankind in this and any other age, will he now be advising his colleagues to change Australia's present export policy?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="814" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did say at The Hague on 11 March, in signing the declaration for Australia, the words Senator Coulter retails about the atmospheric problems being the biggest challenge that we confront in the decades ahead. In that speech I was referring not only to the greenhouse effect but to the question of the depletion of the ozone layer and the whole series of related climatic phenomena which together constitute such a problem. As to the second part of Senator Coulter's question, I am aware that some studies suggest that tropical cyclone activity may become more intense and move further south as a result of the greenhouse effect. I am also aware, as I said in another part of the speech I gave in The Hague, that it is not possible to predict with certainty the likely impact of the greenhouse effect on the global climate, and it is even more difficult to predict climate changes on a regional basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the third part of the question, while the cyclone approaching the Queensland coast may be consistent with some predictions of the consequences of the greenhouse effect, I believe that there is general agreement among the scientific community that the various scenarios of climate change that have been developed in recent years cannot and should not be tested against current actual climate. If we base our perception of climate change on short term variations in the climate there is a very real danger that our recognition of the importance of the greenhouse issue may be reversed as a result of subsequent short term climate pattern variations of that kind. It is for that reason that the declaration adopted at The Hague, with strong support from Australia, stressed the need for more scientific work and more research on the causes and implications of climatic change and, indeed, warned against the kind of instant coffee analysis that we get from people such as Senator Coulter on occasions such as this.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, as to the last part of his question, about coal and forest exports, it is wildly premature at this stage to be contemplating any unilateral action of the kind that Senator Coulter recommends, with his feet firmly planted in mid-air as usual. Atmospheric protection is a global problem which demands a global response. Obviously, fossil fuel burning and the preservation of forests, which as has been well said are the lungs of the planet, are important issues that will have to be addressed by the world at large over the period ahead. They are issues with which we are all going to have to grapple, but on the basis of fair and equitable international burden-sharing, which is another theme of The Hague declaration, which I am glad Senator Coulter read in the advertisement which appeared in the newspapers over the weekend, I simply make the point that the beginnings of a rational response to these questions, and in particular, the question of fossil fuel burning, would be for us to reduce our dependence on fossil fuel burning in favour of much greater reliance on nuclear energy in the period ahead. But I suppose getting Senator Coulter, or any other Australian Democrat, to espouse that little bit of rationality in response to this huge international problem is more than we can reasonably expect.</PARA>

I am very interested in the Minister's reply and the indication that he has very little understanding of the nuclear inability to solve that problem. I draw his attention to one of the sections of the declaration of The Hague, to which he is apparently a signatory, because his signature appeared on that page-unless, of course, he regards Australia as a banana republic. The Declaration of The Hague says, among other things:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Most of the emissions that affect the atmosphere at present originate in the industrialised nations. And it is in these same nations that the room for change is greatest, and these nations are also those which have the greatest resources to deal with this problem effectively.</PARA>
<PARA>Is the Minister aware that Australia, with only 0.3 per cent of the global population, nonetheless contributes to 1.5 per cent of global carbon dioxide? In view of Senator Button's reply to an earlier question and Senator Cook's replies to two questions earlier with respect to coal, petroleum and natural gas, I ask the Minister again: will he press his colleagues to shift the Government's emphasis away from encouraging the export of coal, petroleum and gas into other areas?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Coulter acknowledges that the rest of the industrialised world contributes something like 98.5 per cent to the problem, so any contribution that we might make to its resolution is not going to make much difference unless it is done in unison with the other industrialised nations of the world. It is a global problem which demands a global response. It may well be that part of that response is to reduce dependence on the particular kinds of fuel burning that are particularly harmful in this respect. That is cheerfully acknowledged, but to hare off on wide-eyed unilateral action of the kind that is promoted by the Australian Democrats, with utter and total disregard for the economic implications of what they are proposing and the context in which these things have to be addressed, is, as I say, to follow the prescriptions of those who simply do not have their feet on the ground.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crichton-Browne asked me a question without notice on 9 March 1989, and I sought an answer from the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC), which provided the following information: the Western Australian region of the ADC requested an additional $30,000 for its 1988-89 administrative budget on 18 January 1989. This request was amended to $224,000 on 3 February 1989 following discussions with senior head office (HO) staff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was then asked whether the Acting General Manager of the ADC, Mr Cedric Wyatt, refused this request. The answer is that Mr Wyatt did not refuse the request at any stage.

<PARA> I was then asked whether the Western Australian office would close down the following week. The answer is that the Regional Manager of the Western Australian region sought approval from the Acting General Manager on 7 March 1989 to advise branch managers to cease field operations at close of business on 7 March 1989. The Acting General Manager did not approve the request and the Western Australian offices did not close down. The Acting Assistant General Manager (Administration) had informed the Western Australian Regional Manager, in a number of telephone conversations that, notwithstanding serious concerns expressed about financial administration in the Western Australian region, the recommendation for supplementary funds of $128,000 would be considered on the merits of the case at the proper time. In the event, the Acting General Manager approved the recommendation on 15 March 1989.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I rise to speak briefly on the 1987-88 annual report of the Young Endeavour Youth Scheme. My actions today have been prompted by the opportunity which I had to examine the Young Endeavour during its visit to Hobart for the tall ships race. I can certainly tell those who have not had the opportunity to see this vessel under full sail, apart from the photograph on the front of the report of course, that it is a magnificent sight. The grace and beauty of tall ships evoke memories of the old sailing ships which once sailed the world's trade routes and contributed so much to Australia's early development. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Young Endeavour was in Hobart, I spoke to some of the officers and crew members, and it was obvious that the concept of involving young people in sail training programs was very well received by all concerned. The Young Endeavour, as honourable senators are probably all aware, came to Australia as a bicentennial gift from the United Kingdom. It provides an opportunity for young people to develop, to mature and to equip themselves for their later role in modern society. In addition, crew members also have the opportunity to learn sailing and nautical skills. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also appropriate that I pause briefly to make a quick remark about the Lady Nelson project. This ship is to become a sail training vessel in my State of Tasmania. The Lady Nelson will seek to provide young people with experiences similar to those which they may get on the Young Endeavour. The community support for the Lady Nelson project has been outstanding, and I believe crews are now being trained so that an intense sail training program can be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> I note with interest that crew for the Young Endeavour are selected from all types of backgrounds, and I believe this principle should be adhered to if the aims and objectives are to be best realised. One aspect of the vessel's program which has not received much publicity has been the number of one-day cruises which operate each year for groups of disabled people. Whilst these individuals participating in these voyages are unable physically to involve themselves to the level of other participants, they are nevertheless encouraged to take part as much as possible in the practical training and sailing of the ship. Three one-day cruises for the disabled were held in Port Phillip Bay in March and another four in Moreton Bay in May and June. I am confident that the Young Endeavour will fulfil a vital role in introducing young people to the life skills which they will need to be successful in their later years. Let us hope that before too much longer the vessel will have the opportunity to visit some of our more isolated ports so that the spirit and purpose of this venture can be relayed to those communities. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I raise the very real concern which came out of what has been known as the Zemskov affair. Not surprisingly, the Government seeks from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), as we understand it, security assessments before Australia grants visas to foreign diplomats who are due to arrive in this country. As I said, that seems to be a sensible approach. However, what does not seem to be sensible is the fact that we saw in the Zemskov affair the granting of a visa before ASIO made, and delivered to the Government, its assessment. I ask: What is the point of seeking from our principal security intelligence organisation advice as to whether a visa should be given to a foreign diplomat to enter this country if the Government is not prepared to wait until it receives that advice and take it into account in determining whether or not to give the visa?</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of Mr Zemskov it seems that information produced by ASIO and delivered to the Government was such that the Government may well have had to give very serious consideration as to whether the visa should have been granted. Of course, it was pre-empted from doing so by the fact that Mr Zemskov was already in Australia. I suggest that that practice of the Government undermines ASIO's confidence. It would also have the effect to some extent of undermining the community's confidence in the work that ASIO does. This area is of principal importance to the security of this country. ASIO is skilled and is now well-resourced. Its views should be properly taken into account by government. I hope that a repeat of the Zemskov affair, when the Government did not wait for a security clearance before granting a visa, does not occur again. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the only matter I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate. I am sorry that I did not find reference to it in the report because I think it would have been reasonable for ASIO, which we now know has privately complained to the Government about its practice in this regard, to have put on the public record so that we all would have known of that deficiency in government practice and would have been able to use our endeavours to express to the Government the importance of awaiting security clearances and seriously taking them into account in a decision to grant or not to grant visas. I understand that my colleague Senator Michael Baume wishes to raise a matter on the Auditor-General's assessment of ASIO. I defer to him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) has a special responsibility to conduct its affairs, particularly its financial affairs, in a squeaky-clean way. After all, it is not obliged to provide copies of its reports to this Parliament. We have to depend on an auditor's certificate to establish that the No. 1 account, which is a relatively public account, is kept properly, whereas details of the No. 2 account, which involves expenditure directly related to intelligence service activities, is a private account. Details are certainly not disclosed and it comprises only a small proportion of the total Budget allocation which, in the latest year, was $35.73m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am most concerned about this report to Parliament by ASIO for a couple of reasons. In the first place, it is another manifestation of the sloppy management of this Government in its manner of advising the Parliament of what has actually happened among its agencies. This report for the year ended June 1988 was dated 13 February by the Director-General in his letter to the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) and is now presented to the Parliament in April. There remain only three months of the current financial year. So we have received this report nine months later, which makes a mockery of the comment towards the end of the report about the year ahead. During 1988-89, among its major emphases ASIO expects to do a whole range of things. Naturally, it would be able to say that with some confidence because the year is three-quarters over. It would certainly have some knowledge of what it expects to do in the year ahead when the year is almost completed. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the question of the audit, because I believe this a matter of some significance. As I said, ASIO, being a secret organisation and not being obliged to provide accounts in its annual report, has a special responsibility to behave in the most careful and proper way in the handling of finance. Page 47 of the report reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Audit</PARA>
<PARA>Officers of the Australian Audit Office examined ASIO's No. 1 Account and its supporting records during the year. </PARA>
<PARA>They are the matters we do not see, by the way. It continues:</PARA>

<PARA>Delays in implementing improvements to the maintenance of photographic and electrical equipment asset registers-</PARA>
<PARA>and this one grabs me-</PARA>
<PARA>Continued inability to reconcile a Central Office bank account. </PARA>
<PARA>We have no idea of the magnitude of these problems. All we know is that the Auditor-General says that ASIO has not done its job properly in this area. It has a special responsibility to do the job properly because of the secret and confidential nature of what it does. I am not pressing for this information to be made public. I am simply pressing for a better job to be done and for this Government-particularly the Department of Finance, which is supposed to supervise these things-to take a stronger and more effective role in government which, of course, it is not too good at. It should make certain that its operations work properly. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The Director-General-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Director-General of ASIO-</PARA>
<PARA>advised the Auditor-General of action taken or planned to resolve these matters. When these actions are accomplished, ASIO will have achieved a considerable improvement in the administration of its expenditure . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We have no indication of when these actions are likely to be accomplished. Have they been accomplished? What are the actions, anyway, and can we have confidence, at this stage, nine months after the end of the financial year, that ASIO has its financial house in order? If ASIO expects to be treated in the manner which I am certain that members on this side would like to treat it-that is, with respect-it must respond effectively and properly in its financial management. According to this report, it appears to have failed to do so. We have no idea of the magnitude of the problem. I hope for ASIO's sake that it is small, but we have no way of telling. That gives ASIO a special responsibility which, unfortunately, on this occasion it has not lived up to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the annual report of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). I remind the Senate that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation was a creation of a Labor Government in the late 1940s. However much one might dislike the idea of intelligence organisations probing into the affairs of a country, they are absolutely necessary from a security point of view. It would be no overstatement to say that those on this side of the chamber have some grave reservations as to how efficient ASIO has become under the present administration. We have seen three directors in the time that Labor has been in office here. We have seen an evangelistic ideologue, in the form of Senator Evans when he was Attorney-General, who apparently dramatically changed the operational parameters under which ASIO worked without affecting the legislation; but, in practice, the way the organisation pursued its activities allegedly was changed dramatically. Whether it was changed for the better is a point that has never been established. Sadly, Senator Evans has now gone on to the ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he controls the other security body, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service. It is presumed that significant changes have been made to the only two security bodies we have in this country. We simply do not know whether those changes have been for the benefit and the welfare of the Australian community at all, and some of us suspect that they may be for the worse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation report by Mr Moten, who is the new Director-General, is an interesting and worthwhile report to have before us, but it is really an administrative document. It tells what ASIO's functions are and, in simple terms, how it goes about what it sets out to do. Unfortunately, it does not give any details at all as to what it is actually doing, beyond listing the number of people who applied for security clearance during the year, which really is an irrelevant and meaningless statistic. It would be possible, in my judgment, to have a more comprehensive report of its field activities without compromising security in any way. I believe that the Parliament and the Australian community would support bodies such as ASIO and their activities if the community were better informed. I do not believe that in the modern age the absolute cloak of secrecy aids the acceptance of these bodies in our society in any way. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the point that Senator Hill raised in relation to the Zemskov affair. What is the point of having a body such as ASIO if the Government goes ahead willy-nilly and appoints diplomats before the security clearance is received? Like it or not, it happens to be one of the standard procedures that one looks at diplomats before their credentials are accepted in the host country. It is not something that only Australia does; every country does that. People known to have been engaged to varying degrees in spying activities are not accepted on the diplomatic list. In the case of Mr Zemskov, the Government went ahead before the ASIO report came in. The ASIO report identified Mr Zemskov as a member of an ultra-secret group, an elite group, of the KGB. Senator Hill did not say this, but it would have been quite possible for the Government to have withdrawn Mr Zemskov's visa. That would have been the correct procedure for the Government to have followed. It has been an absolute rule, whether a Liberal government or a Labor government has been in power federally in Australia, that anyone identified as a KGB agent has not been allowed diplomatic entry. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I reiterate the request I made earlier-that Mr Moten in next year's report give us some insight into the broad areas in which ASIO is operating and what difficulties it has in operating so that we in the Parliament can support it in its essential function. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The annual report of the Department of Industrial Relations is a curious document, particularly in the context of the present situation with Australian wages growth, which is running at about 7 per cent on the latest survey estimates, far above the Budget estimates and far above all the measures which are reasonable. This indicates to us that Australia is doing badly on the comparative costs scale and particularly on the scale of productivity. At the same time as wages growth is running at around 7 per cent, labour productivity in Australia is estimated by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development to be running at an annual rate of only 0.3 per cent, only about a quarter of the average for the OECD countries, which at present average around 1.2 per cent. Looking at a table of productivity growth, one will see that it is hard to find any country of any substance with a lower productivity increase than Australia. To measure productivity the Government uses a curious measurement which is totally misleading. The figures in the OECD economic survey are the accurate ones, for those who do not want to be fooled by this Government. Certainly labour productivity is estimated to be running at an annual rate of 0.3 per cent, compared to the rate for the OECD of 1.2 per cent. The rate in the United Kingdom is 1.8 per cent; the rate in Japan is 2.2 per cent; and the rate in the United States is 0.8 per cent. I refer to those countries because they are our major trading partners. It is clearly unsatisfactory that we are having that appalling productivity rate at the same time as we are having a large wages growth. Taken together, nominal unit labour costs growth in Australia has accelerated and has been consistently double the rate of our major trading partners. As Syntec noted recently:</PARA>
<PARA>We have drifted higher and higher in relative costs, which tells us that the much-vaunted Accord is not yet doing its job. </PARA>
<PARA>We are told that the accord is the answer to all problems. If this is the outcome of the accord, it appears to have helped create problems rather than resolve them. The cost of the Government's failure to control nominal unit labour costs is high inflation, deteriorating competitiveness, lower living standards and, for all those people who are unable to meet their mortgage repayments, much higher interest rates. The solution is not to lower wages-and the rigid system the Government supports seems to offer only that solution-but to increase productivity by encouraging investment and more efficient workplaces. That is what is clearly needed in Australia. It is in this latter area that the Department of Industrial Relations has failed. Its major contribution in recent years has been the Industrial Relations Bill, which represents a missed opportunity for genuine reform, although it claims on page 3 of the report that the Act `overcomes deficiencies and sets the direction which the Government believes Industrial Relations should take'. </PARA>
<PARA> The report's comments on page 3 also make interesting reading, claiming that wages policy `has been able to provide appropriate responses to a rapidly changing and difficult economic environment'. That is a curious conclusion in view of the disastrous growth in nominal unit labour costs and the productivity figures which show a lack of adequate growth. Overall, this annual report does little more than outline the basic failure of this Government in its major area of industrial relations, an area in which it claims to have succeeded. When we look at the facts, look at what is happening internationally, look at what is happening to our productivity, and look at what is happening to our comparative wages and costs compared to the rest of the world, it is revealed that this report is simply the report of yet another governmental failure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is unfair to talk about productivity in the round. There are certain very efficient industries and services, and there are some very inefficient industries and services. My concern is that the Government's policy on wages at present-and indeed the policy of the Australian Council of Trade unions (ACTU) at present-is discriminating against the efficient industries. It is discriminating against those workers who over the years have ensured that there was no featherbedding and that their industries and services were in fact efficient. For example, offsets were required under the 4 per cent second tier arrangement. Some workers did not get that 4 per cent second tier increase until many months after the inefficient industries received it. Those inefficient industries could offer employers trade-offs and therefore immediately gain the 4 per cent increase. The efficient industries and services which had no fat to give away were thus denied that increase for many months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This situation is arising again because of the policy of the Government and the Department of Industrial Relations. They are about to say that workers will be able to get an increase in wages in return for award restructuring and multiskilling. What about those industries and services which are efficient and which have already achieved multiskilling and award restructuring? Are employees in those industries to be denied again for many months the increases in wages to which they are entitled? Is this Government being fair in imposing that sort of policy on the trade union movement, particularly on that section of the trade union movement that has played it fair all along the line?</PARA>
<PARA> I get a bit sick and tired of hearing about the inefficiency of Australian workers. Some workers are efficient and some are not. At present the policy of the Government and the Department of Industrial Relations is to favour those industries which have been inefficient and to give the money to the workers in them. These industries, because they have the ability to trade off, have the ability to have some of their feather bedding unfeathered. But the workers in those industries which do not have that ability, who have done the right thing over the years, are going to be made to suffer again. This is not the last time that honourable senators are going to hear me speak on this matter in this chamber or outside of it. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one in the Australian Council of Trade Unions is prepared to get up and say what he thinks. Plenty of unions in the ACTU and members of the Australian Labor Party know that they have been sold down the river by this Government in respect of the shoddy deals that have taken place and the fix-ups that have involved the Department of Industrial relations, the ACTU and the Government. The accord is an accord only for the fat cats and others who are able to give way in order to get their increases. I am concerned about workers in those industries which have done the right thing over the years. I am concerned that they have been sold a pup. </PARA>

<PARA>In the few minutes at my disposal I would like to make a few points on the Arbitration Inspectorate report. Overall, during the 1987-88 reporting year 22,071 inspections were completed involving 520 different awards covering 237,600 employees, and 35,277 prima facie Federal award breaches were detected. A total of $5,606,809 was paid to 21,470 employees by 4,444 employers in voluntary termination of award breaches and the courts upheld prosecutions in relation to 19 matters involving 238 breaches. The courts imposed penalties of $11,810 and made orders for payment of $15,028. Fewer employers made payments than in 1986-87 but more breaches were rectified and more employees received payments. </PARA>
<PARA> The 35 per cent increase in monetary recoveries, equal to $1.46m, was substantially enhanced by recoveries under two awards. A recovery of $487,647 was made under the Supermarket Meat Employees Award 1976. A further $418,761--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reports I have tabled relate to three projects considered by the Public Works Committee in December 1988 and brings the number of reports presented by the Committee this year to six. In relation to the proposal to redevelop facilities at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Organisation (CSIRO) North Ryde site, the Committee has concluded that to support Australia's research performance in the areas of biotechnology, mining and minerals and energy there is a need to construct new research facilities and to replace existing inadequate structures. The cost of the work is estimated to be $18.5m at August 1988 prices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> CSIRO informed the Committee that the current proposal is the first stage of the redevelopment of the North Ryde site. Future works are expected for the divisions of Exploration Geoscience and Coal Technology and include:</PARA>
<PARA>progressive demolition of 1500 square metres of substandard buildings;</PARA>
<PARA>refurbishment of 2000 square metres of existing accommodation;</PARA>
<PARA>construction of 8500 square metres of new accommodation; and</PARA>
<PARA>improvements to roads, site entry, car parks and landscaping. </PARA>
<PARA>These works are expected to be undertaken by the year 2000 at an estimated cost of some $40m at current prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's final report in relation to the National Biological Standards Laboratory (NBSL) is for the construction of a laboratory complex of some 17 900 square metres and the conversion of an existing laboratory at Symonston, ACT at an estimated cost of $51.4m at July 1988 prices. The Committee tabled an interim report relating to this project on 30 November 1988, indicating that it would be recommending in its final report the construction of the works in this particular reference. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's inquiry into the NBSL project is the second time that a proposal to upgrade NBSL accommodation has been examined by the Committee. In its ninth report of 1979 the Committee recommended the construction of a purpose designed complex for the NBSL at an estimated cost of $26 billion at June 1979 prices. Preliminary site works were completed but the project did not proceed beyond that stage due to a series of reviews and inquiries into Commonwealth functions, including the NBSL. </PARA>
<PARA> Having examined a number of laboratories occupied by the NBSL in Canberra, the Committee has concluded that there is an urgent need for the construction of a single purpose building complex for the NBSL. The Committee believes the work is necessary to overcome the problems caused by the poor state of much of NBSL's present accommodation and its dispersed distribution over many sites and buildings, which has resulted in a number of operational, managerial and scientific inefficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The final report I tabled refers to the construction of a shell filling facility for St Marys Munitions Filling Factory, New South Wales, at an estimated cost of $7.7m at April 1988 prices. The new facility will replace facilities which have been operating since 1958 and which have not reached the end of their economic life due to high usage and general wear and corrosion. In addition, fume, dust and noise levels exceed current regulatory standards. The existing facility also fails to meet North Atlantic Treaty Organisation safety principles, particularly in respect of safety distances from inhabited buildings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Defence advised the Committee that it expected the urban encroachment in the longer term-that is, beyond 25 years-would require the transfer of the Munitions Filling Factory to another location. This is estimated to cost half a billion dollars. Following assurances from the Department of Defence and in view of the excellent safety record of the St Marys Munitions Filling Factory, the Committee is satisfied that safety risks posed by the proposed facility are minimal. The reports are recommended. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is twofold. It aims firstly to streamline reporting arrangements for higher education institutions under the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act 1986, and secondly to adjust the Act to reflect the circumstances of institutions planning or undergoing amalgamations in accordance with this government's policy on higher education.</PARA>
<PARA> The Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act 1986 covers higher education institutions and all private sector organisations which employ 100 or more people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act requires employers to introduce an affirmative action program to eliminate discrimination in employment against women, and to ensure equality of opportunity in employment for women. </PARA>
<PARA> Employers are also required to report annually to the Director of Affirmative Act on the progress of their programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act became effective for higher education institutions on 1 October 1986. Coverage of the private sector was phased in over a period of three years, with employers of 1,000 or more persons covered from 1 February 1987, employers of 500 or more people from 1 February 1988 and employers of 100 or more people from 1 February this year. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been an excellent response of the Australian employers to the legislation in the first year of the Act's operation. One hundred per cent of higher education institutions, and ninety-nine per cent of the largest private sector organisations met their reporting obligations under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> This excellent level of compliance reflects the high degree of support for the Act and its objectives across all sectors of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It also reflects the professional manner in which the Affirmative Action Agency has carried out its responsibilities and the co-operative relationship it has established with industry. This Government has held to its commitment, in turn, to ensure that administrative tasks associated with the requirement to report under the Act are minimised. </PARA>
<PARA> A range of initiatives have been taken to standardise reporting and to inform employers in clear terms of their obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill builds further on this commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> Higher education institutions in New South Wales and Western Australia are currently covered by both state and federal legislation requiring the development of programs designed to provide equal employment opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act 1986 relates to women, and the state legislation in both states to aboriginals, people of ethnic background and the physically disabled. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently the reporting periods specified in these Acts are different. The object of this Bill in its first aspect is to move towards a common reporting date of 1 January for institutions in respect of both their federal and state reporting obligations. Under the proposed amendment, institutions would report for the period 1 January-31 December on 1 January in the following year. Relevant authorities in New South Wales and Western Australia have agreed in turn to bring their statutory reporting date into line with the 1 January reporting date proposed in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The choice of a calendar year reporting period of 1 January-31 December reflects better the administrative arrangements of the institutions themselves. It would bring the processes of program development and reporting closer in line with the normal cycle of the institution. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed Bill would therefore greatly assist institutions in meeting their obligations under the federal and state legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill further provides for transitional arrangements to preserve the reporting arrangements of institutions on the changeover to the proposed 1 January reporting date. </PARA>
<PARA> The higher education sector, like other industries throughout Australia, is undergoing significant restructuring. As part of this restructuring many institutions are considering or planning amalgamations. The creation of fewer larger institutions reflects the Government's commitment to the consolidation of institutions as set out in Higher Education: A Policy Statement-The White Paper-July 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill in its second aspect seeks to adjust to the changing circumstances created through amalgamations. It would ensure that institutions that amalgamate will not be regarded as new employers under the Act following the amalgamation. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Affirmative Action Act, there is a hiatus between when an institution is created and when it is covered by the legislation. This hiatus is especially problematic when that new institution is created as a result of the amalgamation of existing institutions covered by the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The interruption to the affirmative action program caused by this gap in coverage is not in the interests of the program and its objectives. Further, it needlessly complicates the requirements on employers by presenting changed circumstances with which they must deal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill in this aspect therefore seeks to ensure continuity of the program and to preserve reporting requirements. The proposed amendments offer certainty to institutions of their obligations under the Act at a time of major upheaval. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments to the Act will facilitate the implementation of the Act in the higher education sector by streamlining reporting requirements, and by ensuring continuity of coverage for institutions going through amalgamations. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA>The proposed amendments have negligible financial impact. I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> (a) That the Senate take note of the report of the Senate Select Committee on Legislation Procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) That the Senate supports in principle the recommendations contained in the report; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) That, unless otherwise ordered, consideration of the recommendations be a Business of the Senate Order of the Day for 25 May 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>This particular report is from a select committee that this Senate established on, I think, 21 August 1988. The Select Committee on Legislation Procedures was tasked with the responsibility of looking at two major factors relating to the procedures in this chamber. One was how we could facilitate the passage of legislation without the farce of long hour sittings right on Christmas Eve when not enough proper or balanced consideration could be given to legislation. At the same time, the Committee looked at the role of committees in examining legislation-something that has been promoted in this chamber on a number of occasions but has never been formalised in procedures. From time to time and on an ad hoc basis legislation is referred to a committee and eventually a report is brought back. </PARA>
<PARA> This particular committee, chaired by my colleague Senator Colston, looked at a number of possibilities. It strove to come up with a balanced recommendation that would not unevenly balance the procedures of this chamber either in favour of the Government or the Opposition. I must say that I did not embrace its initial report with immense enthusiasm because I could see difficulties in it for the Government. But then again, I dare say, some of the recommendations may cause some difficulties to those in opposition or with an opposition mentality. It is certainly my belief that if we are to make these structural changes they should come into operation the day after the next election. By adopting that procedure we, on this side of the House, would be thinking of how much easier it would be in government with these procedures or how much more difficult we could make it for the changed government if we were in opposition. The same sort of thinking could apply to those opposite. I know how easy it is to get into an opposition mentality. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of our credentials on this issue, when Standing Orders changes were moved in 1981 and 1982 I enthusiastically supported them. However, I ran into a fair deal of criticism in my own Party-from my good colleague Geoff McLaren and others who said, `Don't give up any rights. We have the Government over a barrel. How dare you cut speeches back from one hour to half an hour? How dare you stop the reading of petitions?', and many other superfluous proceedings that were used to waste time in this Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the third recommendation I have made here and that is that we bring this matter back before the Senate on 25 May. I put a specific date in. It will be Business of the Senate. Therefore it will take priority. This is to give an assurance that we are not trying to bury it. I do not think it is possible to make an absolute conclusion on these issues today. On our side of politics we have discussed it on two or three occasions but have never come to a conclusion. I understand that probably a similar situation exists with the Liberal-National Party coalition. It has been discussed but probably no overall view has been formed on it as yet. We seek to debate some of these principles today to try to establish the position of honourable senators. Then, maybe, with some bilateral discussion before 25 May, we can draw up the Standing Orders, work out a timetable for implementation and then proceed on that basis. That would be the best procedure we could adopt here today. </PARA>
<PARA> I now move to the major features of the recommendations. There are really 18. They are all broken up into various sections. The first Committee recommendation was that more Bills than at present be referred to committees. I see that as having both advantages and disadvantages. It requires some goodwill; otherwise we may find that far too much legislation is just bottled up in committees. However, later procedures that set aside one day a week for those sorts of hearings will tend to overcome that. I also find it a matter of regret that if we are to refer Bills to committees, study them at great length and then proceed to the same amount of debating time at the committee stage, we would replicate the current Estimates committee system in which we might sometimes spend three days on something and find ourselves coming to the Committee the Whole, asking the same questions and getting the same answers. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I think there is later on-especially that particular set of committees. I just say that for these sorts of things to work some goodwill is needed. The setting up of a selection of Bills committee is, of course, a necessary corollary to referring Bills to committees. That committee, of course, would not have a Government majority on it. I am not too concerned about that. We do not have a majority in this place. That only recognises in a de facto sense what the end result in one of these committees would probably be. Without trying to typecast senators, I think it is fair enough to say that on nearly every occasion they follow the lead of their party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next two recommendations, 1 (d) and 1 (e), really just go to the machinery matters associated with the selection of Bills procedures. I really do not have any comment on them. Recommendation 3-and this is subject to making an appropriate adjustment to broadcast time-would have us go into the committee stage with these committees on a Wednesday, in the middle of the week. There is no doubt that such a proposal could not get support if it meant vacating a broadcast day. So probably the Government would envisage-and I would be interested to hear the Opposition, the Australian Democrats and others comment on this-moving to a five-day sitting week; that is, we would sit Monday and Tuesday, we would have a committee on Wednesday, and we would sit on Thursday and Friday. So there would be ample time and there would be a protection of Question Time; we would still have four Question Times per week and we would still have the same broadcast time available. </PARA>
<PARA> There is really not a lot of detail of what is envisaged at the committee stage. I would envisage something like this: Bills would be referred to the standing committees; and it would be optional for a Minister to appear or not appear, but it would certainly be in the interests of the Minister to make a variety of officials available to answer questions on the technical aspects of the legislation-something that is not always done, in my experience in the Senate, sufficiently well by Ministers, simply because of the complexity of the task involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The second issue coming out of this is the question of delay. If a Bill is referred to a Senate committee one would not necessarily expect the result to be produced straight- away. On the other hand, one would not expect a Bill to be bottled up in a committee for a year. I would think that this also raises the question of failure to pass and the double dissolution requirements. So we might have to do a bit more thinking about exactly what is failure to pass in that context. I know that this really goes back to the McKell decision of 1951, but we would have to give that matter some consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth point really goes to the question of whether when every senator supports the second reading of a Bill we need to have second reading speeches or whether we can just proceed through, allowing senators to speak for five minutes on the third reading to make some general points. Again, I think that is a fairly balanced approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably one of the more dramatic changes suggested by the Committee is that, when we come to the Committee of the Whole on the Estimates, we debate what is in Estimates Committee reports and not just regurgitate the debate that has occurred in the Estimates Committee hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no difficulty with recommendation 6. Recommendation 7 is a matter that has already been to the Procedure Committee, which used to be the Standing Orders Committee. It refers to how much time may be spent on a motion to suspend Standing Orders. I suspect that there are really two aspects to this: the first is that it is possible to disrupt the proceedings of the Senate enormously by such motions, but the second is that the great difficulty with such motions is for the Chair to determine whether the content of the speech is indeed relevant to the motion to suspend Standing Orders. That puts enormous and unfair pressure on the Chair, in my view, because there is a very fine line between arguing why Standing Orders need to be suspended and covering the substantive aspects of what one would be discussing if in fact Standing Orders were suspended. Those difficulties are, to some extent, resolved in this proposition. Even if someone does stray for the whole five minutes, it does not really cost us a lot of time or cause a lot of aggravation to the Chair. </PARA>
<PARA> The final matter is whether the quorum of the Senate should be reduced from one-third to one-quarter of senators. Because of a provision in the Constitution, this would require legislation to be passed by this chamber. The House of Representatives has already passed similar legislation which is now on our Notice Paper. Later this week I intend to give notice of motion for a similar provision-it is not identical-to reduce the quorum of this House. People ask, `Why is it necessary to reduce the quorum of the Senate?'. My simple answer to that is the geography of the House. I do not think it is productive for government-and I ask honourable senators on the other side of the chamber who aspire to government to think about this-for all Ministers to have to attend on all occasions when a quorum is required. That is essentially the case at the moment. With a quorum being in the order of 24, 25 or 26-I have never been certain-basically, with pairs, every Minister has to attend. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also true to say that calls for a quorum are a right accorded to the Opposition, if not by the Standing Orders then by tradition, to punish a government that has misbehaved. I do not see that by reducing a quorum we will in any way blunt that weapon, because the people that the Opposition will then punish are the Government backbenchers, who in turn will very quickly adjust to the behaviour of Ministers if the Ministers do not have to bear the consequences of their own actions. It is true that the geography of this place, with a three-minute walk to the chamber, means that on occasions-I have experienced this myself in the very early sittings here-a Minister may fly in the members of a committee from all around Australia to see him or her between 11 and 12 and by the time three quorums are over there is no meeting any more. I do not think that is productive for government. By advocating that I in no way imply a criticism of the Opposition's behaviour in this chamber over the last six years. Every Opposition has done it, some more mercilessly than others, I must say. Nevertheless, reducing the quorum from about 24 to 18 or 16 will not be the end of the world; it will not, in my view, in any way diminish Opposition rights in that regard. But it will recognise that we are in a new structure. The days when a Minister was within half a minute's walk of the chamber are well and truly over. </PARA>
<PARA> They are the eight major points. They are, I have to stress, a package. It would be very possible, I dare say, to cherrypick out the ones I like and dump the others. I have not done so, and I urge honourable senators on the other side of the chamber not to do so, because this is a balanced package. If one just grabs enough turkey for one's own plate and gives no turkey to anyone else, one does a great disservice to this chamber. If we adopt these procedures honourable senators have to understand that they are dynamically changing the committee system, and it will never be the same again. General standing and legislative purpose committees will become real legislative purpose committees-not just wide-ranging inquiries into wheat stabilisation plans, oil prospectivity or drugs in sport; we will be involving these standing committees in a very close look at legislation, often clause by clause. So it will take time and it will take resources. It will change the nature of those committees. If we impose on top of that the Estimates committees, which we have-and we do not in any way seek to remove them-and endless select committees, these committees will not be able to carry their workload. </PARA>
<PARA> The biggest danger I see in this regard is that if we overload the committee system too much senators will not do the work and their staff will do it, and we as a Senate will lose control of the results. It is true of any committee, but it is true that this will happen if we overload the system and have too many committees for this chamber. If honourable senators support the committee system in a genuine sense, when they approach these matters they really need to make sure that these procedures will work. The clearest way to ensure that they work is to devote a whole day, Wednesday, to them. On Wednesdays the committees would start in the morning and do their work. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not really have much more to add to what I have said. The general view of the Government is that, as a package, these proposals are balanced and they will enhance this chamber. There are pluses for the Government; there are minuses for the Government. As I said, earlier in the piece I thought there were too many minuses, but I have come to the conclusion that it is a much more rational way of dealing with legislation. This last minute rush that seems to occur at Christmas and in the middle of winter may well be avoided if we can adopt these particular procedures. Once again I say that I do not believe we are in a position today to resolve finally and fully all these issues. By getting the general flavour and tenor of the debate today, we will be in a position to start having discussions amongst ourselves to see where we are heading, to draw up the appropriate Standing Orders and to come back to the matter on 25 May in a much more organised fashion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For some reason or other Senator Ray has attributed the long hours and the late Christmas sitting in which we excelled ourselves last year to the way the Senate is run year after year. That is not so. I believe that last year was just an example of very bad administration by the Government. When one has a look at the numbers of parliamentary sitting days in 1987 in Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Australia, one finds that the Australian Parliament sat for only 84 days and passed 184 Bills. In the Australian Parliament 2.19 Bills per day were pushed through-guillotined through by the Government, if you like-particularly in the lower House. The United Kingdom Parliament sat for twice the number of sitting days that we do. We sat for 84 days; in the United Kingdom the figure was 167. In the United Kingdom only 66 Bills were passed-not 2.19 per day but 0.39 per day. In other words, the British Parliament works in a truly democratic way and allows its members to debate Bills as long as they want to. The situation in the Canadian Parliament is very similar. In 1987 it debated fewer Bills per day than was the case in the United Kingdom. It sat for 167 days and passed 39 Bills, 0.23 Bills per day. The United States of America Congress sat for 170 days and passed 242 Bills or 1.42 Bills per day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So it is a lot of rot for Senator Ray to stand up here and say that what is proposed here as a package will overcome the long sitting hours and the late Christmas sittings. All that has to be done is to start earlier in the year, get through the legislation and not let it bank up until Christmas. I have been here a considerable time and I know that each year there is a bit of a bank-up. Unfortunately in the Senate, no matter who is in government, guillotining takes place towards the end of the session. But last year we excelled ourselves. It was a ridiculous state of affairs that we were passing Bills numbered in tens each day. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe the proposal is a package. I believe it can be divided into two parts. One involves committees and the other Estimates committees. There is no need to look at it as a package in terms of our having to pass the lot or none at all. I do not believe there is any need at all to do away with the rights of senators in the way we have done it, and I am certainly looking at this as a government member after the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> But let us have a look at dividing the proposals into two. It has been suggested, as Senator Ray has already said, that a committee be set up to select the Bills that come before the Senate to be sent off to committees and that those committees should be the present standing and general purpose committees. That would certainly alter things considerably. We would no longer be able to have our terms of reference covering matters of general interest to the Senate because much of the time would be taken up inquiring into Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> But if we are going down that road-and I think that it has its attractions-I do not see that a new committee should be set up giving the Whips all that added work. I do not understand why we could not give that work to the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. It could decide which Bills should be looked at and we could start off in a trial way by not putting up too numerous groups of Bills. We could see whether the Senate would rather stick to its original type of committee work and the terms of reference that it has to date found most interesting. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to try the suggestion that more Bills be referred to committees. But it is ridiculous to suggest that we must consider this as a package, that nothing can be interfered with and that we must cut senators' speaking times to five minutes when we debate whether we should send Bills to that selection committee. No in-depth or sensible debate can possibly take place when a senator is limited to five minutes speaking time. That is one of the things I object to very strongly. </PARA>
<PARA> The next objection is in relation to recommendation No. 2 which again limits speaking time to five minutes. A senator who speaks in relation to sending a Bill off to one of those committees or to other motions and amendments again can speak for only five minutes. I object very strongly to limiting senators' debating time in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to proposal No. 3, Senator Ray has answered the question I have written beside that: What sort of arrangements are we going to make to find the additional hours necessary to get through the legislation in the Senate? He suggested a five-day sitting week. That will certainly add to the number of sitting days we have but when you have a look at the number of sitting days that the Australian Parliament sits compared to other parliaments, that may not necessarily be a bad thing. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not really understand recommendation No. 4 because at the present time if nobody wants to speak in the second reading debate nobody gets up. We have seen it happen many a time in the Senate chamber that the Minister will incorporate his second reading speech, while the person who is leading for the Opposition on the particular Bill will say, basically, `The Opposition is in agreement', and make a short speech. Nobody else takes part. What on earth is the difference between that and what is suggested? Is it that the Minister does not make a second reading speech but incorporates his second reading speech on every occasion? Is that a prerequisite?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He would deliver that second reading speech. Why is that different from what occurs now? At the moment, if nobody wants to debate a Bill, the Minister incorporates his speech, the shadow Minister says a few words and the Bill goes through very quickly. I see absolutely no difference between what is proposed and what occurs at the moment. I would like someone to explain to me what the big advantage is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again, in recommendation 4 (b), when the motion for the second reading speech of the Bill is put without debate, I gather we go straight to the committee stage. Then when the third reading stage is reached, if something has occurred in the committee stage that one is particularly concerned about, one is still not allowed to debate it fully; one has got only five minutes. Something might occur in the committee stage that has grabbed one's attention. One whips off and does a little research about it. It occurs regularly in this place that in the committee stage something comes up that the Government has really mucked up in its drafting procedures. People have become aware of the problem. Research is done on it, and one is allowed to talk about it in the third reading debate for only five minutes. In a considerably longer debate, a proper and serious speech by each senator would take longer than five minutes. I believe that is a rubbishy recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> Any government would obviously like recommendation No. 5. Senator Ray said that it should be looked at from two perspectives: what is best for the Government and what is best for the Opposition. He elaborated a bit and said that we should wait until after the next election when, both sides of the Senate believing that they are going to be in government or considering how they could be obstructive in opposition, it can be looked at very clearly. There is a third perspective, and that is: What is best for the Parliament; what is best for the Senate? If we interfere with the present Estimates committees, I believe that we will do a great disservice to this Parliament. The Estimates committee system is unique in the way that it carries out its work. It is a most efficient and very good system. Should a senator be on an Estimates committee for a whole day but would like to visit another Estimates committee and ask questions, the only way to do it at present is to stand in the Committee of the Whole and ask questions at that time. This recommendation takes away that right. This recommendation says that the only things that can be debated in the Committee of the Whole are matters referred to in the committee reports. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, attachments, amendments or whatever. That still does not necessarily cover the concerns that one may have. I would have thought that the chairmen of Estimates committees would be particularly concerned in this area. Senator Colston would know that during past Estimates Committee hearings I have whipped off to another committee, even though I am a member of his Estimates Committee; but, as chairman, he is not able to do that as readily as I am able to. Sometimes it fits in and a member of the Committee can whip off for half an hour and go to another committee and ask questions. That is not always possible because of conflicting interests; but a chairman can never do it. I would have thought that he would have cherished his right in this place, if he has interests in other committees which he is unable to attend, to be able to ask questions of the Minister and be able to follow up those questions in the Senate. According to these recommendations, he certainly could not do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We get down to a five-minute speech again when we look at No. 7. I do not believe that senators can make a point, unless it is a minor point, well or throughly or are able to convince people of the sincerity of their argument in a five-minute speech; it is impossible. Speaking as a senator who, when we were in government, responded to Senator McLaren's calls for quorums, it seemed to me, every five minutes, I believe that a quorum ought to be maintained and that every senator has a right to say that members of this Senate should come into the Senate and have their numbers shown whenever a senator chooses to so call them here. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very disappointed in the recommendations of the Committee. I know that the report was well researched and that a lot of time was spent on it. I would be interested in the new idea of the committees looking at more Bills. I think it would be very productive. It would overcome a lot of the traps that some of the drafting presents to both Government and Opposition members. I would like to go down that road but not limit the rights of senators. I do not agree with Senator Ray at all that the method of running the Senate at the moment results in long hours and the late sittings that we have experienced in the past at Christmas. If the business is administered by the Government in a sensible fashion, there is no need for late Christmas sittings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Senate is debating its own procedures there are always concerns expressed by senators, such as those expressed by Senator Walters, that the rights of senators should not be taken away. As a member of the Select Committee on Legislation Procedures, I can say that that was always in the forefront of its deliberations. Indeed, the Committee operated unlike other committees, inasmuch as it was given leave by the Senate to consult with all members as it proceeded through its deliberations, because we knew it would be pointless to go down a track of trying to make recommendations that did not have widespread acceptance. A large number of recommendations came forward, but very few actually made it into the report, simply because there is a great deal of difference, both within and across the political parties, about what ought to happen in regard to procedures in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first thing I would like to say-in fact, I got together the material which appears at page 40 of the report-is with regard to what other comparable legislatures do and the legislation that they deal with. Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States sit on 165 to 170 days, which is almost twice the number of days that this Parliament sits. They sit twice as long as we do. Yet when one looks at the number of Bills, one discovers that we manage to pass about twice the number of Bills that they do. So either we are four times as efficient or something else is different. In interpreting that point about legislation, one should remember a couple of caveats. Senator Walters referred to the United Kingdom as an example. Australia has a particular problem with regard to legislation that is not shared by any of those other three legislatures; that is, our constitutional prohibitions with regard to taxation Bills. Hence, we tend to have a lot more smaller Bills than those other legislatures have. One should also recognise that Canada makes use of portfolio Bills to a greater extent than we do. So there is some deception in those figures. Nevertheless, even taking those two considerations into account we are still putting through a lot more legislation, certainly in a lot less time. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of ways out of this problem, and it is a problem. I think that those of us who have experienced the end of parliamentary sessions for a number of years believe there has to be a more sensible approach. This Committee was appointed in an endeavour to come up with some ideas as to how it might unclog the log jam. There is one simple method which seems to endear itself to hardly anyone; that is, that we double the number of sitting days. In doubling the number of sitting days we would obviously unclog the log jam. But one has also to acknowledge political realities. In Australia there is a very strong demand on members of the House of Representatives and senators to service their electorates. That means that they need to be in the electorate, not in Canberra, be readily available in their offices or, in the case of senators, travel around their electorates, and appear at different places, speaking to people and finding out what is going on. I for one strongly endorse that idea because that contact with the electorate is a very important element of our democracy, but at the end of the day we cannot be in two places at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot have the luxury of all members of this chamber speaking as long as they like on any topic they like whenever they like and also be in the electorate. Something has to give. What we were trying to work out in the Select Committee is how we might proceed in a way which met the other political reality. Senator Walters said that there is a third way of looking at the matter, and in fact we did look at it. But the political reality in this place is that government and the major opposition parties play the dominant role in the passage of legislation. That being the case, it is fairly obvious that Government members in this chamber would look somewhat aghast at the suggestion that we send more Bills to a committee. The last thing that any government wants is for its Bills to go off to a committee-not this Government but any government. The Minister will have done all his fine work with his bureaucrats and Government members will have passed the legislation through the party room, because after all they are in government; this is part of their legislative program, which they want to see implemented and not held up. That is a legitimate aspiration of government parties. On the other hand, opposition parties have a democratically appointed role to look carefully at all legislation and to scrutinise government operations. </PARA>
<PARA> In attempting to weigh those two things up, governments would not like committee references but oppositions generally would. It is no secret that most of the Bills which are referred to committees from this chamber are sent there because the Opposition parties and the Democrats want them to go there, not because the Government is absolutely delighted and delirious and really wants to get them there. At the end of the day this Government, quite sensibly, generally throws up its hands and ceases to resist once it manages to count the numbers, because there does not seem to be a great deal of point in making a fuss. </PARA>
<PARA> They are the realities we have to deal with. The Committee tried to deal with the realities of politics within the chamber and the realities of politics outside the chamber. Once we take all those realities into account the room to move is very small. Senator Walters made some fun of one of the recommendations and said it was a shoddy suggestion. The one she referred to reflects the very small amount of room that that Committee had to move in. We were attempting to take a small step. From the point of view of the Australian Democrats the first recommendations of the Committee-that is, 1 (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e)-are not advantageous. We have seven members in the Senate and it is proposed that the committees meet on one day. It is fairly obvious that we are able to cover the sittings in this place because it is one focal point. It would be a far more difficult task to cover all the committees discussing different Bills in various committee rooms of this Parliament House. Nevertheless, our Party's point of view and our Party policy is to try to develop greater scrutiny powers on the part of the Parliament, and this is one way in which it might be able to be done. The reason Senator Robert Ray talked about this proposal as a package is that certain elements do not have anything to offer certain political viewpoints-only disadvantages. The idea is to try to pick up at least something on the swings that we are going to lose on the roundabout. I express, on my Party's behalf, the view that those first recommendations would make our task a lot more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walters asked why recommendation 1 (c) did not refer to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. This recommendation is included because it was proposed in the motion that Senator Chaney moved in this place on behalf of the Opposition parties with a view to making use of that Committee's ability to deal with references. It seemed to us to be a very sensible suggestion. It was picked up from that particular quarter. Senator Chaney's suggestion was modified to reflect the numbers in this place. We believe it will have the added advantage of representing what is likely to occur here. There is a third advantage in that the committee meets every day. Its members are a group of people who are well versed in terms of what is going on, how the Bills are progressing through the place and where the particular pressure points are likely to come from. They form a group with a unique set of qualifications in that they are already very much in tune with the flow of legislation and the likely pressure points. Since they meet every day it was felt that in terms of giving some trial to the recommendations before us an additional meeting would not be required, that it would be part of the committee's general overview that takes place each morning. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other recommendations. The recommendation with regard to Estimates committees illustrates how Bills referred to a committee can start to move in a rather odd direction. The Estimates committees do an excellent job. When one reads their reports one realises that they often uncover things that the Committee of the Whole probably would not have managed. But there are some quite considerable costs in the way that we then duplicate that exercise in the chamber. I believe that the Estimates committees ought to be similar to other types of committees. We ought to be inquiring into the Estimates committees reports. These committees have been delegated the task on behalf of this chamber to inquire in detail into a whole range of matters. A very large number of bureaucrats are available to come before these committees. Very large costs are incurred in this respect. If we seek to duplicate that process in this chamber I believe we have to do it with good reason because there are significant costs built into the exercise. I am not at all sure that duplicating those exercises is really the best use of our time. I hope that the detailed scrutiny of a piece of legislation will take place in the Estimates committees, and matters not raised at a particular sitting would have to be taken up at subsequent Estimates hearings, which of course occur twice a year. So those opportunities would not be lost, merely deferred. </PARA>
<PARA> We can say, `No, we are not going to do that', and we can say no to all of these recommendations. Those people who wish to say no have to declare themselves at least in favour of increasing the number of sitting days. I do not really believe that we can continue the way we are going. It is probably all right for people in opposition because at least in that situation they can always blame the Government. In part it has been the Government's fault. It has not been able to give us a legislative timetable at the end of each session. But the Government is not the only player on the field. Indeed, the Government can legitimately say that it does not have the numbers in the Senate. So how can it carry all the blame for the problems in the legislative program? The numbers in this place are outside the Government's control, and hence the chamber has to accept responsibility for the problems that occur at the end of the session. I believe that what occurs at the end of the session brings only disgrace upon this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to devise better methods. I invite honourable senators who are opposed to these propositions to make suggestions between now and May, when we debate this again. We need to find some way of handling this matter. I have put up a range of suggestions which have not been accepted. This is another range of suggestions. Senator Hamer and quite a number of other honourable senators have also put up a range of suggestions but they have not been accepted. They have all been attempts to come to grips with getting a reasonable flow of legislation through the chamber in a way that does not prevent senators from expressing their views, having those views recorded, having an argument take place or having detailed scrutiny of legislation, as this chamber wants. </PARA>
<PARA> I offer a couple of suggestions. One, which will probably upset a lot of people, is to delete the second reading stage on the grounds that it is a more political stage. All the Bills that come from the House of Representatives have been debated, at least by all political parties in the Parliament except our own-and that will be rectified after the next election, when Senator Haines will be able to contribute to debate in the House of Representatives. Those Bills have been debated in a political way in the House of Representatives. Our forte, I think, ought to be increasing scrutiny of the detail of legislation. Therefore, I would like to delete the second reading stage, and all the time saved there could be devoted to the committee stage of Bills, thus allowing more scrutiny. </PARA>

They were not supported as a whole by everybody; nor were they supported individually by everybody. I am not sure whether even one will be passed. If no suggestion is supported by this chamber, if we cannot come up with a sensible way of doing this, then we stand condemned.

<PARA> If people who wish to speak in this debate do not like these recommendations, that is their prerogative. Let them say where the problems are, what is likely to occur and so on.

If there is no other structural way, then I suggest those people commit themselves to the inevitable proposition, which I am happy with-and on behalf of my Party I have acknowledged in the past that we are happy with it-to increase the number of days that this chamber sits. I think at the end of the day that has to be it. Unfortunately, we have not been able to secure agreement across the board on that, so that has been ruled out. But we have to go somewhere and we have to deal with the problem, so I hope that those people who do not like these recommendations-and I can understand why, because they do curtail various avenues that are currently available to senators-come up with other suggestions. </PARA>
<PARA> My Party in particular has a certain amount of difficulty with this set of proposals-and I am sure that the Independents in this place would find difficulty with them-because our small numbers cover a large number of points. Smaller parties and groups in this place have legitimate concerns, but we are willing to give the proposals a try. We believe these should become Sessional Orders and should be tried out and then there should be a review to see how they have gone and what difficulties have occurred. I hope that after such a review people will be generous enough to try to correct any problems that may occur. At least that is the type of response the Committee was getting from members of all political parties. It is less a party problem and more a Senate problem, and I think it should be dealt with in that fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some other recommendations in the report. For example, one way of dealing with the counting procedures in this place is to allow the Whips or other people to record the names of senators as being in support of or against a proposition without calling a division. I hope that honourable senators will look at that. That is another option available to us. Another suggestion is that Bills normally be referred to the legislative and general purpose standing committees rather than to special committees of the Senate so that those general purpose committees can hopefully develop an expertise in this area. Along with that suggestion is a suggestion that we ought to look at the Chair of those committees as being another avenue for expertise development in this chamber. In other words, someone may wish to devote a considerable amount of his or her available legislative time to chairing a particular committee and becoming an expert in a particular area, say, tax, defence or whatever else. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the proposals that the Committee put forward would allow more Bills to go before a committee. I think they would allow committees more time to consider legislation. The time saved in the Senate could then be allocated elsewhere, because we are certainly not going to sit for fewer days. In other words, there would be a freeing up of time for other matters. I think that would allow for maximum flexibility. One must remember that the ultimate decision would always be in the hands of the Senate. That is why our recommendations preserve the rights of individual senators either to have a Bill debated or be able to seek to have a Bill referred to a committee, even when this has not been accepted by other groups of senators. That was done specifically to preserve the rights of Independents who would not be represented on the Selection of Bills Committee or of many members of political parties who dissent from their parties' stance on a particular Bill and whose rights need to be protected in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> This was an attempt to meet those concerns. It was not an attempt to steamroll anybody, or to trample on the rights of senators. I hope that honourable senators will approach these recommendations in that light. It was an attempt to deal with a problem that we all face. If these recommendations are not acceptable, I hope that some other practical suggestions will come forward in the time available to us so that we are not faced at the end of this session and at the end of the year with a situation which only brings disgrace upon this chamber. </PARA>

I have a feeling that the Committee made some reference to Aboriginal affairs, but had it not done so, under this proposal the Senate would have been unable to undertake the further examination of that matter in the Committee of the Whole. Admittedly, it might be said that a considerable number of questions were asked about this portfolio during the Estimates committee hearings. But a number of us were not present at the Estimates committee hearings and were not aware of it until we either read the Estimates Committee Hansard or considered the matter here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a number of questions to be asked as to our legislative function. That is a truly legislative function that will be denied to individual senators. I think that suggestion in recommendation 5 is totally unfair and ought to be rejected outright. I took the opportunity which was afforded to me by the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Colston, to respond to him in writing in September last year. I indicated in that letter that during the 13 years in which I have been a senator I have been alert to the need to ensure that parliamentary procedures operate to the advantage and not to the disadvantage of individual senators, be they Independents or individual senators of the various political parties. That should be the test against which any amendments to the Standing Orders are applied. I am aware, of course, that some senators are obliged to play a designated role within the party team and often quite reluctantly see their responsibilities as being more within a party context than within the context of the Senate's legislative procedures. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not, but it is a problem that some people in the various parties have. They are told to join a committee or specialise in certain matters. What opportunity do they have to express the views of their constituents in respect of some other matters? That is what I am getting at, particularly in respect of recommendation 5. The safeguarding and advancement of the role of individual senators, be they members of political parties or not, forms the basis of my consideration of these proposals. I feel that they are found wanting on that basis. When I considered the draft proposals late last year I thought that it was of some merit to relay experiences of the Senate Estimates committees since their establishment in 1970. I have endeavoured, as honourable senators will know, to participate in the functions of the Estimates committees to the best of my ability. It appears to me that the theory of a filtering system, which is implicit in the proposals that are currently before the Senate, bears some resemblance to the unstated premise on which the Estimates committee system has been based.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As an individual senator I have found it impossible to keep tabs on what is happening within each of the Estimates committees' policy areas in which I am interested and in which my electors are interested. I endeavoured to do this in my earlier years here, but it is the practice for several committees to meet simultaneously-in fact, three committees meet simultaneously nowadays-and I find it logistically impossible to sit with one committee and follow its progress, then leave that committee and sit with another, and perhaps have someone else keep an eye on the progress of the remaining committee. Nor am I sure that the permanent members of those committees always welcome my coming and going. Honourable senators may well laugh, but it is disconcerting when chairmen give one a look as though one is an interloper. Certainly that is not the case with Senator Colston. I am not looking at him at all. He has protected my rights, and the rights of every other individual senator, to ask questions of the various departments. </PARA>
<PARA> Looked at from the point of view of an individual senator with diverse interests, the operation of the Senate's Estimates committee system has carried with it the associated disadvantage of forcing me to specialise and to choose between those areas of top priority. This is what I have had to do in recent years. I am not a one-issue person. I was not elected on a one-issue basis. I am a multi-issue person. I attempt to cover many issues. With diverse interests I have great difficulty. The one saving factor about the Estimates committee system is that the Committee of the Whole remains an opportunity for referring to areas of departmental estimates in detail, regardless of whether the same area has been examined by the relevant Estimates committee. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent years I have discerned an underlying feeling of impatience with anyone who branches out into great detail in the chamber debate. I have not been one to do that. I have done it on occasion, but I have not made a welter of it. However, in essence this means that the focus of the proceedings of the Senate has been transferred from the chamber to the six Estimates committee meetings, meeting in committee rooms, and in the process the focus has been diffused. I ask the Senate to consider these questions. The focus has become diffused, and I think that is what is going to happen if we have this system that is proposed for Bills to go off to committees on Wednesdays. Individual senators will not have the opportunity that they now have to contribute to the debate when it counts. One might say that there is a committee stage when the report comes back, but is the Senate going to tell me that, once decisions on that Bill have been made in that committee, people will change their minds? Of course they will not. The committee stage will be a rubber stamp of what the committee has done. Honourable senators will get quite impatient when somebody who has not been on the committee comes into this chamber to put forward a bright idea about the Bill and has an amendment to put forward. What chance will that amendment have of getting the support of the Senate? Honourable senators will not be here to listen to the debate. They will think, `We've gone through all the pros and cons of that Bill in the committee hearing'. That is a travesty. I feel very offended, as an individual senator, by the recommendations that have come forward on this matter. I do not believe that the basis for these recommendations holds any water at all; that is to say, the volume of legislation. That argument, advanced in support of the recommendations confronting the Senate does not hold up if one really examines it. </PARA>
<PARA> The first point to make on that issue is that governments of all complexions have been guilty of forcing the Senate to consider a rush of legislation towards the end of sessions. This has contributed to the perception of an avalanche of legislation that is beyond the resources of the Senate as presently constituted to deal with. It is only a perception. I have been amongst those who have repeatedly suggested in the Senate that these problems are generally of the Government's own creation and that they could have been ameliorated by better programming. My impression is that this situation has improved in recent years and that the message has been conveyed back to the departments via the programming officers. That message is simply that timely notice should be given of all legislative proposals. I understand that under the present system Ministers must make advance bids to a committee of Cabinet for a place for legislation which they hope to introduce in the next session and that, if they cannot establish some kind of priority, the legislation is not endorsed. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that, if the Senate signals to the bureaucracy and to Cabinet that new machinery has been established to facilitate the examination of greater volumes of legislation, elements of the bureaucracy will move to increase the flow of legislation. One virtue of the limited quota of time available under the present system is that departmental officials must constantly ask themselves whether what they propose is of major importance or could be left for the next amending Bill. I see that as an intangible self-regulating mechanism that is worth reserving. </PARA>
<PARA> To test the excuse, if I might use that word, behind these proposals-increased volume and complexity of legislation-one analysis which I requested examined all the legislation considered by the Senate in 1987 and categorised only 22 per cent of that year's Bills as being of major importance. I think the Senate ought to consider that. I am of course aware that the criteria for such categorisation contains a strong element of subjectivity. It should be pointed out that in purely numerical terms the Senate considered fewer Bills-that is to say, 222-in 1987 than it did in 1985, when it considered 273. But I am aware that such a comparison can be deceptive. Nevertheless, on the basis of the 1987 figures only 22 per cent of the Bills were in the category of being of major importance. </PARA>
<PARA> I come next to a very important matter which no doubt the Committee has considered, namely, the implications of this system for extrinsic aids to the interpretation of the law. I do not know whether it is proposed to have a Hansard report of these committee meetings or whether it is proposed that individual Ministers be present at the meetings. </PARA>

It seems to me that since the passage of the Acts Interpretation Act in 1984 the proceedings in the Senate chamber itself have assumed a particular position for the purposes of judicial interpretation. If the focus of legislative examination is shifted from the chamber to a collection of committees, will the proceedings of those committees, as distinct from the proceedings in this chamber, be taken into consideration for the purposes of interpretation of the law?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that the Committee has given consideration to that. I would be interested to hear the response. If, for example, there is no Minister present at those committee meetings, it would be somewhat difficult for a judge to determine whether or not the intention of the drafters or the proponents of the legislation-namely, the Government-was clear. If the proceedings of the committees are to be taken into consideration by the courts, what action can be taken by an individual senator who might wish to challenge an interpretation which has been read onto the record in his absence within a particular committee?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to say much more. However, I point out that there are two sides to a compromise. The allure of legislation committees is exemplified by the following quotation from the 1976 report of the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System entitled A New Parliamentary Committee System. I quote from page 128:</PARA>
<PARA>46. It is highly likely that more amendments would be acceptable to governments if committee deliberation was less formal and more flexible. In legislation committees the government would not appear to lose face in accepting amendments to its legislation. The closer quarters and less theatrical circumstances should facilitate discussion and compromise. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what that Committee said in 1976. I can understand and appreciate the theory which runs through that statement. Disregarding the comment about `theatrical circumstances', which surely must not apply to the Senate, I am not convinced that the act of compromise should be hidden away in the less than public proceedings of a committee. That is a very important point. What will inevitably occur in these committees as people get to know one another is trade-offs. Deals will be done between committee members. A member will say, `I will trade this off in considering this Bill and you trade that one off in relation to the next Bill'. All of this will be done away from the gaze of the public. Members of the public may be present at these committee meetings. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. However, members of the public also do not have the gift of bilocation. They cannot cut themselves up into six parts and attend six committee meetings simultaneously. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with political compromise, but surely it is desirable that as much of the legislative process as possible should take place in the open forum of the Senate chamber where its elements can be considered and evaluated. I have some sympathy for the view expressed by Mr E. J. Lindsay, MHR, in his dissent from a recommendation favouring legislation committees for the House of Representatives. At page 59 of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure, second report, May 1986, PP. No. 108/1986, Mr Lindsay states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is the constitutional duty of the House by itself, or as a committee of the whole, to undertake the deliberative legislative processes for the passage of a bill. The recommendation of the Procedure Committee would remove part of the integrity of that process from the House. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the recommendation of the Select Committee on Legislation Procedures that we now have before us will remove part of the integrity of the processes of this chamber and thus should be seriously questioned and, I believe, not accepted. When the report to which I have just referred was debated in the House of Representatives, Mr Lindsay made the further point that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure had failed to adduce any evidence in support of its recommendation for the reintroduction of legislation committees. This absence of any strong evidence in the report in support of legislation committees perhaps explains why the Government finally rejected that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there is a fundamental concern about the whole proposal being considered. It revolves around the threat that it poses to the ability of individual senators, whether they be party senators or not, to understand what they are voting for or against and to exercise their vote in a responsible manner. I fear that, in transferring the focus from the chamber to a number of committees, senators will be asked to accept a great deal more on trust and that a substantial part of the legislative process will take place away from adequate public scrutiny. </PARA>

Without question, the present intrinsic role of the chamber will significantly change. The proposals, quite deliberately, will change the committee system. The committees will develop significantly more responsibility. They will take on responsibilities in areas that they have thus far not taken. It ought not be forgotten-I think it was Senator Robert Ray who touched upon the point-that it will very much change the role of the present standing committee system. My judgment is that the standing committees no longer will be able to pursue their areas of current interest and central responsibility when looking at social issues such as drugs in sport or matters relating to pornography, the environment or whatever. Terms of reference which do not automatically flow from legislation no longer will be able to be dealt with because the committees simply will not have time. I have grave concern that the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and other joint committees that have recently been formed under new procedures no longer will be able to address issues other than those flowing from legislation. In my view that is detrimental to the system of the Parliament and to the functioning of the committee system. It will deny the community access to invaluable information and work and substantial recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hamer's contribution was notable, as were many on this side. The reason the legislation came before us late was that the Government could not arrange, amongst its own warring factions, its business. It could not extricate itself from the problem it had got itself into with various groups in the community. It was bowing, scraping and bending and, in the end, wimpering, trying to find a way to get the legislation approved and carried unanimously so that everybody, not just the Government, would carry responsibility for it. That is a typical example of why we find ourselves sitting late in December each year. It has nothing to do with the normal efficiency and functioning of the chamber and its intrinsic responsibilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am also concerned about the type of Bills that are likely to be examined. It is suggested that we might have to deal with Bills of no account. I wonder whether there are those who will be pushing for legislation of a detailed, complex and controversial nature to be examined by these committees. Such activities inevitably will detract from the contribution of all senators in the chamber. What Senator Harradine said is ever so true. Once a committee brings in its report, if it is carried unanimously, one will be like an interloper if one wants to stand up and take a different view, to seek to argue it again, to seek to saw sawdust, to repeat that which has already been done in the confines of a committee. To that extent the chamber will be denied the healthy debate which ought to take place at a second reading stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I will touch quickly on the other matters. First, there is the question of quorums. It was inevitable that this Government would seek to reduce the number required for a quorum from one-third to one-quarter. Part of the Government's argument relates to the size of the building. The truth is that the time to get to the chamber has been extended. I do not see the logic of simply seeking to reduce the aggregate numbers because the building is larger. It sounds like Mr Keating's arithmetic to me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Then I would like to speak on this matter very briefly. I think there were a couple of misunderstandings, partly caused by the way in which the matter was introduced by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray). I do not believe that these recommendations are a single package. They should be viewed in their own right and in their own light. It the Senate passes the package, well and good. But there are problems, and Senator Harradine has pointed out one of them; that is, the fact that the position of Independent senators in this chamber is very difficult to protect. I tell Senator Harradine that we on the Select Committee on Legislation Procedures did try to protect the position of Independents, but it is difficult in the light of the type of recommendations being made. It is up to the Senate to consider that and whether the difficulties of Independent senators should take precedence, in which case the proposals should be rejected. I am sure that when the particular motions come before the Senate Senator Harradine will speak eloquently on that subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are three separate issues in this report. The first is one I feel very strongly about, and that is that this Senate should devote more of its time to detailed consideration of legislation, with expert witnesses being able to give critiques and suggestions on legislation. The House of Representatives, as presently constituted, cannot perform that legislative role. It is very important that it be performed, and the Senate is the only body that can. I think we should make full use of our committee system to ensure much more detailed consideration of legislation. By the way, sometimes it is not the controversial legislation that has the hidden catch in it; it is the legislation that everyone agrees with that we look at too little. We should have a procedure whereby we give detailed consideration, in committee and in the Senate's legislative and general purpose committees, to these matters. That should not preclude subsequent proper debate in the Committee of the Whole. In my experience, Bills that have been referred to committees for report have frequently occasioned very spirited debate in the Committee of the Whole when the committee report has come back to the chamber. That is the first issue. </PARA>
<PARA> But if we wish to do that, we have to devote time to it. The Committee's recommendation is that Wednesdays should be set aside for that purpose. If we are to set aside Wednesdays, there are only two options: either the Senate will have to sit longer to deal with the rest of its business or we will have to make savings in our proceedings elsewhere so that the Senate does not have to sit longer. That is not a popular answer, I have found by discussing this matter with various honourable senators. We have commitments back in our electorates. We are expected by our electors, and in our system they are very strong. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4H4">Senator HAMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not referring to preselection battles. They are very easy ones. I am talking about the more general ones of collecting and representing views from the electorate. I read an autobiography of an English member of parliament. When he was a young man he was elected as a candidate for the Conservative Party for a place he had never ever set foot in before. It was up in the north of England, and he came from London. He asked his electorate chairman, `Would I be required to live in the electorate?'. The electorate chairman said, `Good God, no. You are a young man; you want to sow some wild oats. You must do that sort of thing in London. It would never do in Preston'. He said, `Well, in that case, how often should I visit Preston?'. His electorate chairman said, `Once a month. If you visit more often you will cease to be news; if you visit less often they will think you are neglecting them. Once a month will do'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think we all know that that would not work in this country. The people for whom it would not work, though, are primarily our own party members-but it just would not work. We just have to, we are expected to and we are committed to spend more time in our electorates than members of other legislatures such as the United States Congress and the British House of Commons. If we can spend more time sitting, well and good. I think we should spend a little more time, but not a great deal more. And the purpose of the recommendations in the second group was to make suggestions on how we might save time. We are aware that these proposals would take away from senators things they have been able to do in the past. We are aware that they could create problems for such people as Independent senators who did not have the multiple numbers in order to keep an eye on a number of things simultaneously. The recommendations are put forward in good faith. If they are not acceptable to the Senate, they can be beaten. That is up to the Senate as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The third group, recommendations 7 and 8, is really much involved with time saving. Those recommendations were put forward because they were previous recommendations from the Standing Orders Committee-now the Procedure Committee-and it was thought appropriate that they be dealt with in this group. They are the one to limit the time spent on motions to suspend Standing Orders and the one to reduce the quorum. The quorum change would have very little effect on the time of the Senate. It would allow, as the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) said, more administrative time for Ministers. The one on the suspension of Standing Orders is one which I know worries many honourable senators on this side of the chamber. Of course, if the suspension of Standing Orders is agreed to, there is no debate at all. We often suspend Standing Orders on the voices. The only occasion on which there is this debate is when the Opposition, normally, or perhaps another party, wishes to make a fuss, a noise, about some issue which the Government is chopping off. That is the reason for that particular proposal that that sort of activity should be limited to half an hour. Again, that is an infringement, a reduction, of the present rights of senators. The Senate would have to give consideration to the balance between the time spent on these activities and the time available for others. It is all about how much time we are prepared to spend in this place and how we should allocate that time. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise that the recommendations are in three quite separate groups: one to improve our scrutiny of legislation; the second to save some time by changing procedures to allow for that without increasing the length of time the Senate sits; and the final one, the two procedural recommendations, which did not really originate from the Committee but were on the books of the Senate for some time and which the Committee thought should be debated and decided upon by the Senate in conjunction with the others. I emphasise that it is not a package; it is three quite separate groups of proposals. I commend the first proposal very strongly to the Senate. In relation to the other ones the Senate has to make up its own mind as to how it wishes to conduct its procedures. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats indicated during the second reading stage of the debate on this legislation that we certainly support Government amendments that will prevent foreign investors from buying Australian residential real estate without Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) authority and approval, and will be doing this because we believe it is a long overdue move and a very necessary measure for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is to reserve the capacity of Australian residents to buy their own real estate. Having said that with regard to residential real estate, we will not be supporting the Government's moves with regard to thresholds on foreign investment in business or in the area of rural real estate. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Pages 8 to 11, clause 14, proposed sections 13a and 13b, line 33 (page 8) to line 4 (page 11), leave out the proposed sections. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats will be opposing the thresholds on the grounds that the measure does not go far enough. The measure has established thresholds of $5m for purchases by foreign investors of urban businesses and $3m for purchases of rural land. We believe that those thresholds are far too high and, indeed, that there should be no threshold of this kind set. Anybody who wishes to buy Australian rural property should be required to get the approval of the FIRB. We believe that that body, inasmuch as it still exists and inasmuch as it has the resources to cope-and that is a matter the Government needs to reconsider as well-ought to be in a position to scrutinise all foreign investment proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> In a moment we will be moving a connected amendment for the establishment of a register of foreign ownership in this country not just for rural land or for residential real estate which has already been purchased by overseas investors but for general investment across the board in business. When we have thresholds of this kind we are leaving a massive loophole for people to get through. Adjoining properties can be bought by associated companies, nominees or companies which intend to cooperate in some way or another to avoid meeting the limits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian public, concerned as it is about the level of foreign investment, has a right to believe that somebody is investigating, scrutinising, all purchases of business interests and of real estate, whether it is rural or urban, in this country. The value of foreign investment in Australia has increased dramatically in the last few years, almost doubling in the years from 1985-86 to 1987-88, going from a little under $10 billion three years ago to over $18 billion in 1986-87 and then to $25 billion in 1987-88. If we exclude purchases of up to $5m and $3m with regard to business and rural real estate respectively then we are going to have no comparable figures by which to judge the increasing purchases of businesses and real estate in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately this has been another example of the Government acting by way of legislation by press release because purchases of rural property worth less than $3m and businesses worth less than $5m have been exempt from the requirement for Foreign Investment Review Board approval since April 1987. When the Mr Keating announced these changes he forecast that they would reduce FIRB applications from 1,300 to 400. It is rather extraordinary that we have a government which reduces the resources, staffing and capacity of the Foreign Investment Review Board and then turns around and says, `Because the Board is not able to cope with the workload, we are going to impose some sort of ceiling so that its workload is reduced to meet the capacity of the reduced resources'. That sort of thing is Alice in Wonderland stuff and I do not think it is justifiable in any circumstances at all. </PARA>
<PARA> What is worse is that, in that reduction from 1,300 to 400, if the 900 transactions excluded by those categories were worth an average $2m each, something like $1.8 billion worth of foreign real estate purchases would not even have been recorded, much less scrutinised by the Foreign Investment Review Board. I do not believe-and neither do my colleagues-that any threshold should apply with regard to foreign investment, given the ease with which these can be circumvented the total amounts of money property and involved. I am not aware of too many other countries in the world which make it as easy as Australia for foreigners and non-residents to buy up businesses and real estate, whether urban or rural real estate. I think it is quite shameful that we as a country are not only busily selling off as much of the farm as we possibly can-and various other bits of Australia as well-but also leaving so much of this unscrutinised by government instrumentalities whose major purpose, I would have thought, would be to keep a weather eye on who owns what, and to what extent, in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is very sad indeed that if, after the next election, the Opposition parties were to get into power the Foreign Investment Review Board would be abolished altogether. According to some statements by Mr Peacock and Mr Howard, the Board is not considered a necessary authority to have because they say they would maintain a capacity in Treasury to monitor foreign investment. I want to know how we could monitor what we do not even know about. It is a little tough to expect Treasury, with everything else it is doing, to take on board an activity that ought to be the province of a specific authority such as the Foreign Investment Review Board. </PARA>
<PARA> This means that it is even more important that we have something like a national register of foreign ownership in this country so that not only can Treasury monitor these sorts of situations-or the Foreign Investment Review Board for as long as it is allowed to continue to exist-but so can members of parliament and, just as importantly, so can members of the public. Whilst we are denied information of this sort we really are, in this chamber and out in the community, paddling around in the dark a bit. We get some information with regard to who owns what, but it is often left to other organisations to track these figures down. </PARA>
<PARA> Records kept by the Cattle Council of Australia, for example-presumably accurate records-tell us that Japanese companies with majority and minority interests in abattoirs and feedlots in Australia are quite extensive. Nippon-Ham has 100 per cent ownership of the Oakey abattoir in Queensland. The company also owns its own feedlot at Whyalla and has said that it plans to increase slaughter capacity to 120,000 a year. Mitsubishi and Hannan Chikusan own 95 per cent of the Forbes abattoir in New South Wales and aim to process 75,000 head of cattle per year. Mitsubishi and Hannan in partnership also have a majority interest in the Macksville abattoir on the New South Wales central coast. It is aiming to process 125,000 head per year. In addition, Mitsubishi has bought the Killars and Quirindi feedlot operations to supply the Macksville plant. Itoman has a 50 per cent interest in Hawkridge Meat Co. Pty Ltd abattoirs near Burnie and Devonport in Tasmania. The company also has a 40 per cent stake in Gilbertson's chain of abattoirs around Australia. It is pretty grim that we have to rely on records kept, however well kept those records may be, by organisations such as the Cattle Council of Australia, the National Farmers Federation and other groups in the community which are concerned about the extent of ownership in the rural community of things which ought to be proudly and 100 per cent owned by Australian interests. It is of concern to those people that we are selling off the farm in a very literal way. If this legislation goes through with the thresholds that apply, there will be very limited capacity for the FIRB to scrutinise, monitor, ask questions and stop, if necessary the extent of foreign ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not concerned just about the question of Japanese ownership. The problem, of course, since we do not have readily available accurate public figures about who does own that part of Australia which is no longer in Australian hands, is that there is a tendency for people to perceive Asian ownership as being majority ownership. This produces all sorts of xenophobic results, not to say outright racism. I can remember an Australian National University seminar eight or nine years ago entitled, from memory, `Who owns Australia?'. When it was pointed out that millions of hectares of Australian pastoral land in the north were in fact owned by Saudi Arabian and West German interests. As a member of Parliament, I am not particularly concerned whether Australian property, real estate, rural land and so on is owned by Saudi Arabians, West Germans, Kiwis, British or Asians. What I am concerned about is the amount that is not owned by Australia and the rationale behind it. This will be totally deregulated if the Opposition ever becomes government. If we do not have some sort of register of foreign ownership, then the Australian public-and that includes members of parliament, who do not have access to these sorts of details-will not be in a position either to justify the amount of ownership or to oppose it. </PARA>
<PARA> If one does not have information, one has no real right to be making declaration on one side or the other. That is really putting the general public at a distinct disadvantage. If there is not proper scrutiny of overseas investment in this country, we have no idea what proportion of this country is owned by whom, what their money making capacity is and where that money is finishing up. There is certainly anecdotal evidence-and groups like the Cattlemen's Union, the National Farmers Federation and people who just watch what is being bought down the coast of Queensland are aware of some of what is going on-but the real picture is not going to be made available either until we have a national register, about which I intend to have considerably more to say in a minute, or while we have thresholds applying to certain purchases. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the comments made by people such as Senator Watson during the second reading debate, and given the concerns expressed by the National Party and rural lobbyists over the extent of foreign ownership in the rural sector, I would have hoped to get at least the support of my colleagues in the National Party for this amendment, if not the support of Liberal Party senators. I am disturbed that at this stage there are in the chamber no members of the National Party preparing to take part in this debate. They have expressed their concern publicly. Now is the time for them essentially to put their money where their mouth is and support the Democrats' amendment for removing these thresholds and requiring the Foreign Investment Review Board to have scrutiny of all purchases of Australian business and real estate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This amendment is the first of what are really two interlocked amendments that have been put forward by Senator Haines. The Liberal and National parties will be opposing both amendments, for very clear and cogent reasons which I will now outline. The purpose of the first amendment in respect of the new sections 13a and 13b in the Foreign Takeovers Amendment Bill is to exclude takeovers of Australian companies and businesses with total assets below $3m where more than half of the assets of the businesses are attributable to rural land and, in the case of other businesses, $5m. The force of Senator Haines's amendment is to exclude altogether from the effect of the proposed law those businesses below that level. The effect of her second amendment, which has not yet been moved, is to require that all foreign takeovers be subject to the scrutiny of the machinery which she has outlined in the second amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One is staggered by the size of the Australian Democrats' proposal. What she is doing is bringing to account, to scrutiny, every single transaction, irrespective of its size, its value and the concern it may have for Australian citizens. Some areas of concern are obviously of greater concern than others to Australians, but requiring potential overseas investors to notify the Treasurer of every single transaction, no matter what the size, is certainly not something that the Opposition would seek to support. It has not even been contemplated by the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) on previous occasions. It seems to be an onerous and expensive procedure that has very little value and would not add to the sum of human knowledge to a very great degree at all. That is the first reason for rejecting the Democrats' first amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequence of enacting such a requirement would be to ensure that foreign investment in this country stopped dead in its tracks. The loss of confidence as a result of such an enactment would have enormous consequences for this country, especially at a time when this country is absolutely desperate, because of the financial policies of the present Government, for foreign investment. We have to find upwards of $1 1/2 billion every month just to stay alive. That would be cut off immediately as a result of the Democrats' proposals. Quite apart from that, the bureaucratic machinery that would be required to be established, and no doubt Senator Haines will have more to say about that--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that somebody would love it because I am told that if this were brought into force it would amount to something like 1,000 extra employees in the Treasury. It would certainly create an enormous bureaucracy for somebody. That kind of bureaucratic nightmare is something that Australia has already become famous for on the world scene. We have the complex situation where foreign investors of various kinds are forced to deal with both State and Federal bureaucracies, which inhibits enormously their capacity to make decisions in a rational way. Now we are seeking, by the Democrats' amendment, if it is accepted, to impose even more stringent and difficult requirements which are complex and costly, overriding the need for this country to look at the question of foreign investment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We all know that foreign investment brings enormous economic benefits to this country if it is handled in the right way. I agree with Senator Haines to the extent that there is a need to know exactly where this is occurring, but I do not agree that her means of surveilling foreign investment is the way to go. It is clear-and that will become part of the argument in the second amendment that she intends to move-that there are means available already, certainly at the State level, for the scrutiny of foreign investment. We have within the State jurisdictions the land titles offices, where all land transactions are recorded. We have the corporate affairs commissions where all transfers of shares in companies are recorded and which are publicly accessible. Yet we have the Democrats wanting to superimpose upon this a whole new bureaucracy duplicating all of that. It just seems to be an absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast, we on this side would like to see the Federal Government coordinating the efforts of the various States to ensure that that information is properly collated and recorded to better serve the public benefit. If the Democrats were at all serious in their motives here-one suspects that they are not and that this is just another political stunt-they would have thought through the consequences of the amendment they are proposing. Clearly, they have not. That is the reason why we in the Liberal and National parties will not be supporting either of the amendments that are put forward. But I restrict my argument now to the first amendment which Senator Haines has moved. I say for the record that we will not be supporting that amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it rather amazing that Senator Messner believes that just because something is a bit difficult to do and might involve employing a few more people we should not do it. He may not have noticed this, but when Australians earn money they are required to provide the details to the Treasurer. A foreign resident who buys a piece of urban real estate is required to provide details from dollar one. If it is all right to have no threshold for urban real estate why is it not equally applicable to have no threshold for rural real estate? I would have thought that we were far more vulnerable in the area of problems relating to rural property purchases. After all, we have seen questions asked in this chamber about access for isolated children to something such as Austudy, which is not only income tested but assets tested as well. In many cases the nominal value of the property on which those people live is highly inflated due to purchases by foreign interests of rural property.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Walsh gets up in the chamber saying that if a piece of property is worth $600,000 and people cannot make their living from it then they ought not to be on that property; they should get off it and leave it to somebody who can make a profit on it and take their kids to the city where they do not need Austudy payments because they have access to the school system. That is fine and dandy as long as the property is genuinely worth $600,000 and not simply because the property next door or in the next region was purchased by foreign interests for whom Australian real estate, whether it is urban or rural, is bargain basement as far as pricing is concerned. Those who live in Europe or Asia are aware of the fact that our property prices from their perspective are a give-away. They are quite prepared to pay much higher prices than Australians can afford. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not subscribe to the arguments put forward by Sydney real estate agents that foreign investors in the real estate market are not having an impact on the price of property in this country. Of course they must. It is not simply $4m harbourside properties in Sydney that these people are purchasing. Even if it were, the trickle down effect would have some impact on markets, at least in the upper brackets. The fact of the matter is that in Perth and elsewhere foreign investors have been moving into real estate at the smaller level, buying up whole blocks of units for an inflated price, pushing up the rentals in order to get their money back and therefore having an impact on the rest of the market. </PARA>
<PARA> If it is good enough to recognise the problem that is occurring in urban real estate markets and to remove the threshold there, then surely we should be recognising that those people who live in rural areas have the same rights to protection as their cousins living in urban areas. I would have thought that, given the parlous state of the rural economy at the moment, they would have even more reason for getting protection from highly inflated house prices than their city cousins do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Messner has said that the Australian Democrats' proposal is outrageous and that scrutiny should start from dollar one in all property. I remind honourable senators of something I referred to in my speech in the second reading debate; that is, that the Cattlemen's Union of Australia has asked for even more-not simply scrutiny or even a register but the establishment of guidelines for scrutiny which, in the area of the industry with which it is most concerned, the meat industry, would have meat authorities to determine whether an industry benefit analysis was needed. The Cattle Council of Australia went on to suggest that there should be an economic impact study. It outlined quite a detailed process that it believed should be undertaken. There are other people in the community who are very concerned about this. I reiterate the point that Senator Haines has made-that is, if it is good enough for urban real estate to come under scrutiny, it is certainly good enough for rural real estate and for industries and investment concerning rural people also to come under scrutiny.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>There is a lot of concern in the community about the level, or the perceived level, of foreign ownership in this country. The fact is that most people in Australia, and that includes members of parliament and business people as well as ordinary men and women in the street, simply do not know how much of Australia is in foreign hands, how much of Australia has been sold, leased, loaned, mortgaged, or in some other way disposed of. We believe, and many people in the community believe, that they are entitled to know and that the best way for them to have access to this information is through a register of foreign ownership. Under those circumstances, of course, the government of the day, of whatever political persuasion, whether it is at the State or Federal level, may still be able to sell off the farm-or the Torrens Island power station in South Australia, the Melbourne central business district, Perth real estate, or whatever-but at least Australians would have some knowledge, if they wished to acquire that knowledge, of how much of it is sold and who is buying it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats are not the only people expressing concern at the levels of foreign ownership in Australia. Concern has been expressed by the National Party in Queensland and by the Queensland Labor Party. The Queensland Labor Party has called for a tax on foreigners who own land in Queensland but who live overseas. The Queensland National Party Government introduced a foreign ownership of land register Bill in October last year. I am not aware of whether it is operating yet. I do not think it is; I think it has been held over. In any event, at least it has indicated some sort of bona fides as far as registering some foreign ownership is concerned. It is only some; it concerns foreign ownership of land, foreign ownership of businesses or the whole gamut of ownership. The Liberal Premier of Tasmania announced last year that he, too, would establish, or attempt to establish, a register of foreign land ownership in Tasmania. I am not aware how far that has progressed, but to the best of my knowledge it still has not been introduced. The point is that it ought not be left to the goodwill of State governments to put in place ad hoc registers of some parts of the foreign ownership situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people believe that there is a problem with foreign ownership, but we cannot determine absolutely whether there is a problem, to what extent there is a problem or in what areas that problem occurs until we have established a register of what foreign investments there are in this country. Only when that has been done will we know which Australian assets are controlled by foreign interests, which States, which regions, which industries have a foreign ownership problem or are in some way benefiting from foreign ownership. We are not in any position to make categorical statements about foreign ownership unless we have the information on which to base those statements. While governments prefer not to give ordinary individuals access to the information, one must suppose that it is more likely to be a problem than a benefit or there would be no need to hide the information. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of foreign investment in Australia in recent times, of course, is, apparently at least, a history of increasing dependency. We argue that we have all sorts of economic problems in all sorts of other areas, that if we do not attract foreign money to this country we will have additional problems in meeting foreign debt and so on. That may well be a situation that needs correcting, but I am not sure that too many Australians would genuinely believe that selling off the farm and any other bits of Australia that are not tacked down is necessarily the best way of correcting some other very real, very serious and ongoing economic problems that we face. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the difficulties facing the community is that it is not sure whether there is an excessive amount of foreign ownership or, if there is, in what areas it lies. The concern in the community is real. Whether it is justified, we will not know until we have some form of public access to the information that will provide the basis either for concern or for pleasure at what is happening to this country. There is concern that Australia has very easy rules and regulations regarding foreign ownership-certainly a lot freer than apply in many countries. I was somewhat startled, during a recent television program in which some very angry Australians confronted a Japanese investor, that nobody asked him to justify Japan's fairly strict rules with regard to foreign ownership-far stricter than we have here. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that we simply do not know anything but dollar amounts as far as foreign ownership is concerned. We are able to get some sort of breakdowns, and I cited those figures earlier this evening. We have virtually no information about the who, the what and the why of foreign ownership. Nobody inside or outside of this Parliament has any real capacity, as I said, to criticise, support, oppose or justify foreign investment in Australia when we are so deprived of the necessary information. As I said, we can only suppose that it is a worst case scenario because we are not given access to any information to make any other sort of judgment. Without information, we are, on the one hand, powerless to asses the value of foreign ownership, if there is any, and, on the other hand, powerless to challenge the extent, amount and potential damage of foreign ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> What is worse, of course, is that this lack of knowledge is playing into the hands of some extremists on both sides of the argument. Those who appear blindly to support all or any foreign investment justify it on economic grounds which are not-I guess because they cannot be-based on fully detailed factual information, simply because that information is not available. Just as worrying, maybe even more worrying, is that while foreign investment is not new, the awareness of it in the hearts and minds of the electorate is new and it is occasionally being misdirected. The reason is that we have a relatively new phenomenon of significant Asian investment in this country-something which is far more obvious to ordinary Australians than, say, investment by the British, New Zealanders, West Germans or possibly even Saudi Arabians. There is a very visible amount of investment by Asians in this country. This is happening for a variety of reasons, some of which may be justified, some of which are not. This is far more stringently opposed by average Australians than is investment by other foreign nationals. This is bringing a very disturbing element of racism into the debate on foreign ownership. It is a recent element of racism; it is a reprehensible element of racism; but it is possibly an understandable element, certainly in some areas. For all we know to the contrary, the concern that is frequently expressed in Queensland in particular but also in other areas as to the extent of Japanese investment may be unjustified. I suspect that it is not, and that there is, in fact, a significantly increasing amount of foreign investment in this country which is Japanese investment. In any event we, as members of parliament, and the members of the public are entitled to know who owns what and how much of this country. We are entitled to know what is owned by whom, what the benefits and drawbacks are, and where the profits from the venture will be going. </PARA>
<PARA> I said a moment ago that the Torrens Island power station in South Australia has been sold to foreign interests on a lease back basis, if I recall correctly, but we do not know who has bought that utility. Frankly, I do not think that is good enough. We live, so we are repeatedly being told around here, in a democracy. Members of parliament from time to time-especially when they are in opposition-espouse the intrinsic merits of open government. How can we be a democracy, how can we have open government, if information is denied to the electorate and to members of parliament on something as vitally important as who owns how much of Australia and how much of the money they are making out of what they own is going out of the country to the country of origin?</PARA>
<PARA> Real estate agents dismiss the idea that foreign investment in urban or rural land has any impact on prices or stock availability across the board. That is fine for them. We know that many foreign investors are capable of paying far more for land and property than are the average Australians, so the higher the price goes the better off the real estate agent is because the bigger the cut is. I do not think that is sufficient justification for somebody arguing that there is no harm in foreign investment in urban or rural real estate. </PARA>
<PARA> I said before dinner that there is a real problem for some people who live in isolated areas and whose property has a nominal value that is much higher than they would ever get from an Australian buyer simply because a foreign investor has bought an adjoining or nearby property at an inflated price and has pushed up, therefore, the apparent value of their property. As a consequence, people living in country areas in northern South Australia, in Queensland, and in Western Australia are finding that the very necessary Austudy payments that they need to educate their children properly are being denied them because the income and assets test is applied strictly but unfairly in this case because the property value is not the real value of what Australians would be paying for that property. I would have thought that logic alone would force people to dispute the real estate agent's argument that there is no effect across the board on real estate prices because of foreign ownership. Logic is all we have to go on. There are no detailed facts available to us. Those facts will not be available to us until we have a register. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that a group such as the National Farmers Federation is also concerned about this matter. It is not just the concern of some Australian families who want to buy homes but find that the price is going out of their reach and they cannot meet the mortgage repayments because interest rates are blowing out. The National Farmers Federation, in a letter to the Treasurer (Mr Keating), said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . National Farmers Federation is concerned that the change will prevent any reasonable-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the change to the minimum value for which Foreign Investment Review Board approval is required for rural property purchased by foreign nationals-</PARA>
<PARA>assessment of the level of foreign land ownership in Australia. In the interest of national security and being able to respond to public concern about foreign ownership, it is highly desirable that the Government maintain the capacity to observe and measure the level of foreign ownership, even where approval is not required. </PARA>
<PARA> NFF considers that the foreign takeovers legislation should require foreign investment in land (and possibly selected other assets) to be notified to the FIRB. In addition steps may need to be taken to strengthen the FIRB's powers to ensure that a requirement to notify is effective and enforceable. </PARA>
<PARA>There is real concern in rural communities about the effect of foreign ownership. If only to alleviate those concerns-even if the Government and the Opposition believe there is no reason for concern-we should be moving to a national register of foreign ownership of property and of business in this country. I commend the amendment to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened with some care to the intervention by the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Haines. With respect to the honourable senator, the problem she presents to the Committee is one which only too frequently derives from the corner of the chamber in which she and her colleagues sit; that is to say, it is a whole catalogue of complaints, fears and criticisms-but no solutions. That is only too typical of the Party of which Senator Haines has the honour-I presume that is the right word-to be leader. I am the more moved to make that sort of comment in view of the fact that on almost every occasion that we debate in this chamber questions of fiscal policy, monetary policy, or any aspect of economic policy, whether it be macro-economic policy or micro-economic policy, we find that the voices being raised from the Australian Democrats' corner are almost invariably in favour of measures which would have the effect-not the direct effect but the indirect effect-of rendering worse the very problem about which Senator Haines is now moaning. Yet the Leader of the Australian Democrats comes into this chamber and upbraids us all. I have no brief for the Government in this matter, and I will come to it in due course, but I find it offensive that Senator Haines appears to believe that the level of intelligence of the Australian electorate is so low that it does not see through this kind of populist demagoguery of which this intervention tonight is just another example.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator STONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since we have been favoured with an interjection from the Minister for Finance, let me turn my attention to the role of the Government in this whole matter. The Government does not come to this question with clean hands either, although I would say in fairness to Senator Walsh that perhaps his hands are a little cleaner in this regard than those of most his Cabinet colleagues, by which I mean that Senator Walsh is I think publicly and semi-publicly on the record as standing for a good deal more rational economic policies than so far he has been able to persuade his colleagues to accept.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, let us ask a few simple questions about foreign investment in Australia, around which this debate has revolved. I hope that Senator Haines would not contradict me if I were to say-and I think she said it herself-that we are today receiving a significant foreign capital inflow into this country not only in the form of what is typically called foreign investment, as it is certainly called in this debate, namely, the acquisition of physical or paper assets by foreigners, but also in the form of the issue of debt instruments to foreigners by Australian residents, whether they be governments, corporations or sometimes individuals. In terms of the Statistician's definition, that is just as much foreign investment as is the thing we are talking about tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us assume that by some wave of a magic wand or, if one likes to conjure up an even much more horrifying prospect, some wave of the control power of the Treasurer (Mr Keating), as exercised by the Australian Democrats-and that would be really horrifying-we abolished entirely the capacity of foreign investors to acquire Australian assets, whether it be in the form of land, which has been much discussed, or some other form of asset. If nothing else changed-in other words, if Australia continued to pursue the rake's progress of economic policies which under this Government it has now been pursuing over the last six years-all that would mean is that we would have to borrow more. </PARA>
<PARA> At present we are running a balance of payments deficit on current account of over $15 billion per annum. Nobody can be quite sure where it will finish up for 1988-89, but it will certainly finish up over $15 billion. I do not know what the amount will be, because I do not have sufficiently up to date figures, but let us say that about $5 billion of that is being financed by foreigners purchasing Australian assets-whether they be rural property, real estate, shares in Australian companies, Australian companies themselves or some part of them-and the other $10 billion is being financed by Australian residents', whether they be government, corporations or individuals, borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA> The first thing to have very clearly in mind when we address the question before the chamber tonight is that, in the absence of any policies to address the underlying cause of this phenomenon, the only effect of producing a diminution in the level of foreign ownership of Australia would be to produce an increase in the level of foreign indebtedness of Australians. Once again we have the rather characteristic phenomenon in Australian economic debate of addressing symptoms, not causes. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already hinted at the cause by my reference to the fact that these things are occurring because we are running a balance of payments deficit on current account of over $15 billion a year. I might add that we are doing that at a time when, as the Statistician observed in the national accounts document published yesterday, our international terms of trade are at their most favourable level since the March quarter of 1977. This is the best period for 12 years. So, on what the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the International Monetary Fund might call a cyclically adjusted view of the matter-that is to say, if one adjusted the statistics of our balance of payments deficit to account for the fact that we are at present enjoying very favourable trading conditions-we are actually running a balance of payments deficit in the order of $20 billion a year. On that basis it would be something like 6 per cent or 6 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to spend too long on those kinds of speculations. I simply want to make the fundamental point that if people in Australia are concerned about the growing acquisition by foreigners of assets previously owned by Australians-I confess to concern on that point and, in that sense at least, I share some of the views that Senator Haines expressed and many other people are beginning to express-let us start talking about the policies that are required to get rid of the need on our part to finance a balance of payments deficit either by borrowing or by selling off bits of Australia. I have to say to Senator Haines, and to anybody else who wants to embark on the same kind of emotional trip that she was on, that, unless one is prepared to accept and acknowledge that that is the heart of the matter, one simply cannot be taken seriously, and must not expect to be taken seriously in any proper discourse on the subject. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Haines also pointed out, some specific aspects of the present foreign investment debate in Australia do give rise to concern. I referred to at least one of those in my remarks during the second reading debate on this Bill, and that is the growing body of voices being raised in protest against the prevalence of foreign investment from Japan. As Senator Haines quite rightly observed-again I agree with her on this point-there is a racist undertone in those comments and it is not a pretty one. Nevertheless, again I say that if we are concerned to mute or dampen down that kind of comment in the interests of the quality of life and the quality of social discourse in this country, we should start addressing the causes, not run around addressing the symptoms by talking about land registers, this, that and the other. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I have to say that our Japanese colleagues are not altogether blameless in this matter. In recent times concern has been expressed in the area of so-called vertically integrated investment in the beef industry. I refer here to the process whereby a Japanese trading company comes in and purchases an abattoir in which it can slaughter the beef. No doubt such a company can make arrangements to purchase its own trucking business in order to transport the beef to a port. Certainly, the beef can be shipped in a Japanese ship and so on. On the face of it, there is nothing in any of that to which one could reasonably object. Other countries are quite free to do the same thing. The objection relates not to any of those actions but to the other end of the chain of production, the distribution end, when that meat arrives in Japan. As anybody who has had a look at the Japanese meat importing system knows, the system is totally rigged, like a good many other things in Japan, against the foreigner. </PARA>
<PARA> It follows from that that Japanese firms entering that trade do so not on equal competitive terms-which we tend to assume is the case when we talk about this in good economic textbook fashion-with, say, an Australian producer or, for that matter, an American producer, who had made a similar purchase of assets in Australia. A Japanese firm does not do so on equal competitive terms at all, because a Japanese producer in Australia can pick up all of his margins in Japan, which the Australian producer cannot do. By definition, one simple consequence which flows from that is that the Japanese purchaser can afford to pay a lot more for those assets than can an Australian competitor or, for that matter, an American or British foreign investor, who does not have the same privileged access to the highly regulated and highly controlled marketing distribution systems for beef as is the case in Japan. </PARA>
<PARA> If we want to start talking about Japanese investment in our beef industry, that is the problem we ought to be addressing. Our Ministers ought to be talking to Japanese authorities. They should say to them in no uncertain terms that this kind of approach to international trade is not acceptable. If there are to be sanctions of any kind against foreign investment in Australia, which I personally think should be abhorred for the most part, they would need to be very carefully and specifically directed to instances of the kinds I have given by way of example where one could quite conclusively demonstrate that the foreign investor is in fact not operating on equal terms with its Australian or, for that matter, its other foreign competitors possessing equivalent assets in Australia. The debate on this Bill would be a great deal more rational and therefore a great deal more productive if we began to focus on some of these causes and stopped talking about symptoms. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to indicate, first of all, that I am in total agreement with the remarks of Senator Stone in this regard and to draw attention to the fact that we are dealing with what amounts to an amendment that I believe the Australian Democrats have given very little thought to. They have obviously not in any way thought through the consequences of what they are proposing. Let me just take some of the detailed parts of the first amendment moved by the Democrats, which we discussed before dinner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before going to that, let me put on the record that the Liberal and National parties have, as Senator Stone has outlined, an underlying concern about the degree of foreign investment in this country. We share with many Australians the need to know more about the nature and the form of that investment. Given that there are registries of real estate ownership and corporate ownership in the hands of the State governments, we, in government, would seek, through the Treasury, to establish a unit to bring together and coordinate the activities of the State governments in keeping those records so as to disclose the degree of foreign investment. That is the sensible down to earth approach that can be adopted by any Federal government. It is the proper role of the Federal Parliament. To do otherwise and to accept what the Democrats are proposing, by establishing a national registry of all these assets, would be merely to duplicate much of that which is already available within the public record and that which can be publicly accessed within the various States. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me just give an example of the difficulty of what the Democrats are proposing by the establishment of this new national registry within the Department of the Treasury. The simple point to be made is that this amounts to a duplication of the land titles offices and the corporate affairs commissions of each of the States to be located within the Federal Treasury-a total duplication of those things which are already being carried out by the States. That seems to me to be totally unnecessary, for a start. It would simply amount to enormous extra costs to the taxpayers of Australia and would be a major inhibiting factor to the future of foreign investment which, as Senator Stone pointed out, is so necessary to keep this country going. This Government's policies have forced this country to become more or less a mendicant on the world stage, to the tune of $1,500m a month in order to survive. For Australia to pay its bills every month we need $1,500m to flow in. That is a direct result of this Government's policies. It flows directly from this Government's lack of performance in the areas of reforming the waterfront, industrial relations, the telecommunications industry and so on. We made those points in the earlier part of the debate, at the second reading stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just pick up one or two points in Senator Haines's remarks when speaking to her amendment. I do not know whether she has read through the amendment that she has moved. I am sure that I heard her correctly. I heard her say that the proposed registry applied to nothing else but real estate. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Good. I am glad to hear that. The first point I want to draw out is that it is a requirement, if this amendment were to be accepted, that persons investing more than $5,000 in any instrument, which includes a savings account, a cheque account or a purchase of Australian Government bonds in London, register that in this almighty register than Senator Haines wants to create in the Treasury in Canberra. The mind boggles at the cost of establishing such a register and the money that would have to be spent in order to maintain such a register. If an aunt in London chooses to send out to her niece an Australian Government bond purchased in London, that would presumably have to go on this register. That is the sort of nonsense being proposed by the Democrats. It clearly extends right across the whole range of what might be regarded as ordinary transactions. That is why we object to this proposal and why we do not support it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The commonsense approach is to coordinate that information, which is already available on the public record and which is fully accessible to the Australian people. As I mentioned earlier, that is not to say that we are not concerned about this matter. We are saying that this is the way to do it; this is the way the Democrats should be pursuing the matter. This is the way that we, in the Liberal and National parties, in government will be pursuing this in order to ensure that the information which Senator Haines seeks is made available. It will then be conducive to the making of appropriate decisions within government about the nature and extent of foreign investment in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to conclude by reiterating the point that that duplication, which could well be eliminated by a proper coordination by a Federal government, is in fact being set up because of the positive moves that some State governments are already making. The Queensland Government is the case in point. Senator Haines referred to that. I noticed in recent days that the South Australian Government similarly is moving in that direction. I understand the Tasmanian Government is doing so as well. In other words, the facilities readily to hand, under the control of the State governments, are being mobilised to establish the kinds of registries that are the purpose of Senator Haines's amendment. That being so, this enormous bureaucracy which, I am told, could employ as many as 1,000 extra public servants would be absolutely superfluous and useless in the kinds of situations that Senator Haines envisages. Consequently it does not have the support of the Liberal and National parties.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a touch amazed at some of the matters that Senator Messner has talked about. For a member of a party who gets up here and spouts States rights all the time to be talking about virtually compulsorily coordinating information that is collected and collated by the States into a national registry seems to be running counter to all the other protestations we have heard from members of the Liberal Party of Australia when there has been any suggestion that perhaps there should be a cooperative effort among the States to provide the Federal Government with information on practically anything. Duplication, of course, is something we live with in a federation and, unless the Opposition parties are planning on doing something like abolishing the States or giving additional constitutional powers to the Federal Government, there is no way that the Federal Government can compulsorily acquire the sort of information from land titles registries and one thing and another that are currently the province of State governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Messner talked about the enormous cost and the large number of people who would have to be employed to run this operation. I have only his word for the fact that it will take squillions of people to handle this, but I would have thought that, in any event, the cost-whatever it may be-may well be worth it. We in this country regularly expend money in order to protect our country and our citizenry. We did not hear members of the Liberal Party, for example, saying that they would oppose the tax file number proposals because of the cumbersome bureaucracy, the difficulties associated with the cost of mail-outs and the confusion and so on that they would cause. They quite cheerfully supported the tax file number legislation, apparently despite the cost of the bureaucracy and what appear now to be some significant infringements of privacy. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it rather odd, too, for anybody to suggest that simply requiring a foreigner who owns property or business in this country to register it on a national register would inhibit foreign investment. Does somebody have something to hide? Unless people do, why would they object to their name being listed on a register of this sort? Surely if there is no problem with the investment it ought to be open to scrutiny, particularly if, as Senator Messner asserts, it is already open to scrutiny for those who know where to look in some State government departments. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to question just what real value there is in some of the investment that is being made, particularly by the Japanese, who are giving themselves the benefit of moving into Australian ownership not only in the beef industry but also in other areas. For example, we are seeing increasingly that the Japanese are buying golf courses, tourist developments, hotels and what have you for the exclusive use of Japanese nationals who are visiting Australia as tourists or on business. What benefit is that to anyone other than to the owners of the golf course who cheerfully sold out their property to the Japanese for whatever benefit they could get? The money that therefore goes out of the country is not benefiting Australia at all. Should anyone think that Japanese tourists will not come here if they cannot play on Japanese owned golf courses and stay in Japanese owned hotels, that certainly has not been the situation to date, and one wonders why it should be the situation in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Stone said that he had listened carefully to what I said, and I wonder which part he was listening to, because at no stage in the 15 minutes prior to this did I suggest that we should stop foreign investment. I may have talked in the past, publicly and in this Parliament, about putting some limits on foreign investment, as many other countries do, but I did not do so in the previous 15 minutes; I concentrated entirely on providing the necessary information that we in this chamber and the general public need if there is to be an informed debate rather than an inflamed debate-which is very largely what we have seen to date. </PARA>
<PARA> I also find it a little odd for Senator Stone to indicate that he is not in favour of many restrictions on foreign ownership when, as I understand it, if one believes what one reads in newspapers-and who does not when it is one's opponent being written about?-the National Party has a policy for firmer control on foreign investment, particularly in the agricultural and fishing industries. Certainly supporters of the National Party such as the National Farmers Federation and the cattlemen-the National Party's main constituency-would like to see an investment freeze and a lot more stringent restrictions placed on foreign nationals investing in this country. For example, they would like to see the Foreign Investment Review Board guidelines made much tougher rather than less strict, which is what the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has acted to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The cattlemen would like to see economic impact statements required of foreign investors proposing investment worth a million dollars or more, with such investment proposals to be subject to government and industry scrutiny. The cattlemen want to see Japan agree to allow equal access for Australian investors. I think this is one source of increasing resentment-that foreign investors expect to be able to invest here, for whatever economic reason we care to allow it, under a certain set of rules that they do not apply in return. The cattlemen's industry estimates suggest that Japanese trading houses now control a third of Australia's beef feedlot capacity and almost 15 per cent of meatworks capacity-almost quadrupling what it was a year ago. As Senator Stone has pointed out, that benefits not Australia but entirely the Japanese as far as their trade is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Stone wants to broaden the debate-which we are not supposed to do at the committee stage of a Bill anyway-maybe we ought to have a look at non-tariff barriers that are applied by a range of countries with whom we trade on a regular basis. Maybe we should say, `Okay, all people who are producing primary produce for sale in Australia should have applied to them the same manufacturing, contents and packaging requirements that apply to our own local producers-no artificial colouring and flavouring in cheeses, no unwashed Pakistani dates'. Maybe we should start looking at a few non-tariff barriers in this country. I would be the first to agree with Senator Stone that we need to start looking at the source of the problem and taking some retaliatory action. But that is not what this Bill is about; nor is it what my amendment is about. I point out that my amendment is not about stopping foreign investment-although if some people prefer not to invest because they might have to disclose their investment, that is a decision they will make. This amendment aims at providing accessible information without somebody-whether it is a member of parliament, a bureaucrat or an ordinary member of the public-having to go State by State through lands titles registries, which is a fairly bizarre operation, not to say expensive. </PARA>
<PARA> Our tourist industry is increasingly, if not largely, in the hands of foreign ownership, and that is not necessarily a good thing. There have been studies to show that both here and overseas the benefits to a country of tourist developments would be a lot better if they were in the hands of nationals of that country rather than those of foreign investors. Dr Adrian Bull, a Queensland academic, has done some studies on other countries pointing out that foreign investment in tourism should be stringently controlled so that the financial benefit does not simply flow back to the visitor's own country. I mentioned a moment ago the amount of Japanese investment which is being made available specifically and sometimes only to visiting Japanese nationals. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Bull points out that in some western European countries-he cites Spain as a specific example-as little as 31 per cent of all money spent by tourists remains in the country where that money was originally spent. He points out that if all the services and facilities in, for example, the Spanish situation had been Spanish owned and operated that country would have retained nearer to 85 per cent of the revenue expended by tourists. There is an enormous difference between 31 and 85 per cent when you are talking in terms of millions, if not billions, of dollars. Australians need to start asking themselves just exactly where the value is. But we will never be able to get an answer for ourselves or from somebody else until the information is collated and collected centrally. </PARA>
<PARA> I for one believe that the cost of any increased employment in this area is worth it even if all we do is double the percentage of tourist dollars that remain in this country instead of most of that money flowing out, even if all it does is give our primary producers an even playing field when it comes to beef exports, even if it means only that the price of Australian real estate is still within the reach of the average Australian family. Senator Walsh is working himself into a frenzy over there. I will give him the opportunity to join Senator Stone and Senator Messner in criticising what is after all only a register of what is owned by foreign nationals of Australian property, Australian business, Australian real estate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take up briefly a couple of things that Senator Messner said because he seems to be misinformed about the registers of real estate which are kept by the States. There is no register of nationality kept in the States. As Senator Haines indicated earlier, Queensland has recently passed such legislation. I believe it sat on the statute book for some time, but it has recently been gazetted. In no other State at the moment do we have a register of real estate which includes nationality; so the information is simply not available from the States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator pointed out also that there would be an enormous cost. If, indeed, this information is already being kept by the States it is difficult to see how he can argue that there would be an enormous cost in keeping that information. As I have already indicated, that information has not been kept, so there is a double lack of logic in what he had to say. Moreover, I wonder whether Senator Messner has learned about the way in which computers can transfer quite large amounts of information. If the States did keep information on real estate ownership, including nationality, it would be a relatively simple matter to transfer that to a central register. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Stone started off by criticising Senator Haines by describing her speech as a catalogue of fear. I sat throughout Senator Haines's speech and did not hear anything in any way even heated. Certainly in no sense was anything she had to say a catalogue of fear; it was very calmly and logically argued. What she was pointing out was that there is either a justified or unjustified concern among the Australian population regarding the level of foreign ownership. That is not expressing a fear; it is expressing a matter of fact. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Stone then went on to say that Senator Haines offered no solution. When I initially heard his remark I thought what Senator Haines was offering, of course, was a solution, namely, the establishment of a foreign register, but it became clear then that Senator Stone was talking about the problem of why we have so much foreign ownership. Senator Stone may have information not available to the rest of us-the sort of information that the rest of us would like, namely, some information as to how much foreign ownership there really is. The honourable senator then criticised us in relation to our economic policy, pointing out that the fact of any foreign ownership was itself indicative of a fault in the Australian economy as it is at the moment and that simply establishing a register would not reverse that trend. Of course, that is absolutely true, but he implied there that the Democrats had no other solutions and would simply establish a register and leave it at that. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to point out-and I think Senator Stone would agree with me here-that the majority of foreign indebtedness is not a consequence of Federal Government borrowings. A substantial proportion-I believe somewhere between 60 and 70 per cent-of that foreign indebtedness is private foreign indebtedness, and only some 30 per cent or so is shared between Federal and State governments and government instrumentalities. I am certainly not aware that the average Australian is substantially responsible for that private foreign indebtedness. That has substantially been incurred by, I believe, well-off Australians going overseas, borrowing money to buy what are often Australian assets, and having to pay capital plus interest to those foreign lending institutions. That is where a substantial proportion of our foreign indebtedness arises. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator votes with them more often than we do, as Senator Haines has just pointed out. On this very issue I suspect he is going to vote with them yet again, and we will be voting on the other side. The Australian Democrats would do a great deal to change that pattern of speculative use of Australian capital, and would change very considerably government policies with regard to growth economics and the wise use of our resources, which would allow us to use our resources far more conservatively.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad Senator Stone mentioned that. Some 25 per cent of the costs of power stations is borrowed overseas because we do not make heavy generating equipment in this country. A sane policy would allow us to use our electricity a lot more efficiently and avoid that large amount of capital borrowing. Approximately 20 per cent of our foreign indebtedness is related to government instrumentalities such as the State electricity commissions-for example, the Electricity Trust of South Australia. The Democrats would have far more sensible and sane energy policies, not simply devoted to growth for growth's sake, which would avoid a great deal of that foreign indebtedness. That is just one example. I thank Senator Stone for bringing it up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Stone then went on to develop a most contorted argument. He used a non sequitur to argue that if we do not know how bad the problem is then we do not need to support the establishment of a register. That seemed to me to be a most peculiar argument. If Australians, by and large, are not concerned about our present level of foreign indebtedness and therefore are not prepared to do anything about it, such as changing the present government, then it would seem to me that they may become concerned about a consequence of that foreign indebtedness, namely, the sale of our real estate to cover that foreign indebtedness. It is therefore useful to establish such a register so that that information will become available to them in a form which will cause them to act. Senator Stone's argument in fact turns around and becomes an argument in favour of the establishment of a foreign register. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only conclude by reiterating what Senator Haines said so eloquently, and that is that this is merely a request that we get the information. What we do with that information is further down the track. Information is a sine qua non of the democratic process. We cannot make intelligent, informed, democratic decisions in this very important area unless we have that information. Therefore, it is highly desirable that a register be established and that that information be available to all Australians, not least those who sit in this chamber and pontificate about these questions in total ignorance of the facts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also want to dispute the remarks that Senator Messner made about the information with regard to foreign ownership of property being readily available in the States. As far as the Western Australian situation is concerned, in September 1987 the then Premier of Western Australia, Mr Brian Burke, made a public announcement that Western Australia did not need a register of foreign ownership. When he was asked how much foreign ownership there was in Western Australia he had to admit that he did not know. In fact, at the present time in Western Australia the National Party in the State Parliament has announced that it is about to introduce legislation requiring a register within the State with regard to foreign ownership. So I do not believe that everybody in the Liberal and National parties in Australia feels the same way on this issue as our Federal colleagues here seem to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I strongly support this amendment of the Democrats. We are laying ourselves wide open in a most unfortunate way. I would remind the Senate of an advertisement that appeared in June of last year in the English language newspaper the South China Morning Post, which is published in Hong Kong. It was a very offensive advertisement which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia is up for grabs. Invest in your future now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is not able to accept this amendment. If it was to be carried, it would require all foreigners, both corporate and individual, to report each year all the property or shares that they own in Australia. I think it is fairly obvious that that would require an enormous administrative effort, the cost of which would ultimately be lumbered on the Commonwealth taxpayer, public sector costs, and probably something like comparable private sector costs to the companies or individuals which would be required to supply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is aimed principally at rural land. The registers or records of rural land are held, of course, by State governments. It has been mentioned that Queensland has already announced that it intends to establish a foreign owned land register. If all States had such a register in existence, it may well be that it would not require a great deal of cost or effort by the Commonwealth Government, provided the States were willing to cooperate, to establish a central register. However, that is not the position. The Federal Government has no records of the sales of assets from foreign ownership to Australian ownership, be it land or portfolio investment. As I and Senator Messner have said, it would be an extremely costly exercise to establish one. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there is some information. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has published surveys on foreign ownership and control of different industry sectors in Australia. I do not think it is a regular survey or publication; it is something that happens from time to time. Some of those have dated, but they are a far more useful guide to the extent of foreign participation than could be obtained from the register proposed by the Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it two pieces of legislation-the Lands Acquisition Bill 1988 and the Lands Acquisition (Repeal and Consequential Provisions) Bill 1988. These Bills deal with one of the fundamental issues to be faced by any government, namely, the acquisition of private property for public purposes. That is a very important and significant role which any government has to play. The record of Labor governments in terms of dealing with the question of the acquisition of private property is not a particularly spectacular one. Indeed, coming as I do from the State of New South Wales, I am reminded of the activities of the late and unlamented Wran Labor Government in that State, which in 1981 passed the Coal Acquisition Act which allowed the State Government to seize from private individuals without the payment of compensation all of the coal rights which they held and in some cases had held for many years and for several generations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The two pieces of legislation now before the chamber are designed to redress both deficiencies and matters of urgency as they relate to the question of land acquisition.

In 1986 the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence produced a report on the question of land acquisition in New South Wales by the Australian Army. This concerned an attempt by the Australian defence forces to acquire certain land in the western areas of New South Wales. In the course of the Senate Committee inquiry a number of deficiencies in land acquisition procedures were brought to public attention. The Committee says on page xiv of its report that the Western Lands Commissioner, Mr Pearson:</PARA>
<PARA>also stated that because the Commonwealth Lands Acquisition Act is not considered a suitable mechanism to provide for the acquisition of leasehold property or the variation of the terms of a leaseholder, the Western Lands Commission would hope that the establishment of the manoeuvre area would be the subject of special legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, at that stage a particular deficiency in regard to the acquisition of particular land in particular circumstances under the Lands Acquisition Act was revealed. The Committee, in its comments on page xvii of the report, says:</PARA>
<PARA>Thus the Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government clarify its policy on the compulsory acquisition of land in peacetime for Defence purposes before proceeding further . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee was at pains to draw attention to the deficiencies which existed in the then Lands Acquisition Act. The matter is not only one of addressing deficiencies. It is also a matter of addressing a number of urgent or potentially urgent problems, the most important of which is the acquisition of land in order to facilitate the development of some sort of aviation facility at Badgerys Creek in the west of Sydney. You and I, Mr Acting Deputy President, are both very interested in the decision as to exactly what sort of facility will be developed at Badgerys Creek, but neither of us is any the wiser as a result of Government decisions about the development of aviation facilities. I was intrigued to see in the Sunday Telegraph of last Sunday a call by Mr Roger Price, one of the Government's backbenchers in the House of Representatives, to speed up airport development by privatising Badgerys Creek. How all of that is to be achieved at the same time as there is to be acquisition of land by the Commonwealth for its particular purposes I am not altogether sure. The representatives of the Land Acquisition Reform Committee, to which I shall refer later, have made representations to the Government, so far unanswered, asking it exactly what is the status of land to be acquired in the Badgerys Creek area as a result of the decisions made about airport development in that part of NSW. </PARA>
<PARA> To give one other example of where the question of Commonwealth lands acquisition legislation is going to be important, I draw attention to the December 1988 report on the very fast train project, and in particular, the document entitled Concept Report Summary in which the proponents of the very fast train project say:</PARA>
<PARA>Without government backing for land acquisition, it is likely that the VFT would face costly and protracted negotiations and legal proceedings about acquisition of the route. For this reason it is considered necessary for governments to legislate in support of the land acquisition process. </PARA>
<PARA>That is simply another example of why it is necessary to have a modern and coherent Lands Acquisition Act in place for the Commonwealth when it is going to require the compulsory acquisition of currently privately owned land. The Commonwealth has had lands acquisition legislation in place for a considerable period. In fact, the original Lands Acquisition Act was passed in 1905. That Act in turn was based on a United Kingdom statute which dated back to 1845. The current Act, which is essentially the subject of repeal and the enactment of this new piece of legislation, was enacted in 1955. It is clear that problems existed in land acquisition for many years. In 1977 the Government gave a reference to the Law Reform Commission to produce a report entitled Lands Acquisition and Compensation. That report was provided to the Government in 1980 and the work of the commissioner, His Honour Mr Justice Wilcox, as he now is, is something which is to be greatly commended. Mr Justice Wilcox has not only undertaken this inquiry but has been a major adviser to both government and interested parties in the question of land acquisition for more than 10 years. I have already mentioned the Senate inquiry which dealt in part with the problems of land acquisition by the defence forces. That also had the sole of exposing some of the deficiencies in the 1955 legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I also mention the role of that body to which I referred a few moments ago, the Land Acquisition Reform Committee, commonly known as LARC, which over the last few years has done the most extraordinary amount of work in the public domain in dealing with problems of land acquisition. Its Chairman, Mr John Duff, and its Deputy Chairman, Mary Turner, have been quite prodigious in the amount of work they have done, the public meetings they have organised, the seminars and the representations and submissions they have made to successive Commonwealth Ministers in order to try to bring about the most satisfactory piece of legislation possible. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Law Reform Commission reported in 1980 and that report was critical of a number of aspects of lands acquisition legislation. During recent years the Commonwealth Parliament has enacted legislation to enable the independent review of administrative decisions which adversely affect individuals. The decision to acquire property, particularly by the use of compulsory process, is a decision which affects, sometimes profoundly, the owner of the property. There is in the current Act no mechanism whereby an owner may require the acquiring authority to justify publicly the need for and choice of his property. When persons' homes are acquired, it can cause significant disruption to the individuals involved. There is currently no legislative provision to ensure that displaced owners can provide for themselves out of their compensation money a suitable alternative home. The Government concedes that it is reasonable that people in those circumstances should be provided practical assistance and recompense for this intangible effect of removal from their home. This is not provided for in the current legislative arrangements which we have. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area which is not provided for in current legislation is that of blight. It is not uncommon for government acquisition decisions to be generally known for some years before acquisition takes place. The case of Badgerys Creek is one of the most long running sagas in this regard. People whose property is involved can find themselves in the situation where there is no market for his property because of the Government's intentions, and the Government might not be ready to acquire the land for some years. Under the current Act there is no facility for the owner to compel the Government proposing the acquisition to purchase from him. Inflation can also cause difficulties for owners, particularly if there is a significant lapse of time between acquisition of the property and payment of compensation following final agreement on the amount to be paid. As a result of all of these criticisms, three main recommendations emerged from the Law Reform Commission study: first, that there should be more open procedures in the acquisition process; secondly, that there should be greater public accountability for decisions to acquire property; and thirdly, that there should be more generous statutory provisions for the compensation of persons deprived of their land by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill was introduced originally on 25 May 1988, almost a year ago. It was then laid on the table for an extensive period of public discussion. The Land Acquisition Reform Committee commenced a series of public forums in July 1988 to discuss this, in which the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West), my New South Wales colleague Senator David Brownhill, a number of other distinguished speakers and I participated and turned our minds to this matter. In October 1988 the Government introduced 34 amendments to the legislation and finally, in order to pick up the time lag which had been exposed over the Badgerys Creek decision, in November 1988 the Government introduced the second piece of legislation with which we are dealing this evening, the Lands Acquisition (Repeal and Consequential Provisions) Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The main Bill, the primary piece of legislation that we have before us, arises from the Law Reform Commission report. It specifies an entirely new and comprehensive process that must be followed when the Commonwealth wishes to acquire property. At the start of the process the Bill requires that the Government make a pre-acquisition declaration. This declaration is a statement of intention which is provided to the owner, giving the Government's reason for the acquisition and identifying the owner's rights. At the same time the Bill says that the Government's intention to acquire is to be made public by publication in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette and in a local newspaper. Furthermore, the Bill requires that the marketplace be alerted to the Commonwealth's intention by providing that the declaration will be registered on the title of the property and, indeed, that the owner will be required to tell intending purchasers of the Commonwealth's intention. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill requires the Government to complete acquisitions expeditiously. Of course that is something of a joke for the people of Badgerys Creek. Throughout the Bill time limits are identified in which the Commonwealth must act or make decisions. One of the important features of the Bill is that the owner can seek a review of the Government's decision to acquire his property, although-as I shall show later-that is circumscribed in certain areas. For example, the policy decision of the Government which has led to the decision that an acquisition should take place is itself not subject to review. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, the Bill has been through a number of changes as a result of the public discussion to which I referred earlier. For example, under clause 46 of the original Bill, where there was to be a disallowance of an acquisition of an interest in land in a public park, the legislation provided that either House of the Parliament might, within 28 days after a copy of the declaration had been laid before it, pass a resolution disallowing the acquisition. When the Bill was rewritten, because of the considerable time delays which had been identified in the procedures laid down by the Government, we found that that 28 days had been cut back to seven sitting days. That is a welcome change in the legislation and one which has resulted from the extensive public discussions to which I previously referred. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill was subject to a large number of amendments introduced by the Government. Those amendments covered quite a number of issues, including the right of landowners to seek review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of compensation offers; a new statutory list of compensation entitlements; the payment of a householder's solatium, that is to say a payment in cases where the principal place of residence is acquired by the Commonwealth; optional compensation on the basis of the cost of equivalent reinstatement where there is no market for the property and a bona fide intention to re-establish. There were a number of other amendments: for example, a statutory requirement to make 90 per cent advances of compensation offered, some changes to time limits and some changes in the power to approve compulsory acquisition to devolve from the Governor-General to the Minister for Administrative Services. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have before us the Lands Acquisition (Repeal and Consequential Provisions) Bill, which is designed to extend to acquisitions which were already in train for land at Badgerys Creek before the introduction of this new package of legislation the more generous provisions of this package of legislation, as if the acquisition of land at Badgerys Creek had commenced under the regime which is in fact now the subject of the legislation before us. In other words, where acquisition was already in train but had not been completed, those acquisitions will be completed on the basis of the 1988 legislation rather than on the basis of the 1955 legislation, and that is a more generous regime than was otherwise provided for. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn finally to the question of deficiencies which the Opposition sees as still remaining in this piece of legislation. I should indicate that although we will move one amendment in relation to certain mining matters, it is our intention to support this legislation when it comes to a vote. The first of the deficiencies which we identify is in relation to certain ambiguities in terms of mining matters; in other words, whether existing State mining regimes are in any way affected or displaced by the operation of the new Commonwealth legislation. The 1955 Act guaranteed compatibility with State practices and procedures in relation to mining activity. We are concerned that the 1988 legislation does not adequately repeat that guarantee. We will therefore move an amendment to ensure that it does. </PARA>
<PARA> The second deficiency is that the legislation appears to discriminate specifically against the position of the Northern Territory. My colleague Senator Tambling, always assiduous in his representation of the rights of the Northern Territory, has drawn attention to the fact that the provisions of this Bill seem to imply that the Northern Territory is not treated in the same way as the States. For example, the public purpose for which land may be acquired in a territory means any purpose in relation to the territory, but in relation to States is limited to Federal purposes. In other words, we have a situation in which the acquisition of land in the Northern Territory does not take place on entirely the same footing as the acquisition of land in the States. This is a situation which we believe the Government has wrongly addressed. We believe that the Government should undertake some review of this matter to ensure that the Commonwealth's power to acquire land in the Northern Territory should be limited to public purposes other than those which might relate to a transferred matter under the Northern Territory self-government regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point to which I draw attention is the complaint which has been made by the Land Acquisition Reform Committee that there remain a number of areas in which the question of suitability of the Government's proposals have yet to be addressed in relation to the question of Badgerys Creek. Rather than go into that in great detail at the moment, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a letter which was shown to the Minister in the chamber when this matter was about to come on for debate. The letter is from the Deputy Chairman of the Land Acquisition Reform Committee and details those objections and problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA>The Hon. Stewart West, M.P.,</PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Administrative Services,</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House,</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA. A.C.T. 2600. </PARA>
<PARA>My Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA>LANDS ACQUISITION BILL 1988</PARA>
<PARA>Our Committee was pleased to see the amended Bill returned to Parliament so promptly and to note that the amendments addressed many of the points raised in our LANDWATCH Forum last July. We greatly appreciate your personal commitment to seeking and taking account of public comment on the draft Bill, and agree with you that the new Act, assured of support by the Opposition in the Senate, will be a great advance on the old legislation in its progress towards the constitutional requirement for `just terms' of land acquisition by the Commonwealth, despite its accepted avoidance of the contentious issue of injurious affection. </PARA>
<PARA> However, although we concur with the Opposition's view that the amended Bill should proceed to enactment and proclamation as soon as possible so that its many improved provisions may be speedily enshrined in law, we are deeply disappointed that the most serious flaw in the old Act remains in the new, i.e. the ability of any Government to withhold the process which sets the Act in motion during its pleasure, however long that may be. </PARA>
<PARA> The injustice of this is vividly illustrated by the situation which has obtained at Badgery's Creek since the then Minister for Aviation made his public announcement on 17th February 1986, followed by letters from him to the (clearly identified) affected landholders dated 24th February 1986 and supported by letters to the same persons from the then Minister for Local Government and Administrative Services dated 25th February 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> To contend that these acts-each of them separately, let alone all of them together-do not constitute ``a government or ministerial announcement [of intention to acquire]'' and hence, by the plainest English definition, a ``pre-acquisition declaration'', is in our view self-evidently insupportable. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect, we believe that the views of the Law Reform Commission on this point have been misinterpreted. Its Report alludes to the ``need for a system of review of a tentative decision to acquire land'' (see para. 111), and states (in para. 140) that ``any effective review of the decision to acquire depends upon information as to the purpose for which the land is intended to be used.'' The same paragraph goes on to suggest that ``an appropriate procedure would be to require the Minister to make a declaration that a specified area of land appears to him to be suitable for use . . . by the Commonwealth and that he is considering acquisition for a specified public purpose.''</PARA>
<PARA> The emphasis on the above words is ours, and we submit that the tentative nature of their meaning indicates that the Law Reform Commission envisaged the Minister's declaration (with its consequent machinery for ``effective review'') taking place early in the progress towards acquisition, not-as seems to be its position in the minds of your Department's bureaucrats-as the penultimate step to completion after Government policy has hardened into a final decision and even the finance has been allocated. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the new Bill, as amended, in Clause 22-Declaration that land is suitable for acquisition, uses the phrases ``is considering the acquisition'' and ``appears to be suitable'', your supporting speech (Hansard 20/10/88 p. 2054) clearly indicates that the declaration is not to be made early, to enable the Minister's proposal to be tested and ``effectively reviewed'' as the Law Reform Commission recommends, but indeed as the penultimate step to acquisition. In effect the new process, ``pre-acquisition declaration'', becomes just another name for the old ``notice to treat'', and while ever this flaw is perpetuated the many excellent provisions in the new Bill which come into play after the ``pre-acquisition declaration'' has been made remain out of the reach of affected landholders, who will be as unjustly victimised as ever up to this point in the process; witness the landholders at Badgery's Creek. </PARA>
<PARA> Other sections of the Law Reform Commission's Report reinforce the concern underlying its thinking, particularly its acknowledgment that undue delay on the part of the Government causes blight, which causes loss, and that such loss should be compensable. We refer you particularly to paras. 157 to 160. </PARA>
<PARA> We also refer you to para. 182, in which the Commission discusses the limitations of Section 9 (6) of the old Act, and submit that as currently conceived your ``pre-acquisition declaration'' provisions contain the same limitation:-</PARA>
<PARA>``. . . The second major limitation of S.9 (6) is that it requires a formal notice to treat. In practice a proposal for a public work will be common knowledge long before any formal notice to treat. A `blight' may then descend on the land which will only be removed by an announcement of abandonment of the work or actual acquisition. Where the proposal is abandoned between its original mooting and a formal notice to treat no claim can arise under S.9 (6). Yet in such a case damage may be suffered.''</PARA>
<PARA> Discussing the period within which such damage should be indemnified by the Commonwealth para. 188 says:-``. . . If . . . there has been a formal government proposal for the use of the land involving acquisition [such as that published on 17th February 1986 in the case of Badgery's Creek] it is unreasonable that losses caused by such a proposal should be uncompensated simply because no formal acquisition step has been taken . . . The rule should be that the compensable period commences with the date of the Minister's declaration of a proposal to acquire for a project and that it should terminate at the date of actual or deemed abandonment. The period, for compensation purposes, will coincide with the period within which there is a restriction on sale or development of the land [a period which has existed, in the case of Badgery's Creek, since 17th February 1986]. </PARA>
<PARA> Discussing an appropriate formula for such compensation the Report (in para. 243) says:- ``. . . Specific provision needs to be made for this and it is appropriate to include it as part of the disturbance factor. This may be done by extending the present concept of disturbance, consequent upon acquisition, to include disturbance consequent upon the making of the declaration. The event should be the `making' of the instrument rather than service upon the owner to cover the possibility of the declaration not being served but, nonetheless, coming to the knowledge of the owner [as it did to owners at Badgery's Creek in February 1986] and thus inhibiting development by him of the land.'' (The emphasis is ours.)</PARA>
<PARA> In pressing the importance of triggering the Act earlier in the process of proposal and review, we would point out that the Law Reform Commission's recommendations were made nine years ago, and the intervening period has produced not only examples and experience of acquisition proposals which have enabled more precise definition of deficiencies and injustices, but a much wider public awareness of acquisition issues and a more sensitive public perception of Government's responsibility to deal justly with individuals who may be called upon to make sacrifices for the public good. </PARA>
<PARA> We would also emphasise another point which was made by our Chairman, John Duff, at the forum; that although the perceived cost of prompt acquisition seems to be the most potent factor inhibiting Government action on this score, the cost of the actual land on which a project is to be sited may well be a very small fraction of the total cost of the project, a fraction which to our Committee it seems worth spending in the interests of justice to innocent parties who are otherwise sorely victimised. </PARA>
<PARA> We are encouraged by your declared commitment to keep the workings of the new Act under review; but we must reiterate our belief that the flaw we have discussed above is a crippling one that demands prompt attention if the new Act is to fulfil the hopes we all had of it. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion we should like to add our weight to the Opposition's call for the Government to establish forthwith a task force to examine the remaining complex issue which was deliberately excluded from consideration in framing the new legislation as it is now presented-the matter of injurious affection. We fully support the need-which you have yourself acknowledged-to examine this very complex and contentious question as early and as thoroughly as possible, with the object of framing additional legislation to relieve some at least of its severest effects on people who fall victim to it. </PARA>
<PARA> We have noted, in this connection, the reference in your speech to the House on 20th October last (Hansard p. 2055):- ``. . . I will be proposing an amendment to the Bill after full consultation with the Opposition spokesman and with organisations such as the Land Acquisition Reform Committee''. We would greatly appreciate some clarification and amplification of the direction of your thinking that lies behind this statement. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA>Deputy Chairman</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fourth matter about which I have some concern relates to the acquisition of land in park areas. The Bill provides for the Minister to have power to acquire land in public parks. The compulsory process must be used but can only be used where a specified set of conditions has been met. These are that the State or territory concerned must agree to the acquisition and an inquiry is to be held under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. Both Houses of Parliament may veto the requirement for an inquiry. If that occurs, any other level of environmental investigation required under the Act must still be undertaken. Furthermore, if the land falls within a National Estate area or World Heritage area an environmental impact statement is mandatory. The Minister must table a notice of the acquisition in both Houses of Parliament and either House may declare the acquisition null and void. I have some concerns about the complexity of that matter which I will refer to when we address this matter in the committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fifth matter which is of concern is the question of the solatium which I mentioned previously, which was introduced in the subsequent amendments. The solatium is set in the legislation at a figure of $10,000, to be adjusted according to the consumer price index, whereas there is some case for claiming that it should be set at a percentage of the value of the property. Indeed, under the legislation which is operative in Victoria a fixed 10 per cent of the acquisition price is made as a solace payment. This provides the solatium rather than the fixed figure provided for in the Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The sixth matter of concern is the question of capital gains taxes. Undoubtedly, Senator Walsh would be able to explain this anomaly. The taxation Act, and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) passed by the Senate on 2 March, impact on the taxation liability for those whose land or other property is compulsorily acquired by State or Commonwealth governments. The taxation Act allows for capital gains tax roll-over relief if the moneys gained as compensation for acquisition of land are used to purchase a replacement asset of a nature similar to the asset acquired by the Government. It does not permit roll-over relief if moneys are spent on a dissimilar asset; for example, compulsory sale of a farm or part thereof and purchase of a shop, factory or investment property. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 44 of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill permits capital gains tax roll-over relief for sales of property concluded by negotiation between the owner and the Government where they are part of the lands acquisition process. For capital gains roll-over relief to be granted for a negotiated sale, the Government must advise the vendor that, failing a satisfactory negotiated sale, the land or property will be acquired compulsorily. Given the difficulties in finding a similar replacement asset such as a farm of similar type or value, it is highly likely that the land and property owners will face, as a result of compulsory sale of property and difficulty in purchasing a replacement asset, a capital gains tax. Therefore, the taxation effect of compulsory acquisition of land or property provided for in the Lands Acquisition Bill creates a conflict with the provisions in clause 55 of the taxation legislation that any cost or expenses incurred by the landowner as a result of acquisition of land would be compensated by government. </PARA>
<PARA> Importantly, the cost of a capital gains tax needs to be explicitly included in the compensation package. At present the Bill, unlike the taxation Act, does not link compensation of costs plus expenses to the condition of purchasing a replacement property. Indeed, the National Farmers Federation has recommended that the Lands Acquisition Bill contain reference to the need for capital gains tax roll-over relief where a land-holder does not purchase a similar replacement property following negotiated or compulsory acquisition of property by government, either by direct reference within the Bill or, I think more appropriately, by an amendment to the definition of `replaced asset' currently in taxation legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point which I make by way of criticism of the Bill in its current form is that it does not really address the question of blight. I do not know that there is any really adequate legislative provision which can address that problem. I believe the legislation has simply shied away from dealing with questions of blight. This is a matter which is now one of very considerable moment to people in Badgerys Creek. They have, after all, expected the acquisition of land. After all, they had Senator Evans's assurance that there was not going to be a third runway at Kingsford-Smith. Therefore, they expected the development of a particular type of international airport out at Badgerys Creek. They had Senator Evans's worthy assurance that there was never going to be a third runway at Kingsford-Smith. It turned out to be like so many other worthy assurances that were given by senior figures in the Government that this was never going to take place. Of course, now that it has taken place and Senator Evans has decided that his assurances do not require him to throw himself upon the same sword that Mr Punch has thrown himself upon over this particular matter, the people at Badgerys Creek find that they are no longer as confident about the nature of the acquisition which will take place or the time framework in which the acquisition will take place. They are the primary sufferers at the moment from the effects of the blight which has been caused over the sale of their property by the Government's backing and filling on the question of Sydney's airport needs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our policy has always been perfectly clear on this matter. We support the development of the third runway at Kingsford-Smith. There has never been any doubt about that matter. The legislation substantially improves the regime for public acquisition of private property. It makes a considerable advance on the legislation which started off in the United Kingdom in 1845, was translated into Commonwealth legislation in 1905, was codified in a major Bill in 1955, and was then the subject of a Law Reform Commission inquiry which commenced in 1977, concluded in 1980 and produced a Bill which originally saw the light of day in May last year, which was amended in October last year by the Government with the introduction of 34 amendments and which was added to in November last year by the bringing forward of another piece of legislation, the second Bill before the chamber at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We support the legislation. We believe that those seven deficiencies which I have outlined in relation to the Bill need to be addressed. We will be expecting the Government to respond at the conclusion of this debate to each of those particular matters, namely the ambiguity of the mining regime, the discrimination against the Northern Territory, the particular concerns of the Land Acquisition Reform Committee in the letter which I have tabled, the complexity of the parks regime, the payment of the solatium, the effect of the capital gains tax, and the provisions dealing with blight. We will have something to say about some of those matters at the committee stage of the Bill. Other than that, I have pleasure in indicating the Opposition's support for the Bill in principle. We wish it a speedy passage after the very long and very tortuous time that it has spent in both chambers. It is an important piece of legislation which deserves to be passed and put into effect as quickly as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Lands Acquisition Bill, which relates to Commonwealth acquisition of land, as Senator Puplick has pointed out several times in his dissertation, has had a long gestation period under both the present and previous governments. The Australian Democrats do not intend to add too much to that gestation period, which might come as some relief to the chamber tonight. The need for reform in this area has been long recognised. The inadequacies of the existing legislation prompted the Fraser Government to request the Law Reform Commission to examine the legislation and to concentrate on the rights of people whose land was compulsorily acquired by the Commonwealth and to report on the question of compensation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Law Reform Commission report was tabled in April 1980 and recommendations to improve the legislation were made. Since then, there has been extensive community consultation about the report and this Bill, as pointed out by Senator Puplick, has emerged from that. It is worth observing that the process has been rather slow and, while the reforms are welcome, the Government has been very tardy in recognising that and in introducing them. Some concerns expressed since the original Bill was introduced last year have been picked up in extensive amendments brought in by the Government. I refer particularly to representations made at that time by the Land Acquisition Reform Committee in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> The original Australian Law Reform Commission recommendations urged more open procedures in the acquisition process, greater public accountability for decisions to acquire property, and more generous provisions for compensation for persons deprived of their land by the Commonwealth. The Bill before us has largely picked up those objectives and certainly provides more adequately for the rights of property owners whose land might be acquired. One important aspect of this is that persons threatened with compulsory acquisition of their land should have the opportunity to challenge the fairness of that decision before an independent tribunal. The Bill provides for appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) based upon such matters as public purpose, suitability, effect on land owners, environmental effect and alternative means of achieving the public purpose. There is no provision for appeal where the land is `essential for the implementation of policy', but in such circumstances an owner can always appeal to the Federal Court under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. The Bill picks up all the Law Reform Commission recommendations on changed acquisition procedures, including the gazettal of acquisitions, and provides for former owners to remain in possession for six months after acquisition. More generous compensation will be available, and detailed guidelines are included to ensure its adequacy. </PARA>
<PARA> One important issue which has not been addressed adequately in the Bill relates to injurious affection, that is, compensation for those whose land is adversely affected by the acquisition by the Commonwealth of adjacent land. This is a very complex area, legally and administratively, but it is a serious problem which needs to be addressed. Certainly the Government proposes to retain that part of the existing Act which takes some account of injurious affection but, in the view of the Democrats, it does not go far enough. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Law Reform Commission has pointed out that an adjacent owner may suffer an injury equal to that of the neighbour whose land is acquired, but he is not entitled to any statutory compensation. Obviously, this is both anomalous and unjust, and the Democrats would welcome some comment from the responsible Minister concerning the Government's intentions on this matter. We are also aware that the Government moved some way on this issue in the amendments it made to this Bill after it was first introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick has outlined in considerable detail some other concerns which remain about the legislation, in particular concerns expressed by the National Farmers Federation, which I will not reiterate except to say that the Democrats acknowledge those concerns and take this opportunity to draw them to the Government's attention. In essence, the first concern is the likelihood that all property owners will face capital gains tax as a result of compulsory acquisition of land or property due to that conflict between the spirit of the Bill and of the tax Act. The second concern is that a solace payment, a solatium, is applicable only to the loss of a home and not to the loss of land. As the National Farmers Federation points out, farming families, particularly those which have worked on properties for generations, have an emotional attachment to the land which is indistinguishable from an attachment to a home. This is a concern. As the National Farmers Federation points out, it will be a complex process and one which needs to be reconciled, particularly as major projects such as the very fast train will affect many landowners in the course of their development. That is something which the Government and, indeed, all of us need to bear in mind in developing further this area of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Land Acquisition Reform Commission in New South Wales has outstanding concerns, most of which Senator Puplick has already referred to. In addition to those matters, I refer to a question from that Committee which was addressed to the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) in March of this year. The Committee is concerned that some defence area control legislation has been foreshadowed. It is anxious that further developments should take place on that issue, which is of particular concern to it. However, the Committee has yet to hear again from the Minister following the consultations that were made in July of last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, this Bill provides a much better framework within which the acquisition of land by the Commonwealth will operate. The rights of landowners are much better protected. The Australian Democrats can only regret that the process has taken so long. As I said, we do not intend to lengthen that process. We will be supporting the legislation. We ask that the Government bear in mind the anomalies which have been pointed out and the concerns that we have brought before the Senate in this debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Lands Acquisition Bill 1988 and the Lands Acquisition (Repeal and Consequential Provisions) Bill 1988 have been hanging around for quite some time. It is rather sad that legislation of such significance should have been pushed off the agenda of this place time after time. Little thought has been given to the handful of people who have worked for years to draft the legislation for the Parliament or to the dozens of people who have established committees, held conferences, written letters to members of parliament and lobbied continuously for improvements to existing and outdated legislation. Hundreds of people have already seen their own land taken or placed under threat. Last, but not least, little thought has been given to the thousands of people who have signed petitions on this subject, many of which I have tabled in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I deal with the substance of the legislation before us, I would like to record and applaud the work that the Land Acquisition Reform Committee (LARC) has undertaken over a number of years to bring about changes to the legal process. The Committee members have been tireless workers for their cause. They have written many letters to me and to other members of parliament. Their correspondence has always been full of fact, with well argued opinions. Very obviously, they have looked more closely at the finer points in the legislation than many members of parliament do. I believe that two people who ought to be commended for their work are Mrs Mary Turner, from Orange, New South Wales, who is the Deputy Chairman of LARC, and Mr John Duff, the Chairman of LARC. They must be commended for their dedication and absolute belief in what they have been doing. This legislation is for the most part the result of their lobbying efforts and I commend them for that. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation has a long history. In fact, it was the previous coalition Government that first sent a reference to the Law Reform Commission requesting a review of the Lands Acquisition Act 1955. The Commission was asked particularly to make comments on the rights of private citizens whose land was compulsorily acquired by the Commonwealth. The Law Reform Commission made a report in 1980, and it has taken this long for appropriate legislation to come before the Parliament, although I know that successive governments have had extensive consultation with various groups and individuals during that time. However, despite the obvious need for this legislation, the Government has been disturbingly slothful in addressing itself to the problem. Even when it finally got the Lands Acquisition Bill into a draft and then a final form, it found it necessary to introduce a secondary Bill, the Lands Acquisition (Repeal and Consequential Provisions) Bill, to correct the anomalies. In my view, the Government still has not got it right, but we should all be grateful for small mercies and glad that at least some form of legislation is to be put in place. Mr Uren in the House of Representatives has played a big part in the formulation of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very likely that prior to the 1984 Army land grab fiasco there were other cases where compensation for compulsorily acquired land was unjust or inappropriate. Given that the Commonwealth Government acquires an average of 2,000 properties annually, it is obvious that not all are required without acrimony. Regrettably, little notice is taken of odd instances. It required a seige in the Orange-Bathurst area and the Cobar area to bring the need for legislation into the spotlight. It was only then that the people fully realised the inadequacies and the injustices that the Act contained. I do not need to delay the Senate with a long and protracted history of the aborted attempt by the Department of Defence to evict landholders in the Bathurst-Orange and Cobar areas of New South Wales. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a great part he played! He did not look after the people whose privately owned freehold land was under threat of being taken away from them. However, LARC evolved from resident action which took place over more than four years. It was realised that the injustice that was occurring at that time could recur anywhere because the legislation was inadequate, just as the Law Reform Commission had found in 1980 and just as the 1977 reference to it suggested. The Law Reform Commission, in its 1980 report, recommended new legislation covering both land acquisition and injurious affection which incorporated revised acquisition powers and new pre-acquisition procedures. As I said, the Commission reported in 1980. Only now, nearly nine years later, the Government has finally brought the legislation to the Parliament. The Senate now has an opportunity to debate the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The central feature of this legislation is that a person threatened with compulsory acquisition of his land should be provided with an opportunity to challenge this decision before an independent tribunal-taking it before an umpire, as it were. The legislation provides several grounds on which an affected land-holder can appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the independent arbiter. These grounds include the purpose for which the Government wishes to acquire the land; the extent to which that use is in the public interest; the suitability of the land; the effect of acquisition on land owners; the environmental effect; and alternatives for the proposed public purpose. However, the Bill makes some exceptions, with land required for essential purposes being exempt from that procedure. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's recommendations concerning pre-acquisition, which are already incorporated in the Bill, include improved information to the owners whose land is to be acquired-I might add that the position could not be any worse than previously when people read about proposals in the newspaper or heard about them on radio-an ability for people who have a vested interest in the land in question other than the owner to appeal against the Government's decision; and a statutory deadline for acquisition of land. These are all improvements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also takes into account the Commission's advice on changed acquisition procedures, including the gazettal of acquisitions, and provides for former owners to remain in possession for six months after acquisition. This will alleviate disruption and help assist in relocation once compensation has been paid. The Bill accepts the Law Reform Commission's recommendation that a home owner should not receive less than the cost of a reasonably equivalent dwelling. Too often in the past, legal loopholes have allowed governments to pay amounts which were insufficient to enable a person to be relocated satisfactorily. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation has already received the support of the Opposition in the House of Representatives. It will also receive the support of the Liberal and National parties here in this place. However, I cannot help wondering just how committed the Government will be when the time comes for it to put into practice the sentiments this Bill embodies; that is, that landholders' rights are protected and that the Government is committed to ensuring a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very involved with the people who, for so long, were caught up in the Army land grab. I saw what it did to families, to marriages and to people's health. I saw farms go downhill either because the farmers were out learning how to become lobbyists in order to save their farms or because they had given up. We all know how wool prices have shot away in the past year or so. I wonder how much income the people in the Bathurst-Orange area lost because over the four-year period, while they were away fighting the Government, they did not build up or maintain their flocks. There was no apology from the Government then and there has been neither compensation nor an apology since. Nor has there been an apology from the newest addition to the Hawke Labor Ministry, the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons), Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will have to wait and see. I believe I can be pardoned for being cynical about the sincerity of this Government in its enactment of this legislation. Of course, those opposite can demonstrate their sincerity very quickly but I doubt that they will. In fact, to date they have shown they have learnt nothing from the Orange-Bathurst fiasco. I refer to the Badgerys Creek acquisitions. Having completely bungled the Bathurst-Orange deal, we now see a similar mess arising in connection with the Badgerys Creek saga. The Federal Government's handling of the Badgerys Creek saga is a massive con of this Parliament and of the Australian people. For months the Opposition has been pushing the Government to come clean on Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. We have said there are problems. These arguments have been supported by airline pilots, who use the airport every day, and by air traffic controllers, who are resigning in record numbers because of work pressure caused by inadequate facilities and overcrowded runways. I could go on but I would run out of time, and it has all be said before.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government has sat on the other side of the chamber oblivious to all this criticism, stalling on making a public announcement about anything to do with airports. A succession of Ministers has told us that Badgerys Creek could be up and running in four to six years. Even Senator Richardson told us this in this chamber recently. Now, of course, the Government has decided to go ahead with the third runway at Mascot. I commend it for that but it will take a long while for the environmental study, which should be hurried up. I ask this Government: How, in four years, will it build an airport at Badgerys Creek that will take 747 planes when it has literally to move a mountain to get the distance? What about the water and power for the area? Is it not a fact that Prospect County Council has not so much as a formal plan for providing any services as yet? What of the landholders? That is what this Bill is all about. The Government has already told some of these landholders that it cannot afford to pay out this year. If the Government cannot afford to pay out the small landholders, how can it afford the dairy, the winery and the entertainment centre businesses? Given that its valuers have admitted that they have no idea what valuations to put on these two large businesses, how can the Government say the airport could be finished by 1993? It will take the Government that long just to sort out in court the arguments that are amassing in that area. What about the people living in the Liverpool and Wollondilly shires who have been prevented for some time from making any extensions to their houses or developing their businesses? How long are they to be kept on a string? Senator Michael Baume knows a lot about this. He has been fighting to help those people in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to the Ministers concerned that, before they come into this chamber and try to do a snow job on us, the media and the people in Australia, they take a visit to the Badgerys Creek area. There have been no plans to reroute the main road-the main northern road. That road provides the major link between western Sydney and the Hume Highway. Up to 1,000 semitrailers a day use that road. Where will the Government move them? And when the airport is constructed, how will all that increased traffic be directed? When will it tell the people living along that road that they will have to move? To date the Government has not done this. Badgerys Creek is another saga in dishonesty, administrative bungling and political incompetence, and it must be exposed as such. </PARA>
<PARA> The Orange-Bathurst disaster was an outrage-a vicious soul destroying outrage-and yet, less than three years later, the Government is again doing the same thing to average Australian families. How does it think it can get away with it? Honourable senators opposite cannot come into this chamber and lie their way through Question Time, claiming that all the environmental impact studies have been done when they have not, and pretend that ordinary Australians do not matter when political expediency is at stake. </PARA>
<PARA> There are 243 affected landholders in the Badgerys Creek area. Some of them are residents, some have small rural holdings, while others conduct a variety of businesses, from service industries to wineries and wool sheds. Each of these landholders was assured the Federal Government would purchase their properties when they decided to sell and that either Government or private valuers could be used. But, after that commitment was given, the Government found itself short of cash, so it froze the deal. As at the end of October last year, only 108 properties had been acquired. </PARA>
<PARA> The LARC group is also concerned about what is happening to the people of Badgerys Creek. It considers the most anomalous flaw in the old Act is continued through to the new; that is, the ability of any government to withhold the process which sets the Act in motion for any period it so chooses. That is what is happening at Badgerys Creek now. That is what happened to the people in the Bathurst-Orange district. So, only two years after the public relations disaster in Bathurst, the Government repeats its mistakes. Once again it puts people on the backburner. Once again we have families waiting to move and businessmen not knowing when they have to relocate their operations. Is it any wonder that I do not trust the Government? Is it any wonder that people, particularly those who have been involved in land acquisitions with the Federal Government, are cynical, distrusting and fed up?</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, New South Wales people have further reasons to distrust the Labor Party. They remember only too well the legacy of the Wran years when, as my colleague Wal Fife so appropriately put it, the `Wran piracy' stripped thousands of New South Wales companies and individuals of their private coal rights under compulsory acquisition and offered compensation which was less than one third of the coal royalty rate collected by the State. It is only now that the Greiner-Murray Government is in power that this appalling travesty has been righted. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area in which I consider the existing legislation to be deficient, and which this new Bill fails to address, is injurious affection. This applies to land that is not the subject of the acquisition but perhaps located adjacent or near to the area acquired. The Government has said it will retain section 23 (1) (c) of the old Act, which takes some account of injurious affection. But it is not sufficiently extensive. In respect of solatium, a flat rate has been determined so that no discretion is given for exceptional circumstances. There is no consideration for interest on unpaid compensation. This is a legislative and administrative minefield. I believe it is important that work be done in an attempt to produce some sort of working formula or guideline that can be used to bring about justice to people that, up until now, have been denied it. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, let me say that I am pleased that after so long we are finally getting some sort of words put into place; that after so much work and lobbying by groups such as LARC, their efforts finally are being rewarded. The Bill is not perfect. A number of areas need improvement. I have mentioned some and other areas were covered by my colleagues. But it is important that there are no further delays to this legislation. We must be grateful that this Government has actually done something after so many promises and after so much procrastination. In a good, hopeful spirit, I think we are thankful for mercies, however small they are. I look forward to the time when those who for so long have been adversely affected and who are suffering at present because of compulsory acquisition of their land by the Federal Government will be compensated fairly and swiftly. It is, after all, the very least that a responsible government ought to do, although I could not say that this is a responsible government in respect of anything to do with land acquisition. I commend the Bill to the Senate and I support the words of Senator Puplick in leading this debate for the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Lands Acquisition Act is not controversial. I think that is evident from the contributions of those who have already addressed the issue in this debate. It is also good legislation. I understand that the Opposition intends to seek some amendment, but the general thrust of its argument is that the legislation is not controversial and is good. In the circumstances of this very important piece of legislation coming before and being passed by Parliament, it would be ungracious not to acknowledge the part played by the Australian Law Reform Commission. The Commission has served this Parliament and the people of Australia well, and it seems only appropriate that in this debate we acknowledge its part in bringing this legislation forth-giving birth to it, as it were-and now, hopefully, listening or watching as the process is completed and it becomes law. The other person who should be acknowledged is the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Stewart West.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation has taken almost a decade to come before Parliament from the time the Law Reform Commission first wrote its report. That is partly due to the careful way the Minister has gone about giving everybody who was affected an opportunity to say something about it. That was made clear in the second reading speech, from which I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> Submissions were made by a number of groups including the Australian Institute of Valuers and Land Administrators, the National Farmers Federation, the Northern Territory and Western Australian Chambers of Mining, the Australian Mining Industry Council and the Land Acquisition Reform Committee. The latter convened a two-day symposium in Sydney to discuss the Bill which was attended by the Opposition, the judiciary and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister has made amendments that were proper and has made them readily. He has brought this Bill forth on the basis of what the Law Reform Commission recommended and he has done so in a very considered and conciliatory fashion. Through the operation of the Commission and the Minister, this legislation has come before this chamber and has been, I think it is fair to say, enthusiastically received. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note from the Lands Acquisition and Compensation report of the Law Reform Commission that the instruction to the Commission to undertake its inquiry was actually issued by the then Attorney-General on 7 July 1977. It has taken that long for this legislation to come before the Parliament. The Law Reform Commission's report No. 14 opens with the sentence:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Each year the Commonwealth acquires an average of 2000 properties. </PARA>
<PARA>That is 2,000 people, companies, families or whatever involuntarily pass up their property at the request of the Commonwealth for various Commonwealth works. In many cases settlement is reached between the Government and the owners and, of course, there are many cases that require further negotiations and, regrettably, they often get to the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to speak in this debate for two reasons: firstly, there is one point that I wish to make and, secondly, I believe at this juncture I am still the only member of the Australian Institute of Valuers in this Parliament. I have been a member of that august body since 1955, and I am even wearing my valuer's tie tonight, which is most appropriate for this occasion. I acknowledge that the Government must have powers to make property acquisitions. There are, of course, public purposes that have to be fulfilled, and so acquisition is necessary. However, the clear problem that I have always found is that so often legislation seems to prevent the valuers of both sides of the argument getting together for an agreed settlement. Without the constraints of artificial barriers it would have been much easier. Of course, valuers who are worth their ticket need not be told how to assess a loss. That is all part of the profession, and legislation is not required to lay down to valuers how they should do it. </PARA>
<PARA> The other qualification is that it is still not accepted that, where it is necessary to acquire property for a community purpose, it is the community that must be prepared to pay, and pay appropriately. This is where the differences usually arise. Legislation that limits compensation or removes items where there is a loss of value, or property, to the disadvantage of the owners is simply not adequate under these circumstances. This, of course, is the point I wish to make particularly. This was all part of this Government's humbug in the referendum question of 1988. It required the States to pay fair and just compensation when, of course, it does not pay it itself and has no intention of doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole purpose of this legislation is to reduce or remove the rights of owners-nothing more, nothing less. I repeat: any legislation dealing with land acquisition is specifically designed to avoid paying normal common law entitlement to owners dispossessed or injuriously affected by government-nothing more, nothing less; that is the only reason. How can legislation be fair and just when there are restrictions on appeals, when exceptions are made to allow the Government to circumvent the rules, when there are non-reviewable decisions, when properties under threat of acquisition can be blighted for years, when interest on settlements is fixed without reference to the current rates, when solatium payment is a fixed sum irrespective of whether it is too much or too little, when injurious affection-that is the term given to damage to property caused by the actions of, in this case, this Government-is specifically excluded even if it bankrupts property owners, and when it is specifically recommended as being essential by the Law Reform Commission, to which Senator Cooney referred? I believe that in this regard the Victorian legislation is important. As far as solatium is concerned, section 44 of the Land Acquisition and Compensation Act 1986 says:</PARA>
<PARA> The amount of compensation may be increased by such amount, not exceeding 10% of the market value of the land, by way of solatium as is reasonable to compensate the claimant for tangible and non-pecuniary disadvantages resulting from the acquisition. </PARA>
<PARA>That allows any reasonable valuer quite an amount of latitude, and I certainly suggest that such a provision should have been included in this legislation also. In some of these issues there were precedents that could have been followed, but they were not. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as interest payments are concerned, why could we not have had a clause that for instance, set the long term bond rate applicable at the date for the notification of acquisition as being a reasonable amount? There would be no argument. There would have been reasonable justice. In the Victorian Land Acquisition and Compensation Act 1986-sections 52 and 55-there is again such provision. Section 52 of that legislation says:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The Governor in Council may from time to time, by Order published in the Government Gazette, determine the rate of interest to be paid in respect of unpaid compensation under this Act. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) The rate of interest determined by the Governor in Council must not exceed the rate for the time being fixed under section 2 of the Penalty Interest Rates Act 1983. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very fair authority. Section 55 of that same Act says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if the Authority fails to pay any amount of compensation which it has agreed to pay or which has been awarded under this Act within 30 days of the date of that agreement or award, the interest payable on that amount is five per centum per annum higher than the rate of interest for the time being determined under section 52. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, I believe, absolutely essential. Too often have I seen dispossessed owners strung out by governments that have not paid. There have been many criticisms raised. I have had a lot of letters from all sorts of areas as to sections in the Bill. I am pleased that the Government has taken some action to make some of them right but I am sorry that it did not go a bit further to really provide justice for the people who are the subject of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> However, I fully support the Opposition amendment foreshadowed by Senator Puplick. I have seen far too much of governments riding roughshod over private owners. They suffer because they are left up in the air or because they are caught in a bind, without money to buy, with a price fixed on their acquired property. I said earlier, and I repeat, that if acquisitions are made for the public good then the public should pay, and pay in the manner that at least ensures owners receive an amount of money that compensate them for the loss incurred. </PARA>
<PARA> While not opposing the Bill-I repeat it is disappointing-it still prevents fair and just compensation being available and makes an even greater humbug of the Government's referendum question as it was framed, requiring the States to pay compensation fairly and justly. This legislation provides that the Commonwealth is not required to do so and is not intending to do so. </PARA>

There has been the odd churlish comment about how long it has taken to get the Bill before the Senate. I understand that the report on which it was based came down in 1980, so we all must bear some of that blame-not only on this side but also on the other side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Act and the reforms are fairly complex. They do signal a great deal of progress in this area and the Commonwealth will now be well in advance of all State legislation in this regard. Some of the specific points raised as to Badgerys Creek and other matters seemed to me to be more making political points. All I would say is that I would love to live in the simplistic world of Senator Brownhill where everything is in absolute black and white and so simple. If only decisions one makes could be that simple. Some honourable senators, including Senator Puplick and Senator Powell, certainly raised some concern as to aspects of the Bill similar to ones which were raised in the House of Representatives. I will pass those on to Mr West for his consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> I only want to conclude with the point that was raised that we have acted too late in this particular area. I listed this Bill, I think, in August last year as No. 2 to be considered. If we had not wasted four weeks on what proved to be a waste of time, filling in with industrial legislation in the meantime, this Bill would have been well and truly up and operating. It is the duty of the Opposition to be churlish. It is the duty of the Opposition always to say that we have taken too long with something. I just wonder why the Opposition never amended the Commonwealth Electoral Act, the Migration Act, the Conciliation and Arbitration Act or the taxation Act. There is a whole series of things the Opposition never did when it was in power. It used to be said that the only difference between a Trotskyite and a Stalinist was that a Trotskyite was out of power. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I do appreciate the comments made by Opposition members here tonight. It is very hard to get the balance between the rights of individuals and the priorities of government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 2 March I spoke during the adjournment debate on the tragic circumstances of two deaths in custody, one in my home State of Western Australia and the other in New South Wales. I drew the attention of the Senate to the fact that prisoners are routinely denied medical attention even when they are in agony and virtually unconscious. I also revealed the fact that in some cases autopsies have been delayed so long that critical information on the cause of death ceases to be ascertainable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have recently read some correspondence of the Campaign for Prevention of Custodial Death relating to the tragic death of Daniel Taylor, who died on 11 September 1987. This is another occasion when an autopsy was delayed. In this case it was delayed for five days. Infections, as I said before, cannot be reliably identified after 36 hours at the outside, and specimens should preferably be examined within 24 hours. Who was responsible for the delay and what action was taken against him? It is obvious that a lengthy delay in the carrying out of post mortem examination could well have the effect of hiding forever the true cause of death. Only when the true cause of death is established is it possible to prevent further tragedies. Failure to identify properly the cause of death can effectively camouflage gross neglect by prison staff. </PARA>
<PARA> It would seem that the coronial inquiries in New South Wales are designed more to justify the behaviour of correctional staff rather than to expose the truth. Because in this case the parents were unable to afford independent medical opinion it was impossible for them to expose any incompetence in the medical treatment received by their son. At the inquest, I am told, it was stated that headaches were not an indication of encephalitis, that changes in methadone doses would not mask the symptoms of encephalitis, that his death was certain and that prompt medical intervention would not have made any difference to the tragic outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, I am told on good medical advice that headaches are one of the symptoms of encephalitis. Indeed, I can confirm this myself because my own daughter had encephalitis 12 years ago. Daniel Taylor's acute, persistent headaches began in late July, approximately seven weeks prior to his death. His continued pleas for medical attention were ignored and no treatment was instituted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Secondly, any significant change in methadone dosage, either up or down, would cause temporary personality changes with physical and mental distress. Such dosage variations might also cause headaches. I have had legal advice on these matters. Any of these symptoms, I am told, would certainly have the effect of disguising and masking a developing virulent illness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It would seem highly probable that the prison staff, knowing that Daniel's methadone dosage had been modified as a form of punishment, assumed that his headaches were due to the fluctuating methadone dosages and were an intended effect of the punishment. They therefore did nothing to investigate the headaches. Thus an indefensible practice, the variation of methadone dosages as a form of punishment, may have lulled prison staff into neglecting to investigate the possibility of a more sinister cause of the headaches. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, death as a result of encephalitis should never be thought of as inevitable. Some victims do survive. My own daughter is now a very healthy and active 21-year-old. The earlier it is diagnosed the better the chances of survival. In any case, a dying person, even one who is imprisoned, is entitled to all the comfort, care and the best medical attention that our society can provide and, in particular, to comfort and love in such circumstances. This was all denied Daniel Taylor. </PARA>
<PARA> He had a series of grand mal fits. Grand mal epileptic seizures must be considered serious and sometimes life-threatening events for anybody. In the first instance, even if they occur in a person known to have seizures, they pose a threat. For another reason, the unexpected occurrence of seizures, either in someone well controlled by anti-convulsant medication or occurring for the first time, must never be ignored. They demand urgent assessment as to why they occur. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned a moment ago the varying of medication dosages as a form of punishment. Daniel Taylor was a former drug addict who had made the commitment to free himself from his addiction. He had been on a methadone program for seven months prior to the time of his death. He had never breached any of the conditions of the program and had maintained it during a period of four weeks when he was not in custody. It was confirmed at the inquest that Daniel's dosage was altered because he had an altercation with the nursing staff. It is acknowledged by the prison authorities that it was used as a method of control within the prison. It was admitted at the inquest that Daniel's daily dosage was reduced from 60 milligrams to 30 milligrams for three days, then increased to 75 milligrams for two days, then increased to 80 milligrams for a period of five days, before being restored to the normal dosage of 60 milligrams. </PARA>
<PARA> I am told that when an individual's methadone dosage is being varied as part of a methadone program-for example, to wean that person off the drug-the normal variation is of the order of 2.5 milligrams per week. Honourable senators will appreciate that, if a variation of 2.5 milligrams per week is as much as is regarded as safe, then a variation of 30 to 45 milligrams per day could have traumatic effects on the person subjected to it. The fact that Daniel's methadone dosage was varied has not been challenged, but the fact that it was varied as a form of punishment has been disputed by the Minister for Corrective Services for New South Wales in a letter to the Campaign for Prevention of Custodial Death dated 17 March 1987. I put it to the Senate that when it has been admitted that methadone dosages were varied as a method of control within the prison system, and when it has been admitted that Daniel Taylor's dosages were varied by massive amounts, the only plausible explanation for those variations is that they were punitive in intent. </PARA>
<PARA> Variations in the administration of any form of medication or medical treatment as a form of control or punishment are an obscenity. They are reminiscent of the behaviour of doctors in Nazi concentration camps and of penal systems in countries justly criticised by Australia for gross abuse of human rights. It is my view that the Senate cannot possibly condone such a practice in any prison system in this country and that prison staff responsible for such abuses should be subject to disciplinary charges. Further, it would appear to me that doctors who participate in such abuse of patients' rights should be formally charged. </PARA>
<PARA> Daniel's mother was not told of his hospitalisation but discovered this by accident on inquiry. She was given no warning of his impending death and reached the hospital only a few hours before he became brain dead. He was only able to express to his mother his fear and puzzlement regarding his condition and to plead with her for help. </PARA>
<PARA> In my previous speech I detailed how Nicholas Searcy in Western Australia was kept chained to his bed and guarded in hospital, despite the fact that he was delirious, partially paralysed and in no condition to escape. Even though Daniel Taylor was within hours of his, by now, inevitable death, he continued to be guarded by two armed prison officers whose presence was maintained even after he was declared brain dead. </PARA>
<PARA> I am greatly concerned at this further evidence that I have received that in our country, which has abolished the death sentence for serious crimes, a prison sentence for a relatively minor offence all too readily develops into an effective death sentence. This can happen also to prisoners on remand, who are technically innocent of any offence. Daniel Taylor was simply on remand at the time of his death; he had not been convicted of any offence. He had applied for bail but died before his application for bail was considered. </PARA>
<PARA> I am further concerned that the investigation of deaths in custody is often woefully inadequate, especially when the circumstances possibly involve abuse or neglect by prison or police officers. It is simply not possible to get at the whole truth when the only people who present evidence are those who, were they to tell the whole truth, might well incriminate themselves. Running through this sad story is the persistent theme of the denial of medical treatment to those in custody. Quite simply, our prisons and police lock-ups are a health hazard, and a life threatening one at that. In the general community most people are under the impression that deaths in custody are, in the vast majority of cases, Aboriginal deaths involving hangings or strangulation. In fact, the truth is that there are many more white deaths in custody than black deaths. But colour is immaterial. Every death is a disaster for Australia; every death is a loss of human potential; every death brings grief and torment to parents and loved ones; every unnecessary death is a denial of our standing as an enlightened nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians are often aghast at prison conditions and judicial abuses in countries which do not enjoy the freedoms that we take for granted. It is time that we faced up to the fact that in our own prisons human beings are being abused, treated without pity, stripped of basic rights to personal dignity and necessary medical treatment, and dying of blatant neglect. This situation will not improve until coroners are given a great deal more power and independence to investigate deaths in custody. This has been highlighted by Mr Justice Muirhead, who has called for the setting up of an independent team to investigate deaths in custody and has made it clear that custodians must be able to be compelled to give evidence under oath, as is the case in respect of a royal commission. Further, the practice of delaying post mortem examinations until it is too late to accurately determine the cause of death must cease. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I call on the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) to approach the State Attorneys-General with a view to strengthening the powers of coroners, taking coronial inquests out of the hands of the police and removing the provision for police officers to assist the coroner in the court, thus enabling them to guide the proceedings to a conclusion pre-ordained by them in some cases and protective of the interests of their colleagues in the police and prison services. </PARA>
<PARA> I further call for the setting up of the type of team proposed by Mr Justice Muirhead to investigate deaths in custody, for ending the practice of using medication as a form of control and of punishing those in custody by denying them medication or medical help and for ensuring that prisoners receive a level of medical care not less than that available to people in the general community, thus generally bringing the administration of our custodial systems into the twentieth century. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing my remarks, I note that an inquest will be held in Sydney commencing on 19 April into the death in custody of Malcolm Hatch, about whom I spoke last time. His autopsy was also delayed until the fifth day following his death. I will be monitoring this inquest closely. I trust that deficiencies evident in the conduct of earlier inquests will not be repeated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not normally comment on the speeches of other senators, but I want to say that all the evidence that I have received anecdotally would support everything that Senator Jenkins has said, that there is something wrong with the way our prisons work in terms of medical care offered to prisoners, especially to those prisoners who are on methadone programs for treatment of intravenous drug abuse. Everything she has said is consistent with what I have heard. I am grateful to her for having brought it to our attention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of us serve on the parliamentary liaison group on acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). A number of us were enlisted by the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) to serve on working panels in order to look at the Green Paper that was produced recently. I chaired the panel on intravenous drug use and HIV infection. We came up against the problem of what does constitute intravenous drug use in Australia. We actually reported 10 statements: There may be up to half a million Australians who at some stage have used drugs intravenously; that most of them are recreational users; that they have an increased risk of infection; that users come from all sections of the community and from all social economic groups; that drug use occurs within all ethnic groups in Australia; and that a large percentage of prisoners are in prison for drug-related offences. I interpolate here that drug use is rampant in prisons, even though the drugs are supposed to be contraband. We received evidence of 70 women prisoners sharing one needle and syringe and 40 male prisoners in another prison sharing one needle and syringe. If we want to spread the virus that is the way to go about it. We also heard that there was so much heroin in Pentridge at one stage that it was being exported back to St Kilda for sale. </PARA>
<PARA> We were told a number of other things about drug use but what emerged was how little is actually known and how little hard evidence there is which we can use and be certain about. I want therefore to bring to the attention of the Senate some work done by Stephen Mugford, a senior lecturer in sociology at the Australian National University and a member of the drug indicators project in the Australian Capital Territory. In a paper entitled `Indicators of Drug Use in Australia: An Overview of the National Data', Dr Mugford has done us a great service. He has analysed some of the data sources available to the different States, indicating that most States use only some of the possible sources of data, those being mortality statistics, police statistics, morbidity statistics, methadone data, telephone service data, schools surveys, price and purity data, AIDS data, court statistics and population surveys. The evidence that is available was given at a conference at which Dr Mugford was a participant and he has brought it together in a paper. Because the subject is important and because it is of importance to know how many drug users there are in Australia I have taken the liberty of showing this paper to the Minister for Consumer Affairs, Senator Bolkus. I seek leave to table the paper. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to talk about a visit I recently made to the Philippines as part of the Australian Peace Brigade, which was attended by many other international visitors, in the month of January. Unfortunately I was not able to be there for the whole month but I was there for 10 days, which were very busy and extremely enlightening. Most of the Australians, 88 people in all, were there for the full month. They went on exposure tours in the countryside during which they learnt a great deal about how ordinary people in the Philippines are living and the problems that they are facing at the moment. There was a conference called the Asia Pacific People's Conference on Peace and Development. A very interesting declaration came out of that which was put very briefly along the lines of calling for a cessation of outside international involvement in the internal affairs of the countries in the region, particularly military interference. It was a call for the closure of all foreign military bases in the region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There were people at the conference from Japan, Korea, the Pacific island nations, Aotearoa, Nepal, India and Thailand. Many countries were represented. The people who were at the conference were invited to go to the Philippines by a coalition of 15 cause oriented groups. They worked cooperatively together to provide a very interesting set of exposure tours for the international groups-they were not just Australians travelling together-and put together a very good conference program. The third part of the Peace Brigade's activity consisted of a peace caravan when 2,000 vehicles and 7,000 people weaved their way out of Manila toward Clark Air Force Base-a huge United States air force installation-then towards Subic Bay, which is an enormous United States naval installation. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I want to make is that there is no way that Australia should be supporting the fallacy that the Philippines is a democracy. I heard it repeated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), who visited Manila just after the Peace Brigade was there along with various other parliamentarians and members of the public from Australia. People seem to think that following the Edsa revolution three years ago, in January 1986, democracy had been restored to the Philippines. There were great hopes that democracy would be restored with the overthrow of the Marcos regime. For the first year President Aquino experienced a great deal of goodwill from people supporting her and trying to put some democratic processes into place. Unfortunately, a year later she declared a policy of total war against the insurgents. The label `insurgents' can be applied to any people who are working actively for social change in the Philippines. It is not just directed against members of the New People's Army or others who are connected in any way with any communist organisation. This policy of total war which has been enunciated very clearly by President Aquino is directed against anybody who is working for social change. </PARA>
<PARA> I met many people involved in these cause oriented groups in Manila and outside it. I would like to mention a couple of stories that I was told, particularly by women's groups. The overall umbrella women's group in the Philippines is called Gabriela. It does an amazing job in trying to educate women about their rights. I do not think anybody should argue with that kind of education. From their experience they have found that Mrs Aquino is now totally unwilling to speak to these women, many of whom worked very hard to help her in the election following the overthrow of the Marcos regime. She has removed herself from any kind of consultation with the people who worked very hard to support her. She seems to be totally under the thumb of the military. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people volunteered to me the comment that things are worse as far as human rights violations are concerned under the Aquino regime than they were under Marcos. People said over and over again, `Under the Marcos regime we were afraid of being detained. Under Cory Aquino we are afraid of being shot'. That is exactly what is happening. People are disappearing in great numbers. Human rights violations are very well documented in an Amnesty International report, yet the international community seems to continue to perpetuate the myth that the Philippines is a democracy. There is no democracy at the point of a gun. I am not exaggerating the position at all. I will give a few examples of the violations of human rights in a moment. I experienced democracy Filipino style at the point of a gun and it was not a pleasant experience. </PARA>
<PARA> The Gabriela group that I had the privilege to meet with is a very fine organisation of women. The document I would like to quote from is called Let's work together for the protection of human rights of Filipino women: a documentation report on the human rights situation of Filipino women. It was put out last year by this group. Just to give an idea of the kind of problems that women in the Philippines are suffering I will read the headings without going into details of the atrocities. This will give people an idea of the sort of problems that are faced by women, very often by the children who are in their company and also by men. But this document focuses particularly on women. </PARA>
<PARA> This report documents human rights violations from February 1986 to February 1988. The first heading is `Arbitrary arrest and detention'. There are pages of such cases. The next heading is `Evacuation and hiding'. The next one is `Killings and frustrated massacres'. We have to remember that these cases involve real human beings. I met many of them whose families had suffered and whose spouses had disappeared, or been tortured, and some had themselves been tortured and survived. I will give just a couple of examples. Under the heading `Killings and frustrated massacres', there is the example of Cecita Udtuhan, a 36-year-old peasant women of Matinao, Burawen, Leyte, who was forcibly taken by 20 men who were believed to be members of the Tadtad group, a vigilante group, and the military, on 29 May 1987. She was seven months pregnant. Four days later she was found dead with stabs on her side, her belly lacerated and her foetus pulled out. It is not very pretty stuff but I think people in Australia need to understand what is actually happening in the Philippines now. Another case is that of Marlyn Negro, a 38-year-old peasant women from Barangay Matinao, Burawen, Leyte, who was abducted together with Cecita Udtuhan by a composite group of military men and Tadtad members. Her body was found four days later. Her head had been cut off. The cases under the heading `Killings and frustrated massacres' goes on for pages. </PARA>
<PARA> There are such headings as `Illegal searches and raids', `Looting and destruction of properties', `Abduction and disappearances', `Rape', `Sex trafficking' and `Sex tourism' which gives one particularly ghastly case. I am afraid to say that there are Australian business people involved in sex tourism and sex trafficking. I actually went to some of the bars owned and operated by Australians and felt quite sickened and ashamed. This particular case involved an Austrian, not an Australian. It was the case of Rosario Baluyut, a victim of sex tourism, who died in 1987 at the age of 12 of cervical infection caused by a broken piece of vibrator left in her cervix by a pedophile. That is the sort of situation that Philippine people are facing constantly. There are pages in the list of women political prisoners in the Philippines as at 12 October 1988. I think the women number 68 in all. That is the sort of situation that the people there are facing. </PARA>
<PARA> On International Women's Day, which was 8 March, I did not manage to get on the speakers list, but I want to quote from a statement for International Women's Day from the women of Gabriela. They said that two International Women's Days had elapsed, and now three with the latest one, since `the Filipino women, rejoiced over the coming to power of a woman president at the government's helm'. They said:</PARA>
<PARA>We were so full of hope then. So full of hope on the promise of freedom and democracy brought by the people's uprising in Edsa. But after two years,-</PARA>
<PARA>and this would now be three-</PARA>
<PARA>sorrow and anger had taken over the ecstasy. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of the hardship and pain that we have suffered in the ousting of the Marcos regime, the government of Cory Aquino betrayed the democracy that the people have fought for in Edsa. Up to the present there has been no change in the lot of the deprived and impoverished masses, especially the women. There has been no solution to our age-old problems-most of us are still without jobs, relegated to the role of housekeepers . . . Our wages are mere pittances and we are still discriminated against in occupational opportunity and promotion. We are forced into prostitution and degrading commodification of our bodies. Sexual abuse, institutionalized discrimination, domestic violence . . . and political repression-these are the evils we have to contend with in our daily lives. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, Cory Aquino, together with her soldiers, police and para-military that was formed with the support and blessing of United States, has declared the policy of `total war'. </PARA>
<PARA>The total war is waged against not only the NPA and the MNLF, its political arm, but:</PARA>
<PARA>it is an indiscriminate, genocidal war against the people of this country who want to change the old system of the ruling elite, to end the economic plunder and control of United States and other imperialist powers, and to regain our national sovereignty. It is a war against the Filipino women, who seek genuine progress and freedom. </PARA>
<PARA>There are many other atrocities that I could quote, but I think it is more important to move on the experience of just one other group that I want to mention, and that is the discrimination against and repression of trade unionists in the Philippines. Here again human rights violations are rampant. There is a basic wage in the Philippines but it is not enforced. It is not enforced because there is a great deal of corruption and because it suits the ruling elite to have workers at their beck and call working for an absolute pittance. I visited some picket lines on the outskirts of Manila and I met women who were on strike because they were paid only 23 pesos a day, that is, about $1.50. The basic wage, incidentally, is just over $4 but they are not being paid it. These women had been on strike for only a couple of weeks. All of them in this textile factory had gone out on strike together. I said, `What are your hopes of winning this dispute?'. In fact, they were very bleak indeed, because the bosses merely shut up shop and move out somewhere else where the workers are not yet unionised. That is the kind of violation that is going on. The people who are working with the unions, who are trying to educate the people about basic democratic rights as workers and trying to enforce the Government's own stated basic wage, which is still by our terms a miserable pittance, are also subject to torture, disappearances and salvaging. It is just so distressing to see the scale on which this is happening not only in Manila but in the countryside as well-this war being waged against the people who are working for social change. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of the exposure that I undertook was to go to the United States bases. I did not actually go into the bases but I was interested in looking at the townships which had sprung up outside them: Angeles, which is outside the Clark Air Force Base, and Olongapo, which is outside Subic Bay. I visited two women's centres there, Kapitbahay and Buklod, which try to help the women who are forced into prostitution by their economic deprivation in those townships. I talked with them and learned a great deal about the lifestyle that they lead. As I said, unfortunately, I even had the opportunity of visiting Australian owned and operated bars which are involved in this exploitation, which is the most gross and ghastly because it involves not only women who are there because of the cycle of poverty but very often children as well. The children are often the results of liaisons with United States servicemen. That is what the townships are there for. It is euphemistically referred to as the hospitality industry but it is at a great price to the people. </PARA>
<PARA> These women are often despised by their families back in the provinces, if their families know what they are up to. They are despised by the Catholic Church. Eighty-five per cent of the people in the Philippines are Catholic but the Catholic Church will not allow any form of birth control to be used or any education about birth control. So the chief form of birth control is abortion and, of course, it is illegal abortion so it is backyard stuff, causing many more problems for the women's health. </PARA>
<PARA> The acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is also a very important issue which is not being dealt with adequately or responsibly by the United States servicemen who use those women, and I say `use' in the most obvious sense of the word. There are 28 cases of AIDS amongst the prostitutes in Olongapo. They are not full blown cases as yet, but they have been identified as AIDS carriers and they are still working. As they do not feel sick, they do not see why they should not keep working. Of course we all know how easy it is for that virus to spread, and I think that is a consequence which should not be overlooked. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems that these women face are more psychological because, as I said, they are abhorred by their own families if they know what they are up to, they are looked down upon by the Catholic Church and they are treated very judgmentally by the hierarchy of the church, but not always, thank goodness, by the priests and nuns who are often there to help them-that is the ones who are really living according to the spirit of the gospel and who are concerned about liberation theology and trying to change the social situation of the Philippine people. The women are also despised by their clients. That must be very difficult for these women to deal with. The depression that they often face is so extreme that there are many suicides. They get drugs from the US servicemen on an irregular basis, and when they cannot get drugs to alleviate their psychological depression, they resort to cough medicine so they can get some cheaper kicks that take them away from their particular problems at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> One of these centres that I visited, Buklod, is a night care centre for children. These women often have children and they have got to have somewhere safe where they can leave them while they go off to ply their trade at night. Very often the women are in debt to the bar owners and many of them cannot get out even if they want to and, of course, there are not a lot of other jobs for them. So the economic situation and the deprivation forcing women into this cycle of poverty and then prostitution constitute a very important and distressing problem for the Philippines. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Philippine people decide that the United States bases should go, of course there would be a lot of women out of work and a lot of workers on the bases also out of jobs. But it is up to the Philippine Government to look for creative and socially useful and more morally acceptable work for those people who might be thus displaced. There is a big debate going on in the Philippines at the moment about the presence of the US bases because for 450 years the Philippine people have suffered colonialism of one kind or another, and this is certainly colonialism at the hands of the Americans. It suits the Americans very well to have the international community regard the Philippines as a democracy. It is no democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Embassy staff, particularly the former Ambassador, Mr John Holloway, who has now returned to Canberra, was very helpful in listening to people in the peace brigades and in trying to set up some meetings for us. We felt that it was very important to have that link with our embassy. After all, it helps all kinds of business people who are setting up deals in the Philippines, and they are not always of the very best kind, so it was good that we had that support from the embassy and that helpful information flow. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very concerned about Australia's role in the Philippines. The investments that we have there are often at the expense of the people and the environment. The foreign aid that we give, which is quite substantial-$29m per annum-was increased quite dramatically with the arrival of Cory Aquino on the scene. Everybody was very hopeful for the first year or so that democracy would be restored. But that is not the case now. I think that our foreign aid, government to government aid which actually gives Cory Aquino the support of the Australian Government and of course the support of the Australian people, is misplaced. We should not be supporting a military regime. Cory Aquino has now survived five attempted military coups and each one has pushed her further to the right. She is under the thumb of the military. She is not, as I said earlier, taking any notice of her former advisers. The people who she first put in place to be her advisers have all been moved over. Each time there is a military coup, she has had to move further to the right. She is there with the permission of the military and with the permission of the United States Government as well. It suits them very well to have Saint Cory, as she is often referred to, ostensibly leading the Philippines. </PARA>
<PARA> With her blessing-and I must say with the blessing of the hierarchy of the Catholic Church too-the vigilante groups, which are like a paramilitary force assisting the military forces in the Philippines, carry out these barbarous acts on the people who are working for social change. I do not think that we should support that sort of a regime. My recommendation is that Australia's foreign aid to the Philippines should not be cut or ceased, but that it should be redirected to non-government organisations, of which there are many which are quite capable of distributing that foreign aid in a more equitable way and to the people who could benefit from it most. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that most Australians would want our aid to go to alleviate the problems of the Filipino people at the grass roots level so that they can put in place self-help projects, so that we are not just giving bandaid treatment and so that we are not supporting that Government by giving government to government aid. I think it is a great mistake to continue to do that. Australia is also involved in military aid to the Philippines in the form, mostly, of officers from the Philippine military forces coming to Australia for periods of three to six months each year. I think that that should stop as well, because it is very obvious that whatever kind of training these military people are getting in Australia can be used very readily-and most readily is used-against their own people. </PARA>
<PARA> Time and time again, when I was in the peace caravan travelling to Clark Air Force Base, I heard the Philippine people say to the soldiers who were holding us up and causing us delays on the way-at gunpoint, I might add-that instead of defending the United States bases against some peaceful people who were engaged in a non-violent protest, they should be defending the Filipino people; that the job of a defence force is to support and defend its own nation's people. That is not what it is engaged in. It is engaged in defending the might of the United States military against the Philippine people who are, understandably, very concerned about the continued presence. </PARA>
<PARA> I also mention the case of Captain Edgardo Sebastian of the Philippines Constabulary Military Intelligence Group who, when he was involved in torturing a woman by the name of Adora Faye Devera-she is now a prize-winning poet; she lived to tell the tale-for a period of three years under the Marcos regime bragged about having been taught his torture techniques in Australia. I have asked the Foreign Minister to check this out. Whether or not it is true, it certainly deserves to be thoroughly investigated. I hope that it is not true, but this man who inflicted all kinds of dreadful torture on Adora Faye Devera thought that it was in his interests and made him look like a greater hero if he could brag about having been taught his torture techniques in Australia. For that reason I think that Australian military aid should stop altogether. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as Australian investment in the Philippines is concerned, I think it is necessary to set up a set of ethical guidelines to guide investors so that they do not get involved in the sleazy sex trade which is the most ghastly kind of exploitation of women and children imaginable. If certain ethical guidelines were set up for Australian investors in foreign countries-they should apply to all countries, I guess-the Government could do something to actively discourage people from getting involved in exploitative industries overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The spirit of the Filipino people is inspiring, despite their problems, despite the militarisation of their country, despite the fact that there is no democracy and that economic deprivation is extreme. One has only to go to Smoky Mountain, the rubbish tip in Manila, where thousands of people live on the rubbish dump, and smell the stench of that place to have the lesson very clearly driven home that enormous changes are necessary in the Philippines for the basic human rights and the basic social needs of the Filipino people to be met. Despite their problems, the spirit of the people that I met who are involved in the cause or who enter groups working for social change was absolutely inspiring. Their courage in the face of adversity is tremendous. Their struggle for democracy is extremely brave and they are prepared to continue it until they finally get democracy. Their struggle should be shared by people in Australia. I look forward to the time when-if the recommendations that I have put for foreign aid from Australia to be re-directed towards non-government organisations, for Australia's military aid to cease, and for a set of ethical guidelines to be developed for Australian investment are adopted-Australia is actually part of the solution to the problem in the Philippines instead of contributing to the furthering of the problems for the Filipino people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) to (5) The protection of the natural habitats of Peel Inlet in Western Australia is primarily the responsibility of the Western Australian authorities, and, in particular, of the Western Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management.</PARA>
<PARA> Australian obligations under its Treaties with Japan and China for the protection of migratory birds and their environments are implemented through legislation and administrative arrangements in force in the States and the Northern Territory, with co-ordination being effected through the Council of Nature Conservation Ministers (CONCOM). The CONCOM Working Group on International Agreements Relating to Migratory and Wetlands Birds advises the CONCOM Standing Committee on implementation of the Treaties. The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service provides the convener of the CONCOM Working Group and has an overall coordinating role in the implementation of the Treaties. Western Australia is represented on the Working Group by the Western Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management.</PARA>
<PARA> Under its nature conservation legislation, Western Australia has the responsibility to assess the significance of natural areas as habitat for migratory and endangered birds, identify areas of particular importance and carry out protective measures to conserve habitats in such areas.</PARA>
<PARA> While my Department, when asked, provides advice on the interpretation of these and other treaties, it is inappropriate for my Department to be involved in issues relating to particular wetland areas before such assessments have been made and before the matter has been considered through agreed procedures.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. Australian Government expenditure on disarmament-related activities more than meets the target of 0.1 per cent of defence spending. In  1987-88, expenditure on disarmament and arms control work needed to reach $7.1 million to meet this target. The projects and initiatives listed below total $7.81 million.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Commonwealth Government expects nursing homes to provide a safe environment for residents, staff and visitors. This requirement is one of thirty-one standards stated in ``Living in a Nursing Home: Outcome Standards for Australian Nursing Homes''. This publication specifies quality of life and care outcomes for nursing home residents. Nursing home standards monitoring teams focus on the achievement of the outcome, that is, that residents are safe, rather than the mere presence of inputs or processes relating to safety.</PARA>
<PARA> The legal basis for the safety requirement is stated in Special Gazette No. S303 ``National Health Act 1953-Section 45d: Standards for Nursing Home Care'', Standard No. 6, which states:</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following information in respect of hospitals catering for veterans, and day care centres.</PARA>
<PARA> The Repatriation Commission ensures that Repatriation General Hospitals (RGHs), Repatriation Auxiliary Hospitals, the Anzac Hostel and the Repatriation Artificial Limb and Appliance Centres maintain all Commonwealth, State and local standards that promote a safe environment for patients and visitors. These standards are also followed in the day care centres operating in RGHs. For staff working in these institutions, the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) has occupational health and safety programs. Procedures are also aligned with those set by the Australian Council of Hospital Standards.</PARA>
<PARA> Although the Commission does not operate any nursing homes, social workers at the RGHs ensure that privately-operated nursing homes that receive Repatriation patients meet Department of Community Services and Health requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> In regard to day care centres part financed by the DVA, occupational therapists from RGHs ensure that operating organisations adhere to the required safety standards.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Nursing homes are not specifically funded to meet safety standards. They are provided a standard grant per resident to provide for basic infrastructure services within the nursing home (for example, food, rent, maintenance). The service provider must decide how to spend this income to meet, among other things, the safety requirements for residents, staff, equipment and building.</PARA>
<PARA> Funding for child care services under the Commonwealth's Children's Services Program is conditional on the service being licensed by the relevant authority.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) State Governments receive nursing home benefits for each resident accommodated in a State Government nursing home. It is the responsibility of the State Government and the nursing home administrators to allocate their budget to meet safety requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> Capital grants under the Children's Services Program are based on the actual cost of the project and as such will cover the variety of physical safety requirements directly associated with the building housing the service.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The nursing home safety standards are monitored by standards monitoring teams, which visit homes at least annually. Where these teams find non-compliance with any standards, including safety standards, they negotiate with service providers to ensure that these standards are met. Where serious and/or persistent non-compliance occurs, the Commonwealth Government, as well as the State Government, as appropriate, can invoke powers against the nursing home proprietors. In general, negotiation with service providers is conducted on a cooperative basis to ensure a positive address of non-compliance.</PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth recurrent funding is not directed specifically toward meeting safety requirements. The Commonwealth provides a contribution to operational costs which assists services to meet licensing requirements. Other Commonwealth funds are attracted through fee relief subsidies for low to moderate income families.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes. He argues that a greater proportion of Federal fuel excise revenue should be returned to roads. The challenge for motoring organisations such as the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland is to identify which areas of education, health, housing, social security or defence they would cut in order to provide more funds for roads.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The report's recommendations do not relate solely to Commonwealth responsibilities. They were also directed by the Committee to State education authorities and Vice-Chancellors and Principals of higher education institutions for attention. My reply deals only with the recommendations which fall within my portfolio responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA> The report was distributed to State Ministers for Education, Directors of TAFE, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and the Australian Committee of Directors and Principals in Advanced Education as well as higher education institutions and appropriate Government Departments. The report's recommendations have been considered at forums such as the Australian Education Council and the Cultural Ministers Conference.</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendations relating to school level initiatives were referred to State Directors General for attention as primary responsibility for school curriculum rests with State authorities. So far as Commonwealth activity is concerned it is relevant to point out that my Department has recently produced and made available free of charge to all Australian schools a substantial package of materials designed to strengthen the Australian perspective across the school curriculum. These materials were produced by the Bicentennial Australian Studies Schools Project, a project of the Curriculum Development Centre.</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 1 of the Committee was that the terms of reference of any review of science and mathematics teaching in tertiary education institutions take account of the matters raised in the report.</PARA>
<PARA> The Discipline Review of Teacher Education in Mathematics and Science which I announced in July 1988 will take account, where appropriate, of the report's recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 5a was that in view of the need for high quality editing skills in Australia a course in this field should be supported by the Commonwealth in a tertiary institution.</PARA>
<PARA> A number of higher institutions offer professional writing and journalism courses which contain editing segments. As self-governing bodies, higher education institutions are themselves responsible for decisions about courses. They are considered to be generally responsible to community needs. Certainly such an initiative would receive favourable consideration by the Commonwealth in funding for growth.</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 5b was that greater support to textual editing be given by such research grants bodies as the Australian Research Grants Scheme (ARGS).</PARA>
<PARA> The ARGS has been subsumed in the research grants programs of the Australian Research Council which was established in July 1988, among other things, to coordinate the national research effort. In assessing research proposals for support, the Council's primary concern is to promote excellence in research. Proposals involving research into the methodologies of textual editing, for example, would be considered on their merits, in competition with other proposals.</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 8 was that matters raised in this report be taken into account by the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations, and other Commonwealth and State authorities responsible for providing advice on trade training.</PARA>
<PARA> The concerns and recommendations outlined in the report lend support to the current policy and program directions of the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) and State/Territory Training Authorities in relation to skill formation. Many of the issues identified in the Report as crucial to vocational training have been addressed in Skills for Australia, A Changing Workforce and other recent policy statements and are receiving attention at present in the development of policy regarding competency-based training and the impact of award restructuring on entry-level training.</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 9 was for funds to be made available by CTEC through its Evaluations and Investigations Program and by State TAFE authorities to conduct surveys of vocational training areas with a view to the development of strategies for the integration of Australian based teaching material and Australian studies into technical education curricula.</PARA>
<PARA> The Evaluations and Investigations Program is now administered by the Higher Education Division of DEET. It is used to fund studies in the higher education area only, and is therefore no longer an appropriate source of funding for the project recommended in Recommendation 9.</PARA>
<PARA> The objectives of the Australian Committee on TAFE Curriculum (ACTC) include making the best use of the national resources by working nationally and to increase the use of national core curricula. Recommendation 9 has been referred to the ACTC for their consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 11 was that the curriculum for pre-service and in-service teacher education should contain a substantial component of Australian-based teaching materials and Australian studies.</PARA>
<PARA> My understanding is that this is increasingly the case. Higher education institutions are responsible for the curriculum of pre-service and advanced teacher education courses.</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 12 was that a Chair of Australian Screen Studies be established at an Australian university and that this appointment should be allied with a Directorship of an Australian Screen Studies program in another higher education institution.</PARA>
<PARA> This is a matter for institutions to take the initiative in seeking sponsorship from private enterprise and State or Commonwealth Government sources as appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 16 is that priority in the provision of new places and funding of new key centres should be given to teaching in the heritage area.</PARA>
<PARA> Australian studies has been identified as a priority area for enrolment growth along with Asian Studies and areas considered important for Australia's economic development such as science, engineering, technology and business studies.</PARA>
<PARA> A new key centre in Australian Studies has been established at Monash University. Further details are provided in my comments on Recommendation 32.</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 18 was that a joint working party be established by the Department of Education and Foreign Affairs, with representatives from a wide range of educational organisations to develop a body to co-ordinate Australia's cultural and educational activities overseas.</PARA>
<PARA> Following consultations between the Departments and the educational organisations, the Government has sought expressions of interest in setting up Australian Education Centres (AECs) in countries overseas where there is a large volume of applications for study in Australia. AECs would be located outside Australian diplomatic missions (ADMs) and would offer an advisory, counselling and information service about all aspects of study in Australia for overseas students on behalf of participating institutions. This would not, however, include policy or visa issues which would remain the responsibility of the ADM. The responsibilities of the AECs would not extend to cultural activities.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 20 was for an investigation of the teaching of English as a foreign and second language in Australian and overseas tertiary institutions.</PARA>
<PARA>A National Centre for English Language Teaching and Research has been established at Macquarie University. The National Centre, in the School of English and Linguistics, was approved on the base level funding of $216,000 a year for the next three years, extendable, on review, for a further three years. This is being supplemented by funding from the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs which was transferred from the Adult Migrant Education Program National Curriculum Resource Centre(NCRC). The NCRC is currently being amalgamated with the National Centre. It is to be a catalyst for research into the English language, the problems it poses for non-native and native speakers in Australia and associated educational issues of curriculum design, materials development and program evaluation.</PARA>
<PARA>Approval in principle has also been granted for a Key Centre in Applied Language Studies to be located within a higher education institution. My Department is currently seeking proposals for its establishment. It is expected that the Centre will undertake the following functions: co-ordinate language activities in tertiary institutions through a clearing-house and language advisory service; provide professional development for language lecturers and teacher trainers; engage in research in applied language issues, including language teaching methodology; develop national language proficiency instruments in English as a second/foreign language and other languages; and offer a language testing service on a cost-recovery basis.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 23 was that the Commonwealth ask higher education institutions to take account of the need to develop Australian-based learning and to take account of the need to consider the criterion of Australian relevance in planning and allocating resources and in determining staffing needs and staff development programs.</PARA>
<PARA>As I have mentioned in relation to Recommendation 16, Australian studies has been identified as a priority area for enrolment growth.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 25 and 26, relating to the employment of staff in higher education, have been referred to the National Board of Employment Education and Training for consideration. Generally this matter is one for the higher education institutions to determine.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 28 called for the establishment of chairs in Australian art history and Australian music at appropriate institutions.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a matter for institutions to take the initiative in seeking sponsorship from private enterprise, and State or Commonwealth Government sources as appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 31 of the Committee was that the ARGC and other funding bodies which allocate research funds, recognise the importance of `tools of research', and include suitable provision for the allocation of funds to develop guides, bibliographies, registers, indexes and databases within their guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Research Council and, in particular, its relevant advisory committee in the humanities and social sciences acknowledges the need to develop `tools of research' such as appropriate databases. However, the matter must be considered in the context of determining overall research granting priorities and strategies.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 32 proposes the establishment of a National Centre for Research and Development in Australian studies.</PARA>
<PARA>I announced in May 1988 funding for such a centre at Monash University. It was one of fifteen new Key Centres of Teaching and Research. The Monash centre for Australian Studies has been allocated $176,000 a year for three years, extendable on review for a further three or, possibly six, years.</PARA>
<PARA>The centre consists of a new multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary teaching and research unit which began operation within the Faculty of Arts at the beginning of 1988.</PARA>
<PARA>At the masters degree level, a core course ``Society, Culture and the Study of Australia'' will involve a dissertation chosen from the faculties of Arts and Economics and Politics. This development will produce a new range of Australian Studies programs at the undergraduate level.</PARA>
<PARA>Research reflects the multi-faceted nature of the course and includes: studies in the salinity and desertification of Australia, acquisition of English skills by migrant communities, history of Australian culture, publishing, theatre, religion in Australian society, work in Australian industry and much more.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 33 of the Committee was that in the establishment of key centres in universities and colleges:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) attention should be paid to applications seeking to assist in Australianising the tertiary curriculum.</PARA>
<PARA>(b) recognition be given to the special research needs of vocational studies, and</PARA>
<PARA>(c) centres to be limited to one triennium.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Research Council, which now has responsibility for the Key Centres of Teaching and Research program, proposes to review the future directions of the program early this year. The recommendation will be drawn to the attention of the Council during the course of the review.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>There has been no appreciable delay in implementation of the Committee's recommendations. The first opportunity to secure funding for the Committee's recommendations was for the 1988-89 Budget year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) to (3) The protection of the natural habitats of the North Entrance Peninsula in the Wyong Shire of New South Wales is primarily the responsibility of the New South Wales authorities and, in particular, of the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service.</PARA>
<PARA> Australian obligations under the Treaties with Japan and China for the protection of migratory birds and their environments are implemented through legislation and administrative arrangements already in force in the States and the Northern Territory, with coordination being effected through the Council of Nature Conservation Ministers (CONCOM). The CONCOM Working Group on International Agreements Relating to Migratory and Wetlands Birds advises the CONCOM Standing Committee on implementation of the Treaties. The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service provides the convener of the CONCOM Working Group and has an overall coordinating role in the implementation of the Treaties. New South Wales is represented on the Working Group by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service.</PARA>
<PARA> Under its nature conservation legislation, New South Wales has the responsibility to assess the significance of natural areas as habitats for migratory and endangered birds, to identify areas of particular importance and to carry out protective measures to conserve habitats in such areas.</PARA>
<PARA> While my Department, when asked, provides advice on the interpretation of these and other treaties, it is inappropriate for my Department to be involved in issues relating to particular wetland areas before such assessments have been made and before the matter has been considered through agreed procedures.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Office of National Assessments (ONA) is a statutory body within the Prime Minister's portfolio but independent of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. It contains staff employed under the Public Service Act and is bound by the provisions of that Act when making appointments and transfers affecting them. I assume the honourable senator's question refers to the appointment and transfer of staff of the Office employed under the Public Service Act.</PARA>
<PARA> Appointments to the Australian Public Service are usually appointments on probation. The Public Service Act enables a person who does not have Australian citizenship to be appointed on probation, but the Act provides that, in general, such an appointment cannot be confirmed until the officer has been granted citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA> The ONA, and other agencies in the Australian Intelligence Community staffed under the Public Service Act, do not appoint on probation persons who are not Australian citizens, unless special circumstances apply.

<PARA> The pattern of expenditure displayed by the response to Senate Question No. 545 is consistent with the Department's historical trends.</PARA>
<PARA> Based on data to the end of 1985-86, expenditure for the first three quarters of a financial year is traditionally 66.7% of the full year's outlay.</PARA>
<PARA> For the same periods in the years under review, i.e. 1986-87 and 1987-88, expenditure was 68.8% and 67.6% respectively.

<PARA> Individual taxpayers who derive taxable income of over $1000, other than from wages and salaries, may be required to pay provisional tax. Income from interest bearing assets, dwelling rent, non farm unincorporated income and farm income are important sources of taxable income which may be subject to provisional tax.</PARA>

<PARA> What steps have been taken by the Australian Government to research overseas aid needs to provide optimum benefits in the following areas: (a) training, rural development and increased female involvement in development in the Pacific region; (b) training, hydrology and agriculture infrastructure support, food security, planning support and environmental rehabilitation in Indo-China; and (c) poverty alleviation, agriculture and forestry development in Africa.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="903" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="QLD" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) The Australian aid program supports Pacific Island countries on the basis of development strategies formulated by the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB). These strategies are developed and discussed with Pacific Island governments. They are based on research and discussion of the recipients' needs and priorities, Australia's own capacity to assist and areas of expertise. Consultation with other donors is another part of the process.</PARA>
<PARA> In order to research aid needs for the South Pacific region, AIDAB draws on a range of in-house and external expertise.</PARA>
<PARA> Inhouse, the Bureau has an appraisal, evaluation and sectoral study unit and the AIDAB Centre for Pacific Development and Training (ACPAC) located in Sydney. ACPAC has on its staff experts in human resource development, economic, engineering and natural resources development. A separate Development Training Group also advises on and manages training aid activities.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, AIDAB commissions research with outside organisations such as the National Centre for Development Studies, the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) and the International Development Program of Australian Universities and Colleges of Advanced Education. These research results then feed into the process of developing country and regional aid strategies.</PARA>
<PARA> Education and training are key elements in all country and regional strategies. A large proportion of country program funds are spent directly in this sector, through the provision of education in Australia, in-country training and third country training.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1989-90, AIDAB will also introduce an Equity and Merit Scholarship scheme to complement the existing training program and broaden the scope of our bilateral aid relationships. Training is also an integral component of most other aid activities such as projects managed within the Australian aid program.</PARA>
<PARA> On a region-wide basis, Australia provides significant support to the University of the South Pacific ($3.47m in 1987-88). It is the only viable regional tertiary institution and contributes to the training activities of a number of regional organisations including the South Pacific Commission (SPC) and the South Pacific Forum Secretariat.</PARA>
<PARA> In the area of rural development, Australia supports a variety of activities in the South Pacific. Country-specific activities focus on such priority areas as outer island development, forestry or particular crops. In many country programs, Australia has been asked by the recipient government to take a lead role in aspects of rural development.</PARA>
<PARA> Close links are also maintained with the key research programs of regional institutions. For example, the SPC, of which we are the major supporter, is very active in rural research.</PARA>
<PARA> In the area of women in development, a significant amount of work is being done within AIDAB. Gender analysis is being used to identify the workload of women and their access to, and control of, goods and services. Once this is done, projects can be designed to minimise the negative effects on women or, preferably, to positively benefit women.</PARA>
<PARA> In the South Pacific, the role of women in development is also being addressed on a regional basis. In addition to our traditional support for programs such as the Women's Resources Bureau in SPC, the aid program recently provided funds for research by the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM). The UNIFEM study investigated ways in which women's issues could be accommodated in the planning processes of South Pacific governments. We are currently considering Australian participation in follow-up proposals to this study.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Australia does not provide bilateral aid to either Vietnam or Cambodia. The Australian Government suspended bilateral aid to Vietnam in 1979 following the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. Therefore the Australian Government has not been in a position to undertake first hand research related to developmental needs in any sectors of these countries' economies.</PARA>
<PARA> However, Australia does provide support for country and regional programs of multilateral, international and non-government agencies in Vietnam and Cambodia. Australian contributions are intended to help in the health, agriculture and education sectors in these countries.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian bilateral aid program in Laos is planned in consultation with the Lao Government. Agriculture and the development of basic infrastructure are areas of priority interest. Research of aid needs is limited to sectors where the Lao authorities invite Australia to provide support. AIDAB has not been asked to research or to assist in hydrology, planning support or environmental rehabilitation.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1988, AIDAB carried out an assessment of English language training and is currently planning a mission to identify other possible training needs that could be funded under the aid Program.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has undertaken research in the livestock sector in Laos and in recent years has provided considerable support for livestock development. Support has been given for extension work and improved production and processing of local animal feed supplies.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also provided support over the last 10 years for irrigation projects. Food security has been an important component in irrigation activities.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia is currently examining the World Bank's Fifth Agricultural Development Project covering five Lao provinces. This study looks at options for agricultural development including crop intensification, road rehabilitation and measures to reduce environmentally damaging slash and burn cultivation.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) AIDAB has recently embarked on a study of ways to enhance the focus on poverty in the aid program. The study is expected to be completed early this year. Some of the findings of the study may have application in Africa. The present program in Southern Africa has a theme of food security which, in turn, has a close relationship with income levels and the incidence of poverty.</PARA>
<PARA> Opportunities for Australian research assistance in agriculture arise through Australia's support of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC) Food Security Technical and Administration Unit based in Harare. The Unit is the SADCC sector co-ordinator for agriculture and is concerned primarily with regional food and agricultural issues. Australia currently funds 90% of the core budget of the Unit and provides the services of an Australian agricultural expert. Through the Unit, Australia contributed to an Agricultural Marketing Study covering the SADCC region, and funded a pilot study on bulk grain storage facilities in Zimbabwe with region-wide implications. AIDAB has under consideration a proposal for a regional irrigation study and for a regional food reserve.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1983, the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) sponsored a meeting in Kenya of 70 senior scientists from six Eastern African countries and Australia. The meeting sought to identify major agricultural and forestry problems and where Australian agricultural expertise might be applied effectively. On the basis of this meeting, ACIAR sponsored research on dryland crop and forage production in Kenya. This activity commenced as a farming systems project but is now focused on soil and water management.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has undertaken a number of reviews and feasibility studies leading to projects, both research and implementation, in the forestry sector. An AIDAB review in 1986 of a World Food Program afforestation project in Southern Ethiopia, already supported by AIDAB, led to a project extension until 1989 at a cost of $12.8 million. A further review is planned this year.</PARA>
<PARA> Research seedlots in many African countries are provided under a global tree seed program administered by CSIRO and funded by AIDAB. A five year extension costing $2.2 million was approved in 1988. In Zimbabwe, aid worth $955,000 is being provided until 1992 for a forestry research centre. In Kenya, Australian aid worth $1.8 million is funding an FAO fuelwood afforestation project until 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the agricultural and forestry priorities established at the 1983 meeting, ACIAR supported collaborative forestry research projects involving CSIRO and national institutions in Kenya and Zimbabwe with the aim of selecting fast-growing Australian trees for use as fuelwood and fodder. These agroforestry projects began in 1984 and approval was given in 1988 for a further three year program of research.</PARA>
<PARA> AIDAB and ACIAR have recently funded a feasibility study for a technical assistance forestry project in East Africa.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. In all cases a current market valuation is obtained from the Australian Valuation Office. At the time an offer to purchase is made by the Commonwealth the owner is given the opportunity to obtain one private valuation at the Commonwealth's expense from a valuer of his or her own choosing. While in some instances there are differences between Commonwealth offers and private valuations, my Department is committed to the payment of fair market value and deals with owners in a fair and even-handed way.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) My Department will reopen negotiations if so desired.

<PARA> (3) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Currently there is no provision for the Commonwealth to pay compensation for injurious affection.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) When it was in Canberra, the Principal Registry was too far removed from the AAT's main work areas and was therefore restricted in the level of positive input it could make in its supervision of work flows in the major District Registries. By being situated away from the major registries, it was hampered in performing its functions of closely monitoring the operation of the various systems in place in the AAT for processing the work flow and recommending changes and adjustments.</PARA>
<PARA> Relocation of the Principal Registry to one of the major cities where there is a higher workload, and thus a larger District Registry, was considered to be a more efficient use of resources because economies of scale could be applied.</PARA>
<PARA> After the decision to relocate the Principal Registry had been taken, attempts were made to find suitable accommodation in Sydney, the largest Registry. These attempts proved fruitless because reasonably suitable accommodation could not be obtained at a reasonable cost and at a location convenient to the AAT's existing Sydney facilities, including hearing rooms and the District Registry. The same problem existed in Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA> Of the three major work locations Brisbane remained. A Brisbane location proved to be economically viable, cheaper than a move to Sydney or Melbourne, and accommodation was available in the same building in which the AAT's Brisbane operations are currently accommodated.</PARA>
<PARA> The President of the Tribunal has advised me that, having regard to the changes he has made to the Principal Registry's functions, which, broadly speaking, include centralisation of listing decisions and an increased emphasis on policy advice to the President, it will be able to operate as effectively and efficiently in Brisbane as it could in Sydney or Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The estimated costs of moving the Principal Registry from Canberra to Brisbane are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>$</PARA>
<PARA>Fitout costs in Brisbane ...</PARA>
<PARA>600,000</PARA>
<PARA>Uplift of furniture and equipment ...</PARA>
<PARA>10,000</PARA>
<PARA>Purchase of new furniture and equipment ...</PARA>
<PARA>150,000</PARA>
<PARA>Removal expenses on transfer of staff ...</PARA>
<PARA>20,000</PARA>
<PARA>780,000</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the move, the annual rental paid for accommodation for the AAT will increase by about $29,000.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The decision to move the Principal Registry of the Tribunal to Brisbane has not been formally announced by me but the fact is that it has been made known in all relevant areas, including the media, for many months.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In 1987-88 3.9% of AAT work originated in Canberra and 16.2% in Brisbane. However, it is not sufficient to simply consider the proportion of workload arising in each city. Regard must also be had to existing workloads and the outputs of the Registries.</PARA>
<PARA> The following table provides details of the comparative workloads in 1987-88 as between Canberra and Brisbane:</PARA>
<PARA>Lodged</PARA>
<PARA>Finalised</PARA>
<PARA>Undetermined</PARA>
<PARA>Preliminary</PARA>
<PARA>Conferences</PARA>
<PARA>General and Veterans Divisions</PARA>
<PARA>Brisbane ...</PARA>
<PARA>540</PARA>

<PARA>Canberra ...</PARA>
<PARA>293</PARA>
<PARA>505</PARA>
<PARA>161</PARA>
<PARA>398</PARA>
<PARA> It can be seen that Brisbane's workload far exceeds that of Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The AAT's Canberra Registry has assumed the status of a District Registry. It will initially have a staff of 2 but the need for additional staff will be kept under review. It is incorrect to say that `the bulk of AAT matters require dealings with the central office of Commonwealth departments and their legal advisers, almost all of which are located in the ACT'. Applications before the Tribunals are, in almost all cases, heard and determined in the city or State in which they are lodged. All the necessary processing of matters is handled by the District Registry in the relevant State or Territory including any necessary dealings with officers of the relevant Commonwealth Department and their legal advisers. In some cases, those officers and legal advisers are located in Canberra. The location of such people is a matter of choice for each Department and has no bearing on which Registry handles any particular application.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) There were no other specific candidates for the office of a Deputy President to which Miss Forgie was appointed. It has not been the practice in recent times to advertise for a Deputy President vacancy where suitably qualified persons are known to be available for appointment.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) I have received no representations over Miss Forgie's appointment.</PARA>
<PARA> Miss Forgie is a suitably qualified lawyer who possesses the necessary skills, ability and integrity required of a Deputy President of the Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA> Miss Forgie has never at any time been a member of my ministerial staff. As an officer of the Attorney-General's Department, she did work in my Parliamentary offices for a period of 2 years as the occupant of a position of Departmental Representative created by the Secretary of the Department to assist me with various matters affecting the work of my portfolio. The position is now occupied by another officer of the Department.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. All proposals for acceptance and wearing of foreign awards are treated on a case by case basis. The acceptance and wearing by Mr Hayden of a South Korean award was approved by The Queen under the guidelines then in place. On 6 February 1989 Australian guidelines concerning the acceptance and wearing of foreign honours or awards by Australians were gazetted. Under these guidelines, permission to accept and wear a foreign honour or award will be considered by the Governor-General for:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) conspicuous bravery in saving or attempting to save life, or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) extraordinary service to humanity at large, or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) outstanding service to the country wishing to confer the honour or award and/or in furthering relations between Australia and that country, or</PARA>
<PARA> (d) service in warlike or hazardous situations.</PARA>
<PARA> The guidelines will enable the Governor-General to consider granting permission for Australians to accept and wear foreign honours and awards including awards conferred by international organisations such as the MFO. I understand that this matter is currently before the Governor-General for consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. The Government accepts that if two medals are to be awarded for one period of service they would be proposed and approved by two quite separate processes; one under the foreign award guidelines and the other under the Australian Service Medal regulations. In short, the approval for award of the Australian Service Medal is unrelated to MFO Medal considerations.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Government does not accept that an anomaly exists.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) Are expenses incurred in travelling to such conferences tax deductible?</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Will the Government consider pro rata deductibitlity for the number of days spent in conference and the number of days spent in more pleasurable pursuits?</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) I am aware that the Eighth Canberra Dental Seminar was held in Fiji.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that claims for the cost of travelling to seminars are considered under the general deduction provisions and the substantiation provisions contained in the income tax law. Such claims are allowable income tax deductions where they can be fully substantiated, are incurred in the gaining or producing of assessable income and are not of a capital, private or domestic nature.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Commissioner said that while each claim is determined on its own merits to see if there is the necessary connection between the expenditure and the derivation of assessable income, this particular Dental Seminar seems to have combined both business and recreational pursuits. In these circumstances the cost of travelling to the Seminar would be apportioned in calculating any income tax deduction. The extent of the apportionment would be based upon the details contained in the taxpayer's travel diary. As part of the substantiation requirements all employees and self-employed taxpayers must keep receipts and travel diaries to substantiate all claims they make for overseas travel expenses. Details such as the date, nature and duration of business activities must be recorded in the diary.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Monday, 17 October 1988 (Hansard page 1437), Senator Bishop asked me a question without notice concerning the contribution made by volunteers to the community, the funding arrangements for volunteering under SkillShare and the cessation of Commonwealth funding for the Parramatta Office of the Volunteer Centre of New South Wales which was funded under the former Community Volunteer Program. She asked me a related question on the same matter on Thursday, 15 December 1988 (Hansard pages 4287-8). The Minister for Employment and Education Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has a high regard for the valuable contribution volunteers make to a broad range of people in the community including the important role volunteers play in the achievement of the Government's program objectives in the provision of community, health, migrant, educational, legal, consumer, sport and other services.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government announced in the context of the 1987/88 Budget its decision to form SkillShare by integrating the Community Volunteer Program (CVP), the Community Youth Support Scheme (CYSS) and the Community Training Program (CTP) to achieve a more effective use of available funds and to ensure that community-based assistance is provided for structured training and employment-related support for the most disadvantaged job-seekers. SkillShare commenced on 1 January 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> While there is a focus on structured skills training in the new program, the SkillShare guidelines make specific provision for projects to offer a broad range of open access activities including volunteering, employment-related personal support services and personal effectiveness training to complement structured skills training.</PARA>
<PARA> The Parramatta Office of the Volunteer Centre of NSW was one of the two former CVP projects operated under the umbrella of the Volunteer Centre of NSW. In response to an invitation, extended to all projects funded under CVP, CYSS and CTP to apply for funding under the new SkillShare guidelines, the Centre lodged an expression of interest to provide a regional volunteer service to other SkillShare projects. This proposal was outside the guidelines and consequently was not approved.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Australian Government has the most active sympathy for Australian citizens in difficulty overseas and its policy is to provide them with the fullest possible protection within the constraints of international law and practice and available resources. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade through its consular officials is responsible for implementing this policy. The functions which may be performed by consular officials are defined in, inter alia, the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (VCCR) to which Australia is a party. To further assist Australians travelling overseas the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to examine ways of streamlining the issue of passports. These official documents are provided to Australians as a means of proof of identity and nationality. Replacement of passports lost or stolen overseas is arranged promptly through the Australian consular service.</PARA>
<PARA> It is probably not widely recognised that compared with other countries a very high percentage of Australians travel overseas (1.4 million departures of Australian citizens in 1987-88). Unfortunately, there is often an unrealistic expectation in the community as to the level of consular protection and services which can be provided. In fact this is limited by the resources of our overseas posts and international law and practice.</PARA>
<PARA> Australians who travel overseas should be aware of some of the sensible precautions they can take to facilitate their travel. Australians when travelling overseas can avoid or reduce problems by acting responsibly and prudently by considering and providing for the possible consequences of any hazardous undertakings, by obtaining adequate insurance, and by having due regard for the traditions and laws of the countries in which they travel.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has a consular information program aimed at increasing the awareness of travellers of the services which can and cannot be provided overseas. Consular services cover a wide range of statutory and non-statutory activities-welfare and whereabouts, death of Australian citizens abroad and the protection of the estate of the deceased, arrest and detention, relief and repatriation, registration of citizenship by descent, marriages and notarial acts, medical and emergency evacuations, registration of ships and assistance for seamen under the Australian Navigation Act and assistance to the Australian Electoral Commission in the conduct of elections in Australia. Many of these consular functions can be resolved simply. But there are numerous cases which are not only complex and stressful, but which may not be resolved for prolonged periods and consequently exert great pressure on the human and financial resources of the consular service.</PARA>
<PARA> An explanation of the general range of consular services available overseas is contained in the booklet ``Hints for Australian Travellers''. Copies of the booklet, which is updated annually, are provided with every Australian passport issued. In addition the Department publishes a quarterly consular newsletter which is distributed to the travel industry to ensure that travel agents have the latest information to pass on to their clients. The newsletter is also sent to other interested parties, including ethnic communities' councils and migrant resource centres, and is available in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade State offices.</PARA>
<PARA> The general level of assistance able to be provided and the limitations faced by consular officers might best be indicated by a brief look at three types of cases involving Australians in difficulty overseas-health, legal offences, and dual nationality.</PARA>
<PARA> Each year Australian posts handle many cases where Australians fall ill overseas, or suffer an accident. The Consul can assist with contacting family and friends in Australia and elsewhere to obtain funds to cover their needs, and if necessary assist in arranging transfer of these funds. In cases of extreme distress the Consul may authorise a small advance until money comes through from other sources.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has negotiated with a number of countries reciprocal health care agreements which enable Australian citizens to obtain public medical and hospital treatment under the same conditions as citizens of those countries. Negotiations are continuing to increase the number of countries with which Australia has such agreements. Notwithstanding the existence of these agreements illness or injury occurring overseas can be very expensive.</PARA>
<PARA> The second type of case relates to Australians caught up in the legal processes of other countries. Australians overseas are subject to the laws, legal processes and code of punishment of the country in which they are travelling or residing. In some instances these laws, processes and punishments differ greatly from those in Australia, and may sometimes seem to be harsh and unfair. However, the Australian Government is not entitled to interfere in the internal affairs of another country, in much the same way that it would not countenance interference by another country in Australian affairs. The Government can make consular representations only when there is a basis for believing that an Australian citizen has been discriminated against in the process of the law.</PARA>
<PARA> When Australians are arrested in another country, consular officers will ensure access to legal representation and will provide regular consular assistance, including visits. They will ensure, so far as possible, that an arrested person receives the benefits of the same laws, administrative measures and protective rights as citizens of that country. Similarly, to the extent that it is possible, they will see that an arrested person gets no less a standard of facilities, including accommodation, diet and medical or dental treatment, as citizens of the country where the arrest took place. They will provide whatever other assistance and advice can reasonably be given. However, consular officers have no status in civil cases involving Australians beyond seeking fair treatment under the law. They cannot provide legal advice and they cannot achieve the release of an arrested person.</PARA>
<PARA> The matter of dual nationality often causes difficulty for those Australian travellers who also hold the citizenship of another country. In some countries dual nationals may be liable for military service, or may have restrictions placed on their movements, including being prevented from departing the country. Australians with dual nationality arrested in the country of their other nationality may sometimes be denied access by Australian consular officers. Moreover, according to international practice, a person in a third country is treated as a citizen of the country on whose passport they entered. An Australian citizen may therefore be denied access to Australian consular officers if they are travelling on their non-Australian passport.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government has attempted to address these problems and other matters which are not covered by the VCCR by entering into negotiations for consular agreements with a number of countries. An agreement was signed with Hungary in March 1988 which regularises our consular relations together with an accompanying exchange of notes which provide that dual nationals when visiting the country of their other nationality will be treated as citizens of the country on whose passport they are travelling. Negotiations with a number of other countries are at various stages of progress.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In the same way that foreign governments do not have any input into investigations and trials in Australia involving crimes of violence against foreign nationals, the Australian Government does not have any role to play in investigations and trials in cases involving Australian citizens in foreign countries.</PARA>
<PARA> However Australian consular officers will, wherever possible, monitor enquiries and court proceedings in such cases in order to demonstrate to the local authorities that Australia has an interest in ensuring that due legal processes are being followed. Australian consular officials will seek to ensure that the interests of Australian citizens are protected and that those citizens receive fair treatment under the local judicial system.</PARA>
