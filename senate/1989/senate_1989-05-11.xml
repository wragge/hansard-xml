<TITLE>Interest Rates</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Hawke-Keating government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many Australians out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recently, the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances considered the ACT Imperial Acts (Repeal) Ordinance 1988. This was the third ordinance in a package intended to reform the law with respect to imperial legislation in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). This ordinance repealed various old Acts such as the Evidence of Barbarous and Uncivilised People Destitute of the Knowledge of God Act. It also repealed Acts which obviously were never actually observed in the Australian Capital Territory even though they may have been in force, such as the Wine to be Sold at Reasonable Price Act 1330.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On a more serious note, the Committee looked long and hard at this ordinance, which repealed many Acts, none of which were expressly listed, by a law made by the Executive. At the end of 1985, at the instigation of the Committee, the Senate actually disallowed a similar ordinance made in respect of obsolete New South Wales Acts; another example of the Senate asserting the primacy of the Parliament. Subsequently, the Committee held a hearing with senior officials of the Attorney-General's Department to try to avoid a similar fate for the proposed Imperial Acts (Repeal) Ordinance. The Attorney-General, the Hon. Lionel Bowen, MP, then undertook to meet the concerns of the Committee by providing in the explanatory statement to re-enact any repealed Imperial Act which either House resolved should be re-enacted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee accepted this undertaking as the result would be that the Senate could, in effect, recall a repealed Act. The Committee wrote to the Minister that when the ordinance was made it would report to the Senate that its form was acceptable because of this undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA> The eventual ordinance was not tabled in the Senate until this year, when it was again closely examined by the Committee. There was a strong feeling in the Committee that the subject matter of the ordinance might be better dealt with by the new ACT Legislative Assembly. Legal advice was obtained, however, which indicated some of the Acts concerned were outside the jurisdiction of the Legislative Assembly. Had this not been the case, it is possible the Committee may have recommended that the matter be dealt with by the new legislature. Mr President, I seek leave to incorporate a short summary of the Committee's scrutiny of this ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>IMPERIAL ACTS (REPEAL) ORDINANCE 1988</PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales Acts Application Ordinance 1985, ACT Ordinance No. 25 of 1985, repealed over 100 New South Wales Acts in their application to the ACT, without listing the actual Acts. The result was that a Senator wishing to object to the repeal of a particular Act was obliged to move to disallow the repeal of all the Acts, including those in which the Senator had no interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee moved for disallowance of the Ordinance on 11 October 1985 and when the Senate rose on 28 November 1985 the Ordinance was deemed to have been disallowed. The disallowance was reported on in the Seventy-Sixth Report of the Committee, December 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> The Imperial Acts (Substituted Provisions) Ordinance 1986, ACT Ordinance No. 19 of 1986, was intended as the first of three stages in the reform of Imperial Acts which applied in the ACT. That Ordinance terminated the operations of 26 Imperial Acts in the ACT and substituted new provisions in their place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Imperial Acts Application Ordinance 1986, ACT Ordinance No. 93 of 1986, was the second stage of the reforms. It expressly preserved certain Imperial Acts, such as Magna Carta, the Petition of Right and the Bill of Rights. </PARA>
<PARA> The Third stage would be the eventual Imperial Acts (Repeal) Ordinance, intended to repeal unnecessary and obsolete Imperial Acts in their application to the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General, the Hon. Lionel Bowen MP, then advised the Committee that he had concluded it would not be possible to include a list of Acts to be repealed in the repealing legislation, as recommended by the Committee in its Seventy-Sixth Report. This was because a complete and accurate list could not be provided and because an incomplete list would be inconvenient and uncertain. Nevertheless, the Attorney-General emphasised that he wished to ensure that specific Acts could be taken out of the repeal process if either House wished. Accordingly, the Attorney-General suggested a meeting between the Committee and senior officials of his department. The Committee held an in camera hearing with these officials on 20 November 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the hearing the Chairman wrote to the Attorney-General on 26 November 1986, confirming that the concern of the Committee was that the Senate should have the same control over the executive unmaking of laws as it had over the executive making of laws. The Chairman then advised that following the hearing the Committee accepted the proposal that rather than list Acts in a repealing Schedule, the Attorney-General would undertake to re-enact any repealed Imperial Act which either House resolved should be preserved. The Chairman added that when the Ordinance was eventually tabled the Committee would report to the Senate that its form was acceptable because of this undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA> The Imperial Acts (Repeal) Ordinance 1988, ACT Ordinance No. 94 of 1988, was made on 15 December 1988 and tabled in the Senate on 28 February 1989. It repealed all Imperial Acts in force in the ACT except those expressly preserved by the 2 earlier related ordinances. No Act was expressly mentioned in the Ordinance, although an extensive list of such Acts was included in the Explanatory Statement. A passage in the Explanatory Statement also asserted that if either House resolved that an Imperial Act repealed by the Ordinance should be preserved, that Act would by Ordinance be restored to be in force as it was before the Ordinance. (This Ordinance differed from the disallowed New South Wales Acts Application Ordinance 1985 in that with the former the Imperial Acts affected were not known with certainty, while with the latter there was a limited and definitive number of Acts each of which was certain and known). </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee examined the Ordinance at its Meetings of 2 March, 9 March and 6 April 1989. Because of the length of time involved in the making of the Ordinance and the subsequent passage of Acts with respect to an ACT Legislative Assembly the Committee felt it may be more appropriate for the matter to be dealt with by that legislature. The Committee received advice, however, that the ACT Legislative Assembly did not have power to make laws with respect to some of the matters dealt with by the repealed Acts. After full discussion over a number of meetings of different alternatives such as additional Commonwealth legislation or complementary Commonwealth and ACT legislation the Committee resolved to accept the Ordinance and to report to the Senate that its form was acceptable due to the undertaking of the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All of us would be aware that today the Legislative Assembly for the ACT meets for the first time and Commonwealth statutory provisions will be proclaimed under which most ACT legislation will become the responsibility of that Assembly and will be administered through ACT Ministers. This means that those ACT Ordinances, and the Regulations and other instruments made under them, will no longer be tabled in the Parliament or be subject to disallowance. The relevant ACT Ordinances will be deemed Acts and any future amendments or new legislation will be made by a legislature and not by executive law makers. Regulations and other instruments made under the new Acts will be made by ACT rather than Commonwealth Ministers. Many of the ordinances which today pass from the control of the Commonwealth Parliament have been improved by the technical scrutiny performed by the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the years scrutiny by the Committee has resulted in many ministerial undertakings to amend ACT legislation to provide, for example, for Administrative Appeals Tribunal review rights, for elimination of strict liability offences and for tabling in Parliament of important instruments. Some of the more recent undertakings given to the Committee have not yet been implemented and there is some correspondence outstanding. This matter was addressed some time ago and on 31 August 1988 the then Minister for the Arts and Territories, the Hon. Gary Punch MP, wrote to the Chairman undertaking to direct his departmental staff to do everything possible to clear outstanding undertakings. Should this not be possible before the coming of self-government the Minister undertook to recommend to the new ACT government that appropriate and urgent amendments be made. On behalf of the Committee I have written to the present Minister for the Arts and Territories, the Hon. Clyde Holding MP, reminding him of this undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point I emphasise that, as honourable senators know, it is not all ACT Ordinances and related instruments which are being transferred to the new Legislative Assembly. A few ACT laws will continue to be made by the Commonwealth at least for the time being, particularly those on matters which are the responsibility of the Attorney-General. The Committee will, of course, continue to examine the technical aspects of Ordinances of other Territories of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally I inform the Senate that on behalf of the Committee I shall be writing to the new Speaker of the Legislative Assembly for the ACT, when he or she is appointed, offering the best wishes of the Committee for its future and inviting a delegation of members of the Assembly to attend a lunch jointly hosted by the Committee and the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. The purpose of this meeting will be to discuss the process of technical legislative scrutiny by parliamentary committees with a view to encouraging our ACT colleagues to adopt similar machinery if they consider it to be appropriate for their chamber. </PARA>

Being in the Senate, of course, although never on that Committee, I have certainly benefited from the expertise of the Committee and its staff in overseeing the legislation that has been brought in.

From the time that this Committee existed, and certainly when it was last appointed in 1984, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate appointed two senators to this Committee, which is a fair and reasonable number given our representation in the Senate.

I welcome the fact that the Government has at last, nearly two years later, accepted the fact that it ought to exist.

<PARA>AUSTRALIAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill 1989 is the second and final stage of legislative changes to implement the Government's reform package for Telecom, announced in the Ministerial statement of 25 May 1988 ``Reshaping the Transport and Communications Government Business Enterprises''. The first stage was implemented by the Telecommunications Amendment Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> A central plank in the Government's micro-economic reform agenda for restructuring the public sector is that Government Business Enterprises (GBEs) should be as efficient as possible and responsive to consumers' needs. </PARA>
<PARA> The GBEs within the Transport and Communications Portfolio, in addition to producing final goods and services for consumers, also produce intermediate inputs for the rest of the economy, with a resulting impact on Australia's overall cost structures and the ability of Australian businesses to compete internationally. Telecommunications is an increasingly important input factor in the production of other goods and services by Australian business for supply to domestic and international markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government sees the commercialisation of GBEs as a necessary and fundamental pre-condition to improvements in efficiency. GBEs such as Telecom are being placed on a more commercial footing, bringing them more into line with private sector competitors, and subjecting them increasingly to the disciplines of the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> Implementation of the Telecom reform package, together with real reductions in the average price of a basket of basic telecommunications services through the price control formula CPI-X, will bring about increased efficiencies and economies in the provision of telecommunications services by the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> As announced in the 25 May 1988 Statement, the reform package strategy for Telecom has as its key elements the implementation of a new corporate and financial structure, establishment of new planning and accountability mechanisms, modification of major strategic controls and removal of day-to-day ministerial controls. </PARA>
<PARA> The Telecommunications Amendment Act 1988 was principally concerned with putting in place the new corporate structure and removing ministerial controls. In particular, from 1 January 1989 the Australian Telecommunications Commission (Telecom) was renamed the Australian Telecommunications Commission Corporation. Telecom became a statutory corporation, with a separate Board of Directors, instead of Commissioners who were members of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> This structural change did not change Telecom's legal identity or status, but the separation of the enteprise and the Board assisted in a clearer definition of the roles of the Government as owner, the Board accountable for performance and Telecom management responsible for operations. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with the philosophy of moving from oversight of the proceeds to an emphasis on results, the Telecommunications Amendment Act 1988 also removed a range of controls over day-to-day activities such as approval of individual contract and borrowing proposals. These are now appropriately the responsibility of the Board. </PARA>
<PARA> This Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill 1989 replaces the Telecommunications Act 1975 under which Telecom is established, with a new Act, planned to operate from 1 July 1989. The provisions in the Telecommunications Act dealing with regulatory issues are now contained in the Telecommunications Bill 1989, which establishes the new regulatory body AUSTEL. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Telecommunications Corporation is continued in operation, again with no change of legal identity or legal status. The provisions in the Bill relating to appointment of directors and meetings of the Board, appointment of the Managing Director, and employment conditions for Telecom staff repeat, without significant changes, the new provisions inserted by the Telecommunications Amendment Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom's functions and powers have been redefined. The Bill emphasises Telecom's principal role as a provider of domestic telecommunications services, but it has subsidiary functions to allow it to engage in other business or activities within and outside Australia, related to telecommunications, and incidental functions allowing it to conduct other business in the course of fulfilling its principal role. The Bill provides Telecom with all the powers necessary to carry out its functions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill places commercial, community service and general obligations on Telecom, to perform its functions in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice. It is an integral feature of the reform packages for GBEs that commercial performance is the primary responsibility of the enterprises. However, this does not detract from Telecom's social responsibility to provide universal service, that is to deliver its community service obligations (CSOs). </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom's statutory CSO is the supply of a standard telephone service as efficiently and economically as practicable, reasonably accessible to all people, on an equitable basis wherever they reside or carry out business within Australia. Also there is a requirement that service performance standards must reasonably meet the social, industrial and commercial needs of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance of meeting CSOs is evident in the corporate planning process I describe below. Telecom's plan for, and delivery of, CSOs are part of the accountability measures of the Board. The costs involved will be separately identified and will be taken into account in fixing the financial target Telecom is expected to meet. AUSTEL has the function of monitoring and reporting on Telecom's delivery of its CSOs. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom is also required to comply with directions by the Minister and, where these are notified in writing, government policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the remaining key elements of the reform strategy, that is the implementation of a new capital and financial structure and establishment of new planning and accountability mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for Telecom's initial capital to be determined by the Minister for Transport and Communications as soon as possible after commencement, which will involve conversion of some part of existing Commonwealth loans to capital. Telecom's assets will be revalued before 1 July 1989. Following this, the Government will determine an appropriate debt to equity ratio for Telecom on a basis com- parable to leading telecommunications companies in other parts of the world. Telecom's assets will be revalued at least once every five years in accordance with normal commercial practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill gives Telecom a commercially oriented financial structure with the usual commercial obligations to pay taxes and charges and appropriate dividends on owner's equity. </PARA>
<PARA> The removal of day-to-day controls means Telecom is no longer subject to routine oversight by Government of the way it carries on business. This Bill provides for more structured oversight by the Government, as owner, of the objectives and strategies proposed by Telecom and for the Government to indicate the financial target it expects Telecom to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> The Board of Telecom will be required to prepare and revise a corporate plan for a period of between 3 and 5 years, the first plan commencing 1 July 1989. The corporate plan will set out the objectives of Telecom and its subsidiaries and outline the overall strategies and policies to be followed to achieve those objectives, including meeting its CSOs. </PARA>
<PARA> Financial matters to be included in the corporate plan include an overall financial target to be agreed with by the Minister, overall pricing, investment and borrowing strategies and estimates of the costs of carrying out CSOs and general governmental obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Board is to provide the Minister with a copy of the corporate plan and the Minister can direct the Board, within 30 days, to vary the financial target or the strategies and policies to meet its CSOs, or both. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides other accountability requirements including timely presentation of annual reports and financial statements audited by the Auditor-General, disclosure of the objectives, strategies, policies, operations and performance of Telecom and its subsidiaries, and details relating to CSOs. The Board will also be required to give the Minister prior notification of significant business activities in which Telecom and its subsidiaries propose to engage or cease to participate. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom will be subject to taxation under State and Territory laws from 1 July 1989. Transitional provisions are set out in the accompanying Telecommunications and Postal Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill. Telecom's current exemption from other State and Territory laws will continue until a sunset provision in the Bill comes into force on 30 December 1990. This can be extended by regulation, generally or for particular laws or classes of laws. </PARA>
<PARA> With the enactment of this Bill the Government will have substantially completed the implementation of the key elements of the Telecom reform package. </PARA>
<PARA> Some other aspects of reforms have been completed, such as revised industrial relations monitoring arrangements. Controls relating to Telecom's borrowings, executive remuneration and superannuation are under progressive review. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has put in place the key elements of its reform strategy for Telecom including planning and accountability mechanisms. These, in conjunction with the measures reflected in the Telecommunications Bill 1989, will significantly change the Australian telecommunications industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN POSTAL CORPORATION BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Postal Corporation Bill 1989 is the second and final stage of legislative changes to implement the Government's reform package for Australia Post, announced in the Ministerial statement of 25 May 1988 ``Reshaping the Transport and Communications Government Business Enterprises''. The first stage was implemented by the Australia Postal Services Amendment Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> A central plank in the Government's micro-economic reform agenda for restructuring the public sector is that Government Business Enterprises (GBEs) should be as efficient as possible and responsive to consumers' needs. </PARA>
<PARA> The GBEs within the Transport and Communications Portfolio, in addition to producing final goods and services for consumers, also produce intermediate inputs for the rest of the economy, with a resulting impact on Australia's overall cost structures and the ability of Australian businesses to compete internationally. Australia Post's services are an increasingly important input factor in the production of other goods and services by Australian business for supply to domestic and international markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government sees the commercialisation of GBEs as a necessary and fundamental pre-condition to improvements in efficiency. GBEs such as Australia Post are being placed on a more commercial footing, bringing them more into line with private sector competitors, and subjecting them increasingly to the disciplines of the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> As announced in the 25 May 1988 Statement, the reform package strategy for Australia Post has as its key elements the implementation of a new corporate and financial structure, establishment of new planning and accountability mechanisms, modification of major strategic controls and removal of day-to-day ministerial controls. </PARA>
<PARA> The Postal Services Amendment Act 1988 was principally concerned with putting in place the new corporate structure and removing ministerial controls. In particular, from 1 January 1989 the Australian Postal Commission (Australia Post) was renamed the Australian Postal Corporation. Australia Post became a statutory corporation, with a separate Board of Directors, instead of Commissioners who were members of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> This structural change did not change Australia Post's legal identity or status, but the separation of the enterprise and the Board assisted in a clearer definition of the roles of the Government as owner, the Board accountable for performance and Australia Post management responsible for operations. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with the philosophy of moving from oversight of the process to an emphasis on results, the Australia Postal Services Amendment Act 1988 also removed a range of controls over day-to-day activities such as approval of individual contract and borrowing proposals. These are now appropriately the responsibility of the Board. </PARA>
<PARA> This Australian Postal Corporation Bill 1989 replaces the Postal Services Act 1975 under which Australia Post is established, with a new Act, planned to operate from 1 July 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Postal Corporation is continued in operation, again with no change of legal identity or legal status. The provisions in the Bill relating to appointment of directors and meetings of the Board, appointment of the Managing Director, and employment conditions for Australia Post staff repeat, without significant changes, the new provisions inserted by the Australia Postal Services Amendment Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia Post's functions and powers have been redefined. The Bill emphasises Australia Post's principal role as a provider of domestic postal services, but it has subsidiary functions to allow it to engage in other business or activities within and outside Australia, related to postal services, and incidental functions allowing it to conduct other business in the course of fulfilling its principal role. The Bill provides Australia Post with all the powers necessary to carry out its functions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill places commercial, community service and general obligations on Australia Post, to perform its functions in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice. It is an integral feature of the reform packages for GBEs that commercial performance is the primary responsibility of the enterprises. However, it does not detract from Australia Post's social responsibility to provide universal service, that is, to deliver its community service obligations (CSOs). Australia Post's statutory CSOs are the provision of a letter service available at a single uniform rate of postage for carriage within Australia, by ordinary post, of letters that are standard postal articles. Also there is a requirement that service performance standards must reasonably meet the social, industrial and commercial needs of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance of meeting CSOs is evident in the corporate planning process I describe below. Australia Post's plans for, and delivery of, CSOs are part of the accountability measures of the Board. The costs involved will be separately identified and will be taken into account in fixing the financial target Australia Post is expected to meet. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill changes significantly the way reserved services are handled compared with the Postal Services Act 1975. In that Act it was a criminal offence for anyone, other than Post to carry a letter for reward (with some exceptions). ``Letter'' was not defined and this has made it difficult to mount prosecutions. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Corporation bill ``letter'' is defined broadly, Post is given the exclusive right to carry letters in Australia and between Australia and overseas but there is a number of exceptions to that exclusive right. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia Post's power to enforce the reserved services provisions will be through the ability to seek an injunction, damages or an account of profits in the Federal Court. This should have two advantages; the issue will be dealt with in one superior court; it should allow more consideration by the court of the justification for reserved services and the effects of an infringement on the capacity of Post to meet its CSOs. </PARA>
<PARA> Post also has the exclusive right to issue postage stamps but no monopoly on their sale. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia Post is also required to comply with directions by the Minister and, where these are notified in writing, government policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the remaining key elements of the reform strategy, implementation of a new capital and financial structure and establishment of new planning and accountability mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for Australia Post's initial capital to be determined by the Minister for Transport and Communications as soon as possible after commencement, which will involve conversion of some part of existing Commonwealth loans to capital. Australia Post's assets will be revalued before 1 July 1989. Following this, the Government will determine an appropriate debt to equity ratio for Australia Post. Australia Post's assets will be revalued at least once every five years in accordance with normal commercial practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill gives Australia Post a commercially oriented financial structure with the usual commercial obligations to pay taxes and charges and appropriate dividends on owner's equity. </PARA>
<PARA> The removal of day-to-day controls means Australia Post is no longer subject to routine oversight by Government of the way it carries on business. This Bill provides for more structured oversight by the Government, as owner, of the objectives and strategies proposed by Australia Post and for the Government to indicate the financial target it expects Australia Post to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> The Board of Australia Post will be required to prepare and revise a corporate plan for a period of between 3 and 5 years, the first plan commencing 1 July 1989. The corporate plan will set out the objectives of Australia Post and its subsidiaries and outline the overall strategies and policies to be followed to achieve those objectives, including meeting its CSOs. </PARA>
<PARA> Financial matters to be included in the corporate plan include an overall financial target to be agreed with the Minister, overall pricing, investment and borrowing strategies and estimates of the costs of carrying out CSOs and general governmental obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Board is to provide the Minister with a copy of the corporate plan and the Minister can direct the Board, within 30 days, to vary the financial target or the strategies and policies to meet its CSOs, or both. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides other accountability requirements including timely presentation of annual reports and financial statements audited by the Auditor-General, disclosure of the objectives, strategies, policies, operations and performance of Australia Post and its subsidiaries, and details relating to CSOs. The Board will also be required to give the Minister prior notification of significant business activities in which Australia Post and its subsidiaries propose to engage or cease to participate. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia Post will be subject to taxation under State and Territory laws from 1 July 1989. Transitional provisions are set out in the accompanying Telecommunications and Postal Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill. Australia Post's current exemption from other State and Territory laws will continue until a sunset provision in the Bill comes into force on 30 December 1990. This can be extended by regulation, generally or for particular laws or classes of laws. </PARA>
<PARA> With the enactment of this Bill the Government will have substantially completed the implementation of the key elements of the Australia Post reform package. </PARA>
<PARA> Some other aspects of reforms have been completed, such as revised industrial relations monitoring arrangements. Controls relating to Australia Post's borrowings, executive remuneration and superannuation are under progressive review. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has put in place the key elements of its reform strategy for Australia Post including planning and accountability mechanisms. These measures, in conjunction with the efficiency gains that will derive from a more commercial enterprise should result in a substantially improved postal service in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND POSTAL SERVICES (TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is related to the Telecommunications Bill 1989, the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill 1989 and the Australian Postal Corporation Bill 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> It repeals the Telecommunications Act 1975 and the Postal Services Act 1975, which are replaced by the new legislation and makes consequential amendments to other Acts. It also includes transitional provisions for the imposition of income tax and State and Territory taxes and charges, and for other purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill inserts new Parts in the Crimes Act 1914 covering postal and telecommunications offences, covering the same ground as in the existing legislation. However, the opportunity has been taken to revise the offences, taking into account developments since 1975 and treating Australia Post and the three carriers (Telecom, OTC and AUSSAT) consistently. </PARA>
<PARA> In some cases the existing Telecom and Australia Post offences are adequately covered by general Crimes Act provisions and have not been repeated. The consistent treatment of the three carriers is desirable because of the national importance of the telecommunications network and services and an exception has been made to the general classification of Commonwealth bodies for the Crimes Act. OTC and AUSSAT will be deemed to be public authorities for all purposes under the Crimes Act, and their employees, including people who perform services for and on behalf of AUSSAT and OTC and their employees, will be treated in the same way as Commonwealth officers. </PARA>
<PARA> This inclusion of OTC and AUSSAT within the Crimes Act umbrella is a temporary measure only and is subject to the Government's decision about which, if any, of its business enterprises should be so protected. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, Telecom and Post security personnel investigate offences under their Acts in co-operation with the Australian Federal Police, under guidelines about the break-up of responsibilities. This situation will continue. However, we have made one important change. Under the existing legislation, Telecom and Australia Post employees and any other person are given a power of arrest without warrant for certain property offences. There will be no such powers conferred under the new legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill repeals redundant provisions in the OTC and Satellite Communications Acts to be covered in the new Telecommunications Act and makes minor consequential amendments to bring the language into line with the language in the Telecom and Australia Post Acts. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia Post and Telecom will be subjected to State taxes and charges from commencement, planned for 1 July 1989. The Bill provides that the enterprises will not be subject to stamp duty or similar duties on property acquired, transactions entered into or securities issued, before the commencing day. </PARA>
<PARA> The transitional taxation provisions in the Bill complement the details of the imposition of income tax on Australia Post and Telecom from the 1990-91 year of income, and provide for arrangements to apply in respect of valuation of trading stock, capital gains tax and depreciation. </PARA>
<PARA> Austel established by the new Telecommunications Act, will investigate complaints about failure to provide telecommunications services, connect customer equipment or perform cabling work. The Bill amends the Ombudsman Act 1976 to give the Ombudsman a discretion not to investigate such complaints where Austel would deal with them more effectively, and for the transfer of the complaints. </PARA>
<PARA> In deciding whether or not to issue licences under the Radiocommunications Act 1983 and when imposing conditions on such licences, the Minister for Transport and Communications will now be able to take into account the policy for the regulation of telecommunications networks stated in Division 1 of Part 3 of the new Telecommunications Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 8 of the Bill contains a number of consequential amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. That Act currently affords protection from interception to communications passing over telecommunications systems provided by or with the authority of Telecom. The Act also provides for the interception of such communications in the limited circumstances specified in the Act, such as under a warrant or in connection with the operation or maintenance of the telecommunications system. </PARA>
<PARA> However, with the enactment of the Telecommunications Act 1989, both OTC and AUSSAT will be able to supply certain domestic telecommunications services. The amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act take account of these changes to the telecommunications industry. They are designed to preserve the ambit of the Act's prohibition on interception of communications, the scope of the provisions allowing for interceptions and the communication of information obtained thereby, in specified circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>TELECOMMUNICATIONS BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> On 25 May 1988 the Government released a policy statement outlining a new framework for telecommunications services in Australia. This was an integral part of the Government's third term microeconomic agenda, which emphasised the need to improve the efficiency of our economic infrastructure. The new arrangements for telecommunications were designed as part of a process of structural adjustment of key industries, with a view to establishing and sustaining longer term economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, the Government will continue to serve the significant social objectives associated with the important role in the Australian community of access to telephone services. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian telecommunications industry is of strategic importance to both the manufacturing and service sectors of the Australian economy. It is a key to export led growth. The importance of information industries in the world economy is growing. The world's telecommunications market is currently estimated at around $400 billion per annum, more than computing, pharmaceuticals or air travel. The Australian market is about 2.5 per cent of the world market or $10 billion. Australia's telecommunications industry must be established on a sound and efficient basis, so that it can adapt to changing technologies and user needs. This will contribute to Australia's ability to compete effectively in the rapidly growing world market. Greater efficiency and competitiveness are also required if the Australian people are to continue to receive high standard communication facilities, provided efficiently, economically and on an equitable basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Significant reforms are being undertaken by the Government to achieve these goals. Changes to the structural frameworks of the telecommunications carriers-Telecom, OTC and AUSSAT-are being implemented separately. These changes will ensure that these Government Business Enterprises (GBEs) are more efficient, responsive and accountable to both government and Australian users of telecommunications services. </PARA>
<PARA> New regulatory arrangements, introduced in this Telecommunications Bill, will separate the technical and regulatory functions from the operations of the carriers and place these responsibilities in the hands of an independent industry regulator, the Australian Telecommunications Authority (Austel). Austel will also be responsible for consumer protection, promotion of competition in the industry, and monitoring the efficiency and adequacy of the services provided by carriers. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the most significant reform in Australian telecommunications since 1975, when the Whitlam Labor Government created two major public enterprises, Telecom and Australia Post, from the former Postmaster-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA> There are five key elements in the Telecommunications Bill now before the House:</PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of the Australian Telecommunications Authority, Austel, as the telecommunications industry regulator, with both technical and economic regulatory functions;</PARA>
<PARA> the definition of those telecommunications services which will, for reasons of network development and social objectives, be reserved to Telecom, OTC and AUSSAT;</PARA>
<PARA> the creation of a streamlined licensing regime for other services which, combined with safeguards against discriminatory behaviour by the carriers, will allow free and fair competition in the provision of value added services and the efficient operation of approved private networks;</PARA>
<PARA> the assurance of fair and open competition in the customer equipment market; and</PARA>
<PARA> the provision of mechanisms to ensure that consumer interests are protected and the Government's social objectives are achieved by the telecommunications industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Austel</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As the new industry regulator, Austel will encourage the right environment for growth in the telecommunications industry. In addition to administering the provisions which define the boundaries of the monopoly, Austel will take over from Telecom the function of approving equipment for connection to the public-switched telephone network. Industry will play a major role in the development of appropriate technical standards which will be administered by Austel. There will be close co-operation between Austel and the Standards Association of Australia in the development of both mandatory and voluntary standards for the telecommunications industry. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as being the technical regulator, Austel will have an economic regulation role. </PARA>
<PARA> Austel will operate with a chair and two other statutory office holders. Austel will have approximately 70 additional staff, and the cost of running the authority is estimated to be $5 million per annum. It is our aim to have Austel operational on July 1, 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> It is intended for Austel to develop close links with the Trade Practices Commission, in order to assist both bodies in their respective roles of ensuring that the carriers do not misuse their monopoly powers in competitive markets. The Government intends to appoint the chair and one other member as part-time associate members of the Trade Practices Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains mechanisms to ensure that those affected by an Austel decision have the right to seek reconsideration by Austel or review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It is not the intent of the Government to foster legalistic processes which could be used to thwart Austel's legitimate decision-making processes, but to ensure that those involved receive natural justice. If the appeals machinery is abused or proves too cumbersome in practice, I will move to amend the legislation as necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> As for other similar statutory authorities, the Government expects Austel to seek to recover some of its costs of operation from the industry. A companion piece of legislation to this Bill, the Telecommunications (Applications Fees) Bill 1989, provides for the setting of fees for a range of Austel services such as applications for variations to class licences and applications for permits to attach equipment to the network. These fees will be set to recover direct costs only and Austel will be asked to report to Government, following consultation with the industry, on the practicalities of recovering some of the other costs of its operations from the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision has been made for a power of ministerial direction over Austel, but only as regards policy matters. This power of direction will not extend to specific decisions in individual cases. The Minister will also be able to request reports from the authority on a broad range of issues. </PARA>
<PARA> In this regard, I will shortly be writing to the chair of Austel to seek reports on matters affecting both the operations of Austel and the wider operations of the Telecommunications service industry. As foreshadowed in the 1988 May statement, these will include a report on the implications of licensing an additional operator of public mobile telephone services and a report on the appropriateness of the current policy on the joint use of private networks by ``common interest'' groups. </PARA>
<PARA>Basic Network Services</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> After reviewing Telecommunications policy early in 1988, the Government decided that certain services should be reserved for provision by the three established carriers only. One reason for this was network development. There is a clear need to secure the orderly and efficient development of the basic Telecommunications network by taking advantage of the economies of scale and scope that exist in the industry, and by avoiding costly and uneconomic duplication of facilities that can be most efficiently provided by a single supplier. </PARA>
<PARA> The other reason is the important need for universal service, which is a particular community service obligation placed on Telecom. The Government expects Telecom to provide equitable access to standard telephone services as efficiently and economically as practicable. It is therefore necessary to allow for Telecom to average its prices and practise some cross subsidy. Telecom will be specifically accountable to the Government, through Austel, which will monitor the efficiency with which Telecom meets its obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation provides for the continuation of a monopoly by the carriers in the provision of Telecommunications facilities. It also specifies certain services which can be provided on those facilities only by designated carriers. Telecom will be the sole domestic provider of public-switched voice, data and video services, public switched integrated services digital networks (ISDN), non-satellite leased circuits and public mobile telephone services. OTC will be the sole provider of these services internationally, and Aussat will be the sole provider of satellite facilities within Australia and is given extended scope to provide private network facilities to and from Australia. Third party carriage, or the shared use and resale of leased circuits, will continue to be prohibited. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation also includes provisions to ensure equity within the industry and to encourage the efficient utilisation of our Telecommunications infrastructure. These provisions require the carriers to supply capacity on a non-discriminatory basis to all valid customers: residential or business users, private network operators or value added service providers. </PARA>
<PARA>Value Added Services</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Beyond the reserved services, the legislation provides for full and free competition in the provision of value added services, or VAS. This Bill creates a licensing regime for VAS which will minimise Government intervention in routine commercial activities. The introduction of a class licence, subject to standard conditions, will provide for the operation of all currently approved forms of VAS. There will be no need for a VAS provider to obtain specific approval for a service which clearly falls within the class licence. A person who wishes to introduce an innovative service which is not already covered in the class licence may apply to Austel for a specific authorisation. No authorisation will be given to a service which infringes on the reserved services. If it does not infringe, the class licence will then be amended to encompass provision of the new service by any VAS operator. In this way, the costly and burdensome practice of individual licensing can be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> Austel, and not the carriers, will be the arbiter of what is a value added service. Austel will thus administer the boundary determined by this legislation between the reserved services and the competitive services. </PARA>
<PARA> Provisions in the legislation require carriers to provide carriage for all authorised VAS, and to ensure that there is no price discrimination. The carriers will be required to maintain separate accounting arrangements for their own VAS activities, to provide a level playing field for competition in these services. This Bill maintains the status quo with regard to video and audio information and entertainment services (VAIES), but should the current review of the broadcasting legislation require amendments to this legislation, then I will move them as necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>Customer Equipment</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> With the exception of the first phone, steps have already been taken to liberalise the provision and maintenance of customer equipment. These are formally recognised in this Bill, and in conjunction with the new regime for value added services, they will open up new opportunities for Australian industry to develop and expand. The encouragement of active competition provided by this legislation is a major step towards making the Telecommunications sector stronger and more able to compete on an international level. </PARA>
<PARA> There is provision in the legislation to give effect to the Government's new industry development arrangements for the customer equipment manufacturing sector. These were announced in December last year and are aimed at making the industry internationally competitive. I will be directing Austel, under the legislation, to ensure that all relevant customer equipment complies with these arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>Consumer Protection and Social Obligations</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> One of Austel's prime roles will be as a consumer watchdog, reporting on the performance of the carriers in their delivery of reserved services. It will administer the Government's formula for the price capping of basic services, which will ensure that the average price of a basket of basic telecommunications services will fall in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation also provides a power for the Minister to declare that a specified reserved service charge is to be subject to notification and disallowance. This will provide an additional safeguard for consumers and Austel will be able to give advice to the Minister on pricing practices for carrier reserved services. </PARA>
<PARA> Austel will also report to Government on the performance of Telecom in meeting its community service obligations, including its responsibility to provide universal service and other socially necessary services such as public telephones. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to consumer complaints, Austel may deal with them itself if general regulatory considerations are involved, or it may direct them to the Trade Practices Commission or the Federal Ombudsman. It is not intended that Austel will take over any of the Ombudsman's current activities regarding the investigation of individual complaints. Appropriate arrangements will be developed to coordinate the work of Austel and the Ombudsman's office. Austel will, however, have a responsibility to investigate complaints that raise regulatory questions, and it will work closely with the Ombudsman's office to ensure that complaints against the carriers are investigated promptly and that any necessary follow-up action is taken. </PARA>
<PARA> It is intended that there will be a review of the respective roles of Austel and the Ombudsman within two years of Austel's creation to ensure that consumer complaints are being handled as effectively as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is confident that these measures-establishing an independent regulator, defining specific community service obligations for Telecom, guaranteeing that average price rises for basic telecommunications services fall in real terms, introducing new accountability arrangements for the carriers-will protect the rights of consumers and ensure that the Telecommunications industry fulfils important social obligations and contributes to national economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill has widespread support within both the telecommunications services industry and the general community. There was extensive consultation with interested groups before the Government's decisions relating to telecommunications reform were announced in May 1988, and this consultation has continued. A draft of this Bill was made available to the industry for comment and a wide range of interested groups responded. While this legislation incorporates the results of these consultations, the Bill does not simply reflect the demands of sectional interests. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is an important element in the Government's program of microeconomic reform. It serves the interests of the telecommunications industry and at the same time it legislates for the continuation of universal service. It will benefit all members of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (APPLICATION FEES) BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> This is a companion piece of legislation to the Telecommunications Bill 1989 and provides for the setting of fees for a range of applications to the Australian Telecommunications Authority. I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill, together with its companion Bills, Supply Bill (No. 2) 1989-90 and Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1989-90, seeks interim appropriations for the ongoing services of the Government during the period 1 July 1989 to 30 November 1989, by which date it is expected that the equivalent appropriation Bills, which will form part of the Budget for 1989-90, will have been enacted.</PARA>
<PARA> Supply Bill (No. 1) seeks appropriations totalling some $9,948 million for the ordinary annual services of the Government. This is $1,258 million, or about 14.5 per cent, greater than the equivalent amounts provided in the Supply Act (No. 1) 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> A significant part of the increase reflects commitments which have been approved by the Government, price and cost increases and exchange rate variations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for twelve public service pay periods as opposed to eleven pay periods provided in the corresponding Bill in 1988-89. The extra pay period adds approximately $250 million to Supply Bill (No. 1). </PARA>
<PARA> The running costs appropriations of departments have been amended to include an annotation under section 35 of the Audit Act 1901 which enables departments to retain all or part of the receipts they generate from certain activities funded out of running costs as agreed by Ministers and the Minister for Finance. This change is designed to enable the full benefits of user charging to be realised and to enhance asset management. </PARA>
<PARA> Two other changes to the running costs appropriations are reflected in Supply Bill (No. 1). </PARA>
<PARA> The incorporation into running costs of compensation and legal expenses premiums paid to Comcare, where these provisions are for Commonwealth employees. For 1989-90, residual (ie non-Commonwealth employers) compensation and legal expenses will remain in `other services' in Bill No. 1; and</PARA>
<PARA> Minor capital items individually costing less than $250,000 which are part of the normal continuing activities of departments will be funded from running costs Appropriations in Bill 1 (rather than Bill 2). Bill 2 will continue to provide for new policy and capital projects individually costing in excess of $250,000. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1989-90 each civil agency will have a property operating expenses item which will provide for services previously allocated to votes under the Department of Administrative Services. These services include rent on leased premises, repairs and fitout, contract cleaning and general office services. In addition, moneys previously allocated to Bill 2 for minor new works and acquisitions have been transferred to the property operating expenses item in Bill 1. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to emphasise that this Bill seeks interim provision only in respect of approved ongoing policies of the Government. It does not anticipate decisions to be taken in the 1989-90 Budget context for which provision will be sought in the appropriation Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> (14) That the foregoing provisions of this Resolution, so far as they are inconsistent with the Standing Orders, have effect notwithstanding anything contained in the Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA>This motion deals with the establishment of a select committee to examine paper pulp mills in Australia. Paper pulp mills will be very much on the Australian political and environmental agenda in the near future, as they have been in the recent past. What is happening, of course, is that the paper pulp producers in the Northern Hemisphere, having depleted their resource and having so aroused the ire of the populace that they are no longer able to operate there without environmental pollution controls, are coming to Australia to use our resources and our hitherto lax environmental laws to their advantage. These pulp mills are coming. There is no way they will stop coming. It is as if we are sitting in the middle of a railway track and a locomotive is coming at us with a big headlight, it is very apparent, and we are not doing anything about it. If we do not get off that track we will get run over by that locomotive. Politicians and society in general-but I suppose politicians more than most-look for simple solutions. They think that by merely making a statement about pulp mills the problem will go away. There is no such thing in the real world as a simple solution. Aiding and abetting the wish of a simple solution by the politicians is the media. The media also likes to simplify things. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a lot of confusion at the moment over pulp mills-what they mean, what they may produce in terms of wealth for this country and what the disadvantages are. There is so much confusion over this issue that as I stand here speaking I have not been told officially by either the Opposition or the Government what the outcome of this discussion will be. I do not know whether they are for this committee or against it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After the Tasmanian election, as Senator Haines says, and further down into the never-never. It has already been delayed far too much. This is an issue of very great importance and the Opposition is using it as a political football. I do not know what the Government's attitude is, although I suspect that it will not support this matter. I will go into the reasons why I think the Government will not support it a little later. There is a tremendous amount of confusion over pulp mills in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first issue which was raised was dioxins. I think we owe North Broken Hill Peko Ltd and Noranda Forest Inc. a great debt of gratitude for raising the issue as ineptly as they did. They actually did the nation a service because they focused the nation's attention on pulp mills. They were very ham- fisted and dictatorial in the way they did it, which is the way they operate. They forced the Gray Government to do backflips over their requirements and then they tried to force the Federal Government to do the same thing. I think that this points out the need for an inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government knew so little about pulp mills at the time that even though it wanted to give the go ahead to Noranda and North Broken Hill, it made it impossible for Noranda to go ahead because it set guidelines which Noranda could not possibly accept. The Government wishes to give the go ahead to a project, but because it knew so little about it, it actually squashed the project by asking Noranda to do what was technologically feasible and possible in terms of controlling effluent. Noranda could not afford to do that because if it produced a relatively environmentally pollution-free plant in Tasmania it would have to do so in Canada and it did not want to do that with its many mills in Canada. It wants to run them wide open at great detriment to the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The net result of all this is that there is a lot of confusion over what is an environmentally clean pulp mill. Somehow the argument runs that as long as it does not use chlorine bleaches it is clean. This is absolutely false. Chlorine, of course, does introduce a great number of pollutants into the environment. The dioxins which were discussed in the Wesley Vale issue are not the only things that a pulp mill produces. The kraft process which the Wesley Vale mill and many mills around the world use is a very old process which uses sulphate chemicals to break down the fibres of wood. It has great environmental problems. If honourable senators go to any pulp mill town in the northern hemisphere they will be immediately assaulted by the smell of sulphur in the air. The water and the air are polluted. Just having an unbleached paper mill is not the solution to the problem, but that is the way the argument seems to be running at the moment. There is an article in yesterday's Hobart Mercury entitled `Can do unbleached: ANM'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Australian Newsprint Mills at Boyer said it was able to supply all the Federal Government's needs for unbleached paper. </PARA>
<PARA> ANM's marketing manager, Mr Rocky Wells, said Boyer already made newsprint and other publication papers using pulps other than the chlorine-bleached chemical pulps used by most other papermakers. </PARA>
<PARA> Last Saturday the Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke, announced a feasibility study on an unbleached-paper mill-</PARA>
<PARA>unbleached, again-</PARA>
<PARA>with a promise that the Federal Government would switch to such paper. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Wells said the government could avoid using chlorine-bleached paper by using ANM's papers for many purposes including circulars. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With rubbish, as Senator Calvert says. ANM has killed the Derwent River with pollution, with its sludge. It has caused so much pollution that its stretch of the Derwent is almost devoid of healthy marine life. Merely having a mechanical process, as ANM does, does not necessarily produce a clean environment. So unbleached paper is not in itself the answer. Nevertheless, the opinion in the community seems to be that it is. An article headed `Company may build unbleached paper mill' in the Australian of 10 May 1989 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A private company considering building a paper mill at Grafton on the NSW north coast might produce unbleached paper, the NSW Parliament heard yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> The NSW Minister for Natural Resources, Mr Causley, said the company, Daishowa International- our friends from the south-east New South Wales forests; they want to expand into the northern part of the State-</PARA>
<PARA>had made it clear it would consider building an unbleached paper mill, and take pulp to Japan, if a bleached paper mill was unacceptable to local people.</PARA>
<PARA>There is now the impression that merely having an unbleached paper mill is the solution. Of course, it is not. Other problems are ignored and the select committee would cover them. I refer, for example, to problems with the resource itself. Is the resource available? Are the trees available? What about alternatives to trees? What about agricultural crops such as kino, hemp and other fibre crops? What about the use of recycling in pulp mills? These things are not covered by the simple minded pursuit of an unbleached mill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whatever turns you on, Senator. There is a Government reluctance to have this industry. I contacted the Minister for primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, over this and he said, `Oh, such an inquiry might jeopardise existing mills'. If it does, what is wrong with that? If these mills are operating in such a manner as to harm the environment, why should they not be jeopardised? Why should they not clean up as well?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We need environment friendly processes. The environment movement is not for closing down society and going out in the scrub, eating muesli and ignoring all the problems of employment and all that, as has been portrayed by the Opposition and some members of the Government. In fact, we do look for viable downstream processing of our trees, of all of our resources. There are ways to produce paper which are environmentally friendly. One way is by use of the thermo-mechanical processes which have been developed in Sweden. Thermo-mechanical processes are not new. Newsprint is always made this way. But as we can see from any newspaper, the paper is yellow and rather fuzzy. The Swedes have developed processes to make the paper suitable for the best quality paper, computer grade paper. This high grade paper can now be made with the thermo-mechanical process, using steam-brute force and ignorance, if you want, rather than chemicals-and bleaching with hydrogen peroxide which liberates no chloride into the atmosphere or into the water. </PARA>
<PARA> I have read accounts in the Australian press that our paper manufacturers say that this is impossible. Of course it is not impossible; it is done overseas. I note that the Government is sending experts overseas to look at this very thing. That is fine. But I reiterate that the Government does not really have its money where its mouth is if it is going to vote against the inquiry into the pulp mills. The Government has it about half right when it talks about the environmental pollution aspects of pulp mills. </PARA>
<PARA> The other issue, which they are not looking at, is the use of the resource. Thermal mechanical pulping uses half the number of trees as a chemical mill to produce the equivalent amount of paper. The Government has not mentioned this. I do not know if it intends to look at it, but it is a very important factor. The kraft process, the chemical process which these high-flying international paper companies are trying to foist off on Australia, is as dead as a dodo. Nobody is building kraft process mills anywhere in the world. Everybody is going to thermo-mechanical processes. This Government still seems ready to entertain the emplacement of kraft process mills. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know how the vote will go on this matter. I will learn very shortly from the Government and the Opposition. But I still have the very basic feeling that neither the Government nor the Opposition is taking this issue seriously enough. Our environment obviously is too important to be left in the hands of politicians. Our politicians are simply incapable of looking after our future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issues which this motion has raised are indeed important issues. I can assure Senator Sanders that the Opposition takes this matter seriously. For that reason I wish to indicate that we will be seeking to adjourn this debate for further consideration. At the conclusion of my speech Senator Reid will be moving that this matter be adjourned and that the resumption of the debate be made an order of the day for the first day of sitting in August. The purpose of our doing that is that the Government, as Senator Sanders has indicated, has now responded to some of the concerns about the impact of paper pulp mills in Australia by commissioning a team of experts from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) to travel to Scandinavia and, I believe, subsequently to Canada to undertake certain investigations on two matters. They will cover some of the technical standards dealing with paper pulp mills in terms of their environmental impact and also the team will examine the processes which are put in place for the development and approval of such proposals. Presumably they will be focusing, for example, on the operations of the Swedish Franchising Board arrangements where a series of well-established processes now provide for the analysis, public examination and environmental consideration of proposals. They provide a certainty, not of outcome but of process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has been critical of the uncertainty of process which has been involved in the series of decisions made about these issues, culminating in the decision which this Government announced not to approve the development of the Wesley Vale facility. There are significant issues, including the question of dioxin emission, the emissions other than dioxin from kraft mill operations and processes and the problems which are associated with unbleached pulp production in terms of both the alternatives to the way in which we currently produce paper and paper products and the availability of resources to establish new mills. It is certainly also true that on both sides of the argument there is a commitment to try to do something about producing a greater value added component in our forestry industry and forest products industry. The consequences of the $1.6 billion annual deficit in forest products are something taken seriously by everybody in terms of both their economic impact and the necessary integration of these with proper environmental standards and requirements. Therefore I do not want to go into the specific details of the issues which such an inquiry could address other than to repeat that the matters which Senator Sanders and others have raised are taken very seriously by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> We indicated at an early stage our general support for the examination of these matters. We indicated, in a press statement which I issued on 21 March, our general support for an inquiry into establishing the facts of these matters. On 6 April, together with Mr Howard, I put out a statement which indicated that we wanted to examine this matter in the light of the Government's response to calls that had been widely made for the publication of development guidelines, both in terms of technical standards and in terms of processes for evaluating pulp mill proposals. We said we would be interested to see that information no later than 2 May. On 2 May Senator Button, Mr Kerin and Senator Richardson issued a joint statement in which they announced the establishment and dispatch of the CSIRO mission to which I have referred. That press statement said:</PARA>
<PARA>A report on technical issues will be provided as soon as possible and not later than June 30. </PARA>
<PARA>We believe it is necessary to see that report before this matter is finally determined by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Sanders has indicated the importance of sending this mission overseas. He described it as `fine'; I think that was his word. We believe that the information which will be gained by that inquiry needs to be part of the public record and debate. If that leads to adequate satisfaction of the technical issues which have been raised, and if it leads to the adequate establishment of guidelines in terms of processes, which is the other part of the equation with which the Opposition is particularly concerned, then we will be able to determine whether or not a further inquiry is necessary. We are not in a position to make that determination at this stage, and it is for that reason-in order to have the CSIRO report available to us-that we are seeking to have this matter put off until the first sitting day after 30 June, which happens to be the first sitting day of the Budget session. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments deal with the recommendation of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation concerning the composition of the panel and the relationship between full time and part time members. The Committee heard a great deal of evidence in regard to this matter and, as that is contained in its report, I do not intend to rehearse those arguments again. Extremely strong support was provided by the Chairman of the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) for the continuation of the notion of members' part time involvement. On a number of occasions he made it very clear in his evidence that those part time members had played a most valuable role in the Commission's operations in linking the Commission to the business world. Those part time members had brought an enormous amount of expertise and day to day practical advice which enhanced the Commission's task far more than would have been the case if those people who had been employed were detached from or were outside the mainstream of the business community. That very strong endorsement from the Chairman of the NCSC and other evidence that was taken by the Committee led the Committee to recommend unanimously in favour of the continuation of the majority of members of the Commission as part time members. These amendments would implement that recommendation of the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government opposes the amendments moved by the Australian Democrats in regard to this recommendation. However, we accept the thrust of the Committee's proposal that the Australian Securities Commission has access to input from expert business opinion as this is vital for the viable operation of the ASC. However, we do not accept this amendment and we ask honourable senators to take into account other changes that were recommended by the Committee to meet the policy objectives. Clause 9 of the proposed legislation is identical to the NCSC Act in that it provides that the ASC will consist of between three and eight members, at least three of whom will be appointed full time. This proposal in the ASC legislation does not deviate from the current system where, at the moment, five part time members are appointed in the structure. However, recognising the need for expert business opinion and for flexibility to be inherent in the legislation, the Government believes that the Committee's intention will be partly met by three-year terms for full time members of the ASC-members with a high level of business and market expertise. This shorter term should go some way towards meeting the objective of having people with experience in the commercial sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Briefly, the other problem that arises, which honourable senators should take into account, is that the Government also recognises that whereas, on the one hand, part time members are important, on the other hand, it is vitally important to have people who will devote their full time attention to the job at hand. That is important not only in terms of their input but also in terms of their oversight of the bureaucracy. The Government also recognises that, in terms of full time appointments as opposed to part time appointments, there is some merit in having full time members who are detached from the day to day operations of business activities which may be subject to the operations of the ASC. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, we support the rationale behind the recommendation, but we believe that we need flexibility and our proposals will accommodate the need for commercial expertise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Briefly, obviously we have considered this matter carefully and, on reflection, we have decided to support the Government's position. By doing so, we are not in any way indicating that we are not supportive of part time members; in fact, we are, but we think there is sufficient scope within the existing legislation to allow for that. The existing section states that there should be not fewer than three or more than eight members and that at least three of the members should be appointed as full time members. So there is scope in the existing provision for possibly five part time members. On that basis we do not think it is necessary to write into law the constraint that was recommended by the Committee. We think that the provision that exists at the moment can meet the spirit of the Committee's recommendation without the strictures that would be provided by the amendments moved by the Australian Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>This was a matter of continuing discussion yesterday. Our drafting differed somewhat from that on which the Government had advice. We were happy to concede to the Government's drafting in this matter in that it was more elegant than our own. However, the intent is the same-that is, that the Commission would be provided with power to make recommendations to the Minister but it would not be obliged to do so. In other words, there is no intent in this amendment to require the Commission to spend any money or consider it part of its statutory functions to have to make recommendations. This amendment would provide the Commission with the ability to make a recommendation if it wanted to do so. At the lowest level that makes clear what the Commission wants-that is, to have the ability to talk to the Minister about some matter that it may feel deeply about without necessarily going to the Advisory Committee. It seems to us that there are no problems with that. This amendment addresses the problem that the Government put up-that the Commission would have to spend money analysing policy which, quite rightly, is the function of the Advisory Committee. We do not want the Commission to be doing that. Clearly, the intent of this amendment is merely to allow the Commission, if it wishes, to speak to the Minister about a matter without going to the Advisory Committee. We believe that it is not likely that this would occur frequently, particularly because of the Government's intention to put a member of the Commission on the Advisory Committee. We certainly endorse that second position of the Minister, and we feel that this would fill out the powers of the Commission. We see no sensible reason why the Commission, if it feels deeply about some matter, should not be able to talk directly to the Minister or give advice and direction to the Minister on any matter that it desires under section 148. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I have two amendments, Nos 7 and 8, rather than amendments Nos 6 and 7 as listed, to proposed amendment No. 7. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (7) Page 3, proposed subsection 230fc (2), leave out the proposed subsection.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Page 3, proposed section 230fd, leave out the proposed section. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not sure that these amendments need to be debated at length. It is fortuitous that both the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) and Senator Hill are as familiar as I am with the proposition governing this area, because a similar problem arose in the interpretation of the law with regard to the establishment of the parliamentary committee which dealt with the National Crimes Authority (NCA). </PARA>
<PARA> Undoubtedly, in terms of the drafting provided by the Government, proposed section 230fc (2) and proposed section 230fd were both included in an abundance of caution or an abundance of something else. Whatever it was, a little of the history of the NCA committee would have rapidly disabused the minds of those who put them in of the problem that they perceived to be existing, which is not there, that is, that the parliamentary committee in no way will seek to inhibit, prevent or get in the way of the legitimate operation of the Commission, the panel or the disciplinary board. The role of the parliamentary committee will, in fact, be far more a supportive mechanism, an investigatory mechanism, so that it can report to Parliament on whether or not any changes in the law should occur. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty with the way this is drafted is that it says that it is not allowed to investigate a matter-again both the Minister and Senator Hill know it depends on what is meant by `investigate'-that has been investigated or is to be investigated or is about to be considered or has been considered or is being considered. It is also stated that there can be no reconsideration of an act, an omission, a decision or a finding. The NCA committee soon found that, if that is interpreted literally, all the committee can do is actually meet. It could not actually do anything that would be of any use to the Parliament. Our parliamentary committees will, in future, be as responsible as they have been in the past. There is no need for proposed section 230fc (2) because it is restrictive in a way that could render the work of the Committee totally ineffective. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, section 230fd is a most extraordinary proposition. It says that the fact that the parliamentary committee has found a fact or matter to exist is not evidence of that fact or matter. As it has never been evidence of a fact or matter under any rules of evidence I do not know why that is there. It could have application to a tribunal not bound by the rules of evidence but, quite frankly, it is highly unlikely that any tribunal could admit as evidence a finding of fact by a parliamentary committee. </PARA>
<PARA> My real concern about 230fd is paragraph (b). I have served on the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege and hence have a continuing interest in this matter. I was the person in this place who made the suggestion that we should break the log jam on this matter by getting the Presiding Officers to introduce the Parliamentary Privileges Bill, which they eventually did. I believe that 230fd (b) could be a very dangerous proposition. It is not something of minor concern but rather it is something that is very dangerous to the Parliament. It seeks to prohibit something that section 16 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 already does. The difficulty is that section 16 defines the proceedings in Parliament to include a report of a parliamentary committee, hence it is relevant to this, and prohibits the admission of evidence concerning proceedings in Parliament for the purpose of, amongst other things, drawing, or inviting the drawing of, inferences or conclusions from those proceedings in Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from any new provisions being redundant because the matter is already covered, the view could be taken in subsequent litigation that, because the Parliament had passed that new provision, it had made some interpretation of section 16. One interpretation could be that the Parliament did not intend section 16 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act to prohibit the admission of evidence concerning a finding by a parliamentary committee. Those people who were involved in the privileges legislation know how crucial section 16 is to us. Some court findings prompted this Parliament finally to take action. An interpretation of what proceedings of the Parliament or its committees can or cannot be admitted in a court is vitally important for our freedom as parliamentarians so that we can act in a way we believe is proper and in the general interest. That freedom should not be circumscribed in any fashion by any court. </PARA>
<PARA> To go down the path suggested here with, as it were, a throw-away line in the legislation now before us could be quite dangerous. The Parliament should not contemplate for an instant the passage of legislation which brings into doubt some part of the Parliamentary Privileges Act which was passed by this place, after 87 years of federation, with a great deal of blood, sweat and tears. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Macklin was right when he said that he and I, together with Senator Hill, had served on the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority and had been able to experience first hand some of the frustrations on that Committee. In opposing, at least, the deletion of proposed subsection 230fc (2), I would like to say that I have also served on other parliamentary committees that have gone out of control because there was no restraint on their role of investigation. I am sure that Senator Hill can remember one or two committees that investigated matters that were at the same time under investigation by law enforcement officers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, it is very fair to say that the Government position is that we support the idea of a parliamentary committee with a viable function. But we are concerned, particularly if subclause 230fc (2) is deleted, that a number of problems would emanate. If one looks at paragraphs (a) and (b) of that particular subclause one will find a prohibition on the committee to:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . investigate a matter that the Commission . . . or that the Panel or Disciplinary Board . . . is considering. </PARA>
<PARA>Those two paragraphs are basically intended by the Government to ensure that the parliamentary Committee does not interfere with current investigative or deliberative activities of the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) or the Corporations and Securities Panel and so on. I would be surprised to hear anyone in this place disagreeing with that proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (c) is also important in that it ensures that the proposed parliamentary Committee does not function as an alternative avenue of appeal against decisions of the Panel or the ASC. In principle, members of parliament would agree that they would not want a parliamentary Committee to be seen as an avenue of appeal in cases that have been adjudicated or deliberated upon. Having accepted those two particular principles and the fact that even Senator Macklin acknowledged that he does not think the parliamentary Committee would interfere with current investigations or deliberations or would be seen as an alternative avenue of appeal, for us not to agree to these particular provisions may leave the intention of the Parliament blurred to the extent that a committee may in the future see itself as having an open charter. We think there are inherent dangers in not retaining sub-clause 230fc (2). As a consequence, we oppose the Democrats' amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Liberal Party had circulated an amendment in similar terms to the first of these amendments but the Chairman chose to call the Australian Democrats first. It will not, therefore, surprise the chamber that, as our amendment is in exactly the same terms, we will now be supporting the Australian Democrats' amendment. Although we did not have an amendment with regard to the second, we nevertheless will support that also. If I had spoken first I would have said very much the same things as Senator Macklin said in support of his amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the first amendment, the Government is unduly worried about the operations of this parliamentary Committee, unlike apparently the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) since he has assumed his higher role. It is my view that parliamentary committees act responsibly. There is no reason to believe that this Committee would do other than act responsibly. There can be no concern in relation to the second of the committee's duties as set out in the legislation, that is, to inquire into and report to both Houses on the operation of any national scheme law. </PARA>
<PARA> I presume that that duty is not an area of concern to the Minister. So the area of concern must be the first of its duties, which is to inquire into and report to both Houses on activities of the Australian Securities Commission or the Corporations and Securities Panel, or matters connected with such activity, to which, in the parliamentary Committee's opinion, the Parliament's attention should be directed. The Committee is charged, where necessary, to inquire into and report on the activities of the Commission or the Panel, or matters connected with such activity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister says that we need to incorporate within the legislation specific prohibitions on the Committee, in effect meddling with investigations being carried on by the Commission or the Panel. That seems to me to be unnecessary. The terms of duties suggest that the Committee is not interested in the detail of the investigation or in second guessing the work of those two bodies. Its responsibility is basically to report to and advise the Houses if problems are developing in relation to the operation of the Commission or the Panel. It seems to the Opposition, therefore, that it is unnecessary to add these restrictions that the Government has sought to add by its subsection (2). One can even envisage situations where it could significantly inhibit the work of the Committee in areas in which I would not have thought the Government had any concerns. Although a matter may be current, some investigations by the Commission or the Panel may last for a very long time and include within them many individual matters. In relation to one of those individual matters there may be some abuse of natural justice or some concern by an individual as to whether reasonable rights are being afforded. The Committee may well receive representations from that individual. On the Government's restrictive wording it would mean that the Committee could not address those specific concerns until the investigation had been completed, which might be a year or two later. </PARA>
<PARA> We therefore oppose the restrictive wording, but we do so not in any way envisaging that the parliamentary Committee will abuse the responsibilities that are given to it under this charter. It is included as a safeguard for the benefit of all who are subjected to this legislation-that is, the total community. We would like to see the parliamentary Committee given the widest possible powers to meet the responsibility as set out under the heading `Duties' in this particular clause. We therefore would support the Democrats in this instance in relation to both their amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to be seen as teaching the Minister for Consumer Affairs or Senator Hill how to suck eggs because I think that their skills in counting numbers are much more honed than mine, as they have to use them far more often. If the Minister looks at amendment No. 2 in proposed new section 230fa, he will notice that the structure of the Committee is 10 members, five from the Senate and five from the House of Representatives. By definition, if an alternative majority in the Senate appointed five non-government senators, the Government, which controls the House of Representatives, could retaliate by appointing five members of its own Party from the House of Representatives. Therefore there would be a break-even number and the Committee would be unable to function at all. The government of the day ought have no concerns that the Committee will get out of control. I think that that type of number exercise would never have to be used but ultimately, if it actually makes anybody feel any better, it is fairly obvious that the Committee will be working within the constraints of the parliamentary majorities which are available.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While discussion is going on, I make a contribution on this point. The Joint Select Committee of Corporations Legislation, in terms of tracing beneficial ownership, made a recommendation that would allow the continuation of the status quo. The problem, however, with the continuation of the status quo is fairly obvious. A company can be in receipt of a notice to provide the requisite registers and listings of ownership, without any cost being provided by the person who asked for that information. Over time, a number of companies as a matter of course each day asked for these ongoing exercises to be undertaken by some other company at that other company's expense. Prior to the consideration, I indicated that if the Opposition were minded to move that amendment, the Australian Democrats would support it. It is my understanding that in subsequent discussions the notion of trying to trace beneficial ownership-that is, the current context-might be modified by putting in a fee structure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If there is a fee structure, it is thought that at least companies will be mindful that they are paying the costs rather than the persons doing the search. The hope flowing from that, I suppose, is that the amount of paperwork might be materially reduced. On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I indicate that that approach would certainly also have our support. I hope that Senator Hill and the Minister have come to an agreement along those lines. I have not been privy to that discussion, but any such agreement was made after the early discussions we had on this matter. If that is the approach that it is proposed to take, I indicate that it would have our support. </PARA>
<PARA> The approach could not be objected to by industry. As all parties are aware, there is a split in industry on this matter. If industry has in one way or another to meet these payments, it is obvious as a matter of fairness and justice that the people who are seeking the information should meet them. There is one other item in this area, in that the existing Commission has the power to trace beneficial ownership at the request of a company. I assume that it is proposed that that remain, because undoubtedly that is another avenue and one which, as the Government in previous debates has rightly pointed out, would probably also remove most of the abuses. With both of those in tow, I would have thought that a mechanism of payment, while still allowing a company to undertake a search on its own cognisance, would probably be the optimal way to go and would be a reasonable and effective compromise, considering the contending interests in this area. I hope that is the type of amendment that is now being proposed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I foreshadow that I will move certain amendments as a substitute for Government Nos. 19 to 29. Much of them is common. What is not common is the capacity for a corporation to search, and the difference that has been negotiated by the Government, the Australian Democrats and us is to include the safeguard of a fee. In other words, obviously we are all looking for a reasonable solution to this matter. Certainly the Australian Democrats and the Opposition have the view that there should be a right of search. On the other hand, we recognise that that can be abused and we want a mechanism to avoid abuse. The mechanism which seemed to us most sensible was a fee basis. There are other alternatives, such as including a specified number of shares, a specified percentage of shares, or a specified percentage of the capital of a company, all of which we thought were less satisfactory than simply allowing for a fee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fee would be prescribed by regulation and payable to the company that meets the requirement, the idea being that therefore the company that has to provide the information is recompensed for at least a reasonable proportion of its costs in doing so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is mindful that the Corporations Bill before the Committee limits the power of companies to trace beneficial ownership. However, we have proposed an amendment to provide that the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) has the capacity to do that on the payment of a prescribed fee and when it is not of the view that it is unreasonable to request the person to whom a notice may be addressed to respond to those matters. Essentially, the Government is concerned about this abuse of the system. Such abuse quite often means that a great degree of expense is incurred by corporations and also often means obtaining strategically important information, beneficial only to a board of directors rather than corporate interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government, recognising the will of the Senate, also recognises that one important mechanism in terms of curtailing abuse will be the provision that a requesting party pay a prescribed fee in order to get that particular corporation to trace beneficial ownership and, as such, sees the Liberal amendment as much more positive with the fee than without it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand it, we are talking about the tracing provisions and the changes that are being proposed to what is, in effect, section 261 of the old Companies Act. So far as I can see, I really do not understand the reasons for the changes that are being proposed by the Government to that tracing provision, having lived some time in the corporate world myself. I would say that the ability of a company itself to initiate a trace rather than having to work through any third party-in this case, the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) or the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) poses very considerable constraints on the company. I do not understand the reasons for that requirement. It is possible, I guess, that the tracing provisions can be abused in terms of overuse. On the other hand, there is nothing more important to a company than its ability to know as of right who are its main shareholders and which significant transactions are taking place at any particular time on its register.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The effect of the Government's proposals, as I understand them, is to prevent the company from doing that, to take away what I think is a quite fundamental right of a company. The question of fees for tracing, matters pertaining to that and other provisions possibly required to prevent abuse of the procedure are matters which may well require looking at but I do not understand why the change of the quite significant nature that is being proposed is necessary in order to deal with those other points. I seek clarification from the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) as to what specifically are the reasons why a company should not be able directly to request a trace of its shareholding and significant changes in its shareholding. It takes away a quite fundamental right that a company should have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just briefly in response to Senator Short, I think honourable senators should be mindful of the fact that the Government has had somewhat unanimous representation from the business community in respect to this proposal.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us say that the representations made to us have been unanimous. The concern has been that even a minor movement of shares-as I said, movement which could be a daily movement-has led to some particular players on the field sending out daily notices seeking information, information which has been quite costly to the corporate sector to produce. That is why the Government did propose the mechanism of having the ASC to vet, basically as a safety valve matter. If one looks at the Government's proposal, it is a pretty broad one. The ASC would give permission but would deny permission in circumstances where a test of unreasonability would come into it. We see that sort of mechanism as providing us with a pressure valve to protect efficiency in the corporate sector from misuse and abuse of this access or this right to seek beneficial ownership.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) for that answer. It does not fully satisfy me because I would have thought that the overwhelming majority of companies that do resort to section 261 action do so because they are genuinely concerned about the state of their register and what is taking place on it. Whilst I understand that there perhaps has been some overuse, as distinct from abuse, of the system, I would be interested to have some quantification of the degree to which that problem has arisen. I would also be interested to know why the process of charging a reasonable fee for the action to proceed would not be a suitable alternative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would also like to know what delay will be involved in the tracing procedure through the Government's proposal having to work through the Australian Securities Commission (ASC). One of the essences of the rapidly moving situation in relation to changes in share ownership is that speed is quite essential. If there is going to be a delay, even a matter of 24 hours, in the sorts of situations that we can be contemplating it can be very significant. I would have thought that it was most unlikely that the Commission would be able, with a snap of the fingers, to give a yes or no as to the acceptability of the application. If it is going to be that brief, that raises a very significant question as to whether the monitoring role would serve any practically useful purpose at all. There are two or three things there that I think require clarification. I would welcome such clarification. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again, just briefly, in terms of quantification I think I should say to Senator Short that if information is available on that I will endeavour to provide it for him. I also ask him to take into account the actual details of the Government's proposal. It has been on the public record for 12 months now. During that time there has been only one representation that has queried it. Others have been totally in support. The proposal is not anything other than to prevent unreasonable requests. I anticipate that in terms of processing requests there would be a routine mechanism set up. The proposal that the Government has put up and which is supported by the business sector is one that, as I have said before, would act as a safety valve in that small number of circumstances. I agree that on the whole we are talking about an activity which is a genuine and healthy one but there has been concern expressed, as I said, by the corporate sector that there is a need for that safety valve. In terms of the fee proposal, suffice it to say, as Senator Hill has said as well, that in discussions we found the fee proposal a useful mechanism as well.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> This is the debate with which honourable senators will be very familiar, Mr Chairman. It deals with the question of whether inquiries into unacceptable conduct should be conducted by the Panel as distinct and separate from the Australian Securities Commission (ASC). I understand the sequence of events in relation to this matter, according to the provisions of clause 733 of the Corporations Bill, is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Where it appears to the Commission that unacceptable circumstances have, or may have, occurred:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) in relation to an acquisition of shares in a company; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) as a result of conduct engaged in by a person in relation to shares in, or the affairs of, a company;</PARA>
<PARA>the Commission may apply to the Corporations and Securities Panel for a declaration . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provided that the responsibility for making the declaration be passed to the Panel. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations of the Joint Select Committee, as I read them, were to the contrary; that the power should stay with the ASC in much the same way that currently power is exercised by the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC). The next step in the sequence is that the Government wishes to maintain the position as set out in the Bill, in other words, that the responsibility be passed to the Panel. The Opposition, on the other hand, supports the position that was determined by the Joint Select Committee. In other words, we say that the ASC should have that responsibility. We principally adopt the arguments that were put in favour of this position by the Joint Select Committee. This whole sequence of amendments, therefore, is to adopt the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee of this Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> The principal reason for the Committee reaching this conclusion, as I read it, was the experience of the NCSC. This is a power that the NCSC clearly regards as necessary in order for it to meet its responsibilities in a timely way. Certainly as far as that body-the principal policing body in corporate law in this country-is concerned, there was no justification to pass the responsibility to a separate and distinct panel. There are all sorts of arguments that one can develop about the nature of the Panel, and whether it is composed of those who are most suited to reach these determinations, but I do not think it is necessary for me to press those arguments. Rather, I simply rely upon past experience, which is that the system works well with the NCSC exercising the function and, therefore, the case has not been made out for a transfer of that responsibility to a separate and distinct panel. Therefore, I move these amendments to put into effect the recommendation of the Joint Select Committee in this regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was no disagreement in the Joint Select Committee's report on the Corporations Bill-apart from the general philosophical issues which were debated during the second reading stage, where there was obviously a division within the Committee-on the technical issues, which are the substance of the report, except with regard to one particular item, and that is the item we are discussing today. As a member of that Committee I signed a minority report, along with Senator Alston, Senator Cooney, Senator McMullan and Mr Kerr from the House of Representatives. Essentially, it reflects a divided view as to how best to have the organisations function.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's original Bill was based on the premise of the division of power between the Commission and the Panel. That, for most of our inquiries, seemed to be a reasonable premise. However, in the dying days of the Committee's inquiry a spirited intervention took place by the Chairman of the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) in defence of the position that he and the Commission had been arguing for some time-that they should be able to retain the power to make declarations of unacceptable conduct. </PARA>
<PARA> I had rehearsed those arguments myself for quite some time, and I must admit there is some substance to the propositions on both sides. That is why the Committee divided as it did-not along party lines, but on the basis of the evidence that was presented to us. In the final analysis my position-which is now, I am pleased to say, the position of my Party-on this particular item is that we stay with the minority report which I co-signed. The most compelling reason that I had for this is that I find that the structure proposed by the Government ought to be given a chance to work. I am attracted to the notion of some hiatus between the body which is doing the investigation and the body which makes those types of declarations. </PARA>
<PARA> We used the analogy, in the minority report, of a judge and jury. Of course, it is an analogy and it does not quite hold with regard to this matter. In any event, it gives the feeling of a distinct unease that many businesses have that the Commission should have all those powers. </PARA>
<PARA> My position was further strengthened by the acceptance by the Government of the notion of having a full time operator as President of the Panel. After all, one has to take very seriously any point concerning practical work put by the NCSC, since it is the only body which actually has any practical experience of the day to day operations of regulations in this country at that level. Taking its point seriously, I think it is met by the notion that the Chair will be available at all times so that there can be rapid intervention and movement along the lines that the Commission indicated was most desirable.</PARA>
<PARA> The last point I wish to make with regard to this is that I believe that the ability of the new Australian Securities Commission (ASC), which will take over the role of the NCSC, to make the public generally aware of its activities would be an excessively powerful weapon. I am not at all sure that many companies would relish the thought of being publicly hauled off to the ASC. Hence, I think that the NCSC somewhat understates the power that the new ASC will have of actually sending somebody to the Panel. In many ways that could very well look like the first step towards getting hung. Or, to use a court analogy, to be indicted on a charge of murder would be a pretty drastic first step to come from a magistrate's court. If that happens, one really feels that one is moving into much deeper water. The fact that the Commission is the body referring to the Panel will have a very powerful and salutary effect on business, so business, I am quite sure, will cooperate with the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> We must bear in mind that the power to make unacceptable declarations has been used sparsely, but the fact that such declarations can be made has enabled the Commission to bring together many commercial settlements. That power to refer to the Panel will enable the Commission still to make those commercial settlements. In view of those matters, I believe that the Government's general structure should be given a chance to work and, therefore, I indicate that the Australian Democrats will not be supporting the Opposition's amendments to restructure that organisation. </PARA>

The only niggling concern at the back of my mind is that the NCSC's practical experience leans in the other direction and that it was upon the basis of that experience that the majority of the Committee finally made their decision. It worries me that we are running counter to that practical experience of the NCSC. Hence I believe it is important that both the advisory council and the parliamentary committee make sure that they look at this issue as a matter of priority and keep it under very close supervision. It may be one of the first items that have to come back on board for discussion. The fact that on this matter the Committee split along non-party lines also indicates that it is a matter upon which people, according to the weight of the evidence, can differ. For that reason also it is important that it be one of the major items kept under close supervision.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Senator Hill's amendment to the effect that the declaration of unacceptable conduct should be left with the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) rather than vested in the Panel. I agree with many of Senator Macklin's comments. On this matter the Committee was divided 5-5-down the middle-along non-party lines. Members took different views according to the weight of the evidence available. I was one of the majority who supported the amendment that Senator Hill has moved on behalf of the Opposition. I did so partly for the reasons that Senator Macklin gave in expressing his view on some of the amendments. My judgment was very heavily influenced by the views of the people who have had the most direct involvement in this matter over the last few years-the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The argument that was put to the Joint Select Committee was that the role of the ASC is going to be significantly lessened relative to the existing NCSC role, and that that weakening will have a quite detrimental effect on the ability of the Commission to conduct its investigatory and related activities. At this time, it is essential that we in this country do nothing to diminish investor confidence, but I believe that that is what will happen if the perceived role, as well as the actual role, of the major investigatory body-namely, the Australian Securities Commission-is weakened. That would be detrimental. Given the significance that the NCSC's staff and chairman attached to this matter, and given their view that there would really be a major weakening of its role as perceived by the business, financial and securities industry if the power to make the declaration of unacceptable conduct were removed from the Commission, I agreed with the NCSC position. That position, of course, is reflected in the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> Arguments to the contrary have been put forward, and they are contained in the report of the Joint Select Committee. I should like to quote two of the relevant paragraphs of that report in order to get them on the record in Hansard because they are important in that they sum up the reason the Joint Select Committee and the Opposition have taken the view that they have taken. The paragraphs are 13.74 and 13.75, on page 163. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>13.74 The thrust of the submissions made to the Committee by the NCSC, both in writing and in evidence, in relation to the ASCs powers when compared to the NCSC, was to the effect that the powers given to the ASC by the Bill were so limited when compared to the NCSC powers that they would seriously erode investor protection. In this regard the NCSC recommended to the Committee that it should consider extending the power to make a declaration under Clause 733 (of unacceptable conduct) to the ASC and remove it from the powers to be given to the Panel. </PARA>
<PARA>13.75 This is a view with which the Committee agrees. The provisions in the Corporations Bill are intended to allow the ASC powers of investigation of matters which arise in the course of takeover activities. The Committee observes that the principles of unacceptable conduct are the same as those in the present CASA legislation. The NCSC's argument that existing power of investigation and adjudication on declarations of unacceptable conduct amount to a more effective form of regulation of market conduct, by integration of litigation and investigation, has persuaded the Committee that the power to make a declaration should be vested in the ASC and not in the Panel. The Committee finds it desirable that the ASC not only have an investigatory role, but also the role of deciding what is unacceptable and that the Panel should have the role of reviewing the declaration and of deciding whether and what orders should be made. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a view to which I subscribe completely. It encapsulates very succinctly the arguments for the Opposition's amendment, and I commend the amendment to the chamber. If it is not passed, this matter, as Senator Macklin has said, should be reviewed at a early date. It should be monitored very carefully by the new parliamentary committee which hopefully will be established. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the Minister sums up I wish briefly to respond to the comments made by Senator Short which I think accurately and correctly reflected the views of what has been called the majority of the Committee, although the Committee split evenly, five all, on this contentious matter. The report that has become known as the `majority report' is the one which was carried with the casting vote of the Chairman. I share the views expressed by Senator Macklin which I think cover most of the points which need to be raised on this matter and which motivated the five dissenting members of the Committee to their view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think we all understand the position of the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) from the material that it put before us. It regards its capacity to make declarations of unacceptable conduct as a power which it has used very effectively in the regulation of market conduct. Therefore, it sees the loss of that power to make declarations as preventing the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) from operating in that area in which the NCSC has been so effective. Contrary to the other very useful advice which the NCSC gave to the Committee and to the Government, which is reflected in many of these amendments, I think that in this instance the NCSC has misunderstood some of the factors which will make effective the Government's proposal which is incorporated in the Bill and which will continue to operate if the amendments are rejected. As I recall it, the NCSC, in the course of its evidence to the Committee, made it clear that one of the powers that made its declarations such a powerful deterrent was that they would lead to a public exposition of the activities of the company in question. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, in its response to the Committee's report-which I do not think was in any doubt-makes it explicit that the ASC will have the power to publicise the terms of a reference of unacceptable conduct to the Panel. I think this will prove to be a very powerful deterrent. Time will tell. I will not take up the time of the Committee by reiterating the comments made by Senator Macklin and Senator Short about the need for a continuing review. But I am very confident that that publicity power will be very effective. It is inconceivable that any company would be uninfluenced by the prospect of being referred, by the ASC, to the Panel on the grounds of an allegation of unacceptable conduct. Such diminution of power as there might be, which I would regard as probably minor, would not overcome the fundamental objection of giving the same body the right to be the prosecutor and the jury when other equally effective and convenient alternative mechanisms were available. </PARA>
<PARA> There seems to be a bit of confusion concerning commercial settlements. Neither in theory nor in practice do I see any way in which this provision will inhibit the capacity or effectiveness of the ASC in pursuing commercial settlements-in having the leverage to persuade people to enter a commercial settlement-any more than those provisions which currently prevail in the NCSC. I believe that the dissenting report of the five members of the Select Committee with respect to declarations of unacceptable conduct is the appropriate position. I support the Government's judgment to accept that position and I welcome its decision. Accordingly, I oppose the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McMullan is right. The Government is not convinced that the ASC should have the power to make declarations of unacceptable acquisitions or conduct. Basically, we believe that it is important to separate the investigation and adjudication functions. I think that separation is far more important than having, within the ASC, the weapon of declaratory power. We recognise-and this point has been made by the NCSC and others to the Joint Select Committee (JSC) on Corporations Legislation-that, in these circumstances, timing is extremely important. We believe that allowing the ASC to go public with its applications to the Panel would be tantamount to the ASC announcing that it would be investigating, seeking a declaration, or embarking upon a process which would lead to a declaration. The effect would be the same. The ASC would be able to publish-the NCSC has suggested that it would want to make public-its intention to embark on investigations in this area. We think that its capacity to go public, in addition to the fact that it will make an application, is a very useful mechanism to ensure that the question of timing is accommodated. Accordingly, with that very important requirement that we wish to separate adjudication from investigation, we do not support the Opposition's amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In discussing those amendments, I should say that there are a couple of curious incidental by-products. Under current legislation I notice that the time period during which a declaration may be made is 90 days. The Opposition's amendments extend that to 180 days but, in doing so, they do not take into account the mechanism proposed by the JSC which is embodied in the current legislation-that is, that the time period be 60 days, but with the Panel having a further 30 days to make its decision. The other part of the JSC mechanism-which is also not embodied in the Opposition's amendments-is a provision for an extension of time. Under our provisions, pursuant to clause 737 of the legislation, the time can be extended either by the Panel or by the Panel after a request from a particular court. The other curious thing in the Opposition's amendments is that even though this function has been deleted from the Panel, the amendments do not do away with the Panel altogether. So we could well finish up with a full time chairman of a panel which has no functions to perform. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This might be an opportune time for me to explain why we will not press our amendment No. 7. That amendment deals with matters arising out of recommendation No. 31 in the report of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation. Pursuant to that recommendation, our proposed amendment was to include a provision that, where the National Companies and Securities Commission (NSCS) does not make a declaration under subsection 3-I should say that we referred to the Commission because we were optimistically expecting a substantive amendment to be passed and the Commission would be making these decisions rather than the Panel-it may arrange a commercial settlement and, where it makes a commercial settlement, it may cause the terms of that commercial settlement to be published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette. As I have said, that picks up recommendation 31 of the series of recommendations of the Joint Select Committee which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The committee recommends that the ASC have the ability to publish any declarations of unacceptable conduct and referrals to the Corporations and Securities Panel. </PARA>
<PARA>That recommendation should be read in conjunction with the previous recommendation, which deals with commercial settlements and which reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The committee recommends that the Government review the terms of the legislation to ensure that the Bill provides the ASC with the power to effect commercial settlements in matters involving unacceptable conduct proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA>We have decided not to press our amendment. On reflection, we feel that the matter requires further and more detailed consideration. Mr Chairman, you will be aware that, under the existing legislation, the whole area of commercial settlements under the operation of the NCSC is one of the most vexed areas of practice of that body. It is an area which I have had cause to criticise on other occasions in this place because commercial settlements often effected in private have not given those who follow the law information about whether breaches have occurred and, therefore, have failed to provide desirable precedents for the efficient functioning of the law in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been a process which, in many ways, has aroused suspicion and concern and has been criticised on the basis that the NCSC has had a responsibility to investigate matters and determine whether there has been a breach of the law and to act accordingly. On a commercial settlement being reached we, the public, are simply unaware of the basis upon which that settlement was reached. </PARA>
<PARA> The NCSC has argued before Senate committees and in the Estimates that there is little alternative, because of the budgetary restraints under which it has had to operate under this Government. Also, there has been little alternative because of the volume of work that it has had to process under pressure where commercial matters have had to be resolved in the shortest possible time. I guess that, more positively, it is argued that the option of a commercial settlement can, in some circumstances, effect the best resolution of a problem in ways that allow the corporations concerned to get on with their business; in other words, a settlement of the problem has been reached that has commercial reality and may be, in all the circumstances, the best resolution to a problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition acknowledges that these arguments exist. We think that the whole area requires further consideration. We note that the terms of the Bill are similar to those in the existing legislation in that the receipts for commercial settlements are not spelt out. I think that Senator Macklin is correct and that there is still plenty of scope under this legislation to effect commercial settlements, but nothing sets out in what circumstances that can be achieved and the basis or information upon which the new panel can, in this instance, make such a decision. Furthermore, as the Committee has set out, there is nothing therefore that requires that either the basis of the commercial settlement or the commercial settlement itself be publicised. </PARA>
<PARA> In all the circumstances, bearing in mind the importance of this area, its complexity and the precedents, which some of us have considered to be unsatisfactory and for which others have argued positively in the past, we believe that this is an appropriate question to be referred to the new parliamentary committee which will oversee this legislation. It seems to us that that would be a more appropriate way to move in all the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I say that, on reflection, we have decided not to press the matters at this time. That is not because we do not think that they incorporate an important issue that requires resolution but, rather, because we think that a more detailed consideration by a parliamentary committee of the whole of the issues that surround commercial settlement should be undertaken and that the new parliamentary committee, which we are setting up today through this legislation, is the most appropriate vehicle to give consideration to such matters. On that basis I indicate that I will not be moving our amendment No. 7 and we do not oppose the Government's amendment in this regard. </PARA>

<PARA> Getting back to the corporate legislation, having listened to Senator Hill and Senator Macklin, the Government is of the view that the question of commercial settlements is one that can benefit from greater and further consideration. We will possibly look at either the parliamentary committee or the advisory committee considering the whole question of commercial settlement. </PARA>
<PARA> We recognise that, within the current law, and the proposed law that is before us at the moment, commercial settlements can in fact be entered into. We also recognise that the parliamentary committee recommended further consideration in this area. I am pleased that Senator Hill will not be pursuing his amendment. We are concerned that, if the concept of commercial settlements was embodied in legislation, we would be the first country in the Western commercial world that would be doing so formally. We also recognise that even though it may seem to be an attractive proposal it may have implications in terms of further investigation of matters that may have in fact been `settled'. Such considerations need to be further considered together with the question of publication and accountability through publication of whatever arrangement has in fact been reached. Those issues can be positively looked at in terms of their further consideration by either the parliamentary committee or the advisory committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I should like to take a few moments at this stage to place on record a couple of factors from the Government side. We have just finished a very important stage of this legislation and I think I should place on record the amount of work, effort and foresight put into this proposal by the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) and the stubborn persistence with which he has pursued and is pursuing this issue. As well as the Attorney-General, a whole host of people put in a great deal of work in order to see that the legislation was prepared and progressed to this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Initially I should place on the record the Government's appreciation of the work done by the people in the Attorney-General's Department and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. In the case of the former, the ranks of the particular division of the Department that was handling the legislation diminished from time to time. Despite that, the quality of the advice and information coming to the Government did not change at all. The Government appreciates the resources that have been put in by that division of the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA> We also recognise the amount of work and policy advice that has been put in not only by the Joint Parliamentary Committee but also by the Attorney-General's steering committee and consultative groups. The steering committee was extremely important, as was the consultative group, in terms of providing avenues and panels off which to bounce ideas and from which ideas emanated. We place on record our appreciation of their work. </PARA>
<PARA> I place on record personally my appreciation of the work done by the officers of the Attorney-General's office, my office and Senator Tate's office. They have kept the wheels turning in a very effective way. Finally I place on record appreciation for the way in which Senator Macklin and Senator Hill approached the debate in what has been and is an extremely complex and drawn-out matter. This is the biggest Bill ever to come before this Parliament. It is reflective of the constructive way in which we have been able to handle it through the parliamentary processes over the past few months but more particularly over the past few days. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I would like to associate myself with the remarks of Senator Hill, particularly the last one. It is my belief that, if this chamber ever manages to get back to the report which is before it with regard to procedures and committees to look at complex legislation, and if the more wayward members of the Senate permit an adequate and reasonable discussion of that particular report, we could implement it. Such procedures would facilitate enormously the consideration of complex Bills such as these.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Hill has pointed out, the thought of actually going into the committee stage of this legislation without having had a committee inquiry would have been so horrific that the Government would have kept putting the debate off. But for that inquiry it would have been virtually impossible for this chamber to manage the complexity of the issues, the differences of principle and the necessary emphasis. The fact that we were able to work matters out in an amicable way in the committee stage and that the Government was very positive in its response to the unanimous recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on the Corporations Legislation has enabled the passage of this legislation in a much more reasonable time frame than could ever have been imagined, if at all, with consideration simply by the Committee of the Whole. </PARA>

We think it is important that we insist on a fair representation on an important committee such as the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory in accord with our numbers in the chamber. It occurs to me that on a strict mathematical calculation we are still under-represented compared with the independents and the Australian Democrats; nevertheless, two senators from the Opposition are better than one. We are pleased that that concession has been made. We also recognise that this motion will pass despite the fact that we think we ought to have three because the Government and the Democrats have agreed to this position.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise the matter of an inequity arising from unintended consequences of the Superannuation Benefit (Interim Arrangements) Act of 1988 and the Australian Capital Territory self-government legislation package which transferred staff of the National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) to the ACT Administration and the National Capital Planning Authority. The problem is that the transfer of the NCDC staff to those bodies involved the transfer of staff employed under the National Capital Development Commission Act 1957 to employment under the Public Service Act 1922. This transfer did not involve any break in continuity, loss of accrued leave or other benefits consistent with the general understandings and the provisions of section 81 of the Public Service Act under which the transfer was effected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, because of the peculiarities of the terms of the Superannuation Benefit (Interim Arrangements) Act, in which such arrangements as this were not envisaged, these ex-NCDC staff are regarded as having changed employers. Accordingly, in regard to the 3 per cent superannuation scheme, which is covered by the Superannuation Benefit (Interim Arrangements) Act, that is, the extra government 3 per cent superannuation contribution, employees whose accrued 3 per cent fund is $500 or less, can get access to the money or roll it over in a preservation fund. Although I do not think that is an appropriate arrangement, there is no disadvantage to the individuals because they can get access to the money. It is not what the 3 per cent was intended for, but as it is such a small amount it is probably not a problem. </PARA>
<PARA> However, those people-I understand that up to 70 per cent of the staff could be involved-whose accrued 3 per cent fund is more than $500 must roll the money over in a preservation fund until retirement age, which is the standard requirement in circumstances of a change of employer. In this situation the proposal is totally unsatisfactory, because the change in employer in this case is really only a deemed change. It was entirely due to the employer, in this case the Government, restructuring its operations, not to any voluntary action by the employees, or to any decision of theirs even to change desks. They did not apply for new positions. They have been affected by a proper and appropriate restructuring by the Government, which possibly had adverse consequences for their superannuation entitlements and the way in which they will be treated. </PARA>
<PARA> All concerned seem to agree that this is unfair and anomalous, but it is generally accepted that it is too late to correct the matter because, I gather, the 90-day roll over time which is available to staff has expired. The NCDC Act was repealed on 31 January. Accordingly, it is too late to do anything at this stage. My understanding from discussion with departmental officers is that, as is publicly known, there is a review of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme. They do not want to make piecemeal changes. They would rather deal with any anomalies in that way. It is possible, and I hope probable, that the 3 per cent fund will be incorporated with the existing Commonwealth superannuation scheme as part of the review. Given that this anomaly and potential unfairness has arisen, which is quite contrary to the intentions of the 3 per cent superannuation arrangements, I want to raise the possibility, and seek consideration by the Minister, of allowing the staff so affected to reincorporate their benefit into the main Commonwealth superannuation fund when the review is complete, on the assumption that that review leads to an amalgamation of the funds, which it should do and which I think is entirely appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> This will not remove the anomaly that has already occurred but it will go some way to rectifying the problem caused by the anomaly and it will indicate to these employees that their reasonable expectations when the 3 per cent was granted have reasonable prospects of being fulfilled. I would like to put on the record that, while supporting the intentions and the implementation in the broad measure of the 3 per cent superannuation increment-it is a very important improvement in employees' conditions throughout Australia-the manner of the implementation of the superannuation scheme and the self-government proposals with regard to planning in the ACT has potentially disadvantaged these people. We cannot retrospectively correct that problem, and it seems inappropriate to do so, but I hope that the Minister will consider giving a commitment to these employees that they will be allowed to so reincorporate so that the anomaly might be rectified. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I return to the matter of allegations of corrupt practices in banking. Honourable senators are aware that over a period of some months now I have taken advantage of this Thursday lunchtime matters of public of interest segment to explore, probe, and table materials for the information of honourable senators in relation to a range of very serious allegations in the community concerning corrupt banking practices. On 5 April the Senate debated the proposition that this whole question be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. That proposition was defeated by the combined vote of the Government and the Opposition. Last week I returned to some aspects of that debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the debate on 5 April Senator Stone tabled and had incorporated in Hansard four letters that the Managing Director of the Commonwealth Bank, Mr Sanders, had sent to me personally. I had not previously tabled those letters because I was still researching their implications. As I said, Senator Stone tabled them. As a result of their incorporation in Hansard and their availability to others, I have now received a number of responses which argue that Mr Sanders had misrepresented certain circumstances to me in those letters. Inadvertently Senator Stone, therefore, had been a party to Mr Sanders actually misrepresenting those circumstances to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not for me to make judgments about whether a misrepresentation occurred but to simply draw the Senate's attention to the fact that those allegations of misrepresentation have been brought to my attention. I will shortly seek leave to table the letters of response which draw the Senate's attention to those serious allegations. Each Thursday I have been seeking leave of the Senate to place before honourable senators a series of affidavits which build up the picture of alleged corruption. I seek leave of the Senate today to table two further affidavits, one in relation to the dispute between Mr John Kay and the Australian Guarantee Corporation Ltd, AGC, and an affidavit by Sharon Margaret Shannon who is in dispute with Westpac. Neither dispute is before the courts. I seek leave of the Senate to table those documents. </PARA>

So we do not know what we are agreeing to table. This is about the fourth time that this has happened. It might smooth our procedures if, before Senator McLean comes in here to table documents, he checks them out with the duty Minister and the duty shadow Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. Certainly I will do that in future. I turn now to a solicitor's letter addressed to me from the solicitors of Mr and Mrs Tony Rigg, who are in dispute with the Commonwealth Bank. Mr Don Sanders had written to me in relation to the Rigg question. That letter was tabled, as I said, by Senator Stone. The Riggs argue that the explanation which is offered to me in the letter from Mr Sanders-and which therefore is before the Senate, having been tabled by Senator Stone-incorporates a number of falsehoods. In the solicitor's letter on behalf of Mr and Mrs Rigg it is argued that the Sanders letter contains errors of fact and at least four falsehoods and is misleading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, I am not really in a position to make a judgment as to whether Mr Sanders has stated falsehoods to me, for the simple reason that I have the classic situation of two opinions before me. Indeed, that is the nature of these disputes on every occasion-some of which have been taken to the courts and judgments made upon them. Under the circumstances, since the previous letters of Mr Sanders are now a part of Hansard, I feel obliged to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that their content is disputed by those who claim to know the realities, that there are serious allegations of lying, and threats to life and limb in the case of Mr Gilliland, which I cited last Thursday, and that there are serious allegations of misleading statements and palpable falsehoods contained in the solicitor's letter on behalf of Mr and Mrs Tony Rigg. I seek leave to table these documents so that the counter statements, or counter case, is before the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purposes of this Bill are proper-to reform the outdated legislative framework under which our international liner trade is carried on and to repeal and replace part X of the Trade Practices Act. The Opposition has no objection to those purposes but it is worth being quite clear as to what we are talking about, what liner shipping is. It is mainly containerised cargoes on defined trade routes. The value of this trade is substantial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1986-87, liner exports were 8 million tonnes, worth $13 billion, and imports were 6 million tonnes, worth $21 billion. It is worth noting that the value per tonne of our imports is much higher than our exports, because our exports are mainly wheat and wool and our imports are mainly high value, manufactured items, such as industrial machinery and equipment. Of that cargo, we carried in Australian flag ships seven per cent of exports and nine per cent of imports. It is worth noting why the figure is so high. Our shipping is generally very uncompetitive for reasons I will come to in a moment. The reason Australian ships are in these cartels, these conferences, is that they are very welcome there. The high costs of Australian ships put up freight charges for everyone and make the profits of the efficient operators much higher than they otherwise would be. Australian ships are very welcome in conferences, but not for good economic reasons as far as Australia's economic well-being is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Opposition does not oppose this Bill but we do note that it has been very slow coming into being. It has been in the process of being drafted since 1984-five years ago. It is typical of the Government's approach to micro-economic and structural reform. The Bill, as presented to the Parliament, was very badly drafted. It had a number of serious problems which have been fixed up in the Parliament. But for a Bill which has been drafted for five years it is extraordinary that it should have come into the Parliament with so many errors. For instance, it did not contain a precise definition of what a conference is, the thing we are talking about in this Bill. It has been rectified by way of amendment but it was very sloppy drafting that allowed for a conference agreement to be described as an agreement between conference members without ever defining what a conference was. The definition of market power was not clear as originally drafted. That, too, has been fixed up. Under Designated Shipper Bodies, the Bill gives official negotiating recognition to designated peak shipper bodies and designated secondary shipper bodies but this is very far from a proper, market-based approach which would be ideal. </PARA>
<PARA> Another objection to the way the Bill handles things is that there are no incentives in the Bill to move away from the cartel-like structures in the liner shipping industry. I have given an example of the way this type of cartel can operate to the economic detriment of the country by the welcome it gives to high cost Australian shipping because it pushes up freight rates and pushes up the profits of the efficient shipping operators still further. We want to achieve a system where our trade moves at the lowest possible cost. </PARA>
<PARA> Another difficulty with the Bill is that it may increase costs. Members of the Trade Practices Commission have claimed that the mediation and monitoring function required of the Commission would involve substantial additional expenses for the Commonwealth. Finally, on the points of difficulty-a minor point, perhaps-the Australian Shippers Council in the past has received a small grant from the Commonwealth. I ask the Minister whether there will be similar grants to the designated shipper bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> The main difficulty with this Bill-though I repeat that the Opposition is not opposed to it; it is better than nothing-is that it does not really do anything significant to tackle the entrenched and damaging inefficiencies on the waterfront and in coastal shipping. These are very serious difficulties in a time when we have a balance of payments deficit of $15,000m a year, despite the fact that the value of our exports, and our terms of trade, improved significantly-by about 15 per cent-in the last year. Our balance of payments deficit is 35 per cent higher than for the same period last year. This is despite an improvement in our terms of trade of 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The world does not owe us a living. We must tackle inefficiencies on our waterfront and in our shipping. Our overseas shipping, our liner shipping, which we are dealing with here, is damaged because our highly protected, union and monopoly ruled coastal shipping conditions-the accommodation conditions, the pay conditions, the manning conditions-also flow over into international shipping. This is a great cost to the Australian community. The cost runs into billions of dollars a year. This Government is not tackling these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government can be very free-I must say that I agree with it-in deregulating and freeing up the wheat market because none of the Government's interested parties are affected. But it is very reluctant when it comes to far more important reforms on the waterfront and in shipping, because its party members are involved. We do not have time on our side. I repeat: We are living $15,000m a year beyond our means. The world does not owe us a living. We must tackle these problems of shipping and the waterfront if we wish to improve our standard of living and keep up with the rest of the world. These are matters this Government will not touch. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I answer the question that I think Senator Hamer has asked me I table a revised explanatory memorandum relating to this Bill. The Trade Practices (International Liner Cargo Shipping) Amendment Bill 1989, I am informed, modifies or removes part X of the Trade Practices Act, that part which exempts liner shipping from the Trade Practices Act, and thus has the effect of exposing the conference lines to greater competition in shipping.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question that Senator Hamer asked me was in relation to the funding of designated shipper bodies. No Commonwealth funding will be provided for the establishment or operation of designated shipping bodies. Such bodies are commercial organisations set up in the interests of their members. It is therefore appropriate that their membership fund them. An objective of the Bill is to place greater reliance on commercial structures. So the answer is no. The Government acknowledges that the Opposition supports this legislation. I take on board the other remarks made by Senator Hamer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Export Inspection (Quantity Charge) Amendment Bill lifts the legislative maximum amount for export inspection of grain and dairy products and removes other items which are now charged on a fee for service basis rather than on quantity. The actual operating levels are not included in the Bill. They are to be set up by regulation. The Bill extends the Government push towards a fee for service. The intention to raise fees was made in the May economic statement. Of the 174 items inspected for export, only some dairy products and grain remain on a quantity basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The coalition supports the general thrust of the legislation and changes to export inspection policy, which policy was commenced under the Fraser Government. The coalition accepts the need for increased charges where, for example, the Department was losing money on bagged and container inspection because the current maximum in the Bill does not allow it to recover costs. The Department states that residue testing of grain has resulted in a 31 per cent increase in costs and that is the major reason for the large lift in the maximum grain fees for bagged grain from 33c per tonne to $1 and for containerised grain from $1.46 per tonne to $5. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, however, problems for the exporters of horticulture and floriculture products. These are the problems that I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate. There is a $47 minimum fee for the inspection of horticultural products. I put it to the Senate and to the Government that that is a real disincentive to those who may choose merely to send a sample of their product overseas in order to open up some new market. This minimum charge has caused many nurseries to abandon the export market or attempts to enter the export market. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Barry Waldeck, one of Western Australia's leading nurserymen, addressing the recent national Agricultural Outlook Conference on the future of floriculture told delegates that Australia presently holds only 0.06 per cent of the world flower trade and that a 2.5 per cent share of that market would be worth $100m a year. At the same time he said that it should be taken into account that the floriculture market is increasing at the rate of $400m a year. To provide some encouragement Holland, which commands 63 per cent of the world flower market, described Australia as `an untapped gold mine of unique flower species'. I cite this example to demonstrate the need for flexibility and the need to ensure that inspection charges are not at levels which discourage growth of new exports. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia simply cannot afford disincentives for new exporters. This country is on the edge of an economic abyss as to the value of its dollar. There is a desperate need to encourage exporters in all fields and this is a marvellous opportunity for Australia to enter into this field of export. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition parties believe that the people of Australia, as well as the exporters, have an investment in exports from this country because exports are essential to the maintenance of our living standards and reduce the terrible overseas debt burden we are now suffering at the hands of the Hawke Government. We believe that all Australians should share in the cost of these export inspection costs and we will, in government, reduce cost recovery to a maximum of 50 per cent instead of the 60 to 100 per cent under this Hawke Government. We will encourage exports by solving the problems of the small and new exporters. In government, the coalition parties will encourage export industries to increasingly self-manage, self-assure and back the brand images of their products. Export inspection arrangements should be limited to what is required by international agreements or by importing countries. Outside that requirement it should be left to the exporters to maintain their own quality standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition does not oppose this Bill but condemns the Government for breaking its commitment to recover not more than 50 per cent of the cost of export inspection charges for agricultural commodities. The actions of the Hawke Government demonstrate its lack of sympathy for the problems of rural producers. It is repeatedly demonstrating a lack of sympathy for and understanding of the rural producers of this nation. Obviously it has a hidden agenda of moving towards a 100 per cent recovery cost of export inspection charges for agricultural commodities, as is demonstrated by the dramatic increase in the maximum permissible levels under this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Lewis has said, the Opposition supports this Bill. Therefore, unlike the wheat Bills which will come before the Senate today, and on which there is heated disagreement between some elements of the Opposition and the Government, on this Bill one can fairly say that there is heated agreement. That makes a nice change for this chamber. The second reading debate on this Bill has afforded Senator Lewis an opportunity to make a political speech about cost recovery of inspection charges. I acknowledge that it was a political speech. I do not propose to reply to it other than to make this observation: Last week a national employers body-it may have been the Confederation of Australian Industry; I am not sure-advocated to this Government that cost recovery on inspections should be 100 per cent. We have cost recovery at 60 per cent. That was lambasted by Senator Lewis in his remarks. He promised that the Opposition will reduce it to 50 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask the general Australian taxpayer to consider why the Opposition imagines that the taxpayers' purse should be plundered, and that the taxpayer should shoulder a greater share of inspection charges for normal trading arrangements. The inspections that are undertaken are necessary to assure the quality and brand-type of Australian produce overseas and to allow that produce past international barriers that have quarantine or other restrictions on them. If our products have been inspected by our service in Australia, we can be assured that they will have entry into other markets as quality products. That service goes with the trading process. It seems to me that it ought to be paid for by those who use it. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we have pegged our fees at 60 per cent cost recovery. I do not think there is a case that the Australian taxpayer should subsidise the inspection service by more than 40 per cent. The Opposition seems to think that it should. On the other hand, I take note of Senator Lewis's remarks about the flower industry. The flower industry has a vibrant lobby that makes its case clear to the Government, but I do not believe the $47 inspection charge is a major inhibition. I commend the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Amendment Bill 1989. I am somewhat disappointed that there are not more speakers on the list, Madam Acting Deputy President, to debate the serious issue of the progress of the Government's affirmative action regime. Nevertheless, I am pleased that you are in the chair. You will have no choice but to listen to the views of the Opposition in this regard. The amendments proposed in this Bill will result in some minor administrative adjustments being made to the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act 1986 which established the Affirmative Action Agency and which requires employers to promote equal opportunity for women in employment. This Bill seeks to amend those portions of the principal Act that require employers to report annually to the Director of Affirmative Action on their individual programs and to ensure that tertiary institutions that amalgamate are not regarded as `new employers' for the purpose of establishing affirmative action programs. The Government is also seeking to have higher education institutions report on their affirmative action programs by a uniform date each year and to cover the same period in their reporting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition supports the amendments. They seem to us to be sensible. We hope that they streamline reporting requirements and ensure continuity in the affirmative action programs in amalgamating tertiary institutions, notwithstanding whatever reservations we might have about that amalgamation process. </PARA>
<PARA> As one of those who supported the original legislation in its passage through the Parliament, not surprisingly I follow the progress of the Affirmative Action Agency with interest. I commend the work of those who work within the Agency. It is obvious from our dealings with them in Estimates committee hearings that they are dedicated and are clearly seeking to achieve the legislation's objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of the work the Agency does also deserves to be supported: encouraging compliance with the provisions of the Act, advising employers in the development and implementation of their affirmation action plans and monitoring progress of tertiary institutions, companies with over 1,000 employees, companies with between 500 and 999 employees, and now the last phase, involving companies with between 100 and 499 employees. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who follow the Estimates committee hearings on this matter will be well aware that our concern relates to the qualitative assessments of the work that is being done by the Agency, or rather, to this stage, the lack of qualitative assessment. The question that we on this side of the chamber wish to ask is: How is the Agency assisting in improving the employment status of women which, of course, is the principal objective of the Act? We have been concerned that on the evidence before us the emphasis of the Agency-and therefore, no doubt, the direction of the Minister and the Government-has been to look at whether those obliged to comply with the Act are meeting the technical requirements of the Act rather than determining whether they are meeting the spirit of the legislation and whether the Act is being useful in improving the employment status of women. In other words, what is being done to date is a quantitative assessment of compliance with the Act in its various forms rather than a qualitative assessment. </PARA>
<PARA> We put to the Government that no great effort is needed to get companies and higher education institutions to comply with the strict provisions of the Act. On the basis of the last report, the fact that only three companies did not meet the technical requirements of the Act shows that a very high level of compliance can be readily achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> The real question to be asked when one looks at the report is: What does it tell us about how much the legislative structure, and those who are working within it, are achieving in regard to improving the status of women in employment? As I indicated one finds very little information in the report to guide us in that direction. One would have thought, I respectfully submit, that one would be able to find it because that is the ultimate objective of the legislation and of those who work in the Agency. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Estimates committee hearings, we pressed the point. We asked how the Agency was assessing the effectiveness of its projects, of the legislation. As a result of that process of seeking information we found that the Agency uses a number of different mechanisms to produce the outcomes for which the Agency has been established. The first of the methods it uses is self-evaluation. As I recall it, that obligation is set out in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Information which is obtained from companies is collated and published in the Agency's annual report. Under the legislation companies are obliged to assess themselves against the eight steps they are required to take. But nothing gives us any indication as to whether they are self-assessing; whether they are undertaking a process of self-evaluation. So we have to say that whilst it might, on the face of it, be useful to invite companies to undertake self-evaluation, it gives us no help at all in determining whether or not they are seriously addressing the issues that underlie the legislation. So we do not find much help in the first of the steps that are used by the Agency, it tells us, to assess its success or otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> The second process was put to us as being the audit process. The Agency, we were informed, picks out those companies which have not met minimum standards of compliance and-I quote from the transcript of the Estimates hearing-`looks at their programs intensively and `audits' a 2 per cent sample of other returns. So it audits a 2 per cent sample. So we asked what was involved in this audit process. We found out that it is merely a desk-based audit. In other words, it involves nothing more than reading the reports carefully. We suggest that that is not the type of audit which will in any way inform us as to whether there has been improvement. All it does-it is only a random 2 per cent sample-is to test whether companies are meeting the strict reporting requirements of the Act. We on this side of the chamber would prefer to see a much greater sample taken than 2 per cent. Furthermore, if one is to enter into an audit procedure one enters into a proper audit procedure, which means that one checks. One does not simply read the report, reports which are so easily prepared in terms that comply with the minimum requirements of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I reread the Estimates transcript and what was even more astonishing is that this process of desk audit has not yet started. If we were misreading the Estimates transcript or if there was some confusion in the evidence that was given by the officers, I hope that will be clarified by the Minister in this debate. The Agency has now been in operation for some years. We see no reason why the audit process should not be in place, not just spoken about. </PARA>
<PARA> The third of the tests of meeting the requirements of legislation is referred to by the Director as `evaluation'. We said, `What does that mean?'. The answer was, `Looking in detail at programs in a qualitative sense'. That is what we were looking for all along but, when we searched further and pressed the officers, we found that that evaluation process has not yet commenced. We were told that the reports of some 20 large companies are being looked at in greater detail, but doing an evaluation in a qualitative sense to see whether there is an actual improvement in the status of employment of women within these corporations has not yet commenced. </PARA>
<PARA> When we pressed even further as to what the nature of this qualitative assessment will be-this method of evaluation-again, I regret to say, there were no satisfactory answers. It does surprise us, I say with some disappointment, that these matters have not been addressed. I would have thought that they were the starting point of the Agency's work and the starting point of the Government's resolve in bringing down the legislation. The Government's emphasis seems to have been to get companies simply to meet a reporting function-a basis, almost mechanical, reporting function, thus being able to say in an annual report that the corporate world is meeting its requirements under the Act. That, I regret to say, tells us very little. </PARA>
<PARA> When one considers what is meant by `meeting minimum standards', it seems that it does not mean complying with the eight steps that are set out in the Act. The minimum compliance, we understand from the Agency, in year one of reporting is simply that the company gives some statistics plus compliance with one other step. If that is wrong, we would like to hear from the Government in this debate. It seems to us to be disappointing. In the second year, we are told that companies have to give a statistical profile plus four steps. Why in the second year can they not be required to meet the eight requirements that are set out in the legislation? Why is it necessary to adopt this step by step approach, particularly when, in our view, the meeting of those eight steps in itself does not really mean that the company is complying with the spirit of the legislation? We are aware that the Agency recently has put down an evaluation strategic plan. I think it was prepared from outside the Agency. I do not quite see why that was necessary, given the senior and experienced officers within the Agency, and particularly if companies are mainly going to be meeting a clerical requirement in the first few years of operation of the Act. Even when we look at the evaluation strategic plan, which sets out three levels of effectiveness, we find that all the Agency is looking at now, and seeking companies to comply with, is level one. Level one effectiveness is that the Agency assists employers with reporting obligations and monitors compliance with the legislation and the quality of the programs. Level two effectiveness is that the programs lead to improvements in the equal opportunity performance of the organisations, after which the Agency will provide a broader education and communication service to raise awareness of equal employment opportunity issues in the general community. Level three effectiveness is that the position of Australian women in the work force is improved. We do not understand, and perhaps the Minister might explain, why it is necessary, three years into the legislation, to be looking only for level one effectiveness, which seems to be to comply with the reporting requirements of the legislation rather than to impress upon companies and institutions that are covered by the legislation the need to meet the spirit of the legislation and actually achieve what lies behind it. We bring to the Government's attention in this debate our concern at what seems from the evidence put before us in the Estimates committee hearings to be a lack of effective evaluation proceedings that look to qualitative improvement in this area. I reiterate that qualitative improvement should be what the whole process is really about. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are left at a loss as to the progress of the status of women in employment from the work of the Agency to date and from its annual reports, I guess that the best direction for us to look is to areas of the work force that are directly within the control of the Government and upon which the Government has a much greater power to influence change in accordance with the direction it says it advocates. We therefore look, firstly, towards the Australian Public Service. Again we find a disappointing picture. The Public Service is covered not by this legislation but by a separate equal opportunity regime. When we consider how successful that has been in improving the status of women within the Public Service, as I indicated, the results are disappointing. We see that in the last year the increase in the number of women in the Senior Executive Service was 0.1 per cent. In other words, it was negligible-almost nil. The Government should hang its head in shame. We would have thought that by now we would have seen some female department heads. This Government has been in office for six years. Perhaps the Minister might confirm that there are still no female heads of departments in the Australian Public Service. We do not think that is a credit to the Government. It ought to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The vast majority of women in the Public Service are still in the lowest categories of employment. On the figures I have, women still make up 68.3 per cent of clerical assistants in the Public Service. That percentage has actually increased. So although more women have come into the Public Service, more of them are coming in and being lodged at the lower levels. Evidence of vertical improvement of employment within the Public Service by women has been disappointing. Women are still progressing within the Public Service more slowly than comparable men. The Public Service Board said in its equal employment opportunity annual report  1986-87:</PARA>
<PARA>The low representation of women at senior levels is not fully explained by differences in length of service; nor by differences in qualifications; nor by concentration of women in States with slower promotion rates; nor by concentration of women in departments with slower promotion rates, nor by a combination of these factors taken together. Women have progressed more slowly than comparable men. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps the Minister will be prepared to explain why. Whilst the Government insists on the corporate sector meeting its reporting requirements under its legislation we find the disappointing picture that not all government agencies directly under the control, or certainly within the control, of the Government meeting theirs, which we suggest sends at least a confused signal to the private sector in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that eight government agencies, at least one of which failed to report in 1986-87, failed to report in 1987-88. Perhaps we can have an explanation from the Minister as to why government sector reporting requirements are failing to be met. Four Cabinet level ministries, I am advised, were in default regarding their equal opportunity programs. Amongst the departments which have failed to report progress was the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet which has within it the office of the Status of Women. None of these departments were listed in the Public Service Commission's annual report which we would have at least expected the Public Service Commissioner to have done. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister was pretty quick to jump on the only three companies in the corporate sector that failed to meet the reporting requirements. We have a classic case of double standards. The explanation given in the Public Service Commission's annual report was that there had been major changes and uncertainties due to the Public Service's reorganisation. That is not an excuse for those in the private sector. One should apply the same principles to both the public and private sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> Senior Government Ministers would not comment when asked about the failure of the government agencies to report. As I said, perhaps this Minister might. Neither the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) nor the Minister responsible for the status of women was prepared to comment. Even the Australian Council of Trade Unions told the Government in a recent report, which was reported in the Canberra Times on 22 March 1989, that the Government's equal employment opportunity strategy had failed. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>Probably the most disturbing aspect of the Federal Government's attempt to legislate against discrimination have been the number of government departments which still have not submitted EEO plans. </PARA>
<PARA>As the Federal Minister for Industrial Relations was attacking private companies for failing to comply with the affirmation action legislation his own Department still has not submitted its plans. The Canberra Times editorial of 18 December 1988 summed it up when it said:</PARA>
<PARA>The words of promise spoken by Public Service heads when the program was introduced almost five years ago-</PARA>
<PARA>referring to the equal employment opportunity program in the Public Service, not to the more recent program for the private sector-</PARA>
<PARA>have not been matched by the emergence of women within their own ranks, proving that, for all its checks, balances and appeal mechanisms the Public Service still lacks the force and egalitarianism capable of propelling women to the top. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to note that only 108 people out of the 1,632 people in the Senior Executive Service are women. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>What makes the figures even more damning is the fact that the Australian Public Service, among all employers, had the scope to prosecute the affirmative action program to its maximum extent-it had the Governments imprimatur and was not inhibited by the financial and corporate considerations of private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA>A damning indictment, I would suggest. The editorial finished with these words:</PARA>
<PARA>There is some evidence that the affirmative action program changed virtually nothing in the Public Service except the modus operandi of senior administrator. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope, with all due sincerity, that the Government will address the question of the Federal Public Service because the Government cannot expect improvement in meeting the spirit of the private sector requirements unless it is prepared to take a lead and set the example within the areas of its control. </PARA>
<PARA> More women are moving into employment and, provided they are doing it by choice, we applaud that. We are concerned, however, that as more women move into employment the percentage of those in jobs of lower than average weekly payment is also increasing. It tends to substantiate our concern that more women are moving into the lower paid jobs which carry with them less job satisfaction, fewer training entitlements and more difficult career progression. We would like to see the Government addressing this question more effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> We regret to note that in occupational groups there seems to be little horizontal improvement. Women are still largely entering traditional areas of employment. The Government's traineeship system should be an example. We see a domination of women trainees within the traditional area. For example, women constitute 95 per cent of textile, clothing and footwear trainees, 89 per cent of trainees in child-care and 86 per cent of trainees in office/clerical work. We bring that to the Government's attention again and ask that it make a greater effort. </PARA>
<PARA> Again I remind honourable senators of the position regarding apprenticeships. This same picture is seen. In the metals are there are 322 women and 43,000 men; in electrical, 286 women and 17,000 men, in building 320 women and nearly 25,000 men. Regrettably, very little progress is being made in moving women into areas of non-traditional work and giving them the additional opportunities for job satisfaction and financial reward that would come from achieving that objective. </PARA>
<PARA> We can have all the legislation in the world but we will not have an effective affirmative action system without adequate and affordable child-care. There is no subject upon which I receive more representations in relation to my responsibility for the status of women than the lack of available and affordable child-care which is inhibiting the progress of women within employment. We stress that again for the Government's attention. We stress that women need a better tax package than they are getting at the moment. If I had time I could advance this. We stress that it is necessary to get more women into tertiary institutions and to start courses, as I said, in non-traditional subjects. Unless these basic subjects are addressed, the legislation can be but partially effective. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce to the very critical report by the Auditor- General on the Government's 150 per cent tax concession for research and development, a report which was released only two days after the Government announced a four-year, $600m extension of the scheme.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First, the claims made by two officers of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation regarding creative accounting were totally unsubstantiated and have to be distinguished from the situation relating to the administration of the scheme. I have not studied in detail the Auditor-General's report at the time, but I am familiar with some of the things which are said in that report. For example, the Auditor-General made an absolutely legitimate complaint that there was delay in the adoption of the relevant tax legislation, which delayed the administration of this scheme for some considerable period. The burden of the Auditor-General's report is not one of alleging abuse of the scheme, but rather one of his not being satisfied that the administration was sufficient at the time the report was written to monitor and administer the scheme adequately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was asked whether I had previously been made aware of deficiencies in the scheme. I had, to the extent that there is now in operation a system of auditing of applicants under the scheme jointly by the Australian Taxation Office and my Department. That audit process has been put in place more slowly than I would have wished. I am aware, for example, that for the first time this year company tax returns will be asked to specify amounts claimed in respect of research and development. It might have been desirable for that to have happened earlier. As I understand it, the company tax scheme is being revised generally and this is included in that revision.</PARA>
<PARA> I find some difficulty with what the Auditor-General said with regard to monitoring and evaluation, because we have moved in respect of taxation to a scheme of self- assessment. I understand from reports of the Auditor-General's report that the audit process under the tax concessions scheme will involve the same percentage of claimants as the audit scheme generally catches or examines in terms of the overall self-assessment scheme for taxpayers. So I do not think there is any difference there from the normal run of taxation paid. I do not see why there should be, because there is potentially much more to be lost to taxation revenue generally under a self-assessment scheme than under this tax concession. As far as I know, every effort has been made to improve gradually the administration of the scheme. That process will continue.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen a copy of the so-called Bill of Rights about which Mr Bernard Lord has spoken, but I have seen a number of transcripts and newspaper reports. From them, it is apparent that the three most significant proposals are, first, to increase and tie the pension to 30 per cent of average weekly earnings; secondly, to lift the free income area to 12 1/2 per cent of average weekly earnings; and, thirdly, to provide automatically or, as of right, which is the term Mr Lord used, a universal pension to persons over 72 years of age. There were a number of other demands, but I have had those three costed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The cost of tying the pension to 30 per cent of average weekly earnings would, if it was restricted to age and service pensioners, cost $2.3 billion. If it was extended to invalid pensioners, supporting parents and unemployment beneficiaries, those payments, which are either identical to or closely linked to the age pension, would cost an additional $1.7 billion. The total cost for the first item is $4 billion. The cost of increasing the free area prior to the operation of the income test to 12 1/2 per cent of average weekly earnings is $280m for the age pensioners and $85m for the others. The very regressive proposal to pay a universal age pension to all persons over 72 years of age would cost at present pension rates $1,200m and at the proposed enhanced rate of 30 per cent of average weekly earnings an extra $380m, making a total of $1,580m. So the gross cost is $5.9 billion. If it were paid only to age pensioners and not to the other related categories, the gross cost would be above $4 billion. The claw-back would be of the order of $800m if the increases were paid to all the social security recipients that I have identified, leaving a net cost to the Budget in excess of $5 billion or close to 10 per cent of total taxation revenue.</PARA>
<PARA> I have been asked whether it is affordable. That really depends on the level of taxation which the community is willing to pay. For example, if Australia's level of tax from all governments was as high as Sweden's, that is, 50.5 per cent of gross domestic product as compared to just over 30 per cent in Australia-using 1985 figures, which will not have changed very much-taxation in total as a proportion of GDP would rise by 20 per cent. That would give government an extra $66 billion to spend. It is, however, very clear that Australians are not willing to pay the Swedish level of taxation.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make a couple of other points on the interview with Mr Lord, which I personally heard. He was asked whether, in view of the ageing population of Australia, superannuation was the way to go to provide for retirement incomes rather than universal pensions. He said that young couples these days cannot afford superannuation. To the extent that that is true, if they cannot afford it on present taxation levels, they certainly would not be able to afford it if there was a 60 per cent increase in total tax collection. That is what would be required to take us to the Swedish level.</PARA>
<PARA> The relevance of the Swedish level, of course, is that Mr Lord himself cited it. When asked about the greying of the Australian population he said that that really was not a relevant issue because Sweden had twice as many people of pensionable age for twice as high a proportion of pensionable age right now as Australia does. Sweden pays pensions out of-I stress again because it is terribly important-a level of taxation 20 percentage points of GDP above the Australian level. If people want those levels of taxation they can afford the sort of thing that Mr Lord is talking about. But clearly they do not.</PARA>
<PARA> It ought also to be observed that nobody who is presently of pensionable age has paid throughout his working life the level of taxation which would have been required to pay a pension without any income test. In other words, in calling for this measure now when he has reached retirement age, Mr Lord is asking to receive what he himself during his working life has not paid for. My final comment is that I certainly do not believe that Mr Lord is speaking for people of retirement age in general; he is speaking for a small minority of people of retirement age and should be judged accordingly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly in respect of the National Museum of Australia there have been some funding problems, to say the least. In addressing general priorities for funding in the last few years, there had to be substantial cuts across the board in all sectors of government spending in order to participate in righting our economy from the wrongs of the past. Obviously the arts community had to bear some part of that burden. In establishing what burden it ought to bear, obviously the Government was mindful of trying to make sure that we did not make it too great and that it did not impact too much on individuals. Given that the National Museum of Australia would have required a very substantial amount of money to build a new facility, it was the view of the Government that such a decision could be postponed in the light of other priorities. That is what occurred. Nonetheless, money was granted for maintenance of the collection. There are before the Government at the moment other proposals for the future of the museum. However, I am not at liberty to disclose those because they remain part of Cabinet discussions. I am afraid I cannot elaborate any further.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bolkus would have read the New York Times also, no doubt. This is a most serious question. I can understand why Senator Foreman, who takes a great interest in these matters, should wish to raise it. The information that was contained in the articles in the Melbourne Sun about the results of research into the effects of the taking of cocaine, particularly by pregnant women, can only be described as horrific. The image that cocaine has as recreational or yucky-yuppie-drug-I will explain why that slip came about as I go on-is totally undeserved. Let me outline the position from those articles very briefly: In some United States cities 27 per cent, more than one in four, of babies being born are addicted to cocaine and other hard drugs. Crack hit California in the early 1980s and the far-reaching effects of the drug have just surfaced. This year, about 25 per cent of an expected 2,500 births at Oaklands Highland General Hospital, east of San Francisco, will result in shuddering, dwarfish babies affected by the crack their mothers smoked during pregnancy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> According to Dr Ira J. Chasnoff who directed a study of 36 United States hospitals research suggests that a single cocaine `hit' during pregnancy can cause lasting foetal damage. While a single dose of cocaine and its metabolites clear out of an adult body within 48 hours, an unborn baby is exposed for four or five days. As a result, the researchers believe almost no cocaine-exposed baby fully escapes its damaging affects. The lists of threats is long and growing. Cocaine exposed babies are more likely to die before birth or to be born prematurely. They tend to be abnormally small for their age at birth and have smaller than normal heads and brains. They face an increased risk of deformities of the genital and urinary organs, including kidney malformations that can lead to life-threatening infections.</PARA>
<PARA> I mention these ill effects which can affect the foetus. It is not within my portfolio interest to send a message to women, though I hope they receive it, but I want to explain the very vigorous steps that Australian law enforcement agencies are now taking to prepare us for the targeting of Australia as a market for cocaine by the cocaine cartels. Intelligence indicates that those cartels from South America are targeting Australia as a new and relatively untapped market for their deadly drug. In 1987 in the United States of America some 37,000 kilograms of cocaine were seized compared with 375 kilograms of heroin. In Australia the comparable figures were 16 kilograms of cocaine and 31 kilograms of heroin. One can see from those figures that the United States market is well and truly saturated, and Australia is regarded by these cartels as a relatively wealthy untapped market for their deadly drug. Indeed, the street price of cocaine in Australia is 10 times the price in the United States, so one can see why Australia would be attractive to such cartels.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that, in order to meet this challenge, the two relevant Commonwealth agencies-the Australian Customs Service, under the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, Mr Barry Jones, and the Australian Federal Police (AFP)-are devising their strategies to help prevent this expected penetration of cocaine into the Australian market. For example, only recently the first of what I hope will be a number of AFP liaison officers will be posted to Buenos Aires in South America, because that is the first city to establish a direct air link between Sydney and the South American continent. I believe that that sort of intelligence gathering and the cooperative endeavours with local law enforcement agencies, which have characterised the work of the AFP overseas liaison officers, will help us to get early warning of proposed importations into Australia and help in the law enforcement effort to preclude them from our shores.</PARA>
<PARA> I hope that, at the Australian Police Ministers Council meeting next week in Adelaide, the full cooperation of the States in these endeavours will be secured so that we can prevent the sort of horrific damage, not only to adults in our community but also to foetuses and babies, which has been evidenced in the United States.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lewis tried to score a cheap political point at the end of Question Time on Monday by accusing this Government of being an excessive taxer of the Australian oil industry to the extent that it curbs exploration and thus the finding of more oil to meet our opening self-sufficiency gap. I cannot answer in direct monetary terms what the Fraser Government took out of Bass Strait in the way of taxes compared with what we have taken because, since there is one producer, those figures are commercial in confidence figures. But what I can do is refer to a table which shows the percentages of take by the Fraser Government in the last five years of its period in office compared with what has been taken in five years under this Government. In that table we find that, on average, the Fraser Government took excise of 71 per cent of the gross value of sales out of Bass Strait compared with 60.4 per cent under our Government. In the year 1978-79, the Fraser Government took 63 per cent, the following year 72 per cent, the next year 74 per cent, in 1981-82 73 per cent, and in 1982-83 72 per cent. Indeed, in terms of oil excise, the Fraser Government was a very high taxing government. Under this Government, taxation on Bass Strait production has been, in 1983, 65 per cent, and in successive years 65 per cent, 58 per cent, 58 per cent and 56 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Not all of those figures, of course, are due to the level of excise. Under the old oil/new oil regime some of those figures show a disproportionate bias in favour of the Fraser years, it has to be said, because of the reliance on old oil production compared to new oil production. But there have been significant reductions in excise on Bass Strait production under this Government. We made a number of changes. The highest excise rate applying to old oil was reduced in 1986 from 87 per cent to 80 per cent. Further reductions will see this rate fall from the current level of 77 per cent to 75 per cent on 1 July this year. The Government also made the important concession that the first 30 million barrels of production from all onshore fields and new offshore fields where the resource rent tax regime does not apply will be excise free. Furthermore, there is an annual excise free production tranche of 8,000 barrels a day. Hence, no onshore oil producers pay excise, and that means that excise will not be paid on most new projects either.</PARA>
<PARA> I also indicate that the Government has, by its introduction of the resource rent tax, sorted out a number of the imperfections in the taxation system. Also, I have foreshadowed, in carrying out a promise given by Senator Gareth Evans when he was Minister for Resources and Energy, the bringing forward of the excise review. So I conclude that, on the figures, the Fraser Government, of which I understand Senator Lewis was a member, was the higher taxing government of the oil industry. Further, if one believes the argument of the oil industry-and the argument Senator Lewis tried to put in this chamber-that the level of taxes determines the amount of exploration, and if there is a curb on exploration in Australia, the Government of which Senator Lewis was a party was a major contributor to that curb.</PARA>

In the last 12 months, specifically, the reduction in the statutory reserve deposit requirements has had the effect of taking into bank transactions financial transactions which would have been conducted outside the banking system before that, and, therefore, has increased bank deposits. That is even if people believe that M3, or broad money M6 which includes M3, has the sort of relevance that some believe it had in the 1970s.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it was in late April, although I cannot recall the exact date, that the Courier-Mail reported that the National Party Government in Queensland had renewed sand mining leases on Fraser Island in 1987, and had done so without any consultation. The leases in question are those owned by Dillingham-Murphyores, which is a subsidiary of the Pivot Group. The Courier-Mail reported that the leases cover the east coast of the island and include parts of the townships of Happy Valley and Eurong, as well as the scenic area of Eli Creek. In 1976, it should be said, on environmental grounds the Fraser Government stopped sand mining on Fraser Island by use of the export control powers. We heard about some of that in the debate on forests yesterday because this is, seemingly, the only issue that the Liberal Party can point to in which it has some environmental credentials.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Earlier than 1976, the Whitlam Government set up an inquiry to produce a report on the Fraser Island environment and that inquiry found, among other things, that Fraser Island is the largest sand island in the world; it contains large areas of rainforests and areas of free, open eucalyptus forests, perched lakes, heathland and a number of sand dunes. The report stated that the natural environment of Fraser Island `had great significance, complexity and fragility'. The Fraser Government in 1976 also compensated sand mining companies for not proceeding. Dillingham-Murphyores received $4m in compensation; Queensland Titanium received half a million dollars in compensation; and $10m was allocated to regional employment initiatives for projects for employment in the area.</PARA>
<PARA> Despite this 12-year ban on mining on Fraser Island, the National Party Government in Queensland, one of the coalition partners in terms of the Opposition in this chamber, has granted further leases for mining. I think it would be interesting, before we go too far down that track, to find out what the Liberal Party policy might be on matters affecting this issue. The present Liberal-National Party coalition policy on the use of export control powers reads:</PARA>
<PARA> We will abolish all export controls on the minerals and metals sector except where such exports infringe on national security or on international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA>If a Liberal-National Party government were to come to power, it would abolish, according to its policy prescription, the very means by which the Queensland Government was able to protect the environment of Fraser Island. Given the attitude of the Queensland National Party Government in granting leases, this would open this unique and fragile environment to mining. As the ban on mining on Fraser Island is the only issue on which the Opposition can parade its environmental credentials-quite apart from its most recent attempt to turn green on Antarctica-what we have in terms of the Opposition's policy commitment is a commitment, in effect, which would allow mining in this fragile area.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Stone for that interjection. That may be a relevant factor. I am reserving judgment on which figure is the more accurate. When one looks at the three-monthly figures, what does unequivocally emerge is that employment is still growing at very high rates. Because of that, the unemployment rate came down marginally in April to 6.1 per cent, even though the participation rate rose from 62.2 per cent to 62.8 per cent. That was a large increase in the participation rate, but still a reduction in the unemployment rate. Of course, those two figures, other things being equal, would be inversely related. It is also worth noting-and these are all seasonally adjusted figures-that the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in April last year was 7.8 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been asked about the performance of the States. They are quite variable. In Victoria, for example, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 5 per cent. The figures rose through the other States. Western Australia had the somewhat higher figure of 5.4 per cent; in New South Wales, it was higher at 6.4 per cent; in Queensland, the figure was 7.1 per cent; in South Australia, it was 7.4 which was, however, substantially down on the 9.2 per cent recorded in the same month last year. Tasmania was, as usual, the worst performer with a staggering unemployment rate of 9.2 per cent, and a fall of only 0.2 per cent since April of last year when the national figure had come down by 1.6 per cent. The South Australian figure had come down by 1.8 per cent. As I mentioned last week, Premier Gray was elected in 1982 on a promise to do something about jobs in Tasmania. He has clearly failed to do it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This question has obviously come a bit too late in the week for some of us! Basically, the labelling of alcoholic products is governed by the food standards code, which is part of the National Foods Standards Agreement. It is a code which is adopted in all States and Territories, apart from the Australian Capital Territory and, after today's events in the ACT Assembly, I anticipate that Rosemary Follett's Government will adopt the food standards code for the Territory. The food standards code provides a number of regimes for the labelling of alcohol. In essence, however, all products with levels of alcohol have to be labelled, setting out the percentage of alcohol content. However, in terms of the maximum allowable alcohol level for non-alcoholic or non-intoxicating beverages, the National Food Standards code provides that if beverages contain more than 0.5 per cent of alcohol by volume they cannot be labelled as non-alcoholic. For certain reasons, drinks containing a level of alcohol of less than 0.5 per cent can be classified as being non-alcoholic. We also have provisions in the food standards code for the labelling of beverages which cannot be labelled as non-alcoholic but can be labelled as being low-alcohol or reduced-alcohol and non-intoxicating. They differ according to the particular product, but in those cases as well the labels have to indicate clearly the level of alcohol in the beverage. In essence, therefore, I cannot really say what the situation is in respect of Claytons, but I can say that non-alcoholic beverages can have a maximum of 0.5 per cent of alcohol. The protection for the consumer is that there has to be adequate labelling.</PARA></TALK.START>

Since some 10,000 of the Chouf Coast refugees are now in Australia, having left behind some 2,000 relatives excluded by the 90-day provision, will the Minister grant a special waiver of the immigration points system to permit these Australian families to be reunited with relatives currently in Lebanon?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the historical circumstances affecting those people from the Chouf Coast. In fact, I visited that area before those events occurred. I think most people would agree that that is typical of many of the events that have occurred in Lebanon over the past 15 years of internecine warfare. I know that there exists a special program for Lebanon, under which, if a person's house is destroyed, and if he has relatives in Australia, he can apply within 90 days to come to Australia. That is outside any other policy requirements, such as refugee status or the points system. Lebanon is the only country receiving this favourable treatment which bypasses both the 1951 convention on refugees and the points system. It is the only exception that we make around the world. It has been in place for five or six years and I should like to remove it, but until circumstances in Lebanon change I have no intention of doing so. I should like to remove it because that would indicate great progress in attempts to end the warfare in Lebanon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator asked whether we would provide a one-off waiver for these people. The answer is no. Yesterday I met the same delegation as the honourable senator met-the delegation that prompted this question. One would be pretty heartless if one did not feel for some of the people in Lebanon in these circumstances, but if we were to provide one exemption, how many more exemptions would we be supposed to grant? What about the Kurds from Iran? What about the Tamils in Sri Lanka, the Indians in Fiji, or the people in Guatemala, El Salvador or Nicaragua? On and on it goes.</PARA>
<PARA> I recently sent a reference to the House of Representatives Committee on Community Affairs, specifically asking it to look at ways in which people could come to Australia on compassionate grounds without having to be measured by the points system or given refugee status, while at the same time guaranteeing the Australian Government and taxpayer that they would not be a financial burden. I hope that that Committee will bring forward suggestions that will meet not only this case-and we know that many of these people would make great settlers in Australia-but also other cases in which people are ruined. I think the honourable senator is aware of the type of cases I am referring to. What it comes down to in the end is that every year we receive 1.3 million inquiries-representing three million people-about immigration to Australia. That figure has to come down to 140,000. Currently 12 million displaced persons in the world are claiming refugee status. It is very hard to appeal to my compassion by saying that I should favour one group over another. If I were to do so I think it would be only for political advantage and not out of fairness and equity.</PARA>

As I said yesterday, during the development of this policy a considerable effort was devoted to ensuring that the new arrangements were consistent with the approach of the partnership for development scheme in the information industries. As I also said yesterday, they represent a transitional arrangement-from Telecom's very rigid local content scheme to a new scheme which is much more market-oriented. The industry development arrangements provide an orderly environment for increasing competition and promoting the restructuring of the local telecommunications equipment industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. I want to try to help the honourable senator to understand what I am saying. I am saying that a very controlled, rigid point system was operated by Telecom for many years. An exit from that scheme to a market-oriented scheme has to be done in an orderly way. The purpose of that is to promote the restructuring of a local telecommunications equipment industry over the four-year period of the industry development arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because of a desire for consistency in the approach adopted in the partnership scheme, the industry development arrangements focus on research and development, export performance and local value added. Industry development schemes permit these activities to be undertaken in any segment of the customer premises equipment sector. That is in great contrast with Telecom's previous approach, which essentially required local production of any product which was to be supplied in Australia. The approach is directly in line with the emphasis on strategic business formulation which is inherent in the partnership scheme.</PARA>

An understanding of the customer premises equipment industry would lead one to the instant conclusion that it is highly fragmented at present.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised by the Minister for Transport and Communications that claims that the Federal Government's aviation policy is responsible for the loss of millions of dollars of tourist revenue in Western Australia are clearly unsupportable. The reported surplus of hotel accommodation in Perth is clearly the result of commercial decisions having been made within the Western Australian tourism industry. Undoubtedly, it is also a consequence of the extensive development which occurred in the lead-up to the America's Cup in 1987.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Any claim that Qantas Airways Ltd has prevented carriers from flying to Perth can be dismissed by reference to the fact that the Federal Government determines the grant of rights and levels of capacity to be operated on routes into and out of Australia. It is quite appropriate that the Government should consult with Qantas as the national carrier. This is the practice for all governments around the world. Negotiations for access of foreign airlines to Australia must take into account judgments about the balance of opportunities and benefits, both for Australia and for Qantas. While the views of all interested parties are given due weight, ultimately the decision is one for the Federal Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Transport and Communications consults in this respect with the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories whose responsibilities include, in turn, consultation with tourism bodies, such as the Australian Travel Industry Association and the provision of a coordinated approach to tourism matters at the national level. It consults on all major issues affecting inbound tourism to Australia and specifically on international landing rights negotiations. In addition, the Department of Transport and Communications receives direct representations from tourist organisations on specific issues relating to the provision of international air services.</PARA>
<PARA> In recent months substantial increases in seat capacity to Perth have been agreed to for a number of Asian carriers and discussions with other Asian government authorities are planned for later this year. It is a matter for these airlines to make their own commercial decisions regarding their pattern of operations within the overall entitlements agreed for them. The Federal Government does not interfere in these commercial decisions.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government can and does encourage foreign airlines to take up their entitlements to serve Perth. Finally, in terms of statistics, of the 15 carriers which have been granted rights to service Perth only eight, including Qantas, have chosen to exercise their entitlements.

<PARA> I think I should remind the honourable senator why it is that we are taking these important steps. Enterprises such as Telecom Australia and Australia Post provide services which are important to our economy and form a significant input to the costs of many industries. Obviously any improvements that we can make in the way that these services are delivered will lead to economic benefits to the community as a whole and assist in improving our international competitiveness. The Government's reform packages recognise that, to realise these efficiency gains in the way the enterprises deliver their services-letters in the case of Australia Post and telecommunications in the case of Telecom-the enterprises need to be able to maximise the use of the assets employed in these businesses.</PARA>
<PARA> To allow for this, it is normal practice to provide an incidentals power in the enterprises' enabling statutes. The Government intends that this practice be continued in the future. However, the Government's reform package also protects against the wild cases being speculated by Senator Lewis by providing for a corporate planning process where enterprise boards are required to indicate what business policy directions are to be adopted in the future. Boards are to be held accountable for achieving pre-determined targets in these plans.

<TITLE>AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS: SICK LEAVE CERTIFICATES</TITLE>
<ANSWER PAGE="2302" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Chapman asked me a question in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications about air traffic controllers and sick leave at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. The response I have from the Minister is as follows: The Government, of course, deplores the disruption to services that occurred at Kingsford-Smith airport last Friday in which we understand some 11,000 people were inconvenienced. The reason, it appears, is that there was a high level of reported sickness of air traffic controllers in past weeks, especially on last Friday when further air traffic controllers reported sick that day. There was no-one to take their places who had not already worked a reasonable amount of overtime. Requests to work more than that level of overtime on Friday were refused. Accordingly, with unavailability of a senior air traffic controller and one of the aerodrome controllers, the rest of the staff refused to continue working.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is difficult to say emphatically that what was happening was industrial action but we certainly regard it as very likely. It appears that in recent weeks the level of supposed sickness at Sydney Airport has reached levels far above historic levels. I must stress, however, that this has not been brought about, on all available evidence, by controllers being required to work excessive overtime. They are working to a level of overtime which has been determined by the Industrial Relations Commission as being reasonable, which equates to one extra shift of seven hours per fortnight. That is the only amount of overtime that any air traffic controller is being required to work. I think we would all agree that this is hardly an excessive level of hours for people to work, even given that controllers have a stressful occupation.</PARA>
<PARA> For its part the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has now reinstituted a requirement for doctors' certificates to be produced by controllers taking sick leave. Since the specific bans of the air traffic controllers were lifted a couple of weeks ago, there has been substantial work on items agreed to be examined, including a review of staffing levels. Award restructuring is being progressed. The main area of non-agreement at this stage relates to shift rostering but this is being discussed by the parties.</PARA>
<PARA> In the Government's view, therefore, there is no need for industrial action because all of the concerns of the air traffic controllers are being addressed and award restructuring is being rapidly developed so as to enable the controllers to be a special case, within the meaning of that term of art, and so get pay rises ahead of most other workers.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the CAA also held discussions with the union on Tuesday, which I am told were quite productive, and further discussions are being held today concerning the difficulties experienced on Friday and steps that may be taken to prevent any recurrence. The Authority will also be instituting a number of specific measures to ensure greater staff availability and maintenance of operations. In the circumstances we believe that the Civil Aviation Authority is doing everything it can to ensure that services will be maintained.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Coulter asked me a question on the London dumping convention. I undertook to get some further information and I have been able to do that. I seek leave to have that information incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The information read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The London Dumping Convention (LDC) is an international convention on the prevention of marine pollution by dumping of wastes and other matter. It was drafted in 1973 and its adoption by a large number of maritime nations was a landmark in international environmental responsibility. To achieve acceptance it was necessary to define the scope of the convention closely.</PARA>
<PARA> The convention refers to any deliberate disposal at sea of wastes or other substances carried by ships, aircraft or other man-made structures at sea for the purpose of disposal. It does not apply to other discharges (such as ``operating discharges'') from ships, to discharges from structures (such as jetties or pipelines which extend from the land) which are not ``at sea'' and does not apply to internal waters of states.</PARA>
<PARA> These matters of definition are made clear by the international legal authority on marine pollution, Dr G. J. Timagenis, who also describes article 1 of the convention as ``of preambular character'' and states, ``despite certain wider expressions in article 1, the main object of the convention is the prevention of marine pollution from dumping at sea.''</PARA>
<PARA> Jurisdiction over the waters of Spencer Gulf rests with South Australia. On the basis of the South Australian constating instruments, which are letters patent of 1836, these are ``internal waters'' of South Australia and are not subject to the Commonwealth Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act, or to the LDC. The limits of South Australia were determined in this respect by the majority of the High Court of Australia, in A Raptis and Son v South Australia (1977) 138CLR346.</PARA>
<PARA> The agreement between Mr Fraser and Mr Tonkin referred to ``marine pollution through dumping'' in the 3-mile territorial sea, and beyond the outer limit of the 3-mile territorial sea, and to implementing the provisions of the dumping convention. As I stated in the Senate yesterday, legislation regarding marine pollution through dumping was passed by South Australia and received assent in May 1984. It has not been proclaimed.</PARA>
<PARA> But Senator Coulter is wrong if he is suggesting that South Australia stated that Commonwealth legislation would apply in the 3-mile zone, in regards to land based marine pollution. In Mr Tonkin's letter to Mr Fraser of 7 May 1980 he stated quite clearly in reference to land based marine pollution: ``State legislation will control pollutant discharges within the 3-mile limit.''</PARA>
<PARA> The waters of Spencer Gulf, being internal waters of the State of South Australia, are neither within nor beyond the outer limit of the 3-mile territorial sea.</PARA>
<PARA> Even if Spencer Gulf was subject to the agreement, the land-based discharges which featured in Senator Coulter's original question (part 3) would not have been brought within the Commonwealth's reach.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I claim to have been misrepresented. An article appears in today's Sydney Morning Herald under the heading `New boy puts the boot in', which relates to the maiden speech given by Senator Faulkner on Monday. The article says in part, in relation to Senator Faulkner's comments:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Senator Faulkner-</PARA>
<PARA>chose to ignore the Senate Bible, J. R. Odgers' Australian Senate Practice, which says it is the custom for new senators' speeches not be `unduly provocative' and for the Senator to be heard without interjection or interruption. </PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to mention certain remarks had been made by Senator Faulkner and then says:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . a total of 11 Opposition senators rose and left, leaving NSW Liberal Senator Chris Puplick to reflect on Senator Faulkner's speech alone. </PARA>
<PARA>The article concludes:</PARA>
<PARA> An unbowed Senator Faulkner said he couldn't care less about tradition. He added that Senator Puplick probably remained because he agreed with what he was saying. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to make a comment about that. Firstly, it is correct that Opposition senators left and I remained alone in the chamber. I did so because I was the shadow Minister on duty. It was my responsibility to keep the House as far as the Opposition side was concerned. I did so after having been consulted by a number of my colleagues who believed that Senator Faulkner's speech had transgressed the accepted conventions and traditions of this place and were minded to raise with the President a point of order on that particular matter, thereby interrupting Senator Faulkner during the course of his maiden speech. I advised them that I thought that that was not appropriate despite what they might regard as provocation and that the correct thing to do was for them to leave the chamber rather than remain here. I asked those Opposition senators who were in the chamber who had that view to leave the chamber. I asked the whips to leave the chamber. I asked that a message be sent via our whip's office to senators who were on their way to the chamber to pay Senator Faulkner the courtesy of listening to his maiden speech indicating that they should not in fact come into the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that that was the correct way to proceed. If I had not proceeded in that fashion, we certainly would have taken a point of order about the nature of the maiden speech. To imply, even by way of a presumed tongue in cheek comment, that I in any way agreed with what Senator Faulkner was saying is, of course, incorrect. I do not have any comment to make about what Senator Faulkner may or may not believe about tradition. That is entirely a matter for him. I make the point that this was a question which reflected not only on simply the observation of a technical tradition but also on one's attitude towards the personal courtesies which are extended or not extended in this place in relation to maiden speeches and to other activities which we undertake. We now have an idea of Senator Faulkner's views on these matters. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XG4">Senator GILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 8 December, following the determination of the President that a matter of privilege raised on behalf of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts by the Chairman, Senator Black, should have precedence and the Senate's decision to refer the matter immediately to the Privileges Committee, the Committee received the following reference:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>whether there was any improper interference with a witness who gave evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts in relation to that Committee's inquiry into the use of drugs in sport. </PARA>
<PARA>Because of the importance of the issues raised for the operations of all Senate Committees, the Privileges Committee will be presenting a full report in relation to its reference as soon as possible after the Senate resumes this month. In fairness to the persons affected by the reference, however, the Committee considered it appropriate to advise the Senate of its findings as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Briefly, after considering both written and oral evidence, the Committee has found that Mr Greg Blood's action in asking Ms Sue Howland to leave his house on the day after she gave evidence to the Committee was not taken in consequence of her appearance before the Standing Committee. The Committee has also found that Mr Blood did not try to prevent Ms Howland's giving evidence, or producing a document, before the Standing Committee. Thus, the Committee has concluded that no contempt of the Senate has been committed by Mr Blood, in that he did not improperly interfere with, or inflict a penalty or injury upon, Ms Howland on account of evidence she gave before the Standing Committee in relation to its inquiry into the use of drugs in sport. </PARA>
<PARA> As indicated earlier, the Committee will give its reasons for its findings in a report canvassing issues of significance to the Senate and its committees. The Committee will also table the Hansard report of its first public hearings held pursuant to the Privilege resolutions of 25 February 1988. The Committee also wishes to emphasise at this early stage that it regards Ms Howland's notification to the Standing Committee of the events which transpired after her giving evidence to the Standing Committee, and that Committee's report to the Senate as entirely appropriate, and indeed necessary, for the proper functioning of Senate committees. The Committee considers that the resolution of the matters before it was due in no small measure to the helpfulness and cooperation both of Ms Howland and of Mr Blood, who was accompanied by his legal adviser at the hearings held last night. </PARA>

<PARA>THE HON. KIM C. BEAZLEY MP</PARA>
<PARA>PARLIAMENT HOUSE</PARA>
<PARA>10 MAY 1989</PARA>
<PARA>Madam Speaker,</PARA>
<PARA> This statement marks a new chapter in Defence's relationship with Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Defence policies adopted by the Hawke Government over the past six years have transformed our Defence strategy and reshaped the Australian Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> Defence self-reliance is inextricably linked to our industrial capacity. The capacity of our industrial base to support our Defence effort is as important to self-reliance as a Defence Force structure tailored to our strategic environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Our policies have played a cardinal role in overhauling industries vital to our Defence. These embrace Electronics, Aerospace, Ship Building and Ship Repair, Heavy and General Engineering, and Munitions. </PARA>
<PARA> These are essential elements of an industrial base to serve our Defence needs. They are equally essential for the type of commercial industry structure this Government has sought to encourage to serve Australia into the next century: A structure that is global in outlook, export oriented, and internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to announce today another major step in this process with the formal launching of Australian Defence Industries. ADI has taken over the major Defence Industry facilities still remaining in Government ownership. These establishments were previously controlled by the office of Defence production within my department. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian Defence Industries, a Government-owned corporation, will operate on a commercial basis. ADI will have an annual turnover of $400 million. It will commence as the largest single supplier of Defence equipment and services. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of 11 independently-operating Government establishments, we now have a single company with four operating divisions-Naval Engineering (principally the Garden Island Dockyard), Ammunition and Missiles, Weapons and Engineering, and Military Clothing. We have been fortunate to obtain the services of the former secretary of my department, Mr Alan Woods, as chairman of the new company. </PARA>
<PARA> The launching of Australian Defence Industries completes the process we began in 1984, when we abolished the Department of Defence Support, which had been created by our coalition predecessors. </PARA>
<PARA> By 1984 Defence Support had become one of the largest Public Service Departments, with a staff exceeding 15,000, a total outlay of $598 million, of which only $242 million was recovered from sales to customers. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Speaker, since that decision in 1984, this Government has embarked on a quiet revolution in Australian Defence Industry. </PARA>
<PARA> We have undertaken a massive program of restructuring, rationalisation and commercialisation. We have closed or are closing two Government-owned Defence factories, The Albion Explosives Factory and the Explosives Factory Maribyrnong. </PARA>
<PARA> We sold the Williamstown Naval Dockyard in Victoria and the Aircraft Workshop in South Australia. We converted the former Government aircraft factories at Fisherman's Bend and Avalon into a Government-owned enterprise, Aerospace Technologies of Australia, run strictly on business lines. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last five years the annual cost to the taxpayer of subsidies to our Government-owned Defence Factories has been cut by around $250 million. That is not a one-off saving. It is a permanent reduction in Defence outlays each year. </PARA>
<PARA> With the launching of Australian Defence Industries we have taken a further significant step away from the bureaucracy and politics that have bedevilled these Defence establishments for so many years. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, the transformation has given us the opportunity to restructure awards and employment levels. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, our actions have reduced the number of employees in dedicated Defence manufacturing facilities from more than 15,000 to 6,800 employees. This has resulted in a saving of $92 million in the wages bill alone. </PARA>
<PARA> Another round of staff reductions at ADI commencing earlier this year involved about 1300 positions. ADI's Head Office in Canberra now has just 35 people. Just four years ago the comparable number was 1,000. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be further major savings, about $8 million a year, with the decision to close the explosives factory at Maribyrnong over the next 18 months or so. </PARA>
<PARA> I must emphasise, however, that this has not been a negative exercise; a ``slash and burn'' pursuit of efficiency no matter what the consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> Our aim has been to make Government factories and dockyards not just competitive, but an integral part of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> These factories served us well in earlier times. Australia has been in the munitions business for more than 100 years. By the end of WW1 we had five Government-owned Defence factories. </PARA>
<PARA> During WW2, by mobilising Australian industry around the core of Government-owned factories, we achieved genuinely outstanding results in defence production. </PARA>
<PARA> In April 1940 Australia sent Britain 30,000 rifles. Within 14 months we had also sent 100 million rounds of small arms ammunition. To put this in perspective, British industry in 1940 was able to produce only 81,000 rifles; with some troops being forced to drill with dummy weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> Other Australian Defence production establishments responded with similarly spectacular increases in production. During the war, no fewer than 10 shipyards built three Destroyers, 12 Frigates and 60 Corvettes. </PARA>
<PARA> Successive conservative governments after WW2 failed to recognise and act on the fundamental change in our strategic circumstances. They maintained massive excess capacity in progressively more obsolete capabilities. As a result the defence industry facilities inherited by this government were in poor shape. They suffered from low morale, chronic undercapitalisation, excess capacity and totally unsatisfactory industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Speaker, the Hawke Government has finally swept away the long-held notion that industry capabilities needed for defence purposes must be carefully identified, and then preserved at public expense. That is not the way to go in today's environment. In fact, it is self-defeating. </PARA>
<PARA> Our defence industry policy has clear objectives which were spelt out in the 1987 Defence White Paper. </PARA>
<PARA> That document pointed out that while a substantial commercial workload can provide a base from which to bid for defence orders, the inverse is rarely true. The peacetime requirements of the Australian Defence Force are not usually capable of providing a viable long-term baseload for individual firms or industry sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> An insistence on maintaining specific defence industry capabilities leads to a freezing of technology and, ultimately, to a decline in capability. Defence, like the economy at large, is best served by an industry structure that can hold its own in the world market, capable of recognising opportunities and seizing them. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not abandoned the idea of nurturing particular capabilities in special circumstances. But Government support of that kind is no longer an easy way out for firms unable to compete in the commercial arena. </PARA>
<PARA> This contribution to the government's micro-reform agenda was possible because, as my colleague the Treasurer puts it, we tackled the big picture first. We recognised that a more responsive financial sector was a prerequisite for change. </PARA>
<PARA> By floating the dollar, relaxing exchange controls, and freeing up the banks we gave the economy access to goods and services at world prices. We have signalled that the days of Australia's inward-looking, protectionist stance have gone for good. </PARA>
<PARA> Industry has been a direct beneficiary of the accord process with the ACTU. The government has succeeded in maintaining a wages policy under which real unit labour costs have fallen by about ten percent in the past five years. </PARA>
<PARA> That restraint will continue under the arrangements announced by the Treasurer on April 12. The wages-tax agreement contained in that statement will further consolidate the linkage between productivity and wages and, between wages restraint and the growth of employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is overseeing a sweeping overhaul of the industrial award system, the most momentous change in 80 years in the sphere of industrial relations. The overhaul of occupational classifications and skill categorisations promises immense benefits to both employers and employees. This will allow Australians to adapt more easily to changing technologies. </PARA>
<PARA> These initiatives are reshaping industrial practices so that industry can adjust to a more competitive environment. In defence our principle instrument for change has been a greatly expanded capital procurement program. Fourteen years ago the capital program represented about 18 per cent of defence outlays. Today the equivalent figure is around 30 per cent. We intend to keep it at that level. </PARA>
<PARA> When this Government took office the average level of local content in new equipment acquisitions was about 30 per cent. Now it has reached 59 per cent. In the 1990's we estimate that it will reach an average of 70% as projects such as the new submarine and the Anzac frigate project gather pace. </PARA>
<PARA> Our objective is to foster Australian prime contractors able to achieve high levels of local content without subsidies. The shipbuilding, ship repair and engineering industries exemplify this approach. </PARA>
<PARA> The submarine project costing nearly $4 billion and the ANZAC Frigate project costing about $5 billion have prompted a major restructuring of the Australian shipbuilding and ship repair industries. </PARA>
<PARA> This restructuring started with the sale to the private sector of the former Williamstown Naval Dockyard in Melbourne. Employment in the dockyard has reduced from 2,200 to 750 and the productivity of the overall organisation has increased at least fourfold. The Landmark Industrial Award at the dockyard has fundamentally changed the way people look at their jobs. People are encouraged to develop their skills in order to become an integral part of a multiskilled workforce. </PARA>
<PARA> Some 23 unions have been reduced to three. All this has occurred in a dockyard once notorious for inefficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> Last Friday Williamstown Dockyard launched, three months ahead of schedule, the Frigate FFG 05, the first warship launched in this country in nearly twenty years. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Speaker, under this Government, Australia is now back in the business of naval warship building. </PARA>
<PARA> The owner, Australian Marine Engineering Consolidated Ltd, (AMECON), is tendering the German Meko design for the ANZAC ships, in conjunction with Cable Price Downer, a New Zealand engineering firm. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to close Cockatoo Island Dockyard and the Wran Government's decision to close the Newcastle State Dockyard cleared the way for the emergence of a second bidder for the ANZAC Frigate contract. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian Warships Systems, comprising TNT, Carrington Slipways, AWA and the New Zealand Engineering Firm, McConnell Dowell, has teamed with the Dutch company, Royal Schelde, and has proposed the Dutch M class design. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important development has been our decision to relocate half the fleet to Western Australia over the next ten years. To accommodate that move, the Naval base HMAS Stirling is being expanded at a cost of more than $300 million. </PARA>
<PARA> We now envisage two centres of ship repair located near the main naval bases on either side of the continent. In Western Australia the facility is to be established entirely in the private sector with investment in the first stage totalling more than $20 million. A shiplift has been built and the first docking of an Oberon submarine has been completed. The destroyer escort, HMAS Swan, is currently undergoing refit at the facility. </PARA>
<PARA> Garden Island Dockyard will remain the East Coast Ship Repair Centre and will remain in Government ownership as part of ADI. It will increasingly have to look to the commercial market for part of its workload. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government has also initiated important changes in the Aerospace Industry. This sector developed its wartime skills in areas such as missiles and aircraft. The IKARA missile and the Nomad aircraft were at world standard in their day. However as time passed the industry lagged, particularly in management, finance and marketing. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, the Aviation and Aerospace activities of the former Government aircraft factories have now been combined in a new company, Aerospace Technologies of Australia, (ASTA), established by legislation of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> ASTA is an independent, fully commercial company, with a board of directors experienced in business and keen to see the company expand on a profitable basis, both in Australia and International markets. It has made substantial progress in this direction already. </PARA>
<PARA> ASTA's most recent success is a contract from Boeing to manufacture the composite rudder system for its 757 aircraft. This is the firm's third major contract with Boeing and has a potential value around $125 million. In addition, the company has signed an agreement with the Sikorsky company to take over from Hawker de Havilland as the prime local contractor for the assembly and test program of the navy's eight second phase Seahawk helicopters. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to be able to advise the House that the ASTA board is now exploring the sale of some equity in the company. Companies with key technologies, or access to markets, may be invited to make strategic investments in relevant parts of ASTA and their facilities. The Government believes that this will maximise returns to the taxpayers of Australia as well as enhancing aerospace industry's prospects. </PARA>
<PARA> My department has put its relationship with the rest of the aerospace industry on a normal commercial footing. The private sector counterpart to ASTA is Hawker de Havilland which took over the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Hawker's have restructured substantially and have been winning defence and commercial work. They recently signed a commercial development contract with McDonnell Douglas to design a new light helicopter which has already achieved preliminary sales. </PARA>
<PARA> This industry structure is based on two major companies as prime contractors associated with specialist sub-contractors. It offers the best compromise between competition and economies of scale and bodes well for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The Defence program has also stimulated change in the electronics and systems industry, which in a strategic sense, probably has become the industry of greatest importance to the defence effort. In the last three years the submarine and frigate projects have generated major opportunities in the electronics sector. Most of the world's leading companies in this field now take a more active interest in Australia and are doing business with Australian companies. </PARA>
<PARA> As with shipbuilding and aerospace, local companies are starting to act as prime contractors and linking with overseas firms to tap their technologies and access to markets. They are starting to acquire the necessary technical, financial and managerial expertise to compete effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that big defence projects have attracted into Australia, technologies and investment in this industry that would not be here otherwise. Some are already looking actively for civil sector work to maintain Australian operations for the long term. </PARA>
<PARA> To an important degree, the increasing sophistication of some sections of Australia's electronics industry has been driven by defence-based research. Perhaps the outstanding example is our remarkable Jindalee over-the-horizon radar system, which will give our forces a surveillance reach of some 3,000 kilometres. </PARA>
<PARA> Over a decade of research and trials by the defence science and technology organisation has established the principles used in the system and the hardware and software elements have been demonstrated experimentally, Jindalee, as an operational system, will enter service in the mid-1990's. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian companies have been involved throughout this process, and will be involved more and more as the operational phase progresses, with up to three radar systems being envisaged. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot stress too strongly that my aims for industry development, as Minister for Defence, complement those of my colleague, Senator Button, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. </PARA>
<PARA> Defence has also made a significant contribution to the Government's commitment to help Australian firms to tap export markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The defence offsets program has been progressively refined and broadened over the years, and it has done much to encourage long-term arrangements between overseas and Australian suppliers. The offsets program is now starting to run down because of the success of our overall efforts to encourage local industry involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Speaker, Australian content in the submarine contract was 65 percent. With the Anzac ships the Australian and New Zealand content should reach 70 percent and, in fact, with offsets work added, could reach 80 percent. </PARA>
<PARA> We have reached the point where Australian firms are able and more than ready to take on the role of prime contractor for major defence programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously this means a progressively lower foreign content in such programs and a commensurate decline in new offsets obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the program continues to provide valuable assistance for Australian companies. Last financial year, new offsets obligations were a relatively modest $25 million. But past obligations discharged in that same period, for offsets and Australian industry participation programs, totalled more than $120 million. </PARA>
<PARA> Three weeks ago, defence signed deeds of agreement with four big overseas suppliers of high technology defence equipment for the accumulation of defence offsets credit. These deeds of agreement will allow the companies to undertake long-term programs with local companies to help the Australian partners meet our own future needs and aim at export markets. The companies concerned already have begun negotiations that could lead to Australian industry involvement in joint development, production and export sales. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also fostered the development of a number of specialised technologies to meet particular Australian requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year we spent $12 million to develop generic technologies and a further $27 million to facilitate Australian industry involvement in our capital equipment projects. </PARA>
<PARA> In June 1987 I announced an extensive revision and streamlining of the regulations governing exports of defence-type goods. This is a fairly specialised export area but it has the capacity to foster and maintain specialist skills and reduce the cost of such goods on the Australian market. Last year we received 400 applications for the export of defence goods, of which only 2% were declined. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is critically dependent on access to advanced western military technology if it is to realise its goal of self reliant defence, and we are just as critically dependent on access to advanced western commercial technology if the Government's objectives of more internationally competitive, outward-looking Australian industry are to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia therefore adheres to guidelines developed by the main NATO countries and Japan for the export of advanced commercial technology with dual civil and military applications. Full observance of these guidelines is vital in maintaining this access. </PARA>
<PARA> Last month we joined the Co-ordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, (COCOM), which administers these arrangements. I am confident that this will both facilitate advanced technology transfer into Australia, and help increase exports from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Speaker, under the Hawke Government defence self-reliance is no longer a mirage, but a realisable goal. Our policy of self reliance has two central pillars. The first pillar is a clear definition of our primary strategic environment, which in turn dictates a force structure matching our unique geographic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The second pillar is a competitive, technologically proficient, and adaptable industry base, able to supply and support the changing requirements of our defence force. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Speaker, the Government believes its redirection of our defence industry in recent years has already produced significant long term benefits for Australia. I am confident that Australian industry increasingly sees our defence policies in the same light. </PARA>

<PARA>MINISTERIAL STATEMENT IN RESPONSE TO THE `PERSONNEL WASTAGE IN THE DEFENCE FORCE', REPORT OF 10 NOVEMBER 1988 BY THE DEFENCE SUB-COMMITTEE OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, DEFENCE AND TRADE</PARA>
<PARA>BY</PARA>
<PARA>THE HON DAVID SIMMONS MP</PARA>
<PARA>MINISTER FOR DEFENCE SCIENCE AND PERSONNEL</PARA>
<PARA>11 MAY 1989</PARA>
<PARA>Introduction</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I present the Government's response to the report, `Personnel Wastage in the Defence Force', prepared by the Defence Sub-Committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and tabled in the Parliament on 10 November 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee sought to analyse the extent and magnitude of the personnel wastage problems in the Australian Defence Force, and its effect on the ADF's capability. The Report offered a series of recommendations which the Committee believed would aid in the retention of personnel in the ADF. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Government I thank the members of the Committee for the time and energy they spent in preparing this report, and for their demonstrated concern for the well-being of the Australian Defence Force and for the defence of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> As my predecessor Mrs Kelly said to the Committee in August last year, the profession of arms is a unique occupation. It requires people with special skills and a high level of commitment to their work and to their nation. I am pleased to have this opportunity to give due recognition to those who contribute so much to Australia's defence. </PARA>
<PARA> The men and women of our Navy, Army and Air Force and their families are a very important part of our Australian community. They are justly proud of their Service and of their own individual achievements. It is a pride in which we can all share. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, during the Bicentennial celebrations, millions of Australians did share that pride, and paid tribute to that skill and commitment during the Naval Salute, the Army Tattoo and the Air Show. </PARA>
<PARA> But recognition of the Defence Force is not something that should be confined to such occasions, or remembered only on Anzac Day. While it may not always be so visible, that skill and commitment continues ever day at hundreds of locations both in Australia and overseas. The Government acknowledges and fully supports that commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> Two other important groups also need to be recognised. Firstly, the spouses and children of members of the Defence Force. While they provide invaluable personal support, the inescapable reality of Service life means that these families must endure considerable disruption and separation. This Government has been the first to truly recognise and act on the problems of Services families. </PARA>
<PARA> The second group which needs to be recognised is the civilian element of Defence. The provision of Australia's defence is a partnership to which both the Defence Force and the Department of Defence make a vital contribution. Many thousands in the Department work directly for and in support of the Services, many others, such as those in Defence Science have, as their primary and predominant task, the support of the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government's strong and continuing support for the Defence Force is a matter of public record. Despite the present era of economic constraint and reducing public sector expenditures, the real level of Defence funding has been maintained. The 1987 Defence White Paper has provided a logical and coherent basis for force development and exercise planning. A wide range of new high technology equipment has been provided or is on order. Later this year, Exercise Kangaroo 89 will provide the Defence Force with a great opportunity to test its skills and capabilities right across the northern part of the continent. </PARA>
<PARA>Personnel Wastage</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The present levels of personnel wastage from the Defence Force is an issue of very great importance and concern. The Government has not sought to deny this fact, nor to disguise, in any way, the extent of the problem. We have been most active in taking effective measures to deal with this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> We have reviewed our manpower statistics so that the true extent of the wastage problem, and its impact on specific employment categories can be assessed accurately. This analysis demonstrated that the primary concern with separations is not necessarily the overall numbers leaving, but rather the impact on some specific employment categories. </PARA>
<PARA> We have analysed the reasons for the current high wastage rates. The major conclusion of that analysis is that there is no one cause for increased wastage and thus there is no one simple answer. </PARA>
<PARA> The public image of the Defence Force, the challenge of peace-time service, job satisfaction, Service-civilian relationship, conditions of service, housing, the needs and interests of spouses and families, education, postings policy, personnel management, competition from the wider economy, the simple desire to do something different. These issues and more are all involved in the wastage equation. </PARA>
<PARA> All this analysis was made available to the Committee by the Defence Organization in three agreed and detailed and public submissions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committees's deliberations and their report took place within the context of a continuing program of Government action to both address the wastage problem, and more broadly, to improve the conditions and personnel management of the Defence Force. Many of the Committee's recommendations had already been implemented or were in train before the Committee's report was tabled. Action has continued during the period in which we have been analysing the Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of our overall Defence Force personnel policy we have been actively seeking better personnel management practices, and an ongoing improvement in conditions of service. </PARA>
<PARA> We have introduced some creative new schemes that go beyond what the Committee's report recommends. We have continued to give priority to the areas we recognized as crucial before we had the benefit of this Report. We have, I believe, a proven record of performance across the full range of Service personnel issues, including</PARA>
<PARA> successful support for substantial increases in many key general and specialist allowances;</PARA>
<PARA> the provision of financial, educational and support arrangements for Service families;</PARA>
<PARA> a commitment of $750m to address the long neglect of Service housing, with more than $200M spent in the last two years; and</PARA>
<PARA> recognition of the important area of morale and job satisfaction through more responsive career management, and increased devolution of authority and responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> These much needed improvements were introduced as part of an overall personnel management strategy. They were introduced in advance of the Committee's report. Where these improvements also overcome a perceived cause of wastage, we know we are on the right track. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's Report, like any report to Government, has the status of advice, not policy. I am happy to say, however, that much of what this Report recommends has been implemented, is in the process of being implemented, or will be. </PARA>
<PARA> A detailed response to each of the Committee's recommendations has been finalized, and I will table it at the completion of this Statement. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Statement, I want to go beyond an examination of the Committee's recommendations. I intend to place those recommendations within the broader scope of the Government's initiatives on Defence Force personnel policy. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one very important difference between the Government's personnel policy strategy and the terms of reference that constrained the Committee's Report. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Chairman said in his tabling speech:</PARA>
<PARA> If people are asked what is wrong with their organization and why they are leaving it, then that is precisely the kind of information they will provide; they are unlikely to say much about the positive aspects of their employment. </PARA>
<PARA> ADF personnel policy, however, cannot choose to ignore the positive aspects of ADF employment. Indeed, personnel policy cannot be run by wastage. </PARA>
<PARA> In that regard the Parliamentary Report is not, and cannot be, the engine for reform in ADF employment and family support. Reform was already in progress at the time the Committee's Report was in preparation, and has continued since. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's Report has provided a valuable focus for discussion; and the spirit of their recommendations fits in very well with what we have been doing. However, I am sure that no member of the Committee would want to see their Report taken as the outer limit of what the Government might do to improve retention. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, the Government's initiatives in the area of Defence Force personnel policy do go beyond the scope of the Committee's report. Our initiatives take up the Committee's call for awareness, concern and action. They involve some major changes. </PARA>
<PARA>Review of DFRDB</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Today I announced that there will be a complete review of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme (DFRDB). The Chiefs of Staff Committee has advised me that the DFRDB scheme no longer meets Service objectives, nor provides the right incentives to those who choose to make the profession of arms their lifetime career. The Committee has recommended that the scheme be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government concurs. </PARA>
<PARA> There are effectively three groups of ADF personnel. There are those who join up for a short period, often to learn a skill or a trade, who serve out their period of engagement, and who leave to join the civilian workforce. </PARA>
<PARA> There are those who, encouraged by the structure of the DFRDB scheme, serve for twenty years in the ADF, and, in their late thirties or early forties, take their benefit and enter on a second career. </PARA>
<PARA> The third group consists of those who serve as members of the ADF until retirement, making the Service their life's work. </PARA>
<PARA> The DFRDB scheme works well for the second and third groups at the expense of the first. </PARA>
<PARA> While fitness and strength are still very important attributes, the Defence Force is coming to rely more and more on skills and technology. Therefore, it is time for us to question seriously whether twenty years is still the optimum period of military service for all groups in the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> The DFRDB scheme was established in 1972 with the aim of providing a scheme which-would be easily understood by its membership; would be simple to administer; and would provide retirement benefits suitable for the special requirements of its members on re-settlement into civilian life. The scheme is now failing to meet at least the last of these objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> All public sector superannuation schemes, including DFRDB, are required to conform to the Government's occupational superannuation standards. With regard to the DFRDB scheme, the only significant change which may affect benefits relates to the reasonable benefit limits which are to be set by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. These limits relate to the size of lump sums and pensions on retirement, relative to the level of salary at retirement. While these limits are yet to be set for the DFRDB scheme, they are likely to affect only a few very senior officers. I will make an announcement on the effect of the reasonable benefits limits when they are decided. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee said that any review of the DFRDB scheme must be on the basis of no detriment to current contributors. I agree. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me be quite clear about this. Subject to the effect of the superannuation standards I have just mentioned, the Government gives an ironclad guarantee to those presently in service that the benefits of the existing DFRDB scheme for which they are contributing will remain available to be taken up when they leave the Services. </PARA>
<PARA> Some months ago my predecessor announced a limited examination of dependants and invalidity benefits under the DFRDB scheme. That examination will be completed. </PARA>
<PARA> In that respect, it has been of much concern to the Government that orphans' benefits under the DFRDB scheme are considerably less than under the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. I am pleased to announce that from the first pension pay day in July, orphan benefits will increase by some $4300 per annum. Full details of this interim adjustment will be announced separately. </PARA>
<PARA> A small board of expert people will be appointed to review the DFRDB scheme and to recommend what changes should be made to it. The ADF will be represented on the review board. </PARA>
<PARA> Complete details of the terms of reference for the full review of the DFRDB scheme, and the composition of the board will be announced shortly. There will be opportunities for service personnel to make submissions. </PARA>
<PARA> The terms of reference for the review board will include a requirement to investigate and report on the feasibility of providing serving members with the option of transferring to any new scheme, if they so wish. There will be absolutely no compulsion for any serving members to do so, if they would prefer not to. </PARA>
<PARA> The review of the DFRDB scheme will also be, in effect, a review of the personnel needs of the ADF into the nineties and beyond. The DFRDB scheme must provide ADF personnel with fair recompense for their service, but must also be a major structural element in the pattern of ADF employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The great challenge for Service personnel management into the future will be to make the ADF a competitive and attractive employer of the specialists whose skills our re-equipment program and the modernization of our force structure requires. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee rejected the Department of Defence's analysis that while wastage was of major concern, it was of serious concern only in some specific specialist areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Without reopening this debate, I think it is important to realise that in future the following is a likely scenario: As Australian industry restructures and develops, there will be a shortfall in skilled trades, engineers, project managers and executives until the Government's greatly accelerated tertiary training effort can take up the slack. Skilled members of the Defence Force will be targeted to fill such shortfalls. </PARA>
<PARA> This case is one where, I suggest, a personnel policy that allowed itself to be directed by wastage would be off the track. </PARA>
<PARA> The DFRDB review will be predicated on the future manpower needs of the ADF, and on the retirement incomes policy that this Government has put in place throughout the workforce. </PARA>
<PARA>The ADF and Community Standards</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government bases its ADF personnel strategy on two fundamentals. The first is the recognition that the profession of arms is a unique profession, with unique traditions, duties and skills. </PARA>
<PARA> The second is that the Defence community, while it is unique, is also part of the Australian community. ADF personnel and their families live much of their lives just as all the rest of us do. They are affected by the same rules and regulations, they are influenced by the same social dynamics, they feel the same aspirations as the rest of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> And that society is changing. It is from a changing society that the ADF has to recruit, and in a changing society that the ADF has to retain, its personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot afford to hanker after the values and work practices of the 1950s. We live and work in the late 80s, and the ADF must accommodate itself more to that reality. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a reality that includes increasing job mobility, especially by younger members of the work force. It includes the legitimate and rising expectations of women for education, for their own careers, for child care. It includes all the legitimate expectations that members of the Defence Force share with every other Australian-expectations like good quality housing and educational opportunities for their children. </PARA>
<PARA> To ignore wider social movements in a serious discussion about Service personnel policy is to duck the issues. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also ducking the issues to pretend that the two fundamentals on which our personnel strategy is based are always harmonious, and this is the one area in which I and the Government are strongly at odds with the recommendations of the Cross Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Review of ADF Pay</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 21 of the Report asks the Minister to direct the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal to ``undertake a complete job analysis and job evaluation review of the ADF, exclusive of National Wage Guidelines, for the purpose of establishing wage levels which are based on the recognition of the members of the profession of arms as a distinctive institution.''</PARA>
<PARA> There are two reasons why this recommendation is unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> First, it attacks the independence of the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal. The Tribunal is established by legislation to be an independent body which reviews Defence Force pay and allowance claims on their merits. The Tribunal is not subject to Government direction, nor should it be. </PARA>
<PARA> The only limitation placed on the Tribunal is the requirement that it should have regard to principles determined by the Industrial Relations Commission. These principles include the National Wage Guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason the recommendation is unacceptable is the principle that the National Wage Guidelines apply to all Australian employees. In this sense, the notion of Service personnel as members of the Australian community overrides their membership of a unique profession. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Government does not accept this particular recommendation, we do believe that a full pay review should be undertaken-a review within the Guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> The current structural efficiency principle is designed to reward enterprises that improve efficiency and provide more varied and fulfilling jobs. The ADF has commenced a pay review under this principle. </PARA>
<PARA> This review will address the compression of salaries of senior officers as recommended by the Committee. The review will incorporate the outcome of the current structural review of higher ADF staff arrangements being undertaken by Major General Sanderson. </PARA>
<PARA> An important additional outcome of this aspect of the case should be more fulfilling jobs for those posted to Canberra. This will address the perceived dissatisfaction in the middle levels of the ADF towards Canberra postings-a topic much discussed in the Committee's Report. </PARA>
<PARA> The ADF pay case will also seek pay adjustments based on structural changes and efficiency measures introduced across the whole ADF. The case will therefore encompass the pay of all ranks in the ADF. The aim is to develop the case for submission to the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal later in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> A leaner, more efficient organization uses every resource in a more effective way. And people are our best resource. If they feel they have little effective input into the Defence process, are just shuffling papers, or duplicating someone else's job, then dissatisfaction and disillusion are inevitable. The current structural review of higher Defence Force staff arrangements is directed towards rectifying such problems. </PARA>
<PARA>Civilianization</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government intends to continue our policy of civilianization within Defence. </PARA>
<PARA> I am aware that the Committee had some difficulty with this concept. Let me reassure them, and this House, that civilianization does not, and will not be allowed to degrade combat capability or the operational or manning flexibility of the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> The aim of civilianization is not to convert positions from military to civilian for its own sake, or for reasons solely of peacetime cost-effectiveness. Rather the aim is to ensure that our military/civilian balance is the one which maximises the combat potential of the ADF. Used this way, civilianization releases Service professionals from tasks which do not require specific military skills and puts them in field positions where these skills are needed. Civilianization thus increases the ``teeth to tail'' ratio across the whole of the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA>Conditions of Service and Service Families</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn now to the other two major areas: the Service family, and conditions of Service. </PARA>
<PARA> I plan to take these together, because they are by nature related. </PARA>
<PARA> Conditions of service are the elements of ADF remuneration that recognise, in a tangible way, that the profession of arms is a unique profession. </PARA>
<PARA> Specialist allowances recognise special skills, and other allowances make up for disadvantages or difficulties inherent in Service life, most of them clustered around the operational need for postings. </PARA>
<PARA> Postings impact very much indeed on Service families. The dissatisfactions identified in this area by the Committee relate very closely to the effect of mobility. Thus, education, housing and disturbance and rental allowances are all involved here. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this Government, the Service family has become, for the first time, a recognised entity with its own special needs, pressures and difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Government, and in particular my predecessor, Mrs Kelly can be very proud of what has been done. I do not have the leisure to go through what we have achieved today, but Mrs Kelly has already reported to this House on the implementation of the recommendations of the Hamilton Report. </PARA>
<PARA> We intend to proceed with an alternative to the Committee's suggestion for a White Paper on Service families. There have been enough reviews and reports. We prefer to keep achieving results. </PARA>
<PARA> A Defence families policy plan therefore will be incorporated in a proposed Defence Personnel Policy Plan. That plan will parallel the Defence Five Year Programme. The family policy plan will coordinate family support measures and allow for a systematic periodic review of these arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>Disturbance Allowance</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Despite improvements in postings policy, mobility is a fact of Service life, and disturbance an inevitable consequence. </PARA>
<PARA> Disturbance Allowance is a difficult allowance to administer. It is meant to cover the range of costs incurred by an individual or family during a removal that is not individually reimbursed. Naturally personal circumstances and expenses of a removal will vary to some degree. </PARA>
<PARA> Recognising the mobility of the ADF, we consider the present arrangement for married members is sound whereby the amount of Disturbance Allowance is tiered according to the number of removals experienced. </PARA>
<PARA> Present rates effective from 29 November 1988 range from $545 for the first and second removals to $1095 after seven or more removals. </PARA>
<PARA> We support the recommendation that there should be a survey of Disturbance Allowance. Defence has set in train a co-operative study with 12 large organisations, both in the public and private sector, which have a requirement to re-locate their employees. On a confidential basis each organisation is being asked to provide details of the degrees of assistance provided to its employees to re-locate. Defence will reciprocate by providing details of its assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> It is hoped to have the survey completed by June. The data gained could provide a valuable insight into approaches in other industries and assist in deciding whether present assistance provided to the ADF is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>Temporary Rental Allowance</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's recommendation on Temporary Rental Allowance reflects a general dissatisfaction with the operation of this form of housing assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> The whole arrangement for this allowance requires major improvement. Therefore, the Defence Housing Authority will, on a progressive basis, substitute itself as the lessee of rented housing. </PARA>
<PARA> That is to say, when the Defence housing stock is inadequate for the ADF's total needs in a particular area, the DHA will take out leases with private owners and the individual ADF tenants will occupy these houses on the same basis as if the houses were part of the permanent Defence housing stock. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the DHA also will establish a `market' among ADF members who are home-owners and who are leaving their homes on posting. </PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements when fully in place would remove, for many, the frustrations of house hunting in a new locality and should enable more door-to-door removals with considerable benefits to families who at present must sometimes endure longer than necessary stays in temporary accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements will require a lot of preparatory work by the DHA. However, the DHA will take over the role progressively from 1 November this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Initially, the DHA intervention will be to remove some aspects of the present system which the Sub-Committee criticises. Members eligible to rent privately will advise the DHA the details of suitable accommodation that has been found.</PARA>
<PARA> The DHA will take out the lease and the member will be required to pay only the normal personal rental contribution. Bonds paid by individuals will be eliminated, and experienced DHA staff will manage repairs and maintenance in consultation with individual landlords. </PARA>
<PARA> The important element of choice in rental housing will be preserved. I am aware that some families choose to spend more on housing than the normal level of contribution. Such families will be able to opt out of the new system, while still receiving the same level of housing assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> As the DHA operates on a commercial basis, it will charge the Department of Defence a fee for its services. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is proud of its achievements in Defence housing. Progression in new construction and acquisitions has been matched by improvements in the speed and standard of repairs and maintenance. Housing Management Centres are being progressively established by the DHA in all regions of Defence housing concentration. Letters from tenants attest to the high degree of satisfaction with the new standards of repairs and maintenance which these centres are delivering. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the report in 1986 of the Task Force that examined Public Service and Defence Force housing, the Government adopted a set of principles to govern the provision of housing for its employees. A key principle is that there should be compensation provided for those who incur a housing disability by virtue of employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Rents paid by Defence Force personnel have always been viewed by this Government as conditions of service. There is no intention of changing that policy. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two other Defence housing initiatives that I wish to address today.</PARA>
<PARA>Renegotiation of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement (Services)</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The first of these concerns the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement (Services)-the CSHA(S). Under that agreement, the Commonwealth provides subsidised loans to the States to provide low income housing which in turn is leased to Defence for Service housing. Some 14000 houses presently are provided under that agreement. It is the view of the Government that the agreement has outlived its usefulness. The agreement has failed to provide and maintain housing of the quality or maintenance standard required by Defence Force families. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to announce that the Government has agreed to seek the renegotiation of this agreement with the States. This action will greatly assist Service families by allowing for a marked improvement in the standard of Service housing. </PARA>
<PARA> Under our proposal, the Defence Housing Authority would take over the ownership of 7000 CSHA(S) houses. These houses could then be upgraded or replaced. The remaining 7000 CSHA(S) houses would be released to the States for public housing purposes over the next five years. These houses would be replaced by new housing provided under the existing Defence housing program. </PARA>
<PARA>Post May 1985 Housing Assistance</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The second housing initiative concerns the form of housing assistance to be provided for those who enlisted after May 1985 and who are ineligible for the Defence Service Homes Loan of $25,000 over 25 years. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been the Government's wish to establish a new form of housing assistance which would help to retain members in service and which would in some way provide a benefit proportional to the service rendered, and to the housing disability encountered by virtue of service. </PARA>
<PARA> The new scheme, which I announced today will, as previously, require an initial period of service of six years. Having met that eligibility period, a member who enlists after 14 May 1985 will be entitled to a housing loan of $40,000 with interest being subsidised so that it remains 40% below the market housing loan interest rate. This subsidy will be provided for a period equal to the number of years in excess of six that a member serves. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, a 16% market rate would mean a subsidised loan interest rate of 9.6%. Loan subsidies will be available for a maximum of 25 years. The maximum subsidy period is 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Details of the scheme will be announced separately. Eligibility for the scheme will begin to accrue when members reach their six years service point in May 1991. At that time, Service personnel who enlisted before May 1985, who are still serving and who have not used their Defence Service Homes Loan, will be given a one time option to forgo that entitlement in favour of the new scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Assistance for Defence Force Families</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> One of the most important products of the Hamilton Report was the establishment of ADFILS-the Australian Defence Family Information Section. By providing Service families with information and the skills to use it, ADFILS' aim is to develop a better community spirit and to enable families to help themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> ADFILS staff are presently working on projects such as employment opportunities and work skills for spouses, health care and parenting issues, neighbourhood houses, child care, sole parent support groups, children's educational programs and youth activities. </PARA>
<PARA> This self help approach, and local Defence community efforts needs to be recognised and fostered. I therefore have given approval for grants of up to $20,000 per year to be made to each major base for allocation to organizations of Defence families which are formed with the objective of assisting local community welfare. Within guidelines necessary to protect the spending of public moneys, the priorities for use of the funds will be at the discretion of the local organizations. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe these grants will encourage innovative ideas on community support and will be a useful mechanism for the Defence community to determine its own highest priority needs. </PARA>
<PARA>Family Information Network (FIND)</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> We have also, since Mrs Kelly reported to Parliament on the implementation of the Hamilton Report, introduced the FIND system, a 008 number that Service personnel and their families can ring, from anywhere in Australia, to get information on their entitlements or about community services in a new posting, or about anything else they need to know. </PARA>
<PARA> FIND is convenient and confidential. It answers a need identified in the Hamilton Report for Service families to have a ``clear choice'' to direct their questions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obviously answering a need. The planning estimate was fifty calls a day; but the inquiries have been running at between two and three times that rate. </PARA>
<PARA> FIND is a case of appropriate, and relatively new, technology being harnessed to an identified need. 008 telephone services have been gradually increasing in popularity since their introduction, and people are now familiar with the idea. I am delighted that the Defence Force has been able to respond with a creative, simple solution to a time-honoured problem. </PARA>
<PARA>Education</PARA>

<PARA> The Cross Report identified education as an area of special concern to Defence families. Progress, real progress, is being made in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Education Council (AEC), the peak group consisting of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the State Ministers for Education and their Directors General, set up a committee to study mobility issues, following the Student Portfolio Scheme trialled by Defence in 1988. Core curriculum issues are being addressed as part of a related review. </PARA>
<PARA> These developments are a significant breakthrough. They are a tribute both to the Minister, and to his State colleagues, some of whose predecessors have been more interested in competition and confrontation than in the sensible spirit of cooperation that is now abroad. </PARA>
<PARA> I am delighted that the Defence Student Portfolio Scheme has been the catalyst for such a positive development. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Consultative Group of Service Spouses also has been asked to advise me on improvements that could be made to the conditions governing extra tuition allowance, which assists with the costs of private tuition when a child changes schools. The take up rate of the allowance has been well below expectation. I believe the scheme could benefit many more families. </PARA>
<PARA> All these steps are designed towards assisting Defence families to preserve unity and to minimise education considerations being the cause for family separations. This should be our fundamental principle. </PARA>
<PARA> When separation must occur due to stages of education reached, Education Allowance may be available to assist. The take up of this allowance has been improved in the last two years. This reflects changes made to give greater discretion to those administering the scheme. Nonetheless, there remain a few aspects of the scheme that seem to produce unfair outcomes. These aspects are being reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA>Other Initiatives</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I can also announce today that the Government has decided to implement, in a modified form, the suggestions made by the Committee on postal assistance, and the provision of equipment and supplies so that members of the Defence Force can undertake minor ``do it yourself'' improvements to their married quarters and singles accommodation. In addition, we are at present finalising arrangements for a discount buying scheme for Defence families. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I should like to thank Rear Admiral Alan Beaumont and Mr. Ray Finnegan, who have been tireless in their task of reviewing the recommendations of the Joint Committee, and in coordinating the development of the initiatives which I have announced today. </PARA>
<PARA> Their cooperation, and the cooperation that they have obtained from throughout the Personnel areas of the three Services and the Department, demonstrate that Service-civilian relations in Defence often are less competitive and more harmonious than myth has them. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to pay a special tribute to my predecessor Mrs Kelly for her great contribution to the improvement of the conditions of members of the Defence Force and their families. The very widely based and genuine statements of appreciation and regret that greeted her move from this portfolio provide eloquent testimony to that contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> I have high hopes for the measures that I have outlined today. They represent another substantial series of steps in the rational, and integrated program of improvements that this Government has provided for ADF personnel and their families. I am confident that these measures also will have a significant effect in turning around the current high levels of wastage. </PARA>
<PARA> We have proved that we are about getting results. </PARA>
<PARA> Everything that I have detailed today, together with the detailed responses to the Committee's recommendations, is part of a coordinated strategy to improve personnel management in the ADF and to provide better services to Defence families. </PARA>
<PARA> With this package of improvements, ADF personnel and their families have further evidence of this Government's clear commitment to them. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank the House for its attention; and I table the Government's detailed responses to the recommendations in the Committee's report. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>I would think that even the boys and girls in the gallery today would know that we are having trouble keeping the soldiers, sailors and airmen of Australia happy in the defence forces. Certainly an Australian adult would have to be deaf and blind not to know that there are severe problems facing the defence forces. We have had four years of high wastage in the forces which has meant a tremendous drain on the experience levels of the forces. The Cross Committee reported to the Parliament six months ago back in November 1988 and it was a report which pulled no punches. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>It is clear that the present level of wastage is substantially too high and has been for some time. Further there has been a clear and consistent trend towards the situation for several years. </PARA>
<PARA>The response to that report throughout the defence forces was one of hope that at last the problems had been recognised in the Parliament of Australia and that the 48 recommendations which were made would go some way towards stopping the situation which had developed. Consequently for the last six months servicemen and women around this country have been holding their breath waiting for the Government's response. So very much has been riding on the Government's response, much more, I think, than the new Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons) realises. Our service men and women are fed up with a variety of things that have been happening to them since this Government has come into power, so the Government's response holds the future for many of them. It is really quite surprising how many of them held on waiting just to see what the Government would do. This Government has had a history of broken promises, delays and lack of funding in the defence area. I do not wish to take the time today to detail the quite sad tale of broken promises and reductions in resources and benefits to the forces, but reductions there have been. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, the Government's response has come six months after the Cross report was tabled in the Parliament. It is interesting to note that at the time the then Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mrs Kelly, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>I do not intend to make quick decisions in relation to this report. </PARA>
<PARA>Never was a truer word spoken. When we look at the Government's response we see that she might as well have made it the day after the report came down. During the six months we have all been waiting to see what the Government was going to do about it, another 3,100 personnel have quit; Qantas Airways Ltd has raised its recruitment age to 45, luring into Qantas those who missed out on the wasteful and badly organised pilots' retention bonus; we have read the internal Royal Australian Air Force report which was critical of the manning deficit in the RAAF and its erosion of Air Force capability; and we have seen a signal from the Army which tells us that it needs reservists to fill the gaps of the 350 officer positions it cannot fill. In the middle of this crisis the Hawke Government appoints a new Minister with not only no experience as a Minister, but also with no shown interest at all in the defence area for the six years that he has been in Parliament. It does make the service people wonder whether the Government cares at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the realities that we are facing as a result of these problems. As I said earlier, the Army has 350 officer vacancies in 1989. Many of those positions will be empty for months. Problems of hand-overs and lack of expertise are being passed on. A total of 170 vacancies are between the lieutenant and major levels, and they cannot be filled, even using reservists on full time duty and temporarily putting senior non-commissioned officers into those positions. The Army is calling for reservists to fill those spaces and yet the provisions of the Defence Force retirement and death benefits scheme mean that they are not eligible to receive their pensions while they are helping the Army out of its predicament even though, if they went into the Department of Defence as civilians, into private enterprise or any other government department they could receive the pensions to which they have contributed. Although the country needs them and the Army needs them, they have to lose their pensions to which they have contributed for the period in which they come back to the colours. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us turn to the Navy. In March 1989 we had 25 per cent of the principal warfare officer billets still vacant. Since the Cross Committee report six months ago there has been no improvement in the Navy officer shortfalls. The Cross report expected that there would continue to be a 16 per cent wastage in the weapons electrical branch as there was in 1987-88; in fact, the wastage in March 1989 was 17.8 per cent. We have had problems with the Navy worrying about whether it can afford to take ships to sea due to the inexperience of the available engineer officers. The RAAF has an 18 per cent to 20 per cent deficit in squadron leader and wing commander areas. The general duties branch of the RAAF has a wastage rate of 260 per cent over the average. The RAAF has not met its recruiting targets for officers since 1981. A total of 101 pilots are leaving this financial year, 73 have already left and 28 are leaving soon. Ten have already given notice that they are leaving in the next financial year. In desperation the RAAF is considering lowering recruitment standards for officers, borrowing foreigners and recruiting more older men and young women. The RAAF is already recruiting 45 per cent females. It is a measure of its desperation when so many of its positions have formerly been denied to women. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have the time to waste on Senator Button and so I will leave him to mutter into his beard. The funding realities are also of great concern although the report of the Dibb Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities, recommended 2.6 per cent to 3 per cent real growth per annum in order to maintain capability. That was never met. The total real growth since 1983 has been 1.7 per cent. This year we have the lowest proportion of the gross domestic product being spent on defence since 1950-that is 2.4 per cent. Despite the Cross report recommendations and all the recommendations that have gone before, there is no percentage real growth in 1989-90. If the Minister for Defence is lucky he might get 0.5 per cent from the funds generated by the sale of defence assets-just a fire sale, a once-off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is hard to know just how the response we received today will be funded, because we understand the funding is to come from existing resources. The existing resources are now in such a state that there will be no money for Army removals from now until the end of the financial year. There is a $28m shortfall for army uniforms over the next two years and the Army does not have a clue where it will find the money to outfit its personnel. There is an extra $28m commitment for the Namibian force that has to come out of the existing Defence Force budget; there is no extra allowance for it. Kangaroo 89, which is the showpiece for the Minister to show how clever he is but is more likely to show exactly the opposite, accounts for another $36m and has meant that there will be no other exercises for the rest of the financial year. We have desperate shortages in areas relating to spare parts and personal equipment and we are already down to minimal exercises and operations in the lead-up to Kangaroo 89. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem has been exacerbated by the Government's priorities within the defence budget and a reduced proportion year by year going into the personnel area. Now the Government is also cutting operational expenditure. Mr Beazley has said that there is nothing magical about the fact that we can finance a major defence equipment program without major increases in defence outlays. He said that it was simply a matter of management. It is hardly good management when we are losing personnel at the rate we are. Since April 1983, we have lost 48,000 people, which is over 68 per cent of the current strength. Recruitment simply will not replace the experience and the skills. </PARA>
<PARA> We come again to the Cross report and to the Government's response. The Cross report focused on the need for adequate, substantial retention measures which would stop this happening and turn the position around. The RAAF report which the Opposition released recently said exactly the same things. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we come to today's statement by Mr David Simmons, his first public act as the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. On page 1 of his statement, he says that the Government acknowledges and fully supports the commitment of the defence personnel of Australia. It is not good enough for him to say so. It is action that is needed, real support, to show that the Government is committed to its Defence Force personnel. I understand that the first draft of this speech made no mention whatsoever of families and had to be sent back to deal with that oversight. Such is the Government's attitude to the families of Defence Force personnel that we had a ministerial speech in draft form that failed to recognise families. Families are critical to the happiness and well-being of Defence Force personnel and they have been sadly neglected in times past. The Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's strong and continuing support for the Defence Force is a matter of public record. </PARA>
<PARA>This is quite untrue. One of the core problems of the Defence Force and their morale is that they feel that the Government does not care. The Government's action speak louder than its words and its funding cuts over the last six years to the Defence Force personnel and the erosion in their conditions of service are much more important to them than a small statement like that, which they see to be quite untrue. It is a matter of saying the right sort of thing a bit too late. Under the heading, `Personnel wastage' Mr Simmons says:</PARA>
<PARA>The present levels of personnel wastage from the Defence Force is an issue of very great importance and concern. The Government has not sought to deny this fact, nor to disguise, in any way, the extent of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that the Government has denied the problem. It has denied it over and over again. Then, when finally it had to admit it when the Cross Committee made its report, it continued right up to the other day to deny the desperately serious implications. They go to the capability of our Defence Force to defend this nation in the way that is necessary. It also goes to the ability to maintain safety standards in what is often a very dangerous occupation. The Government fails to acknowledge that. It tries to whitewash it. The Minister, Mr Beazley, has done that on a number of occasions and Mr Simmons is also learning bad habits. About all he has said recently is simply that the Opposition is wrong and that there is no problem with capability. The forces know better. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 2 of the statement there is a mention of statistics. That reminds me that a number of witnesses to the Cross Committee poured scorn on the Defence Department's keeping of statistics. It keeps several sets of statistics. I think it keeps one for public consumption and the rest it keeps in the Department. None agrees with the other. There was a very real need for the Department to do something about its statistics and there were recommendations to that effect. The way the people of Australia were being hoodwinked about the true situation was disgraceful. One cannot be sure exactly where the responsibility for that lies, whether totally within the Department of Defence, totally within the Government, or a mixture of both. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister says that the major conclusion of the report is that there was no one cause for increased wastage and no one simple answer. But there is one very direct answer that the Government could have given long ago-that the people in the defence forces feel that nobody cares about them, that nobody knows they are there. If they go off in a flurry to Fiji, if there is a natural disaster in Australia like the cyclone in Darwin, if there are bushfires, if we send a force off to Namibia, or if we send people to the Iran-Iraq border, for a moment the nation notices and then goes back to its peacetime occupations. The Government has a responsibility to keep the importance and the contribution of the defence forces before the Australian people so that the forces themselves know that the Government cares and the Government respects their status and importance in our national culture. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Simmons claims that the Government has a proven record of performance across the full range of Service personnel issues. He goes on to list them. I would say it has a proven record of a rotten performance and the claims that he makes in the statement about a successful support for substantial increases in many key general and specialist allowances is a lot of rot. The only substantial allowances that the Defence Force has been able to achieve in the last two or three years were when the independent Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal made the determination, over the screaming body of the Commonwealth. The Government has fought every inch of the way to see that decent flying allowances and other allowances were not paid to servicemen, and it knows it. It is no good Mr Simmons claiming otherwise. He claims that the Government has been providing financial, educational and support arrangements for Service families. He has done nothing of the sort. His document proves that. When it comes to educational arrangements, he would not bite the bullet and the recommendations relating to educational stability for secondary school children were rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> So many things in this statement need dealing with that it is hard to choose which ones to pick out particularly for attention. As I have already said, the Government has complained that it has done things about the defence forces already and that the recommendations of the Committee's report fits in very well with what it has been doing. The truth of the matter is that the Government denied the problem until the Committee met and then it continued to deny the implications. The Government had to be dragged to recognise that there really was a problem. Today the Government told us that it will review the defence force retirement and death benefits scheme (DFRDB), and a long time overdue that is. It is interesting to note that when Mrs Kelly was speaking in the House of Representatives only last year on 30 November, she said:</PARA>
<PARA> I think there would be a frenzy through the Defence Force, a feeling of terrific uncertainty, if we tried to make major changes to the DFRDB, even though I recognise that there are anomalies with it at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA>She has never spoken a truer word. In fact, the defence forces are terrified of this Government touching the DFRDB scheme, desperately needed though it is. The Government has said it will make sure that people retain their benefits, but I do not think it will be believed too well because its record on superannuation for the general community is so rotten. It has always reduced superannuation benefits for Australians, and servicemen do not trust them. The DFRDB scheme is facing problems at the moment with the Government's reasonable benefits limits. The Minister says:</PARA>
<PARA>While these limits are yet to be set for the DFRDB scheme, they are likely to affect only a few very senior officers. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that he would be making an announcement when the impact was decided. That is not true, either. The reasonable benefits limits are going to affect considerable numbers of people who go into other employment after they leave the defence forces. I am concerned about the review of the DFRDB scheme because there is nothing in the statement which says it will be a public review. If this gets to be a review behind closed doors in the hands of the bureaucrats, with the Governments able to manipulate it, it will be totally unsatisfactory and will be seen to be so by Defence Force personnel. It is urgent that we see the details of the terms of reference. As with any inquiry, they will be vital in determining how much can come out of the review. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention to the fact that this Government recently introduced into the Parliament legislation which will deal with superannuation benefits where a policeman has been found to be corrupt. I would like to draw the attention of honourable senators to the fact that a corrupt policeman in the Australian Federal Police will be able to leave his employment with more benefits than a serviceman who has served honourably for 19 years and nine months. In other words, the policeman will get back interest on his own superannuation contributions; the soldier, sailor and airman are entitled to not a penny more than they put in themselves. This is a pretty good indication of how urgent the Government sees the need to increase retirement benefits for servicemen when it rushes this legislation through and still leave a corrupt policeman with interest on his contributions. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a passage on page 4 of the statement which really bothers me. The Minister talks about the Defence Force personnel being affected by the same rules and regulations, influenced by the same social dynamics, and feeling the same aspirations as the rest of the Australian community. The situation is that they are subject to quite different rules and regulations. They are under discipline all day every day. They do not have the benefits of unions and the muscle that that gives. They have no right to strike. They have no penalty rates or overtime rates. They are expected to separate from their extended families and live wherever the nation demands; and be separated from their immediate families. If necessary they must put their lives on the line, as our member on the Iran-Iraq border and in Namibia are doing right now. </PARA>
<PARA> It is nonsense for the Government to claim that they are affected by the same rules and regulations and are in the same position as the rest of the Australian community. That is a very important item. It relates to the question of Defence Force pay in particular. The Government has absolutely refused to accept the recommendation of the Cross-committee on a major review of pay and allowances. The important point is that the Defence Force is a unique organisation because of the factors I have already mentioned. As a result, special guidelines need to be laid down for the Remuneration Tribunal to take into account when it is considering the pay of servicemen. The Government welshes on that and says the Tribunal is not subject to Government direction. It is subject to Government direction, however, in that the Government says it must take account of the national wage guidelines. Apparently it is a different thing when the guidelines should include a direction that servicemen are in a unique situation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other matters of concern, as I have said. They include the provision of fulfilling jobs for those who are posted to Canberra and the need to review the Department of Defence. The Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, has totally refused to do anything about the organisation of the Department of Defence. That will remain a major stumbling block for middle to senior ranking officers who decide that the frustrations of work in the bureaucracy are just not worth the effort. I am also concerned that the Government has seen fit to give such emphasis to civilianisation. It is not the answer to the Defence Force's problems. It will give it extra problems, such as problems that it incurs when there is a civilian freeze, the extra expense, which is not widely recognised, but is incurred with civilians, and the question of what to do when there are civilians in vital positions during times of national emergency. An emerging problem concerns maternity leave. A high proportion of the Force is now female, but the Government's policy requires that positions not be filled while women are on maternity leave. That is leaving an enormous hole in the Force as well. Civilianisation will not help, either. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing the Minister says in the statement is that there have been enough reviews and reports. I could not agree with him more, but he goes on in the next couple of pages to suggest areas where there should be surveys and reports. One of the issues that worries me is that there is no attention given to benefits that it is likely will have to be provided for single personnel. There is no readiness to come to grips with the need to more speedily upgrade single as well as married accommodation. The Government has finally taken on board a suggestion I have been pushing ever since I came into the Parliament, as to rental accommodation; in the meantime it is not prepared to do any-thing about reviewing the temporary rental allowance so we may have for a considerable time yet a number of rental ceilings still dating back to 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> The Defence Force Housing Authority has been a great improvement but we are faced today with a really nasty little smart alec gimmick, described on page 8 of the statement as post-May 1985 housing assistance. That is a variation on the existing defence service home loan scheme. At first glance it looks like an improvement. The amount of the loan which will go to people who have enlisted since May 1985 will be $40,000. That is long overdue for all loans. When we look into it more closely, the interest rate, at 40 per cent off current market rates, would be 9.6 per cent. When we look at the fine print here it is hard to work out whether the subsidy period of the loan will be 20 years or 25 years. The Minister claims it will be both. I do not know what the Westpac Banking Corporation is going to say about the arrangements. It means that some of the people who Westpac would have contracted to provide loans for are now going to be able to opt out of that scheme and into this one. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important point is that there is actually a reduction in benefits. It is another erosion because people will be able to have the interest subsidy only as long as they are serving in the Force. If someone serves 10 years, as soon as he gets out he loses his entitlement. The old defence service home loan scheme was for 25 years. People had the interest subsidy for the whole of that time. Once again there has been no attempt to develop a childcare policy. We have got civilian children whose parents are in private employment around Australia being subsidised by this Government under the new scheme Dr Blewett announced last January. Three years after the Government said it was going to have a childcare policy, it still does not have one. This is a poor, wet, wimp of a thing that is referred to in the statement as being some means of assisting families. The Government is prepared to waste a million dollars a year on the family information network but, importantly, it is not prepared to do a single tap to increase the number of children who are eligible for the education allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the greatest reasons for people getting out once they have got the experience levels that we want to keep in the forces is that their children have reached secondary education level and they are unable to get the quality of education in the area to which the father or mother has been posted, or they are taken from one State to another and lose continuity. At a time when secondary education has become so critical, when technology and technical training are so vital to the future of this country, we cannot allow any longer the children of our Defence Force personnel to be carried around the country like packages-and to their own detriment. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is that there is going to be greater use of reservists, and of civilians. There is not going to be any help for singles, as I said. There are no retention packages-certainly none that the Government has been prepared to spell out. The reality is that there are not enough resources; there is not enough manpower. The manpower that is there already is overstretched, and the commanders are in a state of constant crisis management. The Department admitted this in 1987 when it made a submission to the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal. That was during the 4 per cent productivity case, and the Services had to trade off a whole lot of their operational funds in order to pay for that increase. I quote from that submission. The Department said:</PARA>
<PARA> There are substantial shortfalls in the military manpower available because:</PARA>
<PARA> a. expenditure has been focused on new capital equipment necessitating constraint in personnel costs;</PARA>
<PARA> b. levels of Government tasking have in some circumstances, increased. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, they are being given more jobs to do; they are being given fewer people to do it with; they are being given fewer resources-and no attempt is being made to make those people feel better. I wish I had another half hour to go through this Minister's statement for him. Perhaps I should sit down with him and tell him what he does not know. But, for all that was said in the statement, the Government has not shown that it really understands or cares. I suggest that the Hawke Government should learn from Prime Minister Curtin, who, back in 1944, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Freedom is a condition that has to be bought and paid for. </PARA>
<PARA>And the Hawke Government believes it can get it on the cheap out of the hides of its service men and women. It simply will not wash. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I am very interested in the Government's response to the Cross report. If, as the statement of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons) suggests, the Government is going beyond some of the recommendations of the Cross report to stem the wastage from the Australian Defence Force (ADF), then that is to be welcomed. Certainly the overwhelming response from the defence forces and their families in the course of that inquiry last year was to suggest that there was great disquiet within the ADF about conditions, pay, housing, retirement, education difficulties and quality of life difficulties, which I think really need to be addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The one positive initiative I noticed in the Minister's statement-to which I think Senator Newman referred only briefly-does show that the Government is taking an initiative beyond that suggested in the Cross report, that it wants to listen to the views and concerns of members of the ADF and that it actually cares about them. This is the Family Information Network, FIND. It is a 008 number which ADF personnel and their families can ring to find out about their entitlements. This is done in confidence. People do not have to reveal who they are or where they are stationed. I think that in itself is a step in the right direction, because people have sometimes felt that their family situations have not been taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the members of the defence forces and the various Defence Force associations which put their cases so competently to the defence review inquiry committee. However, I would like to point out that there are enormous contradictions in the Minister's statement concerning the concept of the role of the Australian Defence Force in Australian society. I quote from page 4 of the Minister's statement. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government bases its ADF personnel strategy on two fundamentals. The first is the recognition that the profession of arms is a unique profession, with unique traditions, duties and skills. </PARA>
<PARA> The second is that the Defence community, while it is unique, is also part of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, both those statements are true, but inherent in them is an enormous contradiction, which I think is very difficult for the defence forces and the community to deal with. The Government has a policy that it calls `civilianisation', which is referred to on page 6 of the Minister's statement. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government intends to continue our policy of civilianisation within Defence. </PARA>
<PARA>This just cannot happen if we are also to consider that the defence forces are unique and that their traditions, skills and so on are unique unto themselves. If we have that view, we cannot really expect their members to live as normal citizens within the community and to be subject to the usual privileges and constraints of life within the community. I think there has to be a real re-thinking of the role of the defence forces in the community. Are they to be part of the community, or are they to be unique? We really cannot have it both ways. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps we should take a lesson from the Dutch armed forces. Holland, of course, is a fully operational member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. The armed services people in Holland are unionised, so that they can argue collectively for better pay and conditions. Until we have that situation in Australia, I believe that we will continue to have this enormous dilemma between service to the ADF, which is always put first, and the needs of the individual service men and women. Of course, I said this in my dissenting report to the Cross Committee report which came out six months ago. I said that this was a fundamental dilemma and that if we actually took the view that service people should be part of the community, then they should have the privilege of organising as a union to ensure that their wages and conditions were on a par with those of the rest of the community. I said that this would ensure that they did not feel like second class citizens, or feel that their needs were not being met, that they were unimportant as members of the community and that their families were suffering hardships because they were members of the defence forces serving their country. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the peacetime Australian Defence Force, which, thankfully, is what we have to address ourselves to, there should be much more emphasis on the reserves-which I also said in my dissenting report. I would like to comment on some of the statements made by Senator Newman. She said that she was very disappointed that there had been a six-month lag between the presentation of this report and the Government's response to it. The Opposition constantly seems to forget that, when millions of dollars are involved-as is the case with defence expenditure-they cannot just be plucked out of the air. A great deal of negotiation has to be undertaken, and six months is, I think, a reasonable time in which to have looked carefully at the recommendations and to have made this response to them. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the problems of capital and personnel expenditure within the defence area present a constant dilemma which the Opposition never addresses. The Opposition, while suggesting that we should serve the men and women of the ADF better and ensure that their conditions and salaries are more in line with those of the general community, never says what other area of defence should be cut. It never says to the Minister for Defence, `Okay, we can forget about some of the FA18s. We don't really need all this high-tech equipment. We can cut some of the expenditure from another area, and then we would have the extra money to put into keeping our personnel happy in their service in the ADF'. Honourable senators opposite never say anything like that. We are getting these 75 FA18s at a cost of $5 billion. That is a cost that the Opposition seems to accept, but it never says where the extra dollars will come from to pay for the improved service conditions it seeks. I think we should have better service conditions, too. But I would be quite willing to forgo some of the high-tech equipment that Mr Beazley is so keen on to make sure that the men and women in the Services are better looked after. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition also never mentions the huge balance of payments deficit problem-of course, neither does the Government-resulting from this enormous import of high-tech equipment, mostly from the United States. This creates a huge imbalance in our imports and exports. Mr Keating could quite easily change that imbalance by telling Mr Beazley that we do not need to buy all this expensive equipment from overseas. If we are really concerned about our balance of payments deficit, that is one area that we should be looking at. Yet we never hear that questioned by either the Government or the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Newman made quite a faux-pas when she talked about women being recruited to the Royal Australian Air Force as though that was just the last gasp. In these days of equal opportunity, I think that was a very unwise statement. Women make very good pilots these days, and there is no reason why they should not be there. She also mentioned Kangaroo 89. I would like to correct her costing figures. She mentioned some figure in the $30m bracket. Kangaroo 89 is costing a massive $96m. That is another area where perhaps we could save some expenditure-on playing expensive war games which really have very little to do with the threat assessments as identified by either the Dibb Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities or the Defence White Paper. This vastly expensive exercise across the north of Australia, which will take several months later this year, will involve the scenario of Kamaria, an imaginary country, invading Australia. Nobody is seriously concerned about that as a possible problem for Australia in the near future. Yet we will spend $96m of taxpayers' money-and that figure, by the way, does not include wages and allowances; that is just on the exercise itself. That is at least $25m more than the normal cost of single service exercises which Kangaroo 89 is replacing. We do not need to spend money on that kind of thing, yet we do not hear the Opposition-supposedly so concerned about conditions for service people in the ADF-saying that some of that money could be better spent elsewhere. We just do not hear that kind of constructive criticism from the Opposition. All the time Opposition members say they want more and more but they never say where the money would come from. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition would like to have us on a constant war footing. That was the general tone of Senator Newman's speech. Thankfully, that is not the situation. What we should be doing in Australia is putting greater emphasis on the peacetime and socially useful activities in which the ADF engages. I believe it does contribute quite substantially in times of natural catastrophes, for example, and I do not think it gets enough credit for doing that positive work in the community. That is appropriate work for the armed services to be doing in peacetime. </PARA>
<PARA> For a fraction of the amount spent on this huge balance of payments creation exercise, this deficit creating exercise with high-tech equipment, these expensive war games, we could be engaging in much more positive peacekeeping in our region through activities such as improving international institutions such as the United Nations, training our diplomats in negotiation skills and conflict resolution techniques, and increasing our foreign aid budget. To quote a former Prime Minister of Great Britain who was very much engaged in the defence of his country and, people could say, of the free world-former Prime Minister Churchill-jaw jaw is better than war war. That is what we have to learn to do. We have to learn to talk our way out of trouble so that we do not get involved in situations of conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to address the inequities that there are for members of the Australian defence forces, but I wish I could hear somebody from the Opposition say how we are going to pay for the increased expenditure on personnel, unless we are also prepared to say that we will cut the huge expenditure on capital equipment. There is not a constituency in the Australian community for a huge expenditure in the defence budget overall in peacetime. That is the hard question that the Opposition must answer. A small number of people in the community would like to see the Australian defence budget substantially increased at any time, but a far greater number of people in the Australian community would like to see us spend more money on our Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade rather than on our Department of Defence. I do not think we will see a huge expenditure on defence overall in peacetime in Australia. At least, that is my hope. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The response that has been given today to the report on personnel wastage in the Australian Defence Force (ADF) by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mr Simmons, is nothing short of a whitewash. It is full of inconsistencies and typical Labor Government platitudes. This is a most important area which needs to be addressed. Why are people leaving the Australian defence forces in such great numbers? When studying the detail of the response it is very interesting to note that of the 48 recommendations of the Cross report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which studied this matter in a lot of detail, and of which I was proud to have been a member, only one-third have been agreed to or implemented by this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been constant procrastination and delay. The Government has had this report for six months, but I would remind the Senate that the Government has been aware of the problems for much longer than that period. The Cross Committee spend a considerable amount of time-almost a year-on public hearings and inquiries, in soliciting this information. There was considerable community debate and discussion, and the extent of the problem was clearly pointed out. Of course, the Government has looked at a number of the issues. It was publicly aware of them for quite some time before the Committee sat down to do its work-or, at least, I hope it was. Yet what do we get? We get a report that ignores the important issues-the financial considerations-that have to be addressed. I am sure that will not please service personnel throughout Australia, wherever they are situated. The Government has walked away from its responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> I sheet that responsibility home to the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley-not Mr Simmons. Mr Simmons is a patsy. He has been in the job for just a month, and obviously this report was written for the former Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mrs Kelly. A month ago Mrs Kelly was removed from the portfolio because she could not handle it-she was not up to that particular job. It is Mr Beazley who has to accept the primary responsibility for the Government's failure in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very interested to note an article in the Australian Defence Review in April written by a very prominent Australian defence writer, Mr Peter Young. Let me quote some very important points from that article. It is entitled `Beazley-A Failure As Defence Minister'. How does he describe this Rambo of the Pacific, Mr Beazley? He describes him as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> A leader who turned his back on the special demands of the men and women under his command and seen more than half of them vote with their feet. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The most public area in which he has failed however has been in the loss of over 45,000 of the 70,000 strong ADF over the past four years. This is nothing short of scandalous and unprecedented in any comparable Western defence force, yet along with a 12% average wastage rate, it is now being accepted as the norm. </PARA>
<PARA> The real scandal however lies in the way in which this staggering and costly loss rate was denied until the very end and only admitted to when it became clear that the findings of the third Cross Report would provide a public confirmation of the actual loss rate. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Beazley and the Labor Government have not addressed the real issues that affect defence personnel. The Cross report certainly did. In addressing all of the issues of personnel wastage in the Australian Defence Force, the Committee took evidence from 32 witnesses, received 226 submissions, visited bases throughout Australia and, finally, after deliberation came up with 48 significant comprehensive recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened to those 48 recommendations? The Government has agreed to or implemented 16 of them. That is one-third only that it is prepared to recognise. It says it has agreed in principle to a further 19, but even a cursory glance at the summary shows that what that means is, `We will water it down. We will change it. We will play around with it. We will do what we can'. What does it really mean? It means the Government is sweeping them under the carpet. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has put up alternative propositions for five of the recommendations, again because they are too costly, or the Government is not prepared to face up to them. It has not agreed to eight of the recommendations. They are very important statistics. When one looks at the eight recommendations that are not agreed to, one sees that they form probably the most significant sector of the report. Recommendation 21 relates to remuneration of servicemen. Recommendations 22 and 24 relate to the remuneration fixing system. Recommendation 26 relates to the service allowance. Recommendation 31 relates to the relationships of the Department of Industrial Relations. Then there are three recommendations that are not agreed to which affect defence families: recommendation 28 on education, recommendation 37 on the Medicare and health issue and recommendation 48 on the telephone subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very easy to see where the Labor Government's priorities lie. They do not lie with anything that relates to remuneration. What we are really addressing as the most significant problem is the fact that resignation rates are at a record level. Over the two years prior to the report, 25 per cent of service personnel-that is 18,246 personnel-left the Australian defence forces. During 1987-88, 41 per cent of those leaving were not pension-eligible. They were pulling the plug early. Of course, we are all familiar with the area of RAAF pilots. In 1986-87, 107 of them quit; in 1987-88, 123 quit. The 10-year average level for pilots was 47. The RAAF can train 65 new pilots a year, but it cannot be done when instructors are in short supply. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of service conditions, the funding for personnel is 43 per cent of the ADF budget this financial year. I remind the Senate that in 1982 it was 49.9 per cent, so there has been a very significant reduction. Of service homes, 60 per cent are estimated, by the Department of Defence itself, to be substandard. Any senator or member of parliament worth his salt is well aware that there are very significant education problems caused by regular postings of service personnel. As I have said, the remuneration levels are so low that they are the significant factor in morale being at rock bottom. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the response to the report, which has been tabled today, goes nowhere near meeting the challenge that was given to the Government by the Cross Committee. To pick up only one-third of the recommendations is nothing short of insulting to the service personnel. Anyone reading the words, that follow words, that follow words, in Mr Simmons's statement-that is all they are: a straight whitewash of words that are pappy; words that say nothing-soon sees that priority for families and priority for service personnel committed to their unique job are put aside. In his response Mr Simmons says:</PARA>
<PARA>We have analysed the reasons for the current high wastage rates. The major conclusion of that analysis is that there is no one cause-</PARA>
<PARA>the words `no one cause' are highlighted-</PARA>
<PARA>for increased wastage and thus there is no one simple answer. </PARA>
<PARA>The words `no one simple answer' are highlighted. There is no one simple cause, entirely because of government inaction for years and years. No attention has been given to the extra manning requirements or the need for additional financial allocations. The report just walks away from any recognition that there needs to be a government policy and very close attention to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Simmons says that the Cross Committee's report provided a valuable focus for discussion. Yet, in the next paragraph, he says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the government's initiatives in the area of Defence Force policy do go beyond the scope of the Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA>What absolute rubbish when only one-third of the recommendations are addressed or picked up in a way that is seen to be acceptable. How is that going beyond the scope of the Committee's report?</PARA>
<PARA> In the review of the very important retirement and death benefits scheme, it is interesting to note the priority that the Government gives to addressing the problem. Mr Simmons identifies three groups of ADF personnel. There are those who join up for a short period; those who serve for 20 years and therefore get an advantage under the scheme; and those-the third group in his ranking order-who serve as members of the ADF until retirement, making the service their life's work. Mr Simmons puts the priorities in the wrong order. He does not look after the people who are prepared to make a permanent life's work commitment to the Defence Force. It is very obvious, from the tenor of the argument, where the Government's priorities lie. </PARA>
<PARA> All right, there is to be a review of this retirement benefit scheme. There is going to be some involvement from the ADF as part of that. I should jolly well hope so. But there is no involvement on any review board of the representative groups of servicemen. What about the Armed Forces Federation of Australia? What about the other organisations that represent retired service personnel? They are not involved. As Senator Newman said, the terms of reference are not outlined. Nothing is clear. It is again an excuse to defer. Of course, there is considerable discussion in Mr Simmons's paper about where the Defence Force is different from, or part of, the Australian community. In very typical Labor Party parlance, he says:</PARA>
<PARA>They are affected by the same rules and regulations, they are influenced by the same social dynamics, they feel the same aspirations as the rest of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> What about recognition of the very special functions and very special roles that any defence force must play in Australia? It is ironic that he follows straight on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . this is one of the areas in which I and the Government are strongly at odds with the recommendations of the Cross Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that the Cross Committee was able to accept that there are special significant areas that recognise the unique profession of those people in the defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's response is weak-kneed. There are just so many areas, in respect of family conditions, where support does not flow through. I say that the Government has chosen very deliberately to cover up. Senator Vallentine referred to the family information network that had been established in order to find out where the problem areas were. This organisation is costing millions of dollars for a telephone referral service for family needs. For heaven's sake, what are we running? We are running a 008 crisis line service in this area that ought to be addressed among the very significant areas of personnel management and normal relationships that could be handled so well? What a waste of money this-one of Mrs Kelly's fine dreams-is. </PARA>
<PARA> This is probably one of the most disappointing responses from this Government in a long time. Most of the recommendations that have been agreed to or have been implemented would have been agreed to or implemented anyway because that would have been forced on the Government. Let me list some of the areas where recommendations have already been agreed to or implemented: re-engagement, the use of reservists, the managing of personnel statistics, personnel management, geographic stability, temporary rental allowances, defence housing, do-it-yourself removals, do-it-yourself maintenance, drivers' licences and registrations, the recognition of defence benefits. Sure they have been agreed to, but even if there had not been a Cross report the disastrous situation in the Defence Force is such that all those actions would have been forced on the Government by this time, otherwise it would be further down the gurgler than it now is. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations that have been put forward in the Cross report are interesting. All I can say is that the fact that the Government has failed to provide regular and fair pay adjustments is probably the key area-remuneration. The Government has failed properly to appreciate the very special function of Australia's defence forces, and it will be damned for it at the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; In speaking to the response of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons) to the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade entitled Personnel Wastage in the Australian Defence Force-Report and Recommendations, I point out that this is one of a series of major reports by the Defence Committee in recent years. The last three reports have been The Australian Defence Force-its Structure and Capabilities, The Management of Australia's Defence, and Personnel Wastage in the Australian Defence Force-Report and Recommendations. The last two reports have been enormously important in relation to the defence forces. Sadly, the Government has chose to bury completely the report entitled The Management of Australia's Defence which deals with the great and profligate waste in the administration of Australia's defence forces. I will say something about that towards the end of my comments on this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am Deputy Chairman of this Committee. I would like to pay a compliment to all the members of the Committee, particularly the Chairman, for the conscientious way in which they have pursued this report. It is no secret that the Government sought to have the Committee not accept this matter when it was referred to it by the Senate in October 1987. I would like to quote the terms of reference for this report. The Senate requested the Defence Committee:</PARA>
<PARA> To investigate and report on:</PARA>
<PARA> a. the extent and magnitude of the Australian Defence Force wastage problem;</PARA>
<PARA> b. the effects of the present level of wastage on the capability of the Australian Defence Force to fulfil its role in an effective manner; and</PARA>
<PARA> c. measures to reduce wastage and an assessment of the relative effectiveness of those proposed measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are very wide terms of reference. I believe that the Committee conscientiously and constructively addressed all three requirements. I would like to quote from chapter 1 of the report, where the Committee said:</PARA>
<PARA> This report is predicated on three fundamental points. The first two are that Australia must have a high-quality defence force, and that people are the Force's most valuable asset and vital resource. It follows from those premises that personnel wastage which exceeds a certain numerical and qualitative level will be inimical to the national defence effort. The third point is that the Australian Defence Force is a unique institution. </PARA>
<PARA>Why was it necessary for the Senate to require the Defence Committee to inquire into this matter? What were the facts? The facts were that the Australian defence forces were faced with a quite unprecedented wastage in manpower. Since the Australian Labor Party came to power we have lost over 48,000 men and women from a force structure of about 70,000. In recent years we have had a loss rate of 13 per cent per annum; and that is a compounding loss rate, not a simple loss rate. Of course, the Government is saying now the report is out that the loss rate has slowed up. It certainly has in some areas because there is no more blood in the vascular system to bleed away, particularly with respect to pilots. We have lost most of the pilots who could go. The only ones we have left are those who are still bound by their terms of service and are green and inexperienced. </PARA>
<PARA> This unprecedented loss rate has been at a huge cost to the Australian taxpayer because, by definition, the people we have lost are trained people. It is not true to argue, as the Government attempted to argue when we first brought this matter to its attention, that there was no real loss because those trained service personnel went into specialised roles in the civilian field. That is perfectly true. They are not on the unemployment market. But it is also perfectly true that it is most inefficient to train for civil roles pilots, radio technicians and all the other people that the Services train. The demands of and the performance of service technicians and specialists is far higher than in the civilian field. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me revert to the case of the pilot. We can train someone to fly a Boeing 747 and be a captain in command at about a quarter of the cost that it takes to train an F111 captain. In real terms, it probably costs us between $4 to $6m to put together the 10 years training of an F111 pilot. We can train someone to fly a Boeing 747 for Qantas Airways Ltd at a fraction of that cost, and he will fly that Boeing 747 just as well. But it is not only the absolute numbers that are a problem to us; the real problem has been the loss of the key professionals-those people in their early to mid-thirties who have undergone 10 to 15 years professional training-the specialists: the ship captains, the company commanders, the battalion commanders in the Army, the pilots, the warrant officers, the senior warrant officers and the senior technical trades people. These people have gone in great numbers, and that high wastage rate has had a crippling effect on the Australian defence forces. We simply cannot replace them. We cannot replace someone with 10 or 15 years training under 10 or 15 years. Everyone needs that sort of experience. We can run all the crash courses in the world but we simply cannot get the judgment and experience that come from 10 or 15 years in a trained role. As a result of this high loss rate the Australian defence forces have lost their capability not for three or four years but for 10 or 15 years. As a consequence, not only will it cost the taxpayer billions of dollars but also there is the threat to national security that out weakened defence forces pose. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Government's reaction to this? Initially, the government pretended that it was not happening. The civil component of the Department of Defence, the service component, pretended that it was not happening. Eventually it could not be concealed. It is interesting that, in the evidence the Committee initially received from the Department of Defence, there was a high level of dissembling, of fudging of statistics, of proving that there was not a problem at all by comparing it to skewed long term loss rates statistics. The Department of Defence was soon disabused by the Committee of this tendency to dissemble. We lost years when the Government should have known that the loss rate was going on and it took no action. It is now far too late to repair the damage. We have to try to improve conditions of service within the Australian Defence Force so that we retain the few dedicated people that we have left. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the consequences of this in real terms? I would like to give just one example. Last week in the other place my colleague the shadow Minister for defence, the honourable member for McPherson, Mr Peter White, sought to obtain some figures on pilot strengths from the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley). He found it impossible to get those figures. I do not know why, because the same sort of information has been available over the years to Senate Estimates committees. Since Mr Beazley was not prepared to make those figures available on the grounds of national security-which is a quite specious argument-I will outline by way of example the state of our fighter squadrons. We have only three fighter squadrons to defend the whole of our air space and to guarantee the air superiority of Australia. I will give the manning strengths of just one squadron as it represents what goes on in the others. It has nine pilots and 18 aircraft. The minimum manning strength should be two, and preferably three, pilots an aircraft, which gives us a minimum of 36 pilots. We have nine in that squadron. We have a commanding officer who is very experienced. The particular squadron I am thinking of has not had an Executive officer for a very long time. In recent years it has not had one of two flight commanders who are absolutely essential if the squadron is ever to be used on operations. It does not have a fighter combat instructor. Combat instructors are the equivalent of the people in the movie Top Gun, who live in squadrons and maintain guidance and instruction on a day to day basis in air fighting techniques. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the standards of these nine pilots in the squadron? The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) grades its pilots as A, B, C and D. This squadron has two B-rated pilots, one of whom is the commanding officer. I might mention in passing that A rating is very rare. The other pilots in this squadron are all C or D rating. They are very young and inexperienced pilots who simply cannot be used on operations. They cannot be used on difficult operations at night, in bad weather and in circumstances where we have to use the defence forces. Yet the Minister for Defence and the Chief of the Air Staff tell the Australian community that there has been no diminiution in the operational capability of the RAAF. That is simply untrue. The squadron I have outlined is quite representative of the other two squadrons, which are squadrons 75 and 77. The standards of experience in the pilots is all at a minimal level. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal briefly with some of the findings of the report. I make the point that, in general, the Government has picked up all the easy points. At the same time it has picked up the cheap points, the things that will not cost much either in money or effort. Because other senators on this side of the chamber have gone through the report seriatim, I do not want to waste the time of the Senate beyond commenting on a few points. First I shall comment on the good points. It is a good idea that the Australian Defence Force remuneration benefits are being reviewed. I take the point made by Senator Newman that there is an enormous fear in the Services that, in the process, if the defence force retirement and death benefits scheme (DFRDB) is opened up, the service people will be losers. Well they might have that fear because every time this Government has looked at something like the DFRDB, it has ripped off the service people. It is quite understandable that they are terrified about the Government getting its sticky little hands on the scheme in some way or other and disadvantaging them. There is a real need to review that scheme because it is no longer as appropriate as it was when it was introduced. The mortgage rebate proposal also is of some value. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now outline some of the things that were not done because they are the key things that move to the heart of the failings of the Government's administration of the defence forces at present. The first one is the ratio of equipment to actual manpower expenditure. The rather specious argument was used that it was the chief of staff and the Secretary of the Department of Defence who approved it. The recommendations that come from the chief of staff and the Secretary of the Department of Defence are as a consequence of ministerial directives. So it is rather dishonest to say that the Government is following the advice sent back to it when it has already sent it out to the chiefs of staff because it tells the chiefs of staff that that is how much money they can have, that the Government has contractual obligations for equipment and the chiefs of staff can take up the slack. </PARA>
<PARA> The comment made on recommendation No. 6-that the equipment position is being cleaned up-is simply not tenable. We are getting the old platitudes again that boots will be provided and the equipment will be fixed but the Government is putting no effort into doing it. It is absolutely nonsensical that, in this day and age, 1989, the Australian Army cannot fit everyone with boots of the right size. I know that it is a trivial issue but a person can go into any civilian store and buy shoes to fit him. In the Army that is not possible. Why? The Army has been told about it for years. It is absolutely nonsensical. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation No. 22 is that the remuneration fixing system is not accepted. We recommended that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel take action to amend the legislation to allow the Defence Force advocate to appeal independently against the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal determinations. We had the terrible situation where a salary rise was knocked back and the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF) refused to intervene at a time when all the Services were seething at the injustice of it. We recommended that the Defence Force advocate, who is a very responsible person, should have the power to appeal directly without having his hands tied by the CDF who, in effect, have his hands tied by the Minister-in the interests of natural justice-but that has been knocked out. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation No. 37 is the Medicare principle. We have the situation where the Services do not require service personnel to pay the Medicare levy but they do require them to pay half of it for their spouses. The Committee recommended that married service members whose spouses work and have no children receive full exemption from the Medicare levy. The response is not to agree with it. In effect what is being said is that it would set a bad precedent and that it is everyone's duty, as Australian citizens, to pay the Medicare levy. That is a typical piece of bureaucratic stupidity and it recognises and demonstrates the impracticality of this Government. The amount of money received by levying half the Medicare charge against the spouses of Australian service men and women is absolutely minuscule but it is an enormous irritant to Service personnel. They hate it, they loathe it, and they loathe the Government because it is such a nit-picking, pettifogging, bureaucratic exercise. Here is the Government accepting from a bunch of bureaucrats, inflexibly bound to enforcing government policy and demanding this levy. I do not know how much it brings in. It is possibly half a million dollars or a million dollars at best-I doubt whether it would be that much-out of a budget of $7,000m. </PARA>
<PARA> Where do we go from here? The central recommendation of the Committee did not deal with boots and equipment or rates of pay. The central point we made was that the Australian defence forces suffered from a lack of leadership by this Government. That has the most debilitating effect on the morale and the welfare of the Australian defence forces. Leadership is the most important of all human qualities. It is different in Parliament from what it is in the university. It is different in the university from what it is in a football team and in business. It is different in the Services. But it is a quality that is essential in all human operations. This Government is not providing leadership in any way at all to the Australian defence forces. It is the ethos of the Australian defence forces that they will serve and obey the government of the day without question. The reverse of that service and obedience by the defence forces is that they get strong and positive leadership from the government of the day, so they know their purpose in life. The Australian defence forces have always been at their best when they have had strong political leadership, people in whom they can believe, people whose judgment they can trust, who they know look after their welfare and are concerned about it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is particularly important in the Labor Party because the Labor Party has an aura about it, a belief in the community, that it does not care about defence. There is a feeling in the Australian community that the spiritual home of the Labor Party is out there somewhere in left field with Jo Vallentine and the nuclear disarmers. That has characterised the whole history of the Labor Party since Federation. It is rightly or wrongly seen as a pacifist group which is not interested in looking after the defence forces and by extension, the welfare of the defence forces. The Committee on which all parties were represented made the point unanimously that there was a failure of leadership and guidance. That matter is not addressed at all in the response from the Minister. Yet it is the central, fundamental and crucial part of our report. We must have strong leadership so that the men and women know why they are wearing that uniform and making the sacrifices that they are. </PARA>
<PARA> The next important point that the Government needs to deal with is the substitution of new capital funding for other expenditures. The money is inadequate for the defence forces. We need new equipment. That is undeniable despite what Senator Vallentine says. It was foreseen by the Department of Defence in the early part of this decade that there would be a massive re-equipment program which would run at least until the mid 1990s. It may well run longer. But it was seen by the Department of Defence that, if we were going to buy this new equipment, the votes have to go up because it would cost a lot of money. The minimal increase a year was set at 3 per cent in real growth. What have we seen from this Government? We have seen not only an abolition of growth but also a diminution in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The other problem we have with this Government financially is its lack of commercial sense and skill. When the Liberal-National Party Government signed the contract in 1981 for the F18 it exercised a far higher level of commercial skill than this Government has demonstrated with the submarine program or the frigate program. We signed the F18 contract on an FMS scale. The system we operated under enabled us to benefit by a reduction of one-third in the real price of the F18s as the contractor came down the learning curve and was subjected to pressures by the US Government. The problem of the F18 contract came about through the way this Labor Government handled our economy. It gave us an Australian dollar that is worth roughly 50c of what it was worth at the time when the F18 contract was signed. The F18 contract has cost us about one and half times as much as it should have. </PARA>
<PARA> This lack of commercial judgment shows up in the way it has written too many contracts too quickly for big capital equipment. The submarine contract was written before it was necessary. It could have been deferred another five or 10 years. More importantly, we should have bought submarines that the tender documents required so that they were built as designed. The Labor Government prides itself on the fact that it was a fixed contract. It is stuck with this fixed contract on the submarines so that the contract cannot blow out beyond escalations for inflation. What the Government did in its naivety was sign on the dotted line without getting its hands on the goods. Today, years after that contract was signed, we still do not have the detailed design drawings. We do not have them because the Swedes cannot do it. The Swedes actually approached the Germans to see whether they could design the sections of the submarine that are now proving impossible for the Swedes to design. We are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on pouring concrete and building structures to build these submarines and the drawings are not yet available in the country. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now turn to the frigate problem. We will get a very fine platform out of that if we buy the Dutch ship. If we buy the German ship, we will get a Third World platform which will have much lesser capability. But, again, we are proposing to buy something for the Navy which has not really been thought through. If we do, we will buy a very slow ship. We will buy something which will have a fine hull and propulsion system but it will not be armed properly. It will be fitted for, but not with, essential protective and offensive equipment. It means we will face precisely the same fate in an emergency as the British faced in the Falklands when Britain sent off its ships which were designed for, but not fitted with, essential protective and offensive defence equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> The two FFGs are an example of the Whitlam years revisited. The ships built in the Barnard years were the worst ships ever built. Labor signed us up for another two, which are taking a tortuous glacial path towards construction at vast expense. The essentials of defence have not been met. I do not want to dwell on boots but the Defence Force still cannot get boots that fit. It cannot get webbing that is comfortable and appropriate. We have no APCs that are able to protect our troops in a modern environment. We have no air control systems. We have F111s fitted with Pave-Tack but with no precision guided munitions such as GBU 15s with which to train, let alone test their skills. Above all, the human resource-the heart and soul of the defence forces-has been neglected. That is what led us to write this report. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no vision of the future in what this Government is doing. We live in an unpredictable and unstable region. We have very poor intelligence of that region, as the Fiji coup showed. We have no ability to project our power to help anyone we wish to aid in the region. We have no amphibious capability. We have no air fuelling for the F111s. We are not doing the essentials at home such as reorganising the defence forces as we must. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the consequences of the huge resignation rate is that the reserves in the Australian Defence Force must have a far greater place. We can no longer have the luxury of hundreds of highly trained pilots flying for Qantas Airways Ltd, Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines and not using these pilots in flying operations from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) reserve squadrons. The pilots are out there; they are trained and their skills are current. They could be used immediately in transport squadrons. They could be used quite clearly in the QFI role as flying instructors and, in the short term, to maintain currency in the fighter world. But there is no sign that the Government is moving towards picking out these requirements which are binding on them as a consequence of the Government's maladministration. The way the management of the Australian Defence Force has been buried is a national scandal. It is a gross profligate waste. We do not have enough money going to defence be we are also not getting value for the $7 billion that we spend. We are getting about 50c in every dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> We have 44 two-star generals and above-that is, major-general equivalents and above-which is enough to flesh out a huge defence force, let alone the minuscule force that we have. There are 32,000 men and women in the Army and 26,000 in the Reserve. We have a capability of maintaining a battalion in the field on continuous operations out of a total of nearly 50,000 men and women. In the Air Force it is even worse. The whole resources of the RAAF today can provide only two aircraft on readiness around the clock. In other words, if we have and emergency and we want to maintain air superiority the maximum rate of effort for use is to keep two aircraft on the runway, not in the air, ready to go. That is absolutely scandalous from a management point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have inappropriate roles. No-one has developed a modern Army structure the way we should have in this country. We have people doing all sorts of odd jobs in the belief that they form a core force which could be expanded over four or five years. We have a force structure that equates the Army to a police force with the low level contingency concept. We have a brown water navy. These are not the elements that we need. </PARA>
<PARA> The incoming Government in a few months will cut the fat right out of the Department of Defence and give the Australian people value for the dollar that we spend in defence. We will get rid of that huge parasite drag over at Russell Hill. We will get rid of all the non-essentials not only at Russell Hill but also right through the Department of Defence. We will improve the organisational pattern of all three defence forces to give it a much more effective teeth to tail ratio. We will clean out those inefficiencies. By so doing, we will give the men and women in the Australian Defence Force a purpose in life, because we will show them the leadership they need. They are a unique force. They loathe being compared with other members of the Australian community with respect to the terms and conditions under which they work. They see themselves as quintessential Australians but they see themselves as different. Indeed, they are different. They are under orders the whole time. They have duties and responsibilities that none of the rest of us share. They deserve the special care of this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I assume that I am speaking for this side of the chamber. I believe that these Bills, which have been introduced by the Australian Democrats, are the latest manifestation of the populism which has been exhibited by the Democrats in recent times. They remind me of a notice of motion given by my colleague Dr Dick Klugman in the House of Representatives a couple of years ago to the effect that interest rates be increased for lenders and that simultaneously interest rates be reduced for borrowers. That was the whimsical nature of the notice of motion which graced the Notice Paper of the House of Representatives in 1987. It satirised the inconsistencies of some people who parade around the country with economic solutions to some of the problems facing this country. It was totally in character with Dr Klugman who takes a whimsical view of politics most of the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On behalf of the Government, I oppose the Bills that have been introduced by Senator Haines on behalf of the Democrats. It is very easy for the Australian Democrats to come into this place and propose taxation rebates for the people who save and rebates on home loan repayments, both of which will detract from the revenues available to the Government to fund expenditures at the national level in Australia. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7I4">Senator MAGUIRE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that in a moment. The reality is that the Democrats have never been responsible for governing in this country; they never will be and they never have been. They are on the downward trend. They are not responsible for finding revenue at the national level to pay for the accounts of the Commonwealth Government of Australia in its many forms, and they never will be. It is very easy for them at all times to parade around Australia finding ways in which to reduce the revenues available to the Commonwealth and also to add to its expenditure levels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These Bills are simply further examples of the pie in the sky thinking which is being manifested by the Australian Democrats at the moment. The proposals regarding the housing sector-the subsidised interest rates and subsidies on savings in particular accounts which relate to the housing industry-are a reflection of Senator Haines's particular personal interest in the electorate of Kingston in South Australia at this time. The Kingston electorate is in the southern suburbs of Adelaide. A large number of new dwellings are being constructed. It is an outer suburban area with rapid housing growth. Presumably Senator Haines has done some soundings and has come to the conclusion that interest rates are a very sexy issue in the Kingston electorate at this time. So that is probably what is behind this particular proposal for subsidised housing interest rates and subsidised savings in particular accounts to fund housing allocations. </PARA>
<PARA> In standing for the electorate of Kingston and putting forward these proposals, Senator Haines is simply trying to focus national media attention on the Australian Democrats. There is a very good reason for that; that is because the Democrats are on the down trend in Australia. In fact, after the next half Senate election instead of seven Australian Democrats in the Senate there will be three. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7I4">Senator MAGUIRE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Richardson suggests that there may be two, with any luck. We will probably have Senator Powell from Victoria, Senator McLean from New South Wales and Senator Haines from South Australia, all of whom have six-year terms. The rest of the Democrats may depart at the election because they will not get elected. This will mean that the Democrats will no longer have party status in this place; they will not have the requisite number of senators to qualify as a political party; they will not qualify for the resources which accompany a recognised political party; and they will not have the entitlements that go with the status of a recognised political party. The Democrats will effectively be functioning in this House as three independents after the next election. I think that is probably the reason Senator Haines is contesting the seat of Kingston in South Australia. It is essentially a move to focus national media attention on a declining political party in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I get onto the question of housing, I will put some figures forward. It is interesting that in South Australia-and Victoria and South Australia are the two major States for the Democrats-the Democrats could manage only an 11.2 per cent Senate vote at the 1987 Federal election. That was exactly the same vote to the exact decimal point that the Democrats obtained in South Australia in 1977. At a national level, at the very first election the Democrats contested in South Australia, they managed 11.2 per cent of the vote. At the 1987 election, despite the publicity and the hype, nationally the Democrats' vote was not one decimal point higher than they obtained in their first election 10 years before. So there has been absolutely no progress in the Democrats' share of the vote in one of their two major states. This is a situation stagnation for them. I presume that the result is paralleled in other States of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Government are aware of interest rate concerns. We do not try to pretend that they do not exist. We are aware that members of the community are vitally concerned about the level of interest rates. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has made it abundantly clear that interest rates will not remain high for one day longer than is absolutely necessary on economic grounds. One of the great problems of debates in this chamber is that there is too much focus on the symptoms of economic problems, but very little focus on the causes. The Australian Democrats, with their proposed legislation, are being consistent with their track record of focusing on the symptoms-in this case interest rates-rather than the causes of economic problems in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The housing Bill we are debating jointly with a Bill to subsidise savings provides for some tax relief to be given on home loan repayments. As I pointed out earlier, it is very easy for the Democrats, a minor party-it has seven members at the moment and will soon be reduced to three independents-to parade around Australia suggesting that it is easy to cut government revenues. If the Democrats want to have tax concessions for this, that and the other, government revenues will have to be reduced. We in government have to take a responsible view. We have to ensure that revenues are available to fund government expenditures. That is what it is all about. It is not about one-off, populist measures; it is not about people parading around Australia asking for a tax break for this and that without keeping an eye on the big picture, which is the revenue required to fund the ongoing commitments of the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Haines is entirely consistent in this. I well remember that when I came into this chamber in 1983, one of the really momentous pieces of legislation at that time was the so-called bottom of the harbour legislation to crack down on tax cheats and tax avoiders in Australia. That momentous legislation was brought in by the Hawke Government to ensure that tax cheats were caught up with. I do not recall Senator Haines voting with us on that. I do not recall her helping us find that extra revenue from tax cheats, the people who stripped companies and dumped their records on the bottom of the harbour. I do not recall Senator Haines voting with the Government to try to find that revenue, to crack down on tax cheats and to ensure that there was fairness and equity in the Australian tax system. On the other hand, at all times the Australian Democrats are able to find ways and means to reduce the Government's revenue by giving hand-outs here and hand-outs there; giving tax breaks here and tax breaks there. that is the sort of activity that goes on in minor parties. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the specific proposal for housing tax rebates. Housing tax rebates are inappropriate and certainly very expensive. The Fraser-Howard Government, which was in power up to March 1983, tried to bribe the voters in 1982 by bringing in two schemes to subsidise housing interest payments. It tried to bribe the voters by introducing programs to subsidise housing interest payments. That was the record of the Fraser-Howard Administration. We progressively got rid of those rebates in 1983 and 1984 for very good reasons.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7I4">Senator MAGUIRE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will ask Mr Peacock what his real agenda is for tomorrow today. I would be fascinated to hear that. To get back to the matter of housing rebates, I cannot understand why the Democrats would want to bring in a proposal to subsidise home loan interest repayments. After all, for the last couple of years Senator Powell has lectured us about how the Democrats have a compassionate side, she has said that the Labor Government has let down people on social security. By definition, home loan interest repayment subsidies do nothing for people who rent. They do nothing for the poorest people in the community, those who cannot afford to purchase their own homes and have to rent properties. Such people get nothing out of these schemes. That is another policy inconsistency of the Democrats. Month after month last year Senator Powell lectured the Government about how it was letting down the people in need, the people in poverty, yet here is a particular scheme that would do nothing to subsidise or help the neediest people in the community. It would help only those who already have a toe in the housing market. That point about these proposals for taxation rebates for housing loan interest payments needs to be stated most strongly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the key philosophical reasons for our not having such rebates is to ensure that the real and effective tax rates that apply to people are very close to the published tax rates. We should all support that very important factor because once we start going down the road of allowing rebates, tax concessions, we end up opening up the way for tax loopholes. Tax concessions have tended to become tax loopholes for the rich and powerful. We must ensure that there are a minimum number of tax rebates and concessions in the tax system. The lower and middle income earners of the community will do better out of the system if the effective tax rates that apply to people on a weekly and fortnightly basis are close to the published rates. Otherwise, a cancer develops in the tax system, such as that which developed under the Fraser-Howard Administration with a range of tax breaks becoming tax rorts and tax loopholes, with the real tax rate becoming diluted by a range of rebates and tax concessions. I am proud to say that one of the philosophies of this Government since 1983 has been to make sure that the published tax rates are very close to the real and effective tax rates. We have systematically got rid of tax concessions, tax deductions and tax rebates. They all watered down the published tax rates. Lower and middle income earners should be very careful and vigilant in this respect, because if we open the door with a tax concession here and there, it becomes a tax loophole and the rich and powerful exploit it. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7I4">Senator MAGUIRE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what happens with tax systems. The populism of Senator Haines is no excuse. The history of tax systems in this country makes it clear that once we do that the lower and middle income earners have shifted onto them more of the total proportion of the tax system because the rich and powerful exploit loopholes to their advantage. The most important thing is to make sure that the tax rates we read about on our tax forms are the effective tax rates across the board.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From 1 July, we will be ensuring that, as a result of a range of tax concessions being removed in recent years, there will be substantial personal income tax relief for lower and middle income Australians. Instead of allowing a tax break here and there-the sort of piecemeal approach of the Democrats, the populists-we are reducing tax rates across the board. That is the most important way to reform a tax system. It is preferable to opening a loophole here and another there. From 1 July, a single income Australian family with two children and a fairly typical income of $500 a week will benefit to the extent of $23.95 a week as a result of the Government's tax reforms. That figure includes family allowance payments and the increases in the family allowance supplement. That is the sort of thing that can be done for lower and middle income families if all the rorts are taken out of the system. If the cancers are taken out of the tax base and all these rebates and concessions which become loopholes are swept aside, such things can be done for lower and middle income Australians. We can give substantial tax cuts. I am proud to say that I am a member of a Government that from 1 July will give substantial tax cuts across the board. </PARA>
<PARA> We are castigated by those opposite for our housing record. Senator Haines moved a motion about subsidised housing mortgage repayments and said how the housing industry had been crippled and so forth. However, let us look at the record. Let us look at what has been happening in the housing sector of the economy in recent times. In the last year of Mr Fraser's Administration, when Mr Howard was the Treasurer, the number of actual housing commencements in Australia for that year was 105,000. Last financial year, under the Hawke Labor Government, the number of new dwellings commenced in Australia was not 105,000, 110,000 or 115,000, but 136,000. That is real bricks and mortar. According to the independent indicative planning council for the housing sector, it is expected that, despite the high interest rates that the Australian Democrats are running around the country complaining about, the number of actual dwelling approvals this financial year is likely to be 165,000. That is a tremendous record. Not only is it a very high figure for the current financial year but it is also an enormous increase over the 105,000 commencements of dwellings under the Fraser Government in 1982-83. That is the record. Despite the so-called effects of high interest rates, we are still seeing substantial investments in bricks and mortar in this country.</PARA>
<PARA> I want to talk briefly about the first home ownership scheme. I am sure that will be of great interest to Senator Haines in her campaign in the Adelaide electorate of Kingston. The scheme was introduced by the Labor Government in 1983. It is a targeted scheme. It is much better focused than the tax rebates, which can go to anybody, including the mega-rich in the large capital cities. The scheme gives assistance for housing purchase and focuses on the people in need. It is an income-tested scheme. Therefore it has high social justice; it is very fair and equitable. Since 1983 the Hawke Government has provided $1.4 billion in housing assistance through the first home owners scheme. That is a tremendous boost for home ownership in this country. Some 320,000 Australian families have been assisted by the first home ownership scheme throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to turn to the figures for the Kingston electorate, which I just happen to have here. I find these figures fascinating. Senator Haines runs around the Kingston electorate in the southern suburbs of Adelaide saying, `Let's have higher interest rates for savers and lower interest rates for borrowers'. That is what it really comes down to. Despite that, the reality is that as a result of the quiet and methodical work of the Hawke Labor Government, in the Kingston electorate there have been 2,800 successful applicants under the first home owners scheme. That probably means 5,000 electors in the Kingston electorate up to 7 April this year have qualified under the first home owners scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Between 1983 and 1989 this Government spent some $12,600,000 on the first home owners scheme in the Kingston electorate. That is a tremendous amount of money to spend in one electorate in one State. It turns out to be equivalent to 10 per cent of the whole allocation in the State of South Australia. Perhaps 5,000 electors in the Kingston electorate in the southern suburbs of Adelaide are very well aware that they have benefited tangibly, explicitly and directly under a housing program launched and implemented by the Hawke Labor Government. Some 5,000 people will not be receptive to the sort of nonsense that is being put around in that electorate by the Australian Democrats, who, as I say, effectively want lower interest rates for borrowers and higher interest rates for savers. That is what it comes down to. It is populism out on the hustings. </PARA>
<PARA> I now want to turn to Senator Haines's proposals for tax breaks on savings. For example, one proposal is that there should be exemption from personal income tax for the first $2,000 of interest income on savings. That is essentially the nub of the proposal. My first question is: why give this tax break effectively to all taxpayers, irrespective of their income? That is the first proposition that has to be raised. Why should a mega-rich person from the big end of town qualify for this particular tax break? Why does such a person need this particular tax concession? Such people patently do not need it. It strikes me as being a very inequitable proposal. Perhaps it is rather like the proposal launched by Mr Fraser and Mr Howard in the previous coalition Government when they introduced a tax rebate for dividends. It was put forward on the basis of an alleged need to encourage wider share ownership in Australia. Yet they made the concession available to the superwealthy who clearly did not need it. It was yet another of these very expensive policies which were not focused or targeted, which went right across the board and benefited people who did not need it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that one of the aspects of the Democrats proposal is to try to increase saving. I want to look at the question of saving as a concept in a modern economy. Total saving in an economy by definition includes both private sector saving and public sector saving. That is something we have to face up to. The Government itself is a saver-or can be a saver-just as much as the private individual. That is something that has to be borne in mind. Senator Haines claims that her proposal, giving tax rebates on the first $2,000 of interest income, would boost private and individual saving. That would seem to be the motivation behind the proposal. The reality is that once we do that, once we go down that road, we are cutting government revenues, as I have pointed out. Taxation will be lower; so government revenue falls. But the present reality is that the Government has a Budget surplus-it is actually spending less than the revenue it is generating. So the Government itself is a net saver in economic terms. If we were to implement Senator Haines's proposal, we would reduce government revenue and therefore government sector saving. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Haines claims she is trying to boost private or individual saving. There is no guarantee that that will happen as a result of this measure. But we can clearly say that on the other side of the ledger, the other side of the balance, public sector saving will be diminished. The size of the Government's saving through its Budget surplus will be reduced. Even if we gave a tax break for saving, in the present circumstances it is very unlikely that it would boost total saving in the economy. On the other side of the ledger, it is very clear that there will be a reduction in public sector saving. I think that is a fundamental factor that has to be borne in mind. I am not sure that any arguments can be put against it. </PARA>
<PARA> Again I make the point, as I made it repeatedly in regard to the proposed legislation on taxation concessions on mortgage repayments, that it is very important to be vigilant about any of these proposals for tax rebates, tax deductions or tax concessions. Again the proposed tax concessions on saving will also have the effect of diluting the tax base and moving the real effective income tax rates away from the published rates. We have to be very vigilant about that, as I pointed out earlier. In this country we must go for fewer tax concessions but have a philosophy of trying to reduce the tax rates themselves. That is a better way of doing things. The way to reduce the economic distortions in the system is by having general policy measures rather than piecemeal rebates, concessions or loopholes in particular parts of the economy. It is better to have lower tax rates and have a general policy measure which does not distort the economic system. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to move on to one particular group in the community who possibly are net savers-the age pensioners. The aged in the community typically-but not always-own their own homes. Typically they do not have mortgages like younger members of the community. I would like to put on the record that the aged in the community have done extraordinarily well out of the April statement that was brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) not so long ago. This is very relevant to the whole question of saving. As I pointed out, I believe that, unlike younger members of the community, the aged in the community typically are net savers rather than net borrowers. The reality is that as a result of the April statement the aged have had enormous tax relief given to them. For example, in the current financial year, the tax relief applying to non-pension income of age pensioners-that is, personal income over and above the pension, which might be in the form of dividends or interest payments or whatever-was a little below $10 a week. That is the sort of benchmark figure we are looking at. It is a figure of a little below $10 a week of tax exempt income in the current financial year. But next financial year, 1989-90, single pensioners, for example, will have tax exempt income of $25 weekly. So that is a 150 per cent increase in their tax exempt income next financial year, to be followed by a $40 weekly tax exempt income in 1990-91. So that will be a figure four times the current figure. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of those measures and of the further exemption from tax of the extra income of married pensioners-for whom the amount will be going up immediately; in the next financial year, beginning on 1 July, to $70 a week in tax exempt income-that particular group in the community should have a significantly larger capacity to save. As I pointed out, I believe that they are probably net savers now anyway. But, as a result of these measures-lower taxation through the April statement on the extra incomes of pensioners-that group should be able to have greater disposable incomes and therefore greater savings. Of course, this will not apply in the case of every household, but I am talking in generalisations. That is a very tangible way in which the Hawke Government has in recent months added, probably significantly, to the potential in the Australian community to save. Again, we are not talking about piecemeal measures. We are not talking about a tax break here, a rebate there, a concession there and a lurk somewhere else; we are talking about the putting in place of a general policy measure for a group of people in the community which should enable them to save more. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the points I would like to make in opposition to the pieces of legislation proposed by the Australian Democrats. It is much more important in government to go for general policy measures than for piecemeal measures. When addressing the taxation system with a view to reforming it, it is much more important to work on the basis of principles and not populism. That is a very important thing that distinguishes this Government from the populists in the Democrats-that we see tax reform as being based on principles, on general policy measures, and not on piecemeal one-off measures involving a tax rebate here, a tax concession there and a tax lurk somewhere else. So when one does those things-when one goes down the road of general policy measures, cleans out from the system the rebates, the concessions, the lurks and the loopholes-one has a tax base which is sound and not riddled with cancers and which therefore will generate revenues which can be redistributed to lower and middle income earners, as we are doing as a result of the April economic statement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very easy to understand the feelings that motivated the Australian Democrats to bring these two Bills before us today. The two Bills are the Income Tax Assessment (Savings Account Interest) Amendment Bill and the Income Tax Assessment (Housing Loan Interest) Amendment Bill. These two Bills are related in the sense that the first tries to stimulate savings and the second tries to reduce the impact of mortgage costs on individual Australians. It is perfectly clear that the need for these things has been very largely the result of the policies of the present Hawke Labor Government with regard to interest rates and tight monetary control. That, of course, stems from the very significant overseas debt which has been generated in the six years this Government has been in power, climbing now to something like $140 billion, and which, of course, is added to every month to the tune of $1 1/2 billion as a direct result of our current account deficit-which, of course, is the difference between our net exports and imports. In other words, as a nation, we are losing $1 1/2 billion a month, and we have to borrow to make up that difference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So it is clear that the Democrats, in concept at least, are on the right track-in so far as they see the need for there to be a stimulation of savings within Australia to cope with this ballooning debt problem of $1 1/2 billion a month and in that way ensure that we rely less and less on the import of foreign capital, either through loans or by the sale of our assets, and generate the money to cover that shortfall ourselves. We in the Opposition do not have any quarrel with that general concept. However, when we get down to the mechanics of the Bills themselves-the way they are actually drafted and the issues they seek to raise-we find that we are unable to give our support to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go to some of the provisions of the first Bill, which is the Income Tax Assessment (Savings Accounts Interest) Amendment Bill. As I have just outlined, there is no doubt that the Liberal and National parties strongly believe that Australians should be given greater encouragement and incentive to save. There are many reasons for that. They are not connected just with our immediate very sizable problems with the economy; rather, they are of a general nature and conform very greatly with the Future Directions document of the Liberal and National parties. That document, of course, indicates our interest in making Australians self- assured and in control of their own affairs by ensuring that they build up capital during their working lives so that they can indeed earn a satisfactory and well looked after retirement. So saving is part and parcel of our general approach to individuals and their futures. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us turn to some of the provisions of the Bills with which we have quarrels. We are not in any way sure that Senator Haines's Income Tax Assessment (Savings Accounts Interest) Amendment Bill will increase savings in the way she hopes it will. Senator Haines said in her second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . many Australians will save more if we give them a direct incentive to save by not taxing the first $2,000 of interest earned. That is what this Bill will achieve. </PARA>
<PARA>However, on analysing it-and I will come to the points later-it is pretty clear that that might not be so. It is more than likely that, if this Bill succeeds, the savings will merely be redirected from existing investment areas to the proposed low interest accounts in order to take advantage of that $2,000 tax free limit. In other words, the community is already investing in certain types of instruments, including savings accounts, but if a tax free incentive is offered, it is pretty clear that people will tend to take their money from whatever depository they are using and put it into another where they can get that added tax advantage. Quite clearly that is a consequence not contemplated in any way by the provisions of Senator Haines's Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> This reallocation of funds from one asset into another for certain kinds of financial institutions might very well significantly disrupt the capacity of individual enterprises and institutions to meet their commitments to their various borrowers. Moreover, for those who are presently earning at least $2,000 from interest income each year, Senator Haines's proposal would certainly not encourage additional savings because, quite clearly, those who may wish to save will not get the tax benefit beyond that $2,000. In other words, they will work it up to that maximum level of $2,000 of income and will have not incentive to go beyond it. So, quite clearly, this could run counter to the proposition which she is espousing. </PARA>
<PARA> I will quote from the Bills Digest issued by the Legislative Research Service of the Department of the Parliamentary Library, which makes a further point about this matter. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> For those who already earn--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Haines" NAMEID="1H4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator Haines</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, check that. They made a mistake in that. They have acknowledged that they got it wrong. I rang them yesterday. I mention that before you start reading-unless you have one that is dated today. They misread the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not dealing with that point. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>For those who already earn $2000 or more from their investments and pay more than the lowest marginal rate of tax, the incentive will largely be to channel the funds into a tax free return and so earn a greater after-tax return from the same level of investment (i.e. there will be little incentive to increase the total level of investment as they can take advantage of the tax free area already and any new investment will effectively be taxed at the marginal rate.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Acting Deputy President, the Library itself has summed up the series of points which I have just been making which led the Liberal and National parties to judge that this Bill is fatally flawed. It is true, however, as I said earlier, that the concept is an attractive one, and certainly there is a need to examine other alternatives to find the best way to encourage Australians to stimulate savings. There have been various proposals put forward to try to boost aggregate savings. What is needed right now, rather than to decide upon a piecemeal measure that is quite ineffective, such as this put forward by the Australian Democrats, is to examine the series of proposals that might be sculling around the community, test them in the full light of day and apply the blowtorch to them to ensure that they could possibly work well and effectively without undue cost to the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> I will instance the cases which the Liberal and National parties are examining which are on the public record at the present time. The first is that we would like to see an exemption of interest up to a certain amount. Of course, that amount would have to be determined and the details of eligibility decided. That is somewhat similar to this suggestion from the Democrats but it does not suffer from the same flaw, which is that the Democrats' proposal is virtually open-ended. </PARA>
<PARA> The second proposition is to apply a withholding tax of 15 per cent on interest in payment of the full tax liability. The effect of that would be to reduce the rate of tax from the marginal rate, which could be as high as 50.25 per cent, down to a maximum of 15 per cent. That would be a substantial incentive for people to save as they could then save on their tax liability to the extent of 30.25 per cent of the amount received. Of course, it could be a lesser amount depending upon the actual level of people's other income, as well as the interest income. That, again, deserves consideration and it is a proposal which we should send to a committee of the Senate to investigate further. </PARA>
<PARA> A third proposition could well be that we should apply a tax on only the real value of interest after taking inflation into account. In other words, whatever the interest level is, the inflation rate should be applied to it and the difference would be only that rate of interest described as real, which would be subject to tax. That would be very acceptable to potential savers in so far as they are inflation-proofed against that erosion from inflation which unfortunately is such a significant factor in investment management today. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope I have said enough to make the point that this is a very important issue. It needs the most careful and detailed consideration before anyone-least of all uninformed senators in this place-should suggest it as a major policy proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to the line of action on this Bill that the Liberal and National parties intend to take. We seek to have this general question of the effects on savings of the present system of taxation, and the measures that should be adopted to increase Australia's private savings in order to increase Australia's medium to long term investment performance, referred to the Senator Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report. That inquiry is to be included by the last day of sitting in 1989. In order to achieve that, we seek to move an amendment to the motion for the second reading of each of these Bills. In respect of the Income Tax Assessment (Savings Accounts Interest) Amendment Bill 1989, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> Leave out all words after ``That'', insert''</PARA>
<PARA> ``the following matters be referred to the Senate Standing on Finance and Public Adminstration for inquiry and report, on or before the last day of sitting in 1989:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the effects on savings of the present system of taxation; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the measures that should be adopted to increase Australia's private savings in order to increase Australia's medium to long-term investment performance''. </PARA>
<PARA>That amendment is the right way to proceed with this Bill before us today. We should consider in significant detail the most important questions which are influencing people in this country in their decision to invest. There is no doubt that the country needs more investment through savings. The question is, how to get it. What is the best way of approaching this question?</PARA>
<PARA> When Senator Haines sums up at the end of this debate I would like to know just how deeply the Democrats looked at the issue of stimulating savings. Perhaps she can satisfy us on some of the points that I have just been making. I have to say that, judging from the second reading speech and the simple nature of the Bill, it is more than likely that the Bill represents a simple, knee-jerk political reaction to that very justifiable concern in the community about the taxes applied to savings. The bare attention that the Democrats have given to the drafting of this proposal can be seen from clause 4 of this Bill. I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that the Bill refers to a savings account which is bearing interest at a rate of 12 per cent or less before the tax exemption would apply. Given the widely fluctuating interest rates that are applicable today, driven by this Government's monetary policies-</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walsh" NAMEID="TJ4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course they are posturing. We have to take that into account and perhaps we can address ourselves to some of those political matters later. With the fluctuating nature of the interest rate, one would think that if the Bill is to be effective and deliver some kind of assistance to people, it should take account of the fluctuating interest rate structure we have today. The rate will move. It is moving every day. Consequently, this may or may not be an adequate way of addressing it, but our judgment is that it certainly is not, and is totally inadequate. If the threshold rate had to be changed, a Bill would need to go through Parliament every time that interest rates fluctuate. Interest rates are moving literally weekly at the present time. Perhaps Senator Haines can explain how she would proceed to right this difficult flaw in the legislation which she is proposing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point I would like to make is that as the Bill is drafted there will be a significant windfall for financial institutions, particularly banks. Approved financial institutions could accept deposits for tax free savings at a lower rate-that is, the institution would pay only 12 per cent rather than the current market rate which could be significantly higher-while lending to commercial or other customers at that market rate. This would merely result in the financial institutions making a huge windfall gain. They would be able to do it because their effective rate would be below that 12 per cent-it would be subsidised by the Government. We would have the Commissioner of Taxation or the Treasury giving a subsidy to the person who had lent his money to the bank, thus lowering the overall cost of money to the bank, which would then lend it out at market rates and make a substantially greater profit, to the extent of that Treasury subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA> Why have not the Democrats thought through those particular proposals and come up with solutions? Those are the sorts of things that have to be examined deeply. That is why we think that it is necessary to refer this question to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point is that of cost. The cost of the Democrats' proposal, even by their own admission, would be very high. They say that the tax-free threshold proposal, on its own, could cost $1.1 billion. We have to assume, though, that that is a mere minimum. The other proposal-for a rebate for housing mortgage interest-could entail another $200m. The Democrats have given us no convincing financial statement to demonstrate in the first place how much this would all cost and, secondly, how the cost ought to be met from revenue or from the Budget generally. The cost would be colossal. </PARA>
<PARA> But our doubts go further. We in the Liberal and National parties are not satisfied that the proposal in the Democrats' statement is accurately costed. My colleague the honourable member for Mayo, Mr Downer, recently put out a press statement attacking Senator Haines's promise on housing interest rates calling it a popular stunt. On the question of the interest rebate for housing mortgages-the average rebate being, say, $20 a week-the honourable member pointed out that the annual cost throughout the community could well be over $1.6 billion, even at current interest rates, based on $1.6 billion worth of dwellings purchased by income units, as recorded in the Australian Bureau of Statistics 1988 housing survey. That compares with the Democrats estimate of $200m-some eight times greater. Just on these two proposals we are saying that, instead of $1.1 billion-already a highly significant figure-the Democrats proposals could well cost $2.7 billion. If there is anything that could be described as populist and political, it has to be the Democrats proposal to throw, in a quite irresponsible way, $2.7 billion at people in the form of these tax benefits in order to gain support at the polls. </PARA>
<PARA> Just to give some idea of the dimension of those two issues taken together, let us consider that the Government, in its latest announcements last month concerning tax cuts to apply from 1 July, said that the total cost of those would be $5.7 billion. This proposal from the Democrats would cost a little under half of that, which was already most significant. It is a far more costly proposal than this country could possibly afford. It is obviously not one that we could responsibly support. </PARA>
<PARA> During the second reading debate the Democrats answered that point by saying that more money would be available at lower interest rates through the savings proposal, that interest rates would fall and that people would therefore be able to buy more houses. As we pointed out earlier, these proposals would probably have the effect merely of directing funds from existing institutions, existing investments, into these new Democrat-designated institutions offering special tax benefits. As we have described, that would have other consequences, in the main not of direct benefit to those people whom the Democrats would like to see benefiting. In the digest of the Bill there is support for this point:</PARA>
<PARA>Unless there is a noticeable change in the level of total savings, and assuming demand remains constant, there will be little impact on interest rates through such a proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that that sums it up. It is quite clear-and this comes from an independent source in the Parliamentary Library; we do not have to rely on the words of the Liberal and National parties-that that proposal is subject to very serious question. As usual, the Democrats are using populist rhetoric in an attempt to attract support for Senator Haines's campaign in Kingston, South Australia, rather than supporting their case by sound analysis-let alone providing some kind of financial statement using proper methods to show how they come to their conclusions. I have moved the amendment that would require this matter to be referred to the Senate Committee. That would be the best solution for the Senate to adopt, and we urge all her senators to support it. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the Income Tax Assessment (Housing Loan Interest) Amendment Bill, I want now to foreshadow an amendment in the same form as our amendment to the savings account interest Bill. It draws attention to the same problems and seeks to refer the matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The housing loan interest Bill would allow a rebate on the component of mortgage interest above 10 per cent per year for the first $80,000 of loans for first homes. We appreciate the problems that have been created by this Government for home finance borrowers. Quite significantly, that is a function of this Government's mismanagement of the economy. We are very sympathetic about the problems of those who cannot buy houses because of price rises and their inability to meet repayment responsibilities. Nevertheless, this kind of issue cannot be solved very easily by this kind of reaction-the examination of which can be described as having been incomplete. It is true that this Bill is very similar to the system that was introduced by the Fraser Government in 1982. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I officially represent the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in this place I feel that I should say a few words. The two Bills which are before the Senate are the Income Assessment (Savings Accounts Interest) Amendment Bill 1989 and the Income Tax Assessment (Housing Loan Interest) Amendment Bill 1988. The first observation I want to make about them is that they are basically mutually contradictory. The first Bill purports to increase national savings. I will go into the reasons why it will not. But that is its stated purpose. The second Bill would unequivocally lead to dis-saving, or a lower savings effort, because of the revenue which would be forgone without any offsets or any possibility of offsets. Senator Messner has put an estimate on that of $1.6 billion. It is something that is very hard to cost but I would not argue too strongly against his estimate that there would be a dis-saving of $1.6 billion. Of course, it is just another piece of Australian Democrat populist posturing-the application of the magic pudding theory of politics to the business of trying to harvest votes in Kingston in particular.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first Bill provides for a limited amount of tax exemption for interest paid at 12 per cent or less by institutions which lend money for housing. It is possible that that would reduce housing interest rates, although how it is proposed to ensure that all the funds lent to an institution would be on lend for housing purposes let alone on lend at significantly lower rates-a point that Senator Messner has made-is a matter for wide-eyed conjecture. If it reduced interest rates, there would be a direct cost in providing a hidden subsidy to house borrowers at a cost to the Budget and probably in a much less effective way than would otherwise be possible. </PARA>
<PARA> But it would not increase aggregate saving for a number of reasons: First, 40 per cent of Australian householders already have undischarged housing mortgages. For people in that situation the option is already open to repay their mortgages more rapidly and thereby achieve the same personal benefits-if they have personal savings from investment-that this Bill would provide. Secondly, those who have undischarged credit card liabilities on which interest is being charged have exactly the same opportunities. Thirdly, the self-employed and some non-self-employed who are currently paying less than $3,000 a year into a personal cover superannuation scheme also have the same opportunity to invest in an almost tax-free investment. It will not affect or have any influence on the investment effort of taxpayers who already receive more than $2,000 in interest payments, nor will it affect the behaviour of taxpayers below the threshold. When we put all those things together-people with housing mortgages; people with undischarged credit card obligations on which interest is being charged; a large number of self-employed; taxpayers with more than $2,000 of interest; and taxpayers below the threshold-we have the vast majority of the Australian population, the savings decisions of whom will not be affected whatsoever by this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, we have target savers; that is, people who are running some sort of investment account in order to buy a car, an overseas trip or some other consumer durable. The fact that interest earned in that account would be tax free would bring forward the purchase of the item and, therefore, bring forward or increase total consumption; again, another result directly opposed to the ostensible purpose of this Bill. However, on the present volume and pattern of savings the concession will cost $1.2 billion in revenue. In other words, on the present volume and present patterns, public saving will be reduced by $1.2 billion if this legislation is passed. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the present pattern of cash investment would not last for a number of reasons. Many of those receiving more than $2,000 in interest payments will split their deposits in order to get a double benefit for the tax-free $2,000 of interest receipts. Revenue losses which will induce further revenue losses-that is, lower savings efforts in the public sector-will not be matched by any savings increase in the private sector. Those with cash investments presently in other institutions-institutions other than those named in the Bill-will shift their investment, at least to the extent that it enables them to get the benefit of the $2,000 tax free interest income. That will lead to further revenue losses and, therefore, to further dis-saving in the public sector with no offsetting increase in private savings. </PARA>
<PARA> The bottom line of all that is that the net effect of this legislation would be to induce a lower total savings effort in the country because the public dis-savings it would bring on would certainly not be matched by the possibility of there being some increase in savings effort by a small minority of people in the private sector. Of course, Senator Stone was well aware of this when he wrote for publication in the Sunday Telegraph last Sunday:</PARA>
<PARA>Thus we have various bright ideas being canvassed (including by some Opposition members who ought to know better) about so-called incentives for saving. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Stone went on to say that most of them are intellectually disrespectable, and he is absolutely right. The popular impression that Australia has a low household savings ratio, or even a low total savings ratio, by world standards is not entirely correct. Indeed, the household savings ratio in Australia is much higher than in comparable countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States of America. We have a very high level of investment which would require a high domestic savings effort in order to be matched from internal sources. Our private savings effort is inadequate by quite a large margin to support the investment program currently being undertaken. To offset that deficiency in the private sector requires public sector saving and a continuing and substantial Commonwealth Budget surplus. That is a policy that the Government will continue to apply. </PARA>
<PARA> In the rhetoric that has attached to this second reading debate, the Democrats-as usual-purport to be looking after the little people. Senator Haines, who presented this legislation, has previously used her vote to allow tax evaders, such as the Kelly brothers and their cherry-picker scheme, to walk away with millions of what I regard as stolen taxpayers' money-ostensibly because she was absolutely committed to the principle of not voting for legislation which had a retrospective impact. That same Senator Haines, towards the end of last year, moved an amendment to Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 3) which gave it a retrospective application. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have already said, and as Senator Messner has acknowledged, the second Bill recycles a 1982 Fraser Government piece of vote bait. Senator Haines claims that it will assist those most in need. In fact, it is extremely poorly targeted and provides that interest payments above 10 per cent on the first $80,000 of any loan will be allowed as a tax deduction no matter when the loan was taken out. The loan may have been taken out 10 years ago. At that time an $80,000 loan would have bought a luxury or near luxury home in most Australian capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the loans were taken out more than 10 years ago. The people who have had loans for a considerable length of time have enjoyed that benefit, firstly, of a declining outstanding debt in real terms and, therefore, a declining interest payment to service the interest component of that debt. In addition, they are protected if they have bank loans by the grandfathering of the 13 1/2 per cent interest ceiling. It is an extremely poorly targeted measure, the costs of which are difficult to estimate with any precision. As I said earlier, I do not wish to quarrel too much with the $1.6 billion figure that Senator Messner suggested. There is no magic pudding. The magic pudding theory might be all right for those people who never expect that they will have to accept the responsibility of being in government and putting a Budget together. No concoctions of this type can be made available to one section of the community without imposing a penalty on some other section.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition knows very well that these two Bills are pieces of nonsense and they ought to be thrown out of the Senate at the second reading stage. It has chosen the intermediate or non-committal course of moving to refer them to a Senate committee. The Government will not support that move because it is a waste of taxpayers' resources, both those resources that are funded within the Parliament and, of course, the Public Service which will be called upon to supply submissions and information to the Committee. It is a waste of resources and a waste of time. </PARA>

Before I reply to Senator Maguire, I should like to make a response to Senator Walsh who, in his brief discussion on this legislation, complained that there was no time limit on the applicability of the tax concession to own-home buyers, that is, he complained that this concession would go back into the dim distant past and that people would obtain a benefit to which they were not entitled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind Senator Walsh that, of course, that is what applies to the Government's negative gearing scheme and, what is worse in that scheme, there is no limit on the interest rate paid, for which people can obtain a deduction, nor is there a limit on the amount they can borrow for which they can enjoy some sort of tax concession. I am finding it a little extraordinary that Senator Walsh of all people should say that he will not support this legislation because it is basically flawed in an area which is an integral part of the Government's negative gearing scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> People who buy into the investment housing market at any level at all are able to get a total tax concession for it, not a partial tax concession, not a concession that is limited by the interest rate and not a concession that is limited by the amount of money borrowed. I am afraid that the comments of Senator Walsh were sanctimonious, silly and rather hypocritical. </PARA>
<PARA> For half an hour Senator Maguire delivered essentially a history of the Australian Democrats. He said it was very easy for the Democrats to parade around Australia in addition to parading around the Senate chamber suggesting tax cuts, concessions and so on. He said that we will never have to be in government; yet we are here putting up these proposals. I remind Senator Maguire and anybody else who wants to advance this argument that `the Democrats will never be in government and therefore it is easy for us to take these populist lines', in fact, we are part of the governing body in Australia. This Parliament consists of two chambers. Both of them have equal rights or virtually equal rights over legislation, and amending government legislation is as integral a part of being in government as taking the benches opposite is. We are as answerable for our actions as any other member in this chamber. We are part of government by dint of power and the position we hold in the Senate and we are prepared to stand on a daily basis and accept that. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not do what the Liberals do and see some specious difference between Budget Bills and all other legislation; so most of the legislation goes through because the Liberal Party supports the Government's legislation. The Australian Democrats look at legislation on its merits, whether it is our own or somebody else's, and at amendments whether they are our own or somebody else's, and vote accordingly. If that is not part of being in government and accountable, I do not know what it is. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Maguire also suggested this was a ploy in my campaign bid for Kingston. That goes to show how little he knows not only about the campaign in Kingston but also the history of this legislation. One of these two Bills was introduced for the first time in 1981, the second time in 1983 and the third time in 1984. Even I was not contemplating a move from the Senate to the House of Representatives at that stage. It is very easy to sling these sorts of remarks around the chamber when a senator is as ignorant of the processes of this place as Senator Maguire obviously is. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Maguire and other senators should accept that the fact of the matter is that people out there are hurting because of the policies of this Government and the approval, through the legislative process, that the Opposition has given this Government in areas of deregulation and foreign investment, in the approval that the Opposition has given to the Government whenever cutting expenditure in social welfare areas has occurred and where easing tax on the corporate sector has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no good Senator Maguire, Senator Messner and Senator Walsh saying that we must increase the amount of public saving. We are cutting revenue in this place all the time through the coalition between the Government and the Opposition in encouraging companies to pay as little tax as possible and not giving any sort of break to the ordinary Australian individuals or families. The fact is that the playing field in Australia is not level as it is in most other countries for people who invest in housing and people who want to buy a home for themselves and their children. </PARA>
<PARA> In the United States of America and Great Britain, home owners can get a tax concession. In Australia it is only investors in the housing market who can get a tax concession. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that, since the Labor Government, with the support of the Opposition, reintroduced negative gearing for investors in the real estate market, we have seen a massive change in the percentages of homes bought by the three groups who buy houses in Australia-the first home buyers, investors, and people who are selling one home and buying another. It should not surprise any honourable senator to learn that the proportion that has increased significantly since then is the proportion of the market going to investors. If Senator Walsh is concerned about an increase in the building industry, he has to look to his own policies and the part played in home purchases by investors as the cause. </PARA>
<PARA> We support equity. Senator Maguire carried on a treat about the need for all of this sort of thing to be equitable. It currently is not equitable. It is not equitable when it comes to purchasing homes. It is not equitable in many other tax areas. It was in fact our commitment to tax equity that led the Australian Democrats to support the Government's capital gains tax and fringe benefits tax legislation, Bills which the Opposition parties opposed at the time. Senator Maguire said that the Fraser Government bribed the voters by offering a tax rebate for home buyers. Yet the Australian Labor Party (ALP), which supported that original Fraser Government legislation, took it away from everyone but investors. I do know know who is bribing whom but I certainly do know who is not concerned with equity. The people who are not concerned with equity in this place are the two major parties. Investors are able to get a tax deduction but home buyers cannot. `Tax concessions', said Senator Maguire, `are bad. They lead to tax rorts. They lead to people avoiding their tax commitments. They lead to an inability by government to raise revenue. They decrease public savings'. </PARA>
<PARA> Apparently it does not bother Senator Maguire or anybody in the coalition parties either that we offer tax concessions to the corporate welfare sector hand over fist. Why does he suppose that the Alan Bonds of this world have been able to get their tax payments down to nothing, and at a time of a nominal company tax rate of 49c in the dollar? Now that, thanks to the Opposition supporting the Government's legislation, the company tax rate has gone down to 39c in the dollar, I presume that people such as Alan Bond will be getting taxpayers to pay money back to them. </PARA>
<PARA> The ALP has done nothing at all to end corporate welfare and has attacked ordinary Australian families as well as the social welfare sector instead. It has cut company tax by 20 per cent from 49c to 39c in the dollar, at a cost of $2 billion last year. It complains now about a piece of legislation of ours that would spend $1 billion-half the amount spent on companies-on hundreds of thousands of ordinary Australian families who cannot benefit from negative gearing and who do not benefit from the sorts of concessions that this Government and this Opposition have offered companies enthusiastically, although there is no perceptible benefit to the community at large by way of additional jobs, additional export markets or export replacement items. </PARA>
<PARA> The first home owners scheme that Senator Maguire got so enthusiastic about has had the heart cut out of it by this Government and it helps fewer people than the legislation before the Parliament today would. There was a lot of talk from Senator Maguire about the megarich benefiting. Certainly Labor Party policies to date have acted to help the megarich unless Senator Maguire believes that Alan Bond, John Elliott, Robert Holmes a Court and John Spalvins et al are not among the megarich but are among the deserving poor, which I find a little difficult to swallow. </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, I do not care if a few of the megarich get $2,000 tax free, as long as savings increase and interest rates decrease as a consequence. I do not mind if the mega-rich subsidise the interest rates of ordinary Australian families who currently cannot afford to pay mortgage levels that they are confronting because of high interest rates. Senator Maguire carefully overlooked the fact that this $2,000 of interest tax free would be of particular help to pensioners, especially those who find themselves faced with a provisional tax payment once their interest hits $1,000. It would certainly be a more equitable way of going about encouraging savings than indexation, which has been put about by the Liberals courtesy of that intellectual giant Alexander Downer, which will help most those people who can afford to save most. Here is a system that will help the rich disproportionately to the less well off. I might add that Senator Maguire has never seen any need for consistency, having been, as I have said, perfectly happy to deny to revenue something like $2 billion through the company tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an indisputable link between low levels of savings and high levels of interest rates. The greater the demand for money, the higher price the supplier of the money can charge for it. There is also a link between high consumer spending and a huge trade imbalance, given that large amounts of the expenditure go on imported goods. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) is saying that because of these things, because of the link between low savings and high interest rates, because of the link between high consumer spending and our trade imbalance, people should be encouraged to save and not spend. Why should they when there is no incentive to save, when half the money they earn in interest goes in tax? Of course, they will not do it. A broad-based consumption tax is not the solution either because it will hit hardest those who can least afford it. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important thing we need to remember, however, in all of this is that, as a recent piece of research by BIS Shrapnel shows, more than 1 1/2 million Australians will be inadequately housed if the current trend continues. If that is not enough to liven up Senator Maguire, I do not know what is. Senator Messner in his contribution said, `Yes, there is a need to encourage savings and help home buyers'. He castigated the ALP for the proposals that it had introduced to put the country into the parlous economic state that it is currently in, forgetting how much help he and his National Party colleagues have given the Government in doing just that. </PARA>
<PARA> He said that the Democrats' proposal, in concept at least, was on the right track in wanting to encourage savings in order to cut reliance on foreign money. However, while the Opposition liked the principle, it did not like the method. If we spent time in this place looking for the perfect method to do anything, we would never get anything done. Right at the moment we have a lot of people out there hurting badly. We are now quibbling in here about whether it is better to give the first $2,000 tax free or whether it is better to do it by a cumbersome accounting method of indexing for inflation. I am sorry to see the dearth of speakers on the list to debate this Bill. Certainly there do not seem to be too many people on either side of the chamber who are interested. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Haines said that there was a dearth of speakers on both sides on this Bill. May I point out to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that we were especially asked by the Democrats to get this legislation to a vote today and we have done everything we could to accommodate them. Senator Messner was our only speaker, on the undertaking that we gave that we would do our best to see that the Democrats got their Bills to a vote. So it is not for the Leader of the Democrats to come in here and start telling us that we are not taking any interest in her Bills or participating in the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That did not alter the fact that, instead of hearing from Senator Messner a half an hour monologue which said nothing, we may have been able to hear 15 minutes from him and 15 minutes from Senator Short, who might have had something more intelligent to say, coming out of Treasury, as he apparently does. Senator Messner said that he was not sure whether savings would increase. However, he did not give any particular reason for holding that belief. He thinks savings would be redirected from existing investments to low interest accounts. Great. That is precisely what I would like to see happen, at least as part of the result of this legislation. If people take their money out of 15 per cent accounts and put it into 12 per cent accounts, the lending interest rate must also come down. That will be enormously beneficial to those people who are finding that they cannot afford to pay their mortgages or who see no point at all in saving money because they will never meet the deposits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Messner said that piecemeal measures are ineffective. That is how this place operates. One should look at the number of amending Bills that come into this place. He said that we need to look at all the issues in the area, such as exemption of interest up to a certain amount with eligibility criteria, also a withholding tax of 15 per cent instead of the top rate. Why will these not lead to the so-called fatal flaws that he says are in my Bills? We had no explanation of that from Senator Messner. He said that we needed to look at the application of a tax only on the real value of interest after inflation was taken into account. That would produce a much more inequitable system than the one we have put forward. He says that we need to be informed about all of this and that it should all go to a committee. He has duly moved an amendment to that effect. We are not going to watch our Bills being defeated by the process of sending the issues to a committee. If Senator Messner wants to move tomorrow to send the issues to a committee we will cheerfully support him, but we want him to acknowledge that the Opposition is opposing two ways of helping Australian families under the guise of getting more information about the issues. There is plenty of information about the issues out there. We can have a look at what the Swedish Government is currently doing by way of compulsory savings and we can have a look at how successful the Japanese Government was in the last 40 years by not taxing savings at all and providing low interest loans for investment. There are plenty of ways of getting the information without denying for a further year or more the sort of assistance that ordinary Australian families need. </PARA>
<PARA> `Populist' is a word that has come up all over the place tonight. I have news for Senator Maguire and Senator Messner, who use it as if it were a pejorative term. The populace do not necessarily see anything wrong with a populist move coming up in this place; in fact, they would rather like it to happen from time to time. Instead of this chamber and the other place dealing only with what is good for big business, for foreign investors and for big investors, we got around to dealing with something that was in the interests of the populace; that is, was populist. Maybe we would see some significant changes to equity in this country; maybe we would see wealth distributed a little more fairly; and maybe we would not see 50,000 young people homeless. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to face up to a few questions in this place. Either we want tax equity or we do not; either we want to help ordinary families in the same way that we help wealthy companies or investors or we do not; and either we want to encourage savings or we do not. Frankly the Democrats want all those things. The vote on these Bills will tell us whether the Liberal, National and Labor parties want these things too. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The wheat Bills have led to a wide-ranging debate throughout Australia and much soul-searching by wheat growers, not least in my own State of South Australia where, for some 12 months, the Kerin package, as first proposed, was greatly debated in rural centres. Since that time there have been significant modifications to the original package of proposals and we have now before us the wheat legislation. From the outset I want to condemn the way in which the Government through the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has sought at every opportunity to play politics with this important industry. It may be that the Australian Labor Party is cynical about its very limited support in country areas. Whether we in this chamber can be cynical or not, it is the case that the Labor Government has not shown that it has at heart the interests of the industry, or the wheat growers and their families in rural areas. Rather it has tried to catch out the members of the Liberal and National parties who do have those industries, those growers and those families at heart.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At various points over the past six months the heartfelt concerns expressed by me, as a Liberal, and many of my colleagues in the coalition, have led us to be quite searching in our comments about the Kerin package. We have been aware that the Government failed to win the support of the industry and thus there have been many dialogues, meetings and deputations. Liberal and National Party senators and members have taken those discussions most seriously and have tried to understand the views being put forward by wheat growers. It is understandable that the Press and public observers have seen some tensions while we have tried to work out what exact form of amendments to the wheat package as proposed by the Government will be supportable by the main body of the industry and in the best interests of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Even now there are some private judgments amongst my colleagues as to where that burden of amendment should lie. As is the case in any matter coming before the coalition, eventually all of those discussions percolate to a policy stand and a formal concluding debate and decision. The decision that concluded that 12 months of debate was the statement of our primary industry policy of 4 April this year which was adopted unanimously in the coalition. As it is a brief and quite formal public statement, Mr Acting Deputy President, I seek leave for this public statement of policy to be incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> As part of the restructuring and reform of the Australian economy, the Coalition is committed to the completion of the deregulation of the domestic wheat market. So that the burdens of restructuring are fairly shared, this deregulation should occur in conjunction with progress being achieved in certain areas which impinge on that market and which are mentioned below. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Coalition is absolutely committed to all possible action being taken to minimise the impact on the domestic wheat market of extreme corruption in world wheat markets. This goal should be pursued in concert with the commitment to deregulation of the domestic wheat market. </PARA>
<PARA> The Coalition believes that complete deregulation of the domestic wheat market should proceed in conjunction with:</PARA>
<PARA> reasonable progress towards deregulation in the transport, handling, storage and waterfront areas to reduce the many cost burdens placed upon wheat growers by high levels of regulation, restrictive work practices and anti-market abuses in those areas;</PARA>
<PARA> a 95% underwriting guarantee to provide a satisfactory first advance or cash trading option for the Wheat Board;</PARA>
<PARA> the maintenance of the Wheat Board's existing powers in relation to exports; and</PARA>
<PARA> the Board having the capacity to remain a strong trader competing on fair and reasonable terms with other domestic traders. </PARA>
<PARA> Any legislation presented by the Government will be assessed against the position set out in the preceding paragraph. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Hawke Government is seriously committed to deregulation of the domestic wheat market on fair and reasonable terms, it will present a legislative package in accordance with the criteria we have set out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. This conclusion is a genuine compromise on all of the representations that Liberal-National Party members brought to this concluding debate, taking into account all that we had heard and all that we had come to understand about the dimensions of the debate. There is an enormous priority in this country for micro-economic reform, for deregulation, for getting away from each industry in Australia a clutter that adds cost, or for removing barriers that restrict the choice of various elements in an industry. So, this was a major consideration in coming to this compromise statement. On the other hand, there is a legitimate concern expressed by any one industry to ensure that it is not being singled out to have some new heat of the marketplace, or some change from an orderly marketing system, thrust upon it in the name of the highly commendable micro-economic reform, if that is not going to be fully able to be coped with by that industry in the short term, or if it is unfairly a pressure being put upon that industry, but not all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The statement which I have had incorporated in Hansard and which is the policy of the coalition, after a preamble, concentrates upon four criteria for the deregulation of the domestic wheat market. These are four criteria which all coalition members support. The first is that there should be reasonable progress towards deregulation in the transport, handling, storage and waterfront areas to reduce the many cost burdens placed upon wheat growers by high levels of regulation, restrictive work practices and anti-market abuses in those areas. Of course, we want to reduce the cost burdens upon wheat growers. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give one example: In my State of South Australia, growers have a free choice, without restrictions, as to the form of transport that they use to take grain to a port. They can use their own truck to take their wheat 200 kilometres, say, to Port Lincoln, or they can use their own truck to take it five kilometres to, say, Woodener, to a silo, and there the silo, through the cooperative bulk handling company, transports the wheat by rail to Port Lincoln. Or they can contract a trucking firm to take their wheat either the short distance or the long distance. There is a free choice and in fact it is a market choice for the grower. If his vehicle is not strong enough or efficient enough to bear the strain of the long distance, he will choose to take on a trucking company. If he thinks, because of his proximity to a rail head, that there is a genuine advantage in using rail, he will use rail. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not the case in New South Wales, not only with regard to transport in these elements but also at the waterfront. There are barriers to the free and efficient use of the waterfront in New South Wales. In fact, I will come later on to some very sharp contrasts in other areas of grain handling between my State of South Australia, which is so very well developed-it has probably the best grain handling system in the world-and the eastern States such as New South Wales. Clearly, there is a pressing urgency to gain deregulation on the waterfront and in transport and other areas, such as we have outlined in that first criterion and, I must say, particularly in the eastern States. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say something about storage. Even as a South Australian senator, who on perhaps only a couple of occasions a year, drives through the countryside in New South Wales and Victoria, compared with my 20 to 50 times in South Australia, I have seen, over many years now, temporary grain storage in New South Wales. On the side of the road, in someone's paddock, will be a great heap of grain lying on tarpaulins on the ground, with a tarpaulin on top and some car tyres holding it down. It looks highly temporary and one wonders whether or not the grain industry is in the twentieth century. Whereas, in my State of South Australia the growers themselves have paid for a $1 billion silo storage system which is systematically all over rural areas. We have a very large grain belt in my State and every town one goes to has its large silos. It is, as I say, the most efficient and best established infrastructure for grain storage and handling anywhere in the world. I commend the growers of my State of South Australia that this is the case, that they have achieved this. Moreover, no-one can allege that there is one government dollar in it. At no stage did the growers of South Australia gain one dollar from the State Government or from the Commonwealth Government-not one dollar from the taxpayers generally-to pay for that silo system. </PARA>
<PARA> So, when they have elected grower representatives on the board of the cooperative grain handling company, they have control-that is, grower control-of the silo system, and they have total freedom of choice in their transport arrangements to the silo and they have full confidence in the Australian Wheat Board, we can understand how, despite the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy pointing up some of the obvious difficulties with grain in New South Wales and Victoria, the South Australian growers, even when they listened a great deal, were saying to us, `Well, we don't see any particular reason to move from the status quo. We must say that we have not asked for a change. We don't welcome a change. We recognise that the present law in Canberra that regulates these matters will expire in June of 1989. We know that there needs to be new legislation. But, as to this Kerin proposal which would deregulate domestic marketing and do all sorts of other things to the Australian Wheat Board with regard to exports and so on, we still do not understand why these reforms are necessary. As our representatives in Canberra, please do not thrust them upon us'. </PARA>
<PARA> I, along with my colleagues in the Liberal and National parties, genuinely responded to those very clearly expressed views in the industry. Hence we have the other three criteria which the coalition adopted as the basis, or the criteria on which we could go on to the advantages of micro-economic reform that I referred to earlier. The first of the other three criteria was the 95 per cent underwriting guarantee, to provide a satisfactory first advance or cash trading option for the Wheat Board. This is a very important provision, a very important goal. Because the Labor Government has not sought to represent the views of the wheat industry in this matter, this Bill does not have that. It has a 90 per cent underwriting guarantee, becoming, in a matter of years, an 80 per cent guarantee, and then no guarantee at all. So, the Bill that is before us has 90, becoming 80, becoming zero. The coalition's firm view is that that underwriting guarantee should be at the 95 per cent level. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not need to remind the Senate that the phrase `95 per cent underwriting guarantee' is itself a brief description of a quite complicated formula, but that formula is well known within the industry. In fact, it takes into account wheat prices in recent years as well as an estimated price for the current year and takes an average of them. The 95 per cent is related to that. Without going into that detail, the important aspect of the underwriting provision is that it activates a guaranteed price to growers where the guarantee is given under the existing legislation by the Commonwealth Government. If there is a shortfall in the money to be paid to growers, it is made up by the Commonwealth Government, using taxpayer funds. The only time that that has been activated was in respect to the 1986-87 crop and there is likely to be an estimated payout of $220m. I say `there is likely to be' because it is not actually completed yet. It will be of that order. </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, this is in fact one of the major reasons why the legislation is before us in this form. The reason for the Kerin package was that the Hawke Labor Government, like any modern government in countries such as Australia, has financial restraints and does not like paying out $220m under existing legislation to a constituency which does not greatly support the Labor Party. No doubt there was a great deal of soul searching in the Labor Cabinet as to how this payout of $220m could be avoided in the future. The Kerin plan, as it was originally proposed many months ago, was even more draconian than the provision that is in this legislation with regard to the guarantee. So, it is very easy for the public not to be fooled that two of the major elements of this whole wheat package represent the Labor Party, firstly, gleefully trying to divide off various elements of the Liberal and National parties that are conscientiously seeking to be in dialogue about these matters with their constituents and, secondly, saving itself paying a bill for this $220m to a constituency which the Labor Party believes has seen through it and does not support it. </PARA>
<PARA> The third criterion is an absolutely essential one. Because it has been stated in our policy, it just had to be accepted by the Government. It is the maintenance of the Wheat Board's existing powers in relation to exports. Only over thousands of wheat growers' dead bodies would there be any change to the exclusive handling of the export of wheat by the Australian Wheat Board. Certainly, growers do not want any change to that provision, and that is the policy of the coalition. Thankfully, any ambiguities, any slippery slope towards departing from that in the Kerin plan, have been now, through Opposition pressure and industry pressure, removed from the legislation that is before us. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth criterion is that the Wheat Board have the capacity to remain a strong trader competing on fair and reasonable terms with other domestic traders. Eighty per cent of wheat grown in Australia is exported. The Wheat Board, therefore, has control of the lion's share of the crop. Under the present legislation, it has control of the other 20 per cent-the domestic and stock feed elements of the wheat crop. Whilst there is this freeing up to competition of the domestic market-that 15 per cent part of the wheat crop-it is important that the Wheat Board be one of the principal players and that there be no unfair or unreasonable barrier to the Australian Wheat Board being a domestic trader in competition with all the others. </PARA>
<PARA> When we had adopted not only the full statement of our policy but in particular these four criteria, the coalition found that the Government was ready to introduce its legislation. Being aware of what he had decided, the Government naturally, and I think very wisely, itself amended much of the original Kerin package to approximate the policy that the coalition had put down. It was aware that the legislation needed to be passed through the Parliament. I acknowledge not only that the Government did amend the original Kerin package but also that that was very largely a result of the clear coalition decision on 4 April. We then found, on 13 April, when the legislation was introduced into the Parliament, that it was necessary to apply our policy and our four criteria to the legislation itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Because it was necessary to seek further amendments to that legislation, we have before us now a large number of coalition moved amendments that will bring the legislation much closer to the adopted coalition policy. Because of those amendments being approved by the coalition parties meeting together, I have been persuaded by my colleagues that with those amendments we should happily adopt this legislation. It is certainly the case that the legislation, as amended by the Opposition's package of amendments, will not endanger the prosperity of growers in Australia and will not in any radical way disrupt the wheat industry in any of the States of Australia, including my own State of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to the main amendment, as I see it, and that is for the 95 per cent guarantee. I have already indicated why it is so important. I support that guarantee at the 95 per cent level, as I support every other element of the adopted coalition policy. I have had discussions with wheatgrowers in my own State since the coalition's response to the legislation was made public, and I am happy to note that, whilst growers originally were entirely sceptical of the Kerin plan and entirely anxious about the deregulation of the domestic market, they have now come to be prepared to accept the legislation on the basis of the approved coalition amendments. I regard that as a very welcome flexibility in the growers and in the industry in my State. I commend those leading wheatgrowers who have been in continual contact with me over the last 12 months as we have gone through this discussion and debate together. I, jointly with them, believe that we have gained a great deal in the reassurances that are necessary to ensure that the industry is in continuing prosperity in my State. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the particular advantages that flow from the provisions of the legislation is that it gives a new, clear flexibility to allow a premium price to be given to a specialist grower. If a wheat grower seeks to produce a crop that was chemically free, or a crop that had high protein beyond the four standards for classifying wheat as it is received in the silos in my State, in the past that grower has not been able to gain the market price for the specialised product that he has produced, but rather has had to take the price that was the fair average for one of the four categories of wheat that obtained in the system. This legislation does, however, give a direct incentive for specialised products to be rewarded with a higher price. So, there will be a market mechanism that is a welcome change and is one of the genuine positives in the new arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I, for one, as a Liberal senator from South Australia, will be very vigilant with regard to the effect that this new legislation has on the grain industry in my State of South Australia and on the livelihood and prosperity of grain growers. I share their reassurance that there are some advantages in the new arrangements and that there are very unlikely to be any disasters. We will see how the new arrangements proceed season by season and, to the extent that there made need to be adjustments to ensure the prosperity of the industry and of growers, I am sure that such initiatives for change would come from the Liberal and National parties. I am happy, with my coalition colleagues, to support the amendments that will be moved by the coalition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating a package of seven wheat Bills, the main one being the Wheat Marketing Bill itself and the others being enabling economic measures associated with it. One can only wonder at the drafting of legislation such as this, when the Government brings it into the House of Representatives and has a couple of dozen or more amendments to its own legislation, the Opposition has a couple of dozen more amendments to it, the Government refuses most of those amendments-except its own, of course-and then it sends the Bill here, where it knows that those couple of dozen amendments can be carried with the support of Democrats and the coalition. I have had experience with legislation of this nature before, where the Government has brought in revolutionary type legislation and the Opposition has worked like steam to amend it and amend it to try to turn it into decent legislation. On each of those occasions the legislation that has come about has been bad legislation and has led to a crippled administration of those Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The massive economic problems that are being experienced generally in our rural industries today started back at the turn of the century when the debate between the protectionists and the anti-protectionists was won by the protectionists. This was not unusual and it was not out of kilter with what was going on in the rest of the world. Nearly all trading countries opted for protection of their industries. But what this did was cause enormous distortions to our own internal economies and corruption of the world economies. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of our tariff protection to our big industries in the metropolitan and urban areas has been to turn them into high cost industries. Those high costs have been passed on to the rural sector and, of course, the rural sector has to trade on world markets where it has no protection. This really was what led to the formation of the Country Party, as it was. I am grateful that a political party was formed because at least it gave it some clout. The supporters of the Country Party were requiring subsidies to offset the effects of protection of the urban industries which were turned into high cost industries and passed on their costs to the rural industries. It is also for this reason that our political opponents refer to the Nationals now as agrarian socialists. But that is completely untrue. Whenever they refer to us as that, they never refer to the high tariff protection that their supporters enjoy and that is causing the problem that they have had to organise themselves to beat. </PARA>
<PARA> After the Second World War, the wheat industry experienced a time of desperately low prices engineered by forces outside the wheatgrowers' control. So they decided to organise, and they did. They got together and decided that they would build storage out on the farms, they would concentrate on their transport and communications systems from the farms to the ports, and they would build storage and loading facilities at the ports. All of that entailed no government money at all. But it was an enormous cost. As part of their structuring of the wheat industry, they formed the Australian Wheat Board. They decided that they would pool all their wheat and pay a levy towards the running of the Wheat Board and to pay off the enormous cost of the capital works that had been instituted to handle wheat. The State governments cooperated in that effort and, by and large, the Wheat Board functioned very well and everyone was happy with it. Even the Wheat Board's customers were happy with the operation-with the grading, classification and quality of wheat.</PARA>
<PARA> Prior to this legislation there was no great bleating cry from the industry for re-organisation. The Federal Government, of course, as part of its commitment to develop an export industry such as this, underwrote the wheat crop each year in the case of failure so that the Wheat Board would have some feeling of security. For years and years, since the war, the Government did not have to shell out. But recently there was a failure, and the Government had to stand by the Wheat Board and inject funding to meet the guaranteed price. I feel sure that this is why the legislation was introduced. If the wheat industry had received money from its own levy to underwrite its own crop, there would not have been any need for Government interference in the industry. The Government would not have been given a lever with which to enter the industry and bring about such deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA> However, from listening to the debate, it is quite obvious that the Government feels that the people involved in the wheat industry largely do not support it, so it has turned its guns on the wheat industry itself instead of on areas which could have generated massive savings, such as the wharves, coastal shipping, railways, and labour generally. The report of the McColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage Handling and Transport stated we could save $2 billion just by straightening out our wharves and coastal shipping and the unsavoury work practices that are involved in those areas. The wheat industry earns about $2 billion, so, all in all, we are talking about earnings and savings of $4 billion, which is a massive amount of money. We have heard in this debate about the costly work practices in Brisbane and Mackay. At one stage in Mackay, $10,000 was paid out for 40 minutes work. </PARA>
<PARA> Wheat exports, like sugar exports, total about 80 per cent of the crop. Twenty per cent is used for the domestic market. Of that 20 per cent, about 10 per cent is used for stock feed and 10 per cent for human consumption. The domestic market is already two-thirds deregulated. These Bills, of course, introduce measures to finish the job. I had two extended trips to the wheat growing areas. The industry wants two things: orderly marketing, and grower control of the Wheat Board. Again, this is not agrarian socialism in action, because although the boards are given statutory powers, that is done at the request of the industry, and the industry is controlled by the growers. The Government had only a minor role, except, as I say, for this contract to underwrite the crop, and I am sure that that forms the basis of this Bill. So the two fundamentals I found everywhere I went were orderly marketing and grower control. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), in his second reading speech, repeatedly confirmed that the Wheat Board would be protected. He said it would be strengthened and the Government's role would be minimised. But when one looks at the Bill, one sees that this is not the case. The Board has been reconstituted so that now there is an unacceptably low level of grower representation on it. The Board will have to seek the permission of the Minister before it can borrow or spend any money, spend the growers' own levy, or start a subsidiary company. In other words, the Board will be more under the control of the Minister than it was previously. There are at least 20 instances of ministerial interference in the Board's affairs-even after the massive amount of amendments that was moved by the Government in the other place. The Bill that is now before us still gives the Minister far too much power to interfere. The Minister assured us that the Australian Wheat Board would remain the dominant force in this new, deregulated domestic market, but the current legislation runs out on 1 July. The Government has been unable to convince any of the States to pass complementary legislation. This procedure is absolutely necessary if this legislation is to come into force. </PARA>
<PARA> I know the Government has put heavy pressure on the Victorian Government to pass complementary legislation. The Victorian Government is making noises that it will do so. New South Wales is in the same position; the South Australian Parliament is in recess at the moment, so the State Government will be hard pressed to introduce any legislation. Nobody has heard about Western Australia; it has probably been forgotten, in the consideration of this legislation. Queensland is in a different position because it has its own Wheat Board and could probably cooperate with the legislation if it saw fit. The provisions that were contained in this Bill meant that it was being forced on the States, which of course earn revenue from the transport of wheat on their trains. In fact, the only real areas of profit for State government railways are the carriage of coal and wheat, so they would not like to see any loss of earnings in those areas. Maybe there will not even be a loss in those areas, because export wheat will still be transported by train. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, the current legislation runs out on 1 July. I wonder whether the Minister expects the Wheat Board to continue operating outside the Constitution after that time, or whether the States will challenge this intrusion into States rights in the High Court. The Government will have that little problem ahead of it. What is going to happen to the remnants of the current pool on 1 July? It is fortunate that the coalition has been able to retain the Wheat Board's export powers, or the whole industry would be in chaos. </PARA>
<PARA> The natural consequence of these Bills is that growers will have to accept world prices on the home market. I point out that the world prices are corrupt prices; they are not commercial prices. The United States subsidises its wheat by up to $80 a tonne; the European Community subsidises its wheat by up to $50 a tonne. Any excess that is produced because of the huge subsidies that are offered is then dumped on world markets. The anti-dumping provisions in this legislation are not strong enough to hold water and do not reassure our wheat growers about the prices they are likely to receive. </PARA>
<PARA> Our wheat industry is hurting. Our tonnage is down; our acreage is down; our markets are down; the prices are down; and, therefore, our income is down. Australian wheat growers receive no subsidies, unlike their counterparts in the United States, Europe and Canada. Previously, they received the best export price for their wheat, but under this legislation they will receive only the average export price. Those average export prices are low because of the subsidies of other nations. They are not commercial prices. </PARA>
<PARA> No other industry in Australia is being forced into such a position. There are 45,000 wheat farmers and they are going to be forced to accept corrupt world prices. As I said, they earn Australia about $2 billion a year in export income, yet they are being sacrificed by this so-called deregulation. We should start by looking at the sheltered waterfront, coastal shipping and railways, where costs have been escalating-costs which are passed on to our wheat growers, and all other exporters, for that matter. This legislation looks at the wrong area. The Grains Council has been imploring the Government to implement the recommendations of the McColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport. But after all those recommendations have been made, the Government turned around and reassured railway workers that their jobs would be protected, that no jobs would be lost. Under this legislation, the Government wants the Wheat Board, not the grain handling authorities, to deal with the railways. Why will the Government not deregulate the labour market in the transport and grain terminal system? That is provided for in one of our Opposition amendments. We would then not have the fiascos which I described before which occurred on the Mackay waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 88 of the legislation gives the Minister enormous powers over any product of the soil; thus it is a clear intrusion into States rights and the rights of growers of commodities. This clause will be the subject of Opposition amendment in the committee stage. Underwriting is to be funded by a levy on the industry. That is the correct move. As I said before, the industry should pay into its own fund to underwrite its own crop, but the funds raised by the levy are to be used to compensate for an inadequate government underwriting scheme. Although the Government has underwritten it for years, it did not have to put out a penny, except in one recent year. As I said, I am sure that is the basis for the harassing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's veto powers, many of which are unnecessary, are to be amended during the committee stage. I agree with that move. We want to allow the Wheat Board or growers to be compensated for losses that could be caused by bad ministerial decisions. If the Minister is going to interfere in the industry so much, why should he not be responsible for the decisions he is making? I understand the Government has given an undertaking that it will consider this matter, or it will give the Minister longer to deliberate before he makes a decision so that he does not make too many bad ones. We want to allow the Board to employ finance consultants free of legislative restraint. It is important because the type of people that are required to give economic advice on these massive flows of money need to be experts if they are going to keep the industry ship-shape. But the Government has resisted most of these amendments. We will move them in the committee stage and send the Bill back to the other House. We wonder whether it will accept the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Wheat Marketing Bill 1989 and associated Bills contain a number of major features including the removal of the Australian Wheat Board's acquisition and price setting power for wheat destined for domestic human consumption; the retention of the Board's export monopoly; and the reduced underwriting guarantee from the current 95 per cent to 90 per cent, then to 80 per cent, until eventually, in 1993, it will be phased out, after which time the industry is to carry the levy. The legislation includes the removal of an acceptable level of wheat grower Board membership-the lack of such an acceptable level has the industry very worried-and the virtual prohibition of the Wheat Board from intra-state trading and a threatened restriction of its pool on interstate trading. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also gives the Board the ability to negotiate better rail freight arrangements, with the use of the exports power. Clause 88 also provides the Federal Minister with the ability to override, or even terminate, State commodity marketing authorities, other than in wheat. This causes justifiable and considerable opposition. Wheat growing is a major rural industry. In the 1988-89 year the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics put the gross value of farm production of wheat at $2.37 billion, with exports worth $1.88 billion, which represents about $40,000 of exports per wheat grower this year and up to $70,000 per wheat grower just a few years ago. I support Senator Stone's second reading amendment. The amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA> At the end of motion, add ``, but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) deplores the Government's betrayal of the wheat farmers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) condemns the Government for weakening the position of the Australian Wheat Board as a strong trader in the domestic wheat markets; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) regrets the Government's failure to negotiate adequately with State Governments over their respective responsibilities, including in regard to State statutory marketing authorities''. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said, on previous occasions bad legislation had been introduced-legislation which the Government has had to amend in a major way, and which the Opposition has tried to amend in a major way. We have tried to turn such legislation into decent legislation. In every case, there has been maladministration of difficult Bills. Although the Bill that will be returned from the Senate is entirely different from the one that was introduced here, we will have to see what happens to it in the House of Representatives. As this stage, until I see what happens, I oppose the Bill and support Senator Stone's amendment. </PARA>

I do not mention that because I claim or believe that that gives me any special perspicacity or analytical skills in looking at wheat industry issues. The fact that one has actually been a wheat grower does not necessarily say anything about whether one really understands the underlying forces that are operating. But the fact that one has been for a long time associated in a very direct way with wheat farming and has lived in a country town, as I did for the first 40 years of my life, means that over that long period one gains an eclectic knowledge of farmers' attitudes, especially if one has taken some interest in industry politics and has a knowledge of the symbiotic relationship which existed for far too long between the agro-politicians of most farmers' organisations and the real politicians of the Country-cum-National Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Frankly, I do not know what the views of the majority of wheat growers on this legislation are. The views of the agro-politicians are very clear. They are opposed to it. That does not necessarily mean that they speak for the majority. Over the very long period that I was personally involved in agro-politics, I can remember many occasions when referendums that were strongly supported by the agro-politicians, who preferred to describe themselves as elected leaders of the industry, were defeated when put to the test. In any case, there are times when governments have a duty to do what is right or to do what governments believe to be right, whether the action has the approval of the particular group which is identifiably affected by it or, as some who may go further would say, whether it has the approval at the particular time of the majority of the electorate as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know what the current views of wheat growers are, except to say that I do not necessarily accept that the views put by the agro-politicians accurately represent the views of the majority of growers. However, there is no doubt that in the past wheat growers have been somewhat mindlessly attached to what Senator Sheil euphemistically calls orderly marketing and what these days most people would call industry regulation. That regulation has not been at all times-I would say on balance has not been-advantageous to the wheat growers or, more importantly, to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Having a long memory on this subject, I recall that in 1952, under the first wheat marketing legislation roughly comparable to the existing legislation-which was passed by a Labor government, as even Senator McGauran said-the price of wheat on the domestic market for either stock feed or human consumption was set by a formula which was determined by a silly concept known as the cost of production. I will not go too far into that; it is not really the point that I am making. Under that silly formula called the cost of production it was determined that wheat would be sold on the domestic market according to some price derived from that formula, which was at best suspect and, at worst, shonky. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of that formula wheat was being sold for about eight shillings-the currency of the day-a bushel. The value of wheat on the export market was in excess of #1 a bushel, but because the domestic price was regulated, and because the egg industry also was regulated, it had, among other things, this effect: wheat was sold through this orderly marketing system which Senator Sheil so admires to poultry farmers and stuffed down chooks' necks to produce eggs which were, at the margin, exported for an f.o.b. value lower than the value of the wheat that had been stuffed down their necks to produce the eggs in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> The wheat growers were very major losers as a result of that regulation. What is even more serious, of course, is that Australian society, the Australian economy as a whole, lost because of that regulation. It had an additional effect. The domestic market was of very much greater relative importance to the industry in the early 1950s. Domestic sales accounted for-it varied from season to season, of course-about half the total sales. Because sales on the domestic market were at ridiculously low prices-ridiculous compared to the real market value of the product-the average price of wheat was depressed to the point where acreage fell off very substantially and production dropped. Indeed, it dropped to the point where the Australian Wheat Board could no longer live up to its contractual obligations under the then International Wheat Agreement. That, of course, was a secondary round of damage on the Australian economy-that one of the most efficient industries over a very long period was operating at a level of production way below the optimum level of production because governments had decided to meddle in prices on the domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course it is true that we do not do anything nearly as stupid as that any more and, indeed, it is a long time since we have done anything in regard to the wheat industry nearly as stupid as that. We do continue to do things in respect of the egg industry which approximate that degree of stupidity. However, that is a difference of degree, rather than a difference of kind. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation allows the Australian Wheat Board to maintain its export monopoly. I suppose a real purist-indeed, Senator Stone at one time in his life might have argued this line-might even object to that. But most people, at least if they are in governments or in the national Parliament, make judgments principally about what is in the national interest. And it is a judgment. My judgment is that it is in the interest not only of the wheat industry but Australia as a whole that we maintain the export monopoly prices and export monopoly powers of the Australian Wheat Board. It varies from time to time, but over the long period there have been three major wheat exporters in the country and probably prices have been higher because of the degree of centralised control, at least in Australia and Canada, and to a lesser extent, probably, in the United States. As I said, that is a judgment. My judgment is that the national interest and the wheat industry interest are best served by maintaining the export monopoly powers of the Wheat Board. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation, however, frees up the domestic market. The present regulation of the domestic market, though by no means as obnoxious as it was in an earlier period, does impede efficient transactions in the sale and transport of wheat. I saw a letter only this week-it was written to Mr Kerin and I do not know whether anybody else has introduced it into the debate-from Arnotts, the biscuit manufacturers, applauding the Government for having the courage not only to initiate this step but then to ensure, through this legislation, that it actually became effective. Arnotts, operating principally in New South Wales, said that because the market was not free, it was unable to buy the low protein wheat-it has some other characteristics also-that is desirable for biscuit flour. It therefore imported from Western Australia, whose wheat normally has a lower protein level than that of other States. It dragged wheat all the way from Western Australia, I presume over the Eyre Highway, in heavy transports doing 130 kilometres an hour and making a major contribution to wrecking the highway as well, at an additional cost to the firm of some $650,000. Wheat was available in New South Wales and would have been bought in New South Wales, or maybe Victoria, had the company had the opportunity to make bilateral agreements with wheat growers to buy it. That is a small example of the sort of inefficiency which is a function of the regulation of the domestic market which led the Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport to conclude that there were economies of up to $10 a tonne through freeing up the domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say that I believe-and I am not sure whether it will ever be provable for certain one way or another-that the price of wheat to buyers will be lower because of this legislation. I do not, however, believe that the prices received by farmers will be lower, because there is the potential, and this legislation will ensure that that potential is realised, for so many economies between the farm gate and the final consumer which will more than make up that difference. </PARA>
<PARA> The old arrangements-apart from being an impediment to efficient transactions in wheat marketing, storage and handling, one example of which I have given-did of course unequivocally protect the monopoly power on the domestic market of the Australian Wheat Board and, as a flow-on from that and sometimes backed up by State legislation and regulation, protected the monopolies of the grain handling authorities and of the transport system. I guess to some extent it is an ideological question. Some people believe that such monopolies should be protected. Ironically, that view that such monopolies, backed by statute, should be protected comes from the party which more than any other in Australia has a habit of describing itself as the free enterprise party. That is the sort of Orwellian inversion of truth, I suppose, which is not unknown in politics in general and is all too common in Australian politics. Frankly, I do not care about the ideology of it. What I am interested in is the outcome. If the Australian Wheat Board is as efficient as its most vocal critics believe, or claim to believe it is, it has got nothing to worry about. The legislation provides, effectively, the working capital-which the Wheat Board might otherwise have had some problems in providing-for the Wheat Board to compete with private merchants or for bilateral sales on the domestic market with any domestic trader. It will be able to compete on a level playing field. If the Wheat Board is as efficient as its staunchest critics believe it to be, then it does not have to worry. If it is more efficient than the private traders, it follows almost inevitably that it will get--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would have thought that Senator Stone had compromised his intellectual integrity to the degree that he would not want to say another word. I have just read through his speech. The high priest of market economics, the Secretary to the Treasury for many years, came in here yesterday and delivered a speech-I will admit that it certainly was not the crudest speech that had been delivered on this legislation-which was a travesty of everything he claimed to believe in throughout his career in the Public Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have said many critical things about John Howard over a number of years. I do not resile from any of those statements, much less apologise for them; but I want to pay tribute to John Howard for the role that he played in this issue. He demonstrated that he is the only Liberal leader who has ever had the courage to stand up to the thugs of the National Party or its predecessor. The Premier of New South Wales certainly does not have that courage, and I am absolutely confident that the new Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives would not have it. It is a matter of some sadness, I suppose, that the wheat industry issue probably provided the catalyst which destroyed not only John Howard's leadership of the Liberal Party but also Mr Sinclair's leadership of the National Party-not that I have been an admirer of Mr Sinclair either, and not that I believe that he was anything more than dragged along behind Mr Howard on this issue. This was one issue on which Mr Howard was determined to do the right thing by Australia. He failed in a number of previous tests, but at least in his final test as Leader of the Opposition he did the right thing, and he should be recognised for that. Mr Sinclair was sucked in behind him and probably that was the reason that they both got rolled. I guess justice is frequently absent from politics. According to, I think, Senator Stone's speech, the Opposition is going to move 22 amendments to the legislation in this chamber. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Twenty-three, is it? According to the statement which Mr Peacock made last Tuesday, the previous policy of the Opposition-that is, that the amendments will be moved but the legislation will not in the end be blocked, whether it is amended or not-still stands. That is what Mr Peacock said on Tuesday. I just want to lodge one caveat. The opposition to this legislation in the National Party is, of course, intense. Some of it is probably genuine. Some of it, I think, is just purely opportunistic, or following the old Country-cum-National Party habit of telling your own cheer squad what it wants to hear, and to hell with whether it is true or not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That was the policy followed throughout the 1950s and the 1960s in another agricultural industry when the Country Party said, effectively, to dairy farmers, `All that stands between you and destitution is the butter subsidy, and we deliver you the butter subsidy, and if we are not there you are finished'. That had many effects. The first one, of course, was to ensure that the Australian dairy industry remained structurally inefficient in the sense that it concentrated on the production of a product, the market for which was dying, and ignored the opportunities for other dairy products-different end products-which were available. The second was that at that stage, around 1960, there were about 80,000 dairy farmers in Australia, which even at that stage was about twice as many as could get a decent living from the industry, even if the policies of the coalition Government of the day-dictated, of course, by the Country Party-had not been pushing the industry to produce the wrong end product. But, of course, the 80,000 dairy farmers were electoral cannon fodder for the Country Party, maintaining the quotas for rural seats and, in the main, voting for the Country Party. </PARA>
<PARA> If the then Country Party had had any decency or concern for the people it purported to represent it would have said to those dairy farmers, `There is no future for you in this industry at your present scale of operations. The best thing you can do is to sell your dairy farm. You will probably get enough for it to buy a house in a country town or even in a city'. Those were the days of full employment. There would have been no problems in getting jobs. Those farmers would have had a better lifestyle and the national economy would have benefited. But for two decades, the Country-cum-National Party encouraged those people to stay on their non-viable dairy farms, with a lifestyle vastly inferior to that which they could have had somewhere else, damaging the national economy, damaging the prospects not only of the dairy farmers themselves but, in a very sad number of cases, of their children. That is why I despise the Country-cum- National Party. It alone made a virtue of ignorance. Ignorance may have been exhibited by the other parties from time to time but the Country Party alone made a virtue of it. The Country Party also, whether consciously or otherwise-and I believe consciously in the case of the cynical people who really manipulated it-also betrayed the interests of the very people it purported to represent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party does not have John Howard as leader any more, and one of my fears about this legislation is that the National Party rednecks who recognise the weakness of the present Liberal Party leader will have another try-on over this issue and back away from the decision that was made a couple of weeks ago and reiterated by Mr Peacock on Tuesday. I hope I am wrong, but the next couple of weeks, I suppose, will show whether I am or not. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one amendment-I have not looked at them yet-which I believe the Opposition is going to move again in this place and on which I want to comment. I will comment on only that one. It proposes that the underwriting guarantee be lifted from the 90 per cent phasing down to 80 per cent over five years that is in the Bill to an underwriting guarantee of 95 per cent of the estimated market price for the crop in prospect. Whether that actually costs anything of course depends on the accuracy of the forecasts-the market price at the time. But had that provision been operative for the 1986-87 crop, it would have cost the taxpayers $300m, which is a very large amount of money, more I believe than anybody could justify the taxpayers providing to wheat growers, particularly of course, as is always the case in agriculture, as the great majority of the benefits accrue to a relatively small number of larger producers. And it is particularly hard to justify when, as would be the case, it would not affect the area planted or the way in which it was planted. </PARA>
<PARA> Some sort of a case-I do not find it terribly convincing myself-can be made for propping up or encouraging a higher level of production in industries which are in the economic sense extremely efficient, as the Australian wheat industry is, if the Government intervention or taxpayers' subsidy or guarantee or whatever one likes to call it has the effect of influencing the behaviour of farmers in the amount that they produce, or in this case the area that they plant, and the way in which they do it. That does not apply in this case. So even that justification or excuse, whatever its value may be in some other places, does not apply here, and therefore that is a particularly objectionable amendment. </PARA>

The figure I quoted for 1986-87 was the estimate for the current year. It was not tied to the three-year formula. If it was tied to a three-year formula it would cost the taxpayers about only $200m-and that has not been finalised yet.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bills now before the Senate contain several important changes in the structure of the marketing arrangements for the Australian wheat industry. By far the most important changes are those that remove the remaining restrictions on the operations of private traders in the marketing of wheat on the domestic market and allow greater competition in the transport and storage of grains. To an important degree these Bills represent another stage in the evolution of a more efficient and effective marketing system for wheat in this country. Some very significant statements have been made about the import of these changes. I believe that there has been quite a degree of misinformation and misunderstanding about the nature of the changes that are in fact now being proposed as distinct from what the Government originally had in mind. The changes now being proposed, as I say, represent an evolution along the way rather than a radical change. I say that because the Bills, in terms of marketing, are restricted to the marketing of domestic wheat for human consumption which approximates something like 10 per cent of the total Australian wheat crop. The Bills therefore do not apply to something like 90 per cent of the total crop.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, though, the fact remains that the Bills have caused very great concern throughout wide areas of the wheat growing industry. I have seen that at first hand myself. I have had the pleasure, I think would be the appropriate word, and certainly the very enlightening experience, of attending a meeting with Senator Panizza and some of our other colleagues--</PARA>

Perhaps I should have gone to see what it was that has produced these certain qualities in Senator Walsh that he has exhibited over so many years in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nevertheless, it would be absolutely foolish and wrong not to recognise that these legislative proposals before us have caused a great deal of heartburn throughout the wheat growing industry-a great deal of concern, as I say, based largely on misinformation-and also great tensions between the Liberal Party and the National Party. That is clear for everyone to see. We saw that within both parties as well. I think that the result is that that legislation is vastly different from the original proposals that this Government had in mind. There is no doubt that the original proposals that the Government had in mind did not have any inclusion at all for reform of a micro nature in the areas of transport, handling and distribution, nor did the original proposals be restricted to the marketing of domestic wheat. There is no doubt in my mind that certainly Mr Kerin, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy-I am not sure about Senator Walsh-who is responsible for the legislation, had in mind the deregulation of the export market as well, certainly, so far as wheat for other than human consumption was concerned. The fact is that we have now a Bill which is very different from the Bill originally proposed, very much more in line with the interests and requirements of the wheat industry. The wheat industry is an enormously important industry; wheat is Australia's most important crop and it is a major export commodity. It is an industry in which production fluctuates severely, but in the five years to 1985-86 wheat accounted for approximately 65 per cent of Australia's total grain production. Eighty to 85 per cent of our wheat is exported and we have heard the figures earlier in this debate about the value of exports. Again, they fluctuate markedly from year to year. In 1985-86 they totalled $3.2 billion; in 1986-87, $2.3 billion; and this year it is estimated that they will be of the order of a little short of $2 billion. But they are very significant figures in the context of the major problem that this country faces-that is, our external crisis; the simple fact that we cannot pay our way in the world due to a variety of factors, top of the list of which is--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Stone" NAMEID="LJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator Stone</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The most important one of which is the presence of the Labor Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The presence of the Labor Government, and the absolutely disastrous economic policies that it has been pursuing for the last five years. These are policies which have led us now to become the Argentina of this part of the world and have led us to having a debt to the rest of the world of something of the order of $110 billion-the third largest external debt, I think, of any nation in the world and a debt the implications of which for the future of our economy are very disastrous indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So the wheat industry is very important in that context and, to the extent that we can make the wheat industry more productive, more efficient and more profitable, these steps are all the more to be welcomed. I believe, although this does not directly touch, as I said, the export of wheat, that the changes proposed in this legislative package will have at least indirectly some beneficial results in that way, not least because there is every prospect that the proposals will encourage the increased export of value added products based on grains. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties, as I said, in their approach to this legislation have done a great deal to ensure that the disastrous disparity between costs to growers and the prices they receive does not continue. If that disparity that has developed over the last 10 years is to continue, then we are not going to have a wheat industry in this country in many years time. The prices for wheat that Australian growers now receive are not much different from what they were 10 years ago, but the costs to wheat growers of transporting, handling and loading wheat onto ships for export have increased threefold. Quite obviously we cannot go on having threefold increases in costs with no increase in price and expect to maintain a viable industry. Since 1984 the marketing of stockfeed wheat on the domestic market has been essentially deregulated. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not quite, but it has been essentially deregulated. The marketing of wheat for domestic human consumption or human food processing remains under the monopoly control of the Australian Wheat Board and this Bill, as we have said, proposes the deregulation of the marketing of this domestic wheat for human consumption and removes any remaining regulatory aspect of other domestically marketed wheat. I must say that I have a large degree of sympathy and agreement with the remarks that Senator Walsh made in his speech tonight about the role of monopolies and the inefficiencies that monopolies cause in virtually every environment of an economic nature. I agree with him, and I am glad to see that the Government has come to agree with the Opposition that the retention of the monopoly power of the Australian Wheat Board in relation to exports is a power that should be retained. But if we look at the general role of monopolies in the economy, there is no doubt that they do cause inefficiencies and they give the wrong market signals, and to that extent they are very inappropriate. As I said, the Wheat Board will maintain its total monopoly on the marketing of all wheat for export and all parties are now agreed on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation before the Senate is a far cry from the Government's initial thoughts. The Government originally had in mind the deregulation-or appeared to have in mind the deregulation-of certain aspects of the export market, and fierce opposition from the industry, with strong support from the Liberal and National parties, forced the Government to change its view on that. Also, as I intimated earlier, the Government originally of course had no intention whatsoever of linking these Bills with the micro-economic reform so necessary in respect of deregulation in the areas of transport, handling, storage and waterfront services. At least now the Government has been forced to take steps in these directions, although there is a very long way to go. The Government has been extraordinarily heavy on its rhetoric about micro-economic reform, but if we look at its actual performance record, that record is absolutely pathetic. It is essential that the Government be continually forced to move in these areas. It seems incapable of doing so, but if it is not forced in the way it has been in respect of this legislation then we are never going to get anywhere. The undertakings that the Liberal and National parties have wrung from the Government in these Bills is a very important start. It must be maintained and it must be built on. </PARA>
<PARA> Wheat marketing arrangements in Australia go back a long way. The comprehensive marketing arrangements that have become a feature of the Australian wheat industry were first brought together in the Wheat Industry Stabilisation Act way back in 1948. That Act embodied the four main features arising from concepts of price stabilisation and so-called orderly marketing, which have remained fundamental objectives of all subsequent legislation-namely, guaranteed prices, a home consumption price, the Australian Wheat Board, and the stabilisation arrangements. That Commonwealth legislation of course has been complemented to a certain degree by legislation which impacts on the wheat industry. In the first instance, of course, complementary State legislation exists to transfer certain powers to the Commonwealth, thereby giving effect to the Wheat Board's powers of pricing and acquisition. State governments are also very heavily involved in the transport, storage and handling of wheat and it is in this area that the Government is proposing to act in relation to the State governments. Whilst there is a real issue there relative to the question of State rights-an issue I have always felt very strongly about myself-there is an inherent conflict of interest between that issue on the one hand and the need for more efficiency in the transport, handling and distribution areas on the other. I think I could not do other than agree that the Government has acted correctly in respect of that in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation carries the potential for considerable benefit. It is a potential which still has to be proved to be realised. Of course a point that must be stressed-particularly to wheat growers because I do think there has been a misunderstanding here-is that the Wheat Board will still be the major buyer of wheat. Not only will it continue to be the monopoly buyer in relation to exports but, if it is efficient and if it operates in the way that we all believe that it should and will as an efficient marketer of wheat, it should also retain a pre-eminent position in the domestic market. There seems to be a presumption around in some quarters that the proposals in this legislation are going to somehow or other remove the Wheat Board from marketing in the domestic market. That, of course, is not so. If the Wheat Board is highly efficient, then it will continue to be a major and pre-eminent marketer in that domestic market as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The value of the proposals as I see them lies in other areas, including the real opportunities they create for entrepreneurial, innovative growers to be able to market their wheat and to produce forms of wheat which take the best advantage of the opportunities in the market. The 1984 legislation of course allowed the feed wheat market within Australia to be deregulated. That has allowed growers who wanted to take advantage of this to do so. Of those who have, many have done very well indeed. There are numerous examples of growers who believe that they are now receiving a higher price per tonne over their whole crop because they have been able to utilise the marketing skills and, to use the jargon of the day, the niche marketing that this deregulation provides an opportunity for. That is an important opportunity, but it is an important opportunity that growers will have to capitalise on. It is not going to come to them automatically but at least it does provide them with an incentive to look at different products and different marketing methods. It should also, as I mentioned earlier, produce better export opportunities for value added grain products. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, only through having some real competition on the domestic market will the inefficiencies in the storage, handling and transport that have been outlined in the McColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport-about which much has been said-have any real chance of being achieved. These will be real savings to growers if they can be achieved. The McColl Royal Commission estimated that savings in the order of $10 per tonne over the whole crop are to be made if the efficiencies that have potential for implementation are in fact implemented. Under the Bill now before the Senate-improvements in which the Liberal and National parties, along with the wheat industry, can take considerable credit for-the Wheat Board will clearly have the power to implement the changes to bring in those efficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has proposed a range of amendments to the Bill. They are amendments which I urge the Government to consider very carefully indeed. They are significant amendments relating to such important and fundamental matters as the underwriting guarantee. They deal with the structure of the Wheat Board, demanding a wheat grower chairman and five wheat growers out of the nominated eight people on the 11-person wheat board; the provision for more say by the Grains Council of Australia in the spending and management of grain grower money, which would be paid into the levy fund; and, very importantly, the deregulation of labour market practices which have proved to be so costly indeed not only to the wheat industry but to the whole of the Australian economy. It is in the prospect of freeing up the labour market and freeing up the other inefficiencies and highly regulated and controlled industries that associate with not only the wheat industry but rural industries generally-and, for that matter, a vast range of other industries in the economy, particularly the transport industry-that the real potential benefits of this legislation lie. </PARA>
<PARA> But the current move to deregulate part of a major statutory marketing board, which of course this move is, represents a significant and positive development. Wheat, of course, is the only industry subject to Commonwealth regulation which has a domestic marketing monopoly. Not only will farmers as a result of this change have more freedom to choose and the opportunity of higher returns but also the more competitive climate will encourage increased efficiency in a range of service industries. It should never need saying but let me reiterate that certainly the Liberal Party, along with its National Party coalition colleagues, is absolutely committed to the well-being of the rural sector of Australia. It is the lifeblood of our external account. It is a very important part of our total quality of life. Rural Australia is a part of Australia which has an importance in the overall attitudes and aspirations of this nation that well outweighs its population. There are the attitudes and the values, I think, that stem from the rural sector, and they are attitudes and values which have served this nation so well throughout our history. They have been the backbone of the sort of nation that we have traditionally been. We will lose those at our peril if we wish to see an Australia of the future that builds on the best values and traditions of the past. This is a very important part of that process. The wheat industry has been and I hope will continue to be a fundamental part of that sector and I would expect that the legislation before the Senate, provided that there are adequate amendments to it, will provide an important further step along the way to improving the efficiency and the well-being of the wheat industry and therefore the rural sector of this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the responsible and measured stance on this legislation that the Liberal-National coalition has adopted. As a representative of a major wheat producing State I firmly believe that the coalition approach to deregulation of wheat marketing offers the best long term protection of the interests of wheat growers. I think it is a particularly important stand that we have taken given the fact that many wheat growers have been concerned about deregulation while many other wheat growers in fact have been firmly behind the proposal. With 4.8 million tonnes harvested by the middle of January, my State of Western Australia was 2 million tonnes ahead of the next best State, New South Wales. As a Liberal, I am convinced that we cannot create incentive, increase national wealth and maximise individual reward for enterprise and effort through industry regulation. Australians cannot enjoy the benefit of a supposedly free society without total economic freedom. At the very least, regulated industries and marketing systems must show cause why they benefit producers and why deregulation will supposedly do harm. The coalition does not believe in a dogmatic and gung ho approach to deregulation in all matters, nor do we believe in taking precipitate action in any one industry while other producers and providers of labour and other services remain in cosy monopolies. This is why we are supporting these Bills under firm conditions and why we are moving to amend them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not good enough, however, to stand here and say that because there are faults in what is essentially deregulatory legislation, it must be rejected wholesale. It is not good enough to say that because the Hawke Labor Government is putting them forward they must therefore be fundamentally bad. Heaven only knows we see enough legislation that qualifies for that. There are other pieces of legislation that we see from week to week and we do not oppose them just on that principle. The Liberal philosophy is opposed to imposed monopolies-to monopoly power that derives from the exercise of coercion or legislative restriction. While the greatest impediment to both human freedom and economic progress in Australia remains the exercise of monopoly union power, the coalition cannot blindly defend monopolies that may be more acceptable to many of the conservative voters. Australians, I think, are already cynical enough about their politicians and they have good reason to be cynical about knee-jerk opposition to Bills and about those who preach macro-economic deregulation, yet turn away from serious micro-economic reforms. Unless we consider this legislation on its merits, as we have done, and at great length, we will not have the right to expect that essential reforms in the industrial area will be accepted by ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is very important to note at the same time that while many of the wheat growers throughout Australia may in fact be opposed to the principle of this legislation, on other issues they are very much in favour of deregulation. What many of us find difficult to comprehend and explain to them is how those very same people can be in favour of deregulation on the one hand but only as long as it does not affect them. I think that is why we have taken a very measured approach, a very considered approach, to dealing with this Bill and what is best not just for the industry but for the individual wheat growers themselves. Unless we consider this legislation on its merits-as I say, we have done that-we are going to find difficulty right across the board in many other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Having stated this broad principle, I remain conscious that the wheat growers that I represent do not want the overturning of the basic total wheat marketing structure. This reflects a degree of practical reality, as export deregulation would be both unrealistic and irresponsible. For this very reason, this Bill reflects the insistence of the Liberal and National parties that the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) retain its monopoly powers over export wheat. It is a matter of reflecting not just the wishes of wheat growers but also a sensible recognition that the international wheat market is corrupted by the subsidising policies for export wheat of the European Economic Community and the free-enterprise United States. Nonetheless, the fact that the United States of America chooses to subvert free market principles is not an excuse for maintaining full regulation within Australia. It is ironic for the President of the Grains Council of Australia last June to have urged the United States wheat growers to let the free market forces of supply and demand determine the price of wheat, and then oppose all domestic wheat deregulation. The evidence simply does not support the contention that regulation has been an unqualified benefit to wheat producers. Many wheat producers throughout this country agree with that statement. </PARA>
<PARA> Deregulation of transport, handling and storage would, according to the expert findings of the McColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport, create a saving of $7 per tonne for grain producers in Western Australia. Some 40 per cent of the value of export wheat is consumed by these monopolies, forcing growers to pay 30 per cent more than they could expect in a competitive market. An Industries Assistance Commission report last year noted that of each dollar received by the Australian Wheat Board in 1986-87, 20c was consumed in transport, handling and storage. Marketing cost 10c and, of the 70c returned to the grower, 46c was consumed in farm inputs and other costs. Expressed in 1988 dollars, a tonne of wheat in the 1930s, with a gross price to farmers of $234, would pay more than twice average weekly earnings. In 1988, a tonne of wheat bringing $148 pays less than half one week's average wage of $481. So the figures really do speak for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Specifically, it has been calculated that in the 30 years between 1948-49 and 1978-79, the cost of wheat regulation, especially domestic regulation, was $1,122m. Deducting government assistance, the cost to growers, expressed in 1979 dollars, was just below $1 billion. I think in anyone's language that is a very big price to pay for regulation. I do not quote these figures to argue against the principle of a strong Australian Wheat Board. I do however consider that they underline the merits of greater domestic deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Bureau of Agricultural Economics at the beginning of this year predicted production levels of 13.5 million tonnes of wheat for the next five years, a static figure as farmers turn to livestock and more profitable crops. Again, it is clear that our wheatgrowers do not inhabit the best of all possible economic worlds, and it therefore is proper for their Senate representatives to consider possible and proper improvements. It must be emphasised that this legislation removes AWB monopoly control only-and I emphasise the word `only'-over domestic wheat sales that account for less than 20 per cent of total wheat grown in Australia. Of course, of this, more than a quarter of the stockfeed wheat is already deregulated. In fact, many would say that 90 per cent of stockfeed at the moment is already sold privately. </PARA>
<PARA> Domestic deregulation should not be seen as a sudden innovation, but as the continuation of a process already under way. Figures that were supplied to me recently in fact indicated that at least 11 per cent of human consumption wheat was already being sold privately. Of course, there were great benefits to the producers themselves, inasmuch as the cheque went straight to the producer instead of going through its natural course as has happened over the years. </PARA>
<PARA> The increased use of the permit system has raised the incomes of many producers by up to $17 per tonne. It has also led to a warning by Mr Clinton Condon, Chairman of the AWB, last July that the AWB was not able to compete properly on the domestic market. It is the view of the coalition, however, that the AWB should act in full competition with other traders on the domestic market. Support for deregulation, therefore, cannot be said actually to subvert the AWB. </PARA>
<PARA> Arguments that a loss to the pool of $7 per tonne under domestic regulation will occur have been produced by comparing the best asking prices on a single day with seasonal averages. A more sober assessment of a loss of $1.50 per tonne would be offset against other savings, including $2 gained in direct sales and savings through deregulation of transport and handling. </PARA>
<PARA> In the final analysis, it is probably well to remember that prices are not the same as returns to the grower. I think that is something that very much needs to be remembered. Moreover, it is inequitable that producers of specialised varieties of wheat should continue to meet the cost of pooling without benefiting from the service. Producers of fine quality wool would not appreciate a forced pooling with a lower quality product. I think that we need to draw the distinction between those two areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to the introduction of this legislation, the coalition laid down a firm set of principles that I support, because they combine cautious and responsible deregulation with safeguards for the wheat grower. We have not wavered in our insistence that the export powers of the AWB be retained, and this has forced the Government to drop plans for weakening it. We are committed to deregulation in the complementary areas of transport, handling, storage and waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate needs to be reminded that it is the coalition that has forced the Government to accept our position on these important issues because without one, we cannot effectively have the other, and we have been most insistent that those areas be very much a part of this legislation. They were not in the original Bill, they were not originally part of the legislation and we consider them to be most important. We believe that as a matter of justice, and to ensure the ability of the AWB to provide solid cash advances and to borrow necessary funds, underwriting should be guaranteed at 95 per cent and no less. We will continue to fight for this if necessary, even if unsuccessful with our amendments, which I understand the Australian Democrats may in fact now support. We are committed to maintain the position of the AWB as a strong domestic trader. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has already secured the acceptance of amendments that protect the marketing powers of State statutory bodies dealing with grain. Unless so amended, clause 88 could have put an end to these boards in a sweeping and most arbitrary manner. In the Senate, we are seeking, as I say, a 95 per cent underwriting guarantee, and the assurance that of eight nominated members of the 11 Australian Wheat Board members, five will be wheat growers, as will the Board Chairman. I think that is a very very sensible move. We are also moving to allow greater input from the Grains Council of Australia as to the spending and management of money from grain growers paid into a levy fund. </PARA>
<PARA> The major principles that I have outlined here tonight are not some kind of temporary response to a particular situation. They form the coalition policy on wheat as an integral part of our primary industry policy. So one has certainly not been a knee-jerk reaction to the other, and any attempt to paint it as such is certainly fallacious. What is certain is that a Liberal-National government will ensure that the wheat industry alone does not experience deregulation. Reforms in the areas of shipping and waterfront will be a major priority. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has a coastal shipping service where, according to the Industries Assistance Commission, an estimated $860m in cost savings will have an ultimate bearing on the rural sector. The coalition will strive to make it internationally competitive. That is certainly something that the Government has failed to do. It tends to close its eyes to anything that happens on the waterfront. To this end, over five years we will phase out absolute prohibition of foreign competition in coastal shipping through a more lenient granting of single voyage permits. We will deregulate in a careful and measured manner, with a 10 per cent to 15 per cent tariff initially to enable Australian shippers to adjust. </PARA>
<PARA> On the waterfront, a coalition government will implement the reforms that the latest report has shown to be most essential. Foremost of these is the promotion of enterprise-based employment, with employers and employees free to negotiate their own wages and conditions. Industry-based employment, on the waterfront and in shipping is a root cause of inefficiency, uncompetitiveness and restrictive practices. Australian competitiveness, and rural export industries, cannot suffer while maritime and waterfront unions are exempt from the normal disciplines faced by other Australian workers in the labour markets and while their monopoly power is upheld. Unions simply cannot continue to determine who works where and for whom. The list of outrageous behaviour on the waterfront just goes on. These practices are affecting our primary producers and thereby affecting all Australians. A coalition simply will not allow that to continue. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply mention these related areas to wheat marketing to make it clear that a future coalition government would be of the opinion that regulation must proceed on a very broad front, not the narrow front that is being considered by the Government. Australians who believe in free enterprise, and who are inclined to praise the Labor Government for some minor deregulatory initiatives, ought to realise that there are definite limits to what can be expected from a Party beholden to the Australian Council of Trade Unions and answerable to all the other unions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party will not take on the Seamen's Union of Australia or the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, and therefore we will not have the necessary deregulation and efficiency in this vital section of the export chain. I might add that I believe that only a coalition government will have the courage to act in this area and that is just simply a matter of fact. The Australian Labor Party has failed the test of commitment to a genuine free market because it will not apply free market disciplines to its own supporters. After the passage of these Bills, this charge will not be able to be levelled against the Federal coalition. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, we have the born-again regulators, the Australian Democrats, jumping on every discredited economic bandwagon in the quest for any votes they can get. In fact it is not often that I might say that Senator Maguire speaks some sense, but I suppose in the debate this afternoon he certainly exposed some facts about the motives behind the Australian Democrats and their leader Senator Haines in her publicity seeking attempt to gain a lower House seat. I think their position in many of these debates is simply an extension of that-they will do anything and make any decision, according to which way the wind is blowing and if in fact there is a vote in it. So anxious are they to shackle business enterprise that I guess it is fair to describe them as political bondage freaks. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that throughout this debate the coalition has upheld a sensible and proper mix of deregulation and safeguards necessary for Australian wheat growers. Should our amendments be successful, the end result should be an Australian Wheat Board giving the best possible service and end returns to growers. Just as financial deregulation has strengthened the major Australian banks to the national good, so should the AWB emerge the stronger for this limited competition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The package of six wheat Bills which we are debating today were amended numerous times in the other place. I am rising now to speak on this debate in support of Senator Lewis and also in support of Senator Stone, the Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate, whose amendment states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) deplores the Government's betrayal of the wheat farmers of Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) condemns the Government for weakening the position of the Australian Wheat Board as a strong trader in the domestic wheat market; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) regrets the Government's failure to negotiate adequately with State Governments over their respective responsibilities, including in regard to State statutory marketing authorities''. </PARA>
<PARA>The three points in Senator Stone's amendment have been clearly brought to the fore in this debate. The main feature of the legislation is to remove the Australian Wheat Board's acquisition and price setting power for the wheat for domestic human consumption. The Bills retain the Board's export monopoly, reduce the underwriting guarantee from the current 95 per cent to 90 per cent next season and then phase it down to 80 per cent in 1993, after which this part of the legislation will cease to exist any more-it will be subject to a sunset provision. The major Bill-the Wheat Marketing Bill 1989-gives the Board the ability to negotiate better rail freight arrangements with the use of the export power. Clause 88 provides the Federal Minister with the ability to override or even terminate State commodity marketing authorities other than wheat. This, of course, was the subject of considerable opposition by the States and has now been amended due to the good work of Mr Bruce Lloyd in the other House. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot pretend to like this legislation and I do not; neither do the overwhelming majority of wheat growers in Australia. Before I go any further, I might just say that the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) spoke earlier in the debate and quoted some figures. The figures that Senator Walsh gave in respect of underwriting are completely wrong. They are misleading to the Parliament. I now seek leave to table the figures that I have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The actual payout for 1986-87 on the three-year moving average formula of the 1984 Act was $140m in nominal terms. Therefore, how can the Minister say that there has been an increase in liability of some $300m in the subject year? The Minister told us that he was a fellow wheat grower; that he was one of the few people in this place to grow wheat. I might add that I grow wheat. I know that Senator Stone grew wheat. Senator Panizza grows wheat. Senator McGauran, who has a lot of other enterprises, also grows wheat. The Minister said that $300m would be necessary. In fact in 1986-87, the year he talks about, there would have been no payout whatsoever up to 99.8 per cent of the guaranteed minimum price. I would imagine that the Minister will tell us more about that in the committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation is flawed; it is inappropriate in that it takes no account of present marketing arrangements; and I believe it is a political stunt. The wheat growers of Australia are the jokers and are being used as playing chips in this big battle by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and other people in the Australian Labor Party. Little has been said about the role of the Minister and I notice that his advisers are in the chamber tonight. I hope that Senator Walsh tells the Minister what he might hear in this debate. If he does, we might get a heap more amendments from the Minister before it is all finished. I notice that an amendment brought in by the Government was circulated here a little while ago. Maybe the Government is starting to see the light that the legislation is not well drafted in the first instance. </PARA>
<PARA> The current arrangements were due to expire in June 1989. This date has been known for five years. In the meantime, the Government conducted an Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) hearing into the industry. The McColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport has presented a report. Those bodies made certain recommendations as to where the industry ought to be heading. McColl actually said, and I think this is very pertinent, that the identified savings are achievable with the existing marketing arrangements. So why is the Minister trying to change the whole thing and turn it on its head? Last July Mr Kerin flagged his intentions on the legislation to State Ministers for agriculture at a meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council. But they were not along the lines suggested by McColl or the IAC. In fact, the IAC, on page 6 of its report, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Difficulties may also arise in negotiations that would have to take place between the Commonwealth and State governments. </PARA>
<PARA>What has he done about it? He has not put that in the legislation or talked to the State governments about it. He has just gone ahead in his own bulldozing way with the wheat growers of Australia, as I said, being used as chips in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The States asked for more details when this legislation first was mooted and said that they would not pass complementary legislation without changes being made to the Bill. They asked again in February of this year for more details and more changes. The information and changes have not been forthcoming. As early as 12 July last year the New South Wales agricultural Minister, Ian Armstrong, rejected the Kerin wheat plan. A press release stated:</PARA>
<PARA>New South Wales Minister for Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Ian Armstrong, today rejected the Kerin proposals for the restructuring of the wheat marketing arrangements. Mr Kerin would do well to listen to the industry as a whole on the matter and act according to what is best for the industry, and not the Federal Government bureaucracy. To open the doors to the commercial wolves would mean that producers' returns will once again return to negative figures. It is time for cool heads in the management of the Australian wheat crop, Mr Armstrong said. </PARA>
<PARA>And, of course, what has happened since then? Mr Armstrong repeated his objections as recently as February of this year in a press release which stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The New South Wales Government has expressed disappointment that full advice on Commonwealth wheat marketing legislation will now be delayed until mid-March, State Agriculture and Rural Affairs Minister Armstrong said. </PARA>
<PARA> He slammed the delay which he said only fuelled more uncertainty within the industry and jeopardised forward planning. </PARA>
<PARA>Just ask a few of the wheat growers. The press release continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Armstrong and Queensland Primary Industries Minister, Mr Harper, both rejected outright today any complementary State legislation which could water down the export domestic marketing powers of the Australian Wheat Board. </PARA>
<PARA>The press release went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It is clear that if the Federal Minister continues on his present path, the domestic wheat market could end up under legal challenge. </PARA>
<PARA>What has happened about that? Has the Minister really made an outright effort to go to the States and talk this over with them? I should say he has not. </PARA>
<PARA> We sit here in the chamber at the moment debating this legislation on the day the New South Wales Parliament is due to rise for the winter break; the South Australian Parliament has already got up. There is no complementary legislation in place in any State. Victoria is talking about it today; there can be nothing done in South Australia because the South Australian Parliament has already risen; and the New South Wales Government has Buckley's chance of enacting legislation before it rises. The effect of this is going to weaken the capacity of the Australian Wheat Board to operate on a domestic market in a competitive manner. To exclude the Wheat Board-and Senator Stone made this very clear in his speech yesterday-from intrastate trading will make it ineffective and leave it open to the major grain traders. It will not be able, under the current legislation, to trade intrastate in a way which will make it competitive on the market. Senator Stone mentioned that there is a misleading paragraph in the second reading speech presented by the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook). That paragraph reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The essential point is that compulsory acquisition is no longer needed for efficient marketing effort. I am confident that the AWB will remain the dominant force in a deregulated domestic market given its expertise and the additional commercial powers which I outlined earlier. </PARA>
<PARA>Tell me, Mr Acting Deputy President, if you can, how it can remain competitive, how it can remain as the dominant force on a domestic market, if it has had its legs cut out from underneath it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister cannot tell us. I know that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, would like to tell me, but you cannot. I know that the Minister's adviser has now left the chamber. Obviously he has gone to find out how it is going to be done. Let us hope he can do it because if he cannot we will be in a lot of trouble. Senator Cook might help. He is into resources; maybe he might be able to help. He will say, `Look, it's not my fault. This is the fault of these State governments'. I say that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy stands condemned for trying to foist this on the Australian wheat growers without doing his homework and making sure that the whole lot is going to work properly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Senator Panizza is a wheat grower; he knows a bit about it. The Minister is engaging in political stunts. This legislation is flawed in a number of ways. In passing, I note that even in the passage of this legislation through the House of Representatives the Government found it necessary to tack on 45 amendments-this has been mentioned a few times-to the original draft. After all the time it has had to produce this legislation, the Government is still amending it a few weeks before it must be in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now turn to some of the principles enshrined in the legislation. The first is the issue of deregulation. I have often said that I think the wheat market is deregulated now. We have direct delivery to the Australian Wheat Board. We have the grower to buyer method or grower to miller method, whereby we can negotiate a premium for handling and storage and transport costs. Last year we sold our wheat direct to the millers. We sold some to the Wheat Board at the local silo. We had some feed wheat; so we sold that wheat to a feed lot. We had other options. We could have stored some with the grain handling authority for payment at a later date. Also, we could store some on our own farm. So there is quite a bit of deregulation in that respect. I say that the market is pretty well deregulated already. So why do we have to take away the little bit of stability that the industry had by completely deregulating? I believe that deregulation is going to expose the industry to the corrupt world stage. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen in the last week the United States' attitude to freeing up of trade, particularly in respect of grains. The Americans can see no danger to Australia of their protectionist policies. They applaud our moves to open up world trade and at the same time they subsidise sales of wheat to Russia. There are rumours of similar subsidised deals going to China. Australian wheat growers are already the lowest paid in the Western world. They are that way because they receive no hand outs and no government subsidies. They are not complaining about that, but I believe it is unfair. They sell their wheat on the world market against subsidised grain from the European Community and the United States. In 1985-86 we had nearly 20 per cent of the world wheat trade and flour trade. Today that has dropped to somewhere around 11.3 per cent. The European Community and the United States shares have jumped during that same period because of export subsidies. How can Australia compete with that? This legislation, I believe, will penalise them even further. </PARA>
<PARA> At present the price of wheat sold to Australian millers is set by the best export price paid based on the need for quality wheat and the continuity of supply. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Panizza" NAMEID="JI4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RD4">Senator BROWNHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. But under this legislation, this floor price, which is presently around about $225 per tonne, would be removed and the effective floor price would become the average export price which stands at around about $190 a tonne. After allowing for quality differences, the main reason for taking the best export price is that a high percentage of Australia's wheat is sold on the Egyptian, Chinese and Russian markets which meet the price of United States wheat subsidised under that country's export enhancement program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This wheat industry, with which the Minister is playing Russian roulette, is in jeopardy. What is the Government doing about it? At a time of high interest rates, rising inflation and the removal of agricultural machinery bounties, the Government says to the growers, `Take less for your grain; you'll be better off with this arrangement'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government claims that what growers lose on the difference between the best export and average-around about $10 a tonne-they will more than make up with the savings in grain handling, storage and transportation as a result of inefficiencies being removed from that system. They are very nice sounding words, but I believe that actions speak louder than words. We have already seen prices falling in other grain crops. I know that sorghum prices at the moment have fallen from something around $140 a tonne to $125 a tonne. The weaker seller syndrome is starting to set in in anticipation of a deregulated domestic market. We cannot allow the market to become further weakened because, as farmers, we depend too much on it to remain solvent. </PARA>
<PARA> Deregulation of the industry must be accompanied by reform in other areas such as the waterfront, restrictive work practices and transport. Senator McKiernan talked a little about this matter earlier in the debate. Senator Cook knows a lot about industrial relations. But I want to see the whites of the eyes of the Government senators who are sitting on the other side of the chamber. I want them to tell me what they are going to do about a few of their little tricks instead of just picking on the wheat growers and saying, `You deregulate. We want you to deregulate. We'll do these things'. All we get is a few smart words. Nothing has happened at all up until this particular stage. As Senator Knowles has mentioned, we have to free-up such things as coastal shipping, and rail monopolies and the closed-shop network must end. The Government says it will do these things. I ask you, Madam Acting Deputy President: When? How can we believe a government which says it will deregulate transport and the waterfront when it cannot control the unions?</PARA>
<PARA> Where are all those agreements which Mr Hawke and Mr Kerin say they will have with the unions? Only last week in Victoria the Australian Railways Union was drumming up opposition to the legislation because it claimed that 1,050 rail jobs in Victoria alone would be lost. If that is the case, there must be a lot of feather bedding going on-and I think we would all agree on that. The fact is that for years the railways have had a monopoly on the transport of grain and they are not going to give it up very easily. It will be interesting to see whether the Government capitulates. I believe it will. There have already been suggestions that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has promised the Victorian unions some special sort of deal. That suggestion has been widely touted around the place. The honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby) has said as much in the Bendigo Advertiser. In that newspaper he assured the V/Line employees that their jobs were safe. </PARA>

This can be shown from the Bill that we are talking about. The Government cannot deny any of the things that I have just mentioned.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second issue, of course, is the overriding of States' rights. This issue is very important. Senator Stone has been the person who has made the most-I was going to say `noise', but I will not say `noise' because he speaks in a very nice, modulated voice-telling points in this part of the debate. The Government would have allowed this legislation to trammel the State functions in the areas of transport, storage and handling. That is one of the ineptitudes of this Bill. Are we to be grateful to the Government for accepting the Opposition's amendments? I ask that question because I am a bit concerned about this matter. As far as I can see, the Government would have allowed this situation to proceed if it had not been brought to its attention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Scrutiny of Bills Committee, of which I happen to be a member and of which Senator Cooney is the Chairman-he does a good job on it-is also very concerned about different clauses of the Bill. For example, let me mention clauses 7 (5), 88 (2) and 88 (10). The Committee said that there are inappropriate delegations of parliamentary power. Effectively, those clauses mean that people involved in the industry, and governed by State and Territory laws, may be adversely affected if that enactment were rendered ineffective by the making of a regulation. That is something I think the Government should seriously look at. </PARA>
<PARA> A total of 37 amendments were moved by the Opposition in the other place; some of less importance, others of greater importance. We have proposed 22 amendments, plus one, which is the amendment that Senator Stone will move and which I mentioned earlier in this chamber. To me there are several that are basic to the acceptance of this legislation. The first is the underwriting. I have already tabled a document showing what the underwriting means. The Opposition has made it clear that it wants 95 per cent underwriting. The Government has offered, so we are told, 90 per cent reducing to 80 per cent over three years. This has the effect of leaving the Wheat Board weakened. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of the composition of the Board has also not been addressed satisfactorily. The Opposition has insisted that the chairman be a wheat grower and this amendment has been moved in the other place. It is fundamentally the right of the industry, surely, to have its own chairman of its own industry. The same condition applies for a majority of growers on the Board and again that is not happening. Again the Opposition has moved to correct that anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation has caused pain to a great many people and not just to the wheat grower. It has involved many hours, days and weeks of discussions. I know that Senator Stone mentioned an Opposition committee I was on. I was very happy to see in a press release that has been put out by the Grains Council of Australia those terms that we set down with the Opposition. I take exception to what Senator Walsh has said about the agro-politicians and the people who represent the industries. He does not say the same thing about the Australian Council of Trade Unions, mind you, does he? But if we have a group of people representing an industry, the Minister is up in arms and says, `They are just those agro-politicians and we do not take any notice of them.'</PARA>
<PARA> I think that everyone has put a lot of work into this Bill and, as I said, particularly the Grains Council of Australia. It is disgusting that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has left this legislation so late and ignored the request of the State Ministers, some even from his own Party, so that they are unable to pass complementary legislation in the States although, belatedly, it looks as if Victoria might be doing something about it. What so many commentators and five-minute experts on wheat have forgotten throughout this entire debate is that the wheat industry is not a supply and demand situation. The wheat industry has never been a supply and demand situation. It has always been ruled by manipulation and speculation. Those are not my remarks; they are the remarks that a gentleman called Don Barwick made many years ago when he was on the Wheat Board. He said, `The major grain traders are manipulators and speculators'. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is going to put at risk those 40-odd thousand wheat growers of Australia by throwing them to the wolves, the manipulators and the speculators, the big grain traders. I have a little bit of knowledge of this because I have been a grain grower now for some 35 years. </PARA>

The grower who only grows wheat-the sole wheat grower-is going to be left cruelly exposed by a government that does not give a fig for his future. One other point I of course meant to mention was the greater control of the industry fund, that $100m fund that the Minister is setting up. The growers must have complete control of that. The other thing I would like to mention in finishing is that it is not often that one gets Kenneth Davidson writing something good about the National Party. I am going to get a plug in for the National Party. He says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is not often your correspondent thinks the National Party has a case but it is not difficult to see that the interests of the mass of wheat growers are not being served by the Hawke Government's decision to deregulate domestic wheat sales. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Richardson is always trying to say, `Let us lock things up, do not let us have production going on in Australia, do not let us have export income being produced'. Now one of his own colleagues here is putting this industry in jeopardy. I get back to Kenneth Davidson. At the end of his article he said that unless the bulk of Australia's wheat growers have untapped attributes in marketing their own wheat, the real beneficiaries of the deregulatory proposal are the middleman and the end user. That is what worries me about this legislation. People have set up a Wheat Board so that they can have a united way of selling their grain. In other words, instead of being multiple sellers to single buyers, they have set it up so they can become multiple sellers to only a few buyers and they can protect themselves. This Government is callously taking that protection away from the wheat growers of Australia and throwing them to the wolves, the international grain traders. </PARA>

This Government has an ideal pristine opportunity to do something about the distortions in the economy and it does nothing except talk about deregulating the domestic wheat market in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my view-in terms of the economy this measure is not a major step, but certainly for many wheat growers it is an emotional disruption and for the old people in the industry something of a trauma-this is a misconceived notion but one that I can understand. For those growers still alive who in the 1920s and early 1930s received advances from private buyers but found at the end of the year they had to hand back not only all their wheat but half the advance, there is naturally that memory, that recollection of events. But of course we live in a different day and age. In those days we could not pick up the telephone and ring up the commodity buyers. In that day and age we did not have instant access to world prices or domestic prices. So I understand and, while not empathising, certainly sympathise with those who have anxieties and concerns about this legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us talk about the export market. Let us talk about where the world wheat industry is going. Let us look over the horizon at areas that ought to be of major concern, that are fundamental and intrinsic to the future of the industry in Australia. It is not the domestic wheat market, Senator Richardson, with respect; it is our capacity to sell into overseas markets. Let us look at China for instance. In 1966 China was producing about 26 million tonnes of wheat. It is now producing 88 million tonnes of wheat. I think, if my memory serves me correctly-and I am sure the experts in this chamber will tell me if I am wrong-that China is now the largest producer of wheat in the world. By the year 2000 China will be a net exporter of food. I was in Egypt two years ago and there was a Chinese delegation seeking to sell wheat into one of our traditional and major markets. It was not without consequence for me to note at that stage that our embassy did not have one single person even indirectly related to the Wheat Board. Yet we think that we are keeping our finger on the pulse of our overseas markets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at India. In 1965-66 India was producing about 12 million tonnes of wheat. In 1986-87 it was producing about 46 million tonnes. That is the last figure that I have access to. Now it is the fifth largest wheat producer in the world. It was a significant market for Australia. Twenty years ago, 80 per cent of India's wheat production was lost in storage, for reasons that would be obvious to anyone who knows anything about the subject. The situation is now quite the reverse. It now loses 20 per cent of its wheat because of inefficiencies and, more particularly, inadequacies in the storage of its grain. It is not without significance to note that from time to time in the right seasons India is itself a significant exporter of wheat. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no doubt that the Australian Wheat Board is keeping its eye on these things but, clearly, some of our traditional markets will not exist in years to come. It is my view that if South America, for instance, ever gets its act together and some of that infertile country is provided with adequate and sophisticated trace elements, that country's capacity to produce wheat will be quite different from its present capacity. Perhaps we ought to be looking at new wheat markets in the Middle East and Asia, and I will come to the Soviet Union in due course. In the early 1970s those markets took up something like 50 per cent of our total exports and now they take up 80 per cent. I repeat that we in Australia should be concerning ourselves with fundamental micro-economic reforms with our overseas markets. </PARA>
<PARA> While we make much of the problem in terms of our blusterings and our protestations about the United States export enhancement program (EEP) and the common agricultural policy (CAP) arrangements of the European Communities (EC), it is my judgment that we cannot expect any significant relief in the next decade. Perhaps there are people more informed than I. Perhaps others are more optimistic than I am, but it would be absurd for us to think that representations from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) or Mr Kerin, or by delegations from Australia to the United States or the European Communities, are going to change their fundamental attitude in respect of the subsidisation of wheat in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that we all understand the fundamental political base that is made up by the grain growers in the European Communities, for instance. If we imagine that a French Government, or any European government, is going to cut the heart out of its political body by immediately abolishing, for the well-being of world trade, its present subsidy levels, we are kidding ourselves. If we imagine that President Bush or any other President of the United States is going to have the courage and the commitment to tell the mid-west farmers overnight, unilaterally, that as long as the European Communities has its program they are no longer economic, that the subsidy has gone, that the taxpayers' money that has kept them alive for the years it has will be taken away from them and that he is prepared to carry the political consequences, we are fooling ourselves.

But if we imagine that there are going to be fundamental changes to those programs simply because of the squeaking of our wheel we are making a grave mistake. We ought to be, for our part, improving the efficiencies of our own production. But that seems to come very far down the track in this Government's order of priorities. It is more interested in putting up mischievous legislation to see whether it can be divisive and cause difficulties for the coalition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia's world share of wheat exports has declined by 50 per cent since the commencement of the export enhancement program. If I remember correctly it is down from 19.5 per cent to 11.3 per cent. Australia has seen a reduction by 31 per cent in areas sown since the year 1983-84. In that period 12.9 million hectares, and in 1987-88 8.86 million hectares, of wheat were sown. We ought to note that the gross value of production since 1983-84 is down by $1 billion in nominal terms, reflecting a massive drop in exports from 15 million tonnes to between nine million and 9.5 million tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult to determine the exact cost to Australia of the United States export enhancement program because the program is in competition with the subsidies provided by the EC in its program. Any subsidies that provide for production well above the level of market demand are bound to have the effect of driving prices down in terms of immediate sales or of creating storage levels which overhang the market, it also guaranteeing a significant reduction in real prices. I think it was Mr Dawkins, the then Minister for Trade, who estimated some time ago that the export enhancement program had reduced Australia's export earnings by in excess of $1 billion in 1986-87. Both programs are costing Australia about $1 billion each in exports. The Chairman of the Wheat Board has claimed that the United States EEP has halved Australia's world market share while those of the United States and the EC have increased significantly. As I said earlier, our market share has gone from 19.5 per cent in 1985-86 to 11.3 per cent in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> The Soviet Union has in contemporary times been a significant market for Australia, but we have seen our share of that market crumble from 20 per cent to 3 per cent. We see that the United States has offered subsidies to no less than 35 countries since its export enhancement program began in 1985 and that it sold in excess of 59 million tonnes of wheat at a price, with subsidies included of up to $50 a tonne. Since 1985 when the EEP began, Australia's production has fallen from more than 18 million tonnes to about 13 million tonnes, and during that period wheat prices have continued to fall. There are, of course, a number of other countries that I will not canvass for the moment which have previously been significant buyers of our wheat and are no longer major importers of our product as a result of the subsidies offered to them by the United States of America and as a result of the CAP program. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn for a moment to what I see as an area of fundamental change which this Government would have the capacity to do something about if it had the moral and political courage, but about which essentially it has done absolutely nothing. Let us talk about the transport and handling in the wheat industry. The significance of wheat storage, handling and transport charges can be seen in the fact that the combined charges represent 18 per cent of the overseas customer's price. Storage, handling and transport charges vary widely from State to State. In 1987-88, for instance, the combined charges for these services ranged from $24.72 a tonne in South Australia to $42.53 a tonne in New South Wales. The State freight and handling monopolies' costs consume 22 per cent of free on board crop value. It is just not possible for us to compete on the world market as long as we have those levels built into our production costs. The McColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport suggested that, from a national perspective, resource cost savings of approximately $10 per tonne could be achieved through greater efficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to some restrictive practices as set down by the McColl report which give a clear and graphic example of some of the problems that we have in Australia. In talking about restrictive practices, that report tells us:</PARA>
<PARA>The `job and finish' or `nickaway' practice-the practice of leaving the plant after finishing an allocated task and refusing to accept any further tasks-has been named as one of the more blatant and damaging work practices affecting grain terminal activity . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Job and finish means that labour is being paid (usually at double time overtime rates on the premium afternoon shift) for non-work. </PARA>
<PARA>One common scenario is that of workers accepting only one job or task. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>On completion, it is usual for them to shower and spend the balance of the shift in the meal room. If, as is often the case, the task takes only two hours, the balance of the shift (five hours) is totally unproductive for that labour. </PARA>
<PARA>In some port terminals the Australian Workers Union smokos and meals breaks severely limit productivity. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>With start-up time at the beginning of the day and finishing tasks at the end of the afternoon shift . . . With an added five minutes on smokos, meal breaks and so on, it would be not uncommon to lose . . . two hours and fifty minutes from a 14 hour period. </PARA>
<PARA>The report refers to absenteeism at the Newcastle port terminal, stating that between 1986 and 1987:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . an average of 22 men, nearly 18 per cent of workforce, were absent on any one day. </PARA>
<PARA>Nearly 18 per cent of the total workforce are absent on any given day. In respect of disputes at the Newcastle grain terminal the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Between October 1986 and September 1987 . . . 69 shifts were lost due to industrial stoppages and stop work meetings. This represents approximately 14 per cent of the total shifts available during the year. </PARA>
<PARA>The total cost of ships times lost due to industrial stoppages during that period was $915,000. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>This estimate does not take into account the indirect costs such as harm to Australia's reputation and the charging of a premium by overseas shipowners over and above normal freight rates. </PARA>
<PARA>That total is estimated to be $1,065,000. The report goes on to outline in a graphic way the most gross abuses. This is one area in which, in my view, the employees' acceptance of wages from the employer verges on the criminal, and this Government has done absolutely nothing about it. It does not have the courage to do anything about it because it is its natural constituency that it may have to impinge upon. </PARA>

<PARA> I see I have about two minutes of my time remaining. Let me say this in conclusion: if this Government were serious, and committed in a very genuine way to reform, so that there would be a certainty of major changes and a significant reduction in costs to the growers of Australia which was reflected in our export sales and in the price paid by the consumers of Australia, we would see fundamental changes right across the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Micro-economic reforms should be made. There is an urgent need for change. Yet this Government stands silent on its commitment to do something about the problems. It is prepared to deregulate the domestic wheat market which in my view is a trivial matter and which I personally cannot get terribly emotional about. But when it is confronted with the real issues necessary to change the landscape and the economic horizons of Australia, it does not have the courage, the commitment, the fortitude but most of all, sadly, the Government does not have the will. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to speak for too long on this wheat legislation. The time has gone on, there have been many speakers and I think we should get to the committee stage as soon as possible in order to get as much of this legislation as possible passed tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation contains the following main features: first of all it contains provision for a more commercial structure and operating basis for the Australian Wheat Board (AWB), including the ability to buy wheat for cash, market other grains, trade in wheat produced in other countries, and operate grain handling and storage facilities. The legislation also empowers the AWB and other grain trading operations and service organisations to enter into contracts unencumbered by State legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the AWB is to remain the sole exporter of milling and industrial quality wheat but the remaining restrictions on the operation of private traders on the domestic market are to be removed. Thirdly, membership of the AWB is to comprise 11 people including eight nominated by the selection committee. There is no requirement for the AWB chairperson to be a grower nor for all States to be represented on the Board, apart from the presiding member. The members of the selection committee are to be nominated by the Grains Council of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, there will be an end to compulsory acquisition and administered domestic pricing methods. Fifthly, pool will identify the actual charges incurred by growers for storage, handling, transport and port services. Sixthly, a government loan guarantee on AWB borrowings will be provided to fund advance payments based on the estimated current season net pool return. The guarantee is to apply initially to 90 per cent of the net pool return, then phase down to 80 per cent over five years. Seventhly, there will be a termination of the levy which funds the shipment of wheat to Tasmania. Finally, a wheat industry fund will be established to provide a capital base to fund activity including the AWB's commercial operations making advance payments above the borrowing guarantee and providing insurance on credit sales. That is a brief summary of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer to a couple of points that previous speakers have made. First of all, the Opposition parties seem to be getting themselves into a considerable knot about the change in the membership of the Australian Wheat Board and the background of the members. There seems to be a view that the Government is not cognisant of the contribution of wheat growers themselves and that the wheat growers feel that the change in the nomination process will diminish their voice. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that I want to point out to the Opposition is that the Australian Wheat Board is not a production board; it is a marketing board. Wheat farmers in Australia are excellent producers of wheat. They are not bad at marketing and over the last 20 years individually wheat farmers have acquired considerable sophistication in being able to make judgments about the price of wheat and about determining how much wheat they should sow according to the price that they might be able to obtain in the forthcoming season. </PARA>
<PARA> However, one should recognise that the Australian Wheat Board's function is to market the wheat the farmers produce. It is not the other way around. It is not the Wheat Board's function to produce the wheat for the farmers to market and I believe that what the Government is proposing is quite reasonable. It is to ensure that the marketing functions of the Australian Wheat Board are strengthened and that, therefore, its ability to sell the wheat the farmers produce is strengthened. That, I believe, should be accepted by the Opposition. The Australian Wheat Board has done an excellent job over nearly the last 41 years. I acknowledge the fact that the Australian wheat farmers who have been elected to the Australian Wheat Board by and large have done an excellent job. Obviously their representation will continue, but we should not weaken the Board's primary function of being a marketing organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is interesting to reflect on the history of the Australian wheat industry and which party in government has done the most to change and improve the wheat industry in this country. There have been a number of major phases when the Government has intervened in legislation in the wheat industry in Australia. The first occasion was 1915 during the First World War under wartime regulations. That was, of course, under a Labor government. The first time there was intervention in the wheat industry occurred under the Fisher Labor Government. When the war ended, the then National Government ended that involvement and the wheat marketing system went back to the free-for-all of a free market. A Labor government in 1930, to overcome the problems of the wheat industry, attempted to introduce legislation to guarantee payments to wheat farmers in Australia. It is interesting to note that in 1930 that legislation to guarantee payment to farmers failed in this very chamber. A Senate dominated by conservative parties rejected the legislation to stop farmers getting a guaranteed income. </PARA>
<PARA> Through the rest of the 1930s there was chaos and a mishmash of legislation attempted at both State and Federal level, none of it of much benefit to the wheat producing farmer. The next major step, of course, was in the 1940s, again a Labor government introducing legislation in wartime for the sake of the nation to regulate and guarantee prices for wheat farmers. That led ultimately to the Chifley Labor Government introducing the Australian Wheat Board legislation in 1948 to start the stabilisation program. It guaranteed prices for wheat farmers and ensured orderly marketing. It was a Labor government that did it. It was not the Country Party, the National Party, the Liberal Party, the United Australia Party or any other party. The history of rural affairs in Australia and in politics in Australia until 1948 shows that it has been Labor governments that have made the big interventions, the big decisions to change an industry for the better. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am just coming to that. It certainly was 40 years ago. The legislation of 1948 established the wheat industry in Australia and gave it the stability to last 40 years, with amendments to the Wheat Stabilisation Act every five years. Neither the National Party-previously the Country Party-nor the Liberal Party moved away from the fundamentals of the legislation introduced by the Chifley Labor Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Now the Hawke Labor Government introduces in 1989 further significant amendments to the operation of the Australian Wheat Board. But the legislation does not destroy the Australian Wheat Board; it does not remove its overriding powers. In fact, it will be the major influence in the wheat industry. As I outlined in the beginning of my remarks, it will enable features that will make the Wheat Board more flexible, more commercial and able to provide a better marketing service to Australian wheat growers. It also enables wheat growers in the domestic market to have some wider options about what they can do. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, one of the encouraging features in Australian agriculture over the last 30 years is that farmers have become a lot more sophisticated, have access to a lot more information and make judgments about the way they run their rural activities-whether it be wheat growing, wool growing, beef production, and so on. So we are not dealing with a wheat industry of the 1920s or 1930s where farmers were isolated through lack of communication, did not have access to information on prices and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition parties have raised some queries about this legislation. I am not quite certain, after hearing some of the speeches tonight from Opposition members, whether they actually support this legislation or oppose it. I understand that they will be supporting it in general and proposing certain amendments. But the way they speak it could be thought that the legislation was designed to destroy the whole marketing arrangements of the Australian Wheat Board. The point I wish to make is that farmers are able to make much better judgments than they were 40 years ago, 30 years ago or even 20 years ago about--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The balance has to be there. I think the Government proposal is quite sensible. The Hawke Government has recognised that Australian wheat farmers are without doubt second to none in wheat production.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1987, as a member of a delegation to the United States of America, I met a number of members of the American Congress. One in particular, Charles Stenholm, a Conservative Democrat congressman from Texas and a leading figure in agricultural politics in America and in the Congress, openly admitted that Australian wheat farmers were, if not the most efficient, certainly second to none and he did concede that in some ways they were more efficient than American wheat farmers. So even Americans recognise that Australian wheat farmers are outstanding in their ability to produce top quality wheat. What we have to do is provide them with a marketing mechanism for the 1990s that will enable them to get the highest possible return for their efforts. This Bill does that. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise that some older members of the farming community who experienced the dreadful times of the 1930s are very concerned that the introduction of this Bill and its proposals could in some way, inadvertently even, return them to the mercy of the private grain buyers of the 1930s. When wheat farmers have a chance to study this Bill in detail they will see that that is not the case, that the Australian Wheat Board maintains its absolute monopoly on exports. It will still be the major force in marketing in the domestic area. And because it will set the prices for the export market, which is 80 per cent of the production, it will be the determining factor of price in the domestic market.</PARA>
<PARA> Does anyone believe that Australian wheat farmers will deliberately sell wheat to a private wheat buyer at a price less than what the Australian Wheat Board will offer either in the export market or even in the domestic market? Of course not. No wheat farmer in Australia will be that stupid. I think it is derogatory of the Opposition and some elements of farmer organisations to imply that farmers would do that. They are not that stupid; they will make intelligent marketing decisions to their own benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation represents the fourth time since Federation that major changes to the benefit of the industry will be made and it is the fourth time that they are being made by a Labor government. Despite all the protestations by the Liberal Opposition, the National Party and its predecessor the Country Party, they have squibbed all the times they have been in government making any significant changes to the wheat industry in Australia. I think it ought to be remembered by the wheat farmers of Australia that they cannot rely on the Opposition parties to deliver the goods, to tackle the important issues in their own industry. </PARA>
<PARA> When Senator Crichton-Browne spoke he stirred himself up a little about this Government not tackling major issues of micro-economic reform. I could not help but interject. I asked him to tell the Senate when, during the 30 years of the last 40 years that the Opposition was in government in Australia, it ever attempted the range of micro-economic reforms that the Hawke Labor Government has instituted since 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> We have come up not only with this present wheat board legislation; we also have coming before the Parliament in the next few weeks major legislation to implement the recommendations of the McColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport. I am very interested to hear the attacks made on the inefficiencies of waterside workers, on Australian Workers Union members and other workers in Australia within the grain storage and handling industry. Certainly, the McColl Royal Commission identified those inefficiencies. For 30 years out of the last 40 years since 1949 the Opposition was in power. It never held a royal commission into these matters. It never tackled these issues or identified the problems. It just ignored them. It was slothful and in a long slumber on these issues. It let the industry accumulate these inefficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is going to take on a major issue of reform of grain handling and storage. It is already being attacked by conservative State governments and, I must say in my view unfortunately, some aspects have been criticised by State Labor governments. But I have no hesitation in saying that on this matter the Federal Government must be supreme because of the importance of our export wheat industry to the world. For the good economic health of Australia also, the legislation must be carried. I trust that when it comes before the Parliament the National and Liberal parties will support it. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that within the next three or four weeks the Government will also announce a micro-economic reform package for the waterfront and maritime shipping industries in Australia. Again, when that announcement is made there will be numbers of vested interest, both employee and employer, who will complain. But I ask Opposition members what they did about this for the last 30 or 40 years. They did nothing. They were not game to tackle it because it was just too difficult. So when we come to consider the range of micro-economic reform it is this Government that has the guts to do it. It will never be the Opposition because it is beholden to too many vested and special interests. Though this Labor Government has a base in the trade union movement, we have been the government-even at times of strong political criticism from our trade union base-that has been willing for the national interest to take on those issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was introduced, as I will explain, as a result of the hard work and efforts of wheat growers of that time. Coming from that background, I suppose it is not surprising that I was weaned on the benefits of orderly marketing-the system which is going to be changed as a result of this legislation. Therefore I understand the concern, indeed the fear, of many wheat growers concerning these changes. This Labor Government must accept full responsibility for the extent of fear generated among wheat growers. No wonder farmers are confused and afraid of change. The main problem for the rural industry is not drought, flood or rabbits; it is the kangaroos Mr Kerin has loose in his top paddock. His proposals remained vague and imprecise for more than a year until this legislation was introduced a month ago. This lack of precision about the detail of the changes, understandably, encouraged fear of them and allowed that fear to rage like a bushfire among wheat growers. Unfortunately, when the legislation was introduced those fears were shown in large measure to be justified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Farmers are all in favour of fertiliser, but they would rather see it in their paddocks, not in the Government's legislation. The Government preaches good management and efficiency to the rural sector, yet its own legislation reeks of gross mismanagement and inefficiency. When was the last time the Government proposed as many amendments to its own legislation as the Opposition proposes to make? George Bernard Shaw said:</PARA>
<PARA>Men are not governed by justice, but by law or persuasion. When they refuse to be governed by law or persuasion, they have to be governed by force or fraud. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an accurate description of this Government's approach. How does the Government expect growers to be persuaded by a Bill to which it has attached some 40 amendments? The fraud is evident in that these amendments fail to address the central concerns of wheat growers. It has been left to the Opposition to ensure that benefits will be achieved-benefits which logical analysis shows are offered by further deregulation of the domestic wheat market. Our amendments will ensure that those efficiencies in marketing, which will be demanded by marketing deregulation, continue right down the chain of storage, transport, handling and distribution. We are moving 45 amendments to ensure that the legislation is beneficial to growers by removing the shortcomings which even the Government's own amendments fail to address. </PARA>
<PARA> The point of our amendments is to separate the wheat from the chaff in this Bill. The producers are efficient, it is the middle men who are not. I refer to the unions and their cosy deals with State governments and other utilities; the rorts in the ports; the snails on the rails; the go-slows in the silos. Producers are being railroaded by the railways and conditions at the terminals are just that: terminal. As the McColl Royal Commission into Grain Handling, Storage and Transport concluded, an end to all this would save growers $10 per tonne. </PARA>
<PARA> While a deregulated domestic market offers potential benefits to growers through increased returns, it also obviously involves risks, as any competitive, free enterprise system does. Growers are therefore entitled to have those risks offset by that $10 per tonne benefit to be gained by deregulating those other sources of costs to growers in the grain distribution chain. That must, above all, include the deregulation of the labour market within this industry. Let us see the efficiency for which growers themselves are renowned translated to other sectors of this important industry. Our amendments will ensure this, but if they are not passed, there is some justification for the fears of growers. Those fears arise largely from the experience of wheat growers during the Great Depression of the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA> I have discussed this issue with wheat growers throughout the length and breadth of my own State of South Australia over the past year at public meetings and in private discussions. A major concern has been that the Government's proposals will return growers to the bad old days of the 1930s. Of course, they will not, but it is to this Government's eternal discredit that, as I said earlier, its proposals were so vague for so long that those fears could be allowed to be generated. </PARA>
<PARA> Several government inquiries in the early part of this century referred to the existence and impact of price and shipping cartels, whose collusive actions depressed prices and controlled transport. This exploitation of farmers was facilitated partly by difficulties experienced with storage and transport arrangements during a period of rapid expansion and technological advances. </PARA>
<PARA> The Great Depression severely impacted on Australia's external trading position. In 1930, the Commonwealth Government sought to overcome these economic difficulties through an expansion in primary production, especially wheat growing. Early in 1930 Australian wheat growers were urged to grow more wheat. The appeal was instigated and supported at the highest levels of government. This was the first time that politics interfered with farmers' production decisions. The `Grow More Wheat' campaign was accompanied by obvious patriotic overtones and included the particularly attractive offer of a price guarantee of four shillings per bushel. Political leaders were unable to keep their end of the bargain, with the Senate rejecting Australia's first wheat marketing Bill on 4 July 1930-during the period, of course, of a Labor government; promises made by a Labor government that were unfulfilled. It reminds me of the promises which were obviously made to our media moguls a year or two ago about changes to the legislation with regard to media ownership, which again were not able to be delivered. So this party presently in government has a history or making promises to industries that it cannot deliver. As I said, it was not able to deliver the promised four shillings a bushel. </PARA>
<PARA> During 1930, of course, world wheat prices declined significantly. As most wheat producers in the eastern States were already in a financially weakened state, the industry entered a severe economic slump. Several other legislative initiatives providing for assistance to the wheat industry were attempted during 1930 and 1931. Although one of these, providing for a price guarantee of three shillings per bushel, was actually enacted, it was stillborn because no funds for the bounty were available. The result was that growers fought long and hard throughout the 1930s and into the 1940s for comprehensive marketing arrangements. As I said earlier, my own father was heavily involved in that process. Those marketing arrangements have become a feature of the Australian wheat industry. They were first brought together in the Wheat Industry Stabilization Act 1948. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act embodied four main features arising from concepts of price stabilisation and orderly marketing which have remained fundamental objectives of all subsequent legislation. Those four features were guaranteed prices, a home consumption price, the Australian Wheat Board, and stabilisation arrangements. While the present proposals abandon some of those features they do not abandon growers to the deprivation of the 1930s. First and foremost, the Australian Wheat Board is retained and although losing its monopoly power in the domestic market, its commercial capacity is strengthened by this legislation, which gives it the capacity to buy wheat for cash, to market other grains, to operate grain handling and storage facilities, and to enter into contracts unencumbered by State legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Most importantly, as a result of Opposition pressure, the Wheat Board will remain the sole exporter of Australian wheat. Maintaining this monopoly means that it has more than 80 per cent of Australia's crop tied up and that gives it sufficient market power to remain a major and effective player in the domestic market, which comprises the remaining nearly 20 per cent of the Australian crop. This dominant position will enable the Wheat Board to maintain a floor price in the domestic market. In other words, it will have the capacity to ensure that growers will not succumb to any collusive tendencies on the part of traders. The present day capacity for the sort of collusion which existed in the 1930s is further constrained by restrictive trade practice laws which, as we have seen in the recent court decision on section 56 of that legislation, do have effective teeth. The continuation of the Australian Wheat Board, combined with the Trade Practices Commission and legislation, is sufficient to ensure that changed marketing arrangements for the 1990s are not a return to the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA> Another concern of growers has been that these changes are the thin end of the wedge towards removing the export monopoly of the Australian Wheat Board and eventually to doing away with the Board. I cannot speak for the Government on that issue, but certainly that is not on the Opposition's agenda. We would oppose vehemently any such initiative by the Labor Party. The Opposition has demonstrated its bona fides with regard to the continuation of the Wheat Board and forced the Government to withdraw its proposals to remove its monopoly on the export of feed wheat. Many of our customer countries have single buying agencies and there is no benefit to be gained from increasing the number of sellers in these markets. So the export monopoly will remain. </PARA>
<PARA> A further concern of growers is that with the abandonment of the human consumption price for wheat on the domestic market, returns from that market segment will fall from the best export price to the average export price. While there is ample evidence that this will not occur, it is always easier to identify negatives from a removal of protection than positives. It has been ever thus on a whole range of protection issues, including tariffs and quotas. We should remember that these changes to wheat marketing were recommended by the Industries Assistance Commission which has been a great friend of the farming community for many years through its advocacy of the reduction of tariffs and other forms of protection to other sectors of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also relevant that the concept of the human consumption price was established in the late 1940s when more than half our crop was sold on the domestic market. With growth in production and exports over the years since then, that figure has now declined to less than 20 per cent. In other words, the domestic price premium now has only a small effect on overall returns when averaged across total production, compared to the benefit it gave in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The Australian Wheat Board has acknowledged that the maximum overall price effect, if the average export price becomes the benchmark rather than some higher figure, would be $2.50 per tonne and in my own State of South Australia, between $1 and $2 per tonne. Against this must be weighed the fact that since the 1984 deregulation of the feed wheat market in Australia, on average, growers are $13 per tonne better off by marketing oven wheat. This demonstrates the great likelihood of getting a higher rather than a lower price, similarly, for human consumption wheat, on the domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite simply, in the future, as now, the major determinant of returns for wheat growers will be world wheat prices. Orderly marketing does not achieve a higher price; it simply causes a lag effect. In a falling world market, the decline in returns will be slower than otherwise, but equally, in a rising world market, returns will rise slower than otherwise. That is why the major responsibility of this Government is to lobby effectively in world forums for freer trade and the removal of subsidies. If only this Government was as good at selling off the crop as it is at selling off the farm. But it has failed dismally in international forums. At a time when Australia's balance of payments reads like the balance sheet of the National Safety Council, this Government has presided over a fall of 45 per cent in our share of world wheat markets over the last four years, while the United States has increased its share by 48 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> A short time ago the Prime Minister wept on television over his success with the birds. What success? He had no luck with Quayle; he will have even less with Peacock. He told us Mr Quayle had got the message. Some message! A week later the United States announced a sale to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) of 1 1/2 million tonnes at a subsidy of $18 to $20 per tonne. Last year the United States spent $760m on its export enhancement program subsidies. This year it will spend $1.1 billion. Our Prime Minister failed to impress the United States Vice-President because he was either too clever by half or poorly briefed. He cited the figures I gave a few moments ago-Australia has suffered a 45 per cent decrease; the United States has enjoyed a 48 per cent increase over the last few years. Unfortunately for our Prime Minister, Mr Quayle was a little better briefed and by referring to market share figures for the 1980s was able to show that our share four years ago was an atypical high and the United States share an atypical low. Our Prime Minister should have been better briefed. </PARA>
<PARA> The real damage which is being done to Australian wheat growers by the United States export enhancement program can be shown by looking at market share figures for the whole decade of the 1980s for our two major markets-China and the USSR-rather than looking at our total share of the world wheat market over the last four years. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table showing respective market shares since 1982 of Australia, the United States and the European Economic Community, in China and the USSR. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Reference to this table clearly shows a dramatic rise in the market share of the United States and the European Economic Community since the introduction of the export enhancement program over the last four years, compared not just to 1985-86 but to the average share for the first half of the 1980s. In contrast, in the same period there has been a massive fall in Australia's market share. In China the change has not been so dramatic until this year. Our share has fallen to 9 per cent, from an average for the 1980s of 20 per cent, while the United States share has arisen from around 30 per cent to 47 per cent and the European Economic Community's share has risen from around 4 per cent to 12 per cent. The table shows a much more extended period of change in the USSR, but again, only since the introduction of the export enhancement program. This is the message which this Government must ram home to the United States in particular, and to the European Economic Community. It is in our two key markets that our Western allies are doing demonstrable and serious damage to our wheat growers and hence to our economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before concluding, I will highlight the major reasons for deregulating the domestic market. Firstly, to ensure the deregulation of the transport, storage and handling sectors and to achieve those savings of $10 per tonne which, I mentioned earlier, had been identified by the McColl Royal Commission, it is important to deregulate the domestic market. While McColl acknowledged the possibility of achieving these savings under current marketing arrangements, the Royal Commission concluded that marketing reform would enhance the likelihood of improved efficiencies being obtained in the transport, storage and handling sectors because of the effect of competitive pressure in the marketplace. Because my home State of South Australia has enjoyed the benefits of deregulated transport for many years, thanks to the foresight of the Playford Liberal Government of earlier times, and has grower-owned bulk handling facilities, savings there may be somewhat less than the figure of $10 per tonne. But there are still savings to be achieved in South Australia as a result of deregulation, most notably on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason for supporting deregulation of the domestic market is that it is already partially deregulated. Since 1984 the permit system has allowed private trading in feed wheat. That deregulation of the feed wheat domestic market has been so successful that over 90 per cent of domestic feed wheat now bypasses the Australian Wheat Board. It is doing so because growers are getting better returns through private trading. The gloomy predictions in 1984 have not been realised. Of course, the feed wheat domestic market represents 40 per cent of our domestic market. So we are only talking about deregulating the other 60 per cent of the domestic market, or about 12 per cent of our total crop. </PARA>
<PARA> The third reason for domestic deregulation is to encourage the development of specialist varieties and niche marketing. The development of the organic wheat market, for example, has been hindered by the regulated system. As an example, for the privilege of growing and milling his own wheat and not selling the wheat to another buyer, one producer has to pay the Australian Wheat Board $40 per tonne. This is clearly a nonsense; hence, the benefits of this legislation, provided it incorporates the Opposition amendments, are demonstrable. The Opposition amendments will ensure that the fears of growers will not be realised and it is important that those amendments be carried. </PARA>
<PARA> I am confident that over the next five years growers who have yet to be convinced of the benefits of domestic market deregulation will see and come to realise the benefits of competitive marketing opportunities. Of course, if they do not wish to avail themselves of those opportunities, the Australian Wheat Board will still be available. They can deliver their wheat to the Board, and the Board will be able to market on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> Our amendments will test how dinkum this Government is about micro-economic reform. There is no doubt the legislation should include the deregulation of the labour market within this industry. The Government, particularly with regard to the waterfront, has now been given a blueprint for deregulation of the labour market with the publication of the Inter-State Commission report. I want to see some action on that front and in other sectors of this industry as far as the labour market is concerned. The Liberal Party has shown its bona fides with its support of this legislation. Let us see some bona fides on the part of the Government with its support for our amendments. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is is for the managers of Senate business to sort out these details, and advise me, but that is my understanding of the position, and I am acting on that basis. Therefore, I do not propose to deliver what is traditionally the Government's reply to the points raised in the debate in an exhaustive fashion, as I am prepared to do and as I would like to do. I do, however, for the Hansard record, note that many of the points that I have heard canvassed in debate here tonight are points that were canvassed in the debate in the other place. I believe that if I were to adopt the reply by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, to all those points, and present that reply to the Senate, that would at least cover my reply to those issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some issues, however, have been raised specifically in this chamber and are unique to the debate here. I think they require some comment. The first of those, in the order in which they appear before me, is the frequent comment by Senator Stone-by way of interjection or, indeed, in his speech-about the definition of grain in clause 3 (1). Grain, according to that provision, means wheat, barley and any product of the soil declared by the Minister by regulation. Senator Stone has sought to try to cast aspersions that the Government was trying to insert a definition that was improper. Senator Stone might not know that what he is attacking is a definition which was lifted directly from the Queensland Act and he, as a Queensland senator and Leader of the National Party, should be aware that it is a definition that we have taken and applied because we think it is the proper definition in these circumstances. But the origin of that definition is the Queensland Act-an Act provided by a National Party government. If Senator Stone has difficulty with that, he ought to speak to his Party in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats have indicated a series of amendments. I do not propose to address those amendments in this debate or, indeed, the points that have been raised by the Australian Democrats, because it has been pretty hard to follow the ever-altering trail of motive or argument that the Democrats have put up. One could now say that the Democrats are performing a throwback to the old, heavily regulated days. The would-be suburban trendies do not have much of an agricultural or primary industry policy. They are now trying to capture the cocky vote on an issue about which there is anxiety among wheat growers, and this seems to me to be the basis of all political activities and one that is easily unmasked. The amendments that the Democrats are proposing are amendments similar to those moved by some National Party members in the other place, and I will deal with them in the appropriate way. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been many references to deregulating the labour market. The debate, as I have heard it-and I have followed it whether I have been here or outside of the chamber-has been marked by, I think, many fine contributions from the Opposition. I think I am obliged to pay that compliment. That is not to say that I have agreed with 100 per cent of the content of all Opposition speeches. But in terms of the perception of what the Government is trying to do-to deregulate the domestic wheat market to provide greater choice for wheat growers and, indeed, to open the prospect for wheat growers to make significant savings for themselves-the strand of the debate has been equalled only by the contributions from our side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate by Liberal Party senators has mainly fallen down when they have tried-and I know they are obliged to do this by the Party commitment-to embrace the whole question of deregulation across the board. In that regard they have fallen into deep water. I do not want to relate, chapter and verse, the record of this Government on deregulation, but it can be compared to that of any other government since Federation and is certainly better than the record of the Opposition. Indeed, ours is an enviable record. I do not want to attempt to argue that, somehow or other, the Opposition, if it were in government-an event that I am sure the Australian people will conspire at the ballot box to prevent-if the Democrats were in government--</PARA>

If the Opposition were in government I do not believe there is any credibility whatsoever in the allegation that it would succeed in deregulating the labour market, even though it has summoned up the image of the old confrontationist days under Fraser, which it believes it could copy to force things through. The most eloquent put-down of that line of argument was given, I believe, by Senator Schacht, when he said that the Opposition, since the war, had been in government for some 30 years, it has not yet succeeded. There is no reason why the people of Australia should believe it would succeed now.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also note that the amendment moved by Senator Stone is factually incorrect. It seeks in paragraph (a) to deplore the Government's betrayal of wheat farmers of Australia. That is not a fact. In fact, what this Bill does, as many of the coalition speakers have pointed out, is give greater flexibility, greater choice and an opportunity for farmers to indeed earn more. That is hardly a betrayal; it is an enhancement of their prospects. In paragraph (b) of the amendment, he refers to the Government weakening the position of the Australian Wheat Board as a strong trader in the domestic wheat market. The Wheat Board is a monopoly trader in the domestic wheat market. We propose by our amendments to make it a strong trader in the domestic wheat market. The amendment Senator Stone has moved demonstrates the antithesis of reality in paragraph (b). In paragraph (c) he talks about regretting the Government's failure to adequately negotiate. That is a perceptional problem. Honourable senators may wish to pretend that that is the case. We have taken note of the findings of the Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport, and since the Industries Assistance Commission report, we have engaged in exhaustive consultation on these Bills. I am now advised-and I think just today the Minister for Agriculture in Western Australia, Mr Ernie Bridge, has announced-that Western Australia will be passing complemetary legislation. I understand Victoria will be doing the same. I expect so will South Australia. The recalcitrant States will be Queensland and New South Wales, and they seem to have a political motive for that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>This amendment is moved by us as a substitute for the Opposition amendments (9) and (10). This amendment addresses Opposition and I believe industry concerns about the current provisions which prevent the Wheat Board from employing staff on terms and conditions more favourable than those of the Managing Director. The provision I am moving reflects Government policy and it is our view that it is not onerous. We therefore regard the Opposition concerns about this as misplaced. However I note that, given Mr Kerin's undertaking to give this matter further consideration, the Government is moving an amendment which provides for an exception to this provision to be made subject to the approval of the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA>I simply point out to the Committee, as I did in the second reading debate, that the purpose of these amendments is really to reinstate the Australian Wheat Board in a fashion that the Democrats believe is in the best interests of the wheat industry and represents the desire of the wheat growers of Australia. The amendments represent the technical necessity to do that. Although there are other amendments to be dealt with which will, if passed, ameliorate the end result, the amendments which I am moving are the only amendments before us tonight which will, in fact, do what the wheat industry wants with this legislation. I quote from the Grains Council of Australia, which has written to the Department to this effect:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . while the Grains Council has pursued other amendments, it is the industry's strongly held view that the domestic wheat market should not be further deregulated than currently exists. Consequently, the Australian Wheat Board's acquisition power should be restored, as should the domestic human consumption pricing arrangements, with the modifications suggested by the Grains Council some months ago. </PARA>
<PARA>That in fact is the effect of the amendments en bloc which I am moving now. I commend those amendments to the Committee and note that these amendments were moved at an earlier time in another place by Mr Peter Fisher, the honourable member for Mallee, and are moved in the same spirit here, in the interests of the wheat growers of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to speak in support of the Australian Democrat amendments. From the line-up that we had in the divisions on the second reading, it looks as though the package of Bills will be passed.

I rise to speak on this occasion as a senator who represents Western Australia because in that line-up for the divisions I was, in fact, the only Western Australian senator to vote against the deregulation of the wheat market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw to the attention of honourable senators the fact that the State of Western Australia is against wheat deregulation. As reported in the West Australian on Friday, 14 April of this year:</PARA>
<PARA>The State Government and Opposition have joined forces to oppose the Federal Government's plan to deregulate the domestic wheat market. In a move which saw the State Liberal and National Parties rebel against their Federal counterparts, the Legislative Assembly yesterday passed a National Party motion calling for all-party support to retain State control of the industry and they threatened to challenge in the High Court the Federal Government's power over State transport and grain handling. The Deputy Leader of the Western Australian National Party, Mr Monty House, told the Legislative Assembly yesterday that many Western Australian farmers would be disadvantaged by the plan. Western Australia already had one of the most efficient grain handling and storage systems in the world. `The grain handling system in Western Australia is unique and it has been handling grain at a cheaper cost per tonne than in any other country', he said. </PARA>

<PARA> (7) Page 10, paragraph 15 (1) (a), line 25, after ``Chairperson'', add ``who shall be a wheat grower at the time of appointment''. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of all of these amendments in many respects is to correct the worst flaws in the Government's legislation. I deal now with the first seven of the coalition's amendments. As to the first one, the Government agreed to change `grain' in two places in the Bill but left wheatgrowers only with the choice of marketing options. As to the second one, under the Bill as written, it is illegal for the Board to trade intrastate. By making the legislation less specific, the Board should be able to trade intrastate without complementary legislation, until challenged in the High Court. Of course, we do not know what the High Court might do with it. It might approve it. In any event, by that time, if the High Court were unhappy, the States would have had the opportunity to pass complementary legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the third amendment, this provision is already covered by the Australian Constitution and the intent that the Board operate on a commercial basis makes these clauses heavy-handed. Amendment No. 4 is necessary because clause 2 is removed. Amendment No. 5 should further protect the States' concerns about their State marketing boards by requiring consultation with the Grains Council on grains other than wheat. Amendment No. 6 provides for compensation to be paid for losses in obeying directions of the Minister. Amendment No. 7 ensures that the Minister's commitment in the second reading speech that the chairperson is a wheat grower at the time of appointment is met. </PARA>

<PARA> I am supporting Senator Lewis on this amendment because section 15ab of the Acts Interpretation Act says that extrinsic material may-and the main point of this is the word `may'-be used:</PARA>

We have heard in this place tonight and yesterday many statements that this is a marketing board rather than a producer board. Then the same speakers have gone on to contradict themselves by saying that some farmers, or a lot of farmers, have marketing skills and managerial skills.

About 80 per cent of grain which is used within the State of Victoria is grown within the State. Not to have clear provisions at this point to allow the Wheat Board and, perhaps even more importantly, to allow grain growers a real choice to use the Wheat Board, as the Minister's staff and departmental staff have been saying around the country at meetings of growers they would be able to and everyone is confident they will, and not to have these provisions in the absence of State enabling legislation-which we do not have-would be chopping the Wheat Board off at the ankles.</PARA></TALK.START>

We opposed them in the other place; we won there. I see from the round-up of forces that we are not likely to win here. Nonetheless, we oppose the amendments. Since there are seven of them, I want to quickly cite for the Senate record the Government's position on each one of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to the first, the current objectives of the Wheat Board provide, inter alia, that the objectives of the Board are, by participating in a commercial manner in the market for grain and grain products, to provide Australian wheat growers with a choice of marketing options. The intention of the proposed amendment is to change the objectives of the Board's commercial operations so that they are directed not only to wheat growers, but to all grain growers. To change this last reference from `wheat' to `grain' would change the whole basis of the Act and essentially amount to the establishment of a grains corporation. This is a direction which the Government has not considered and would raise concerns if it lessened competition in grain marketing. I think that is probably enough on our position on that. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me move to amendment No. 2. Our basic problem with amendment No. 2 is that we believe that it goes beyond the Commonwealth's constitutional power and therefore ought to be opposed. I make the observation on that, in passing, that creating a clouded legal situation, if this were to carry, is not the answer since it puts the Australian Wheat Board then in an impossible position. As I say, we believe that it is against the Commonwealth's constitutional power to do what this amendment proposes. </PARA>
<PARA> As to proposed amendments Nos 3 and 4, this is a standard provision which states the constitutional position that the Australian Wheat Board not exceed its powers. Its exclusion would put the whole Act into question. We oppose Nos 3 and 4. </PARA>
<PARA> On amendment No. 5, the Government has amended clause 10 (2) (b) to refer to the consultation on the marketing of grain rather than wheat. The second reading speech also refers to an expectation that the Australian Wheat Board consult with the Grains Council of Australia on general policy issues relating to trading in other grains and wheat of other origin. In view of that, we oppose amendment No. 5. On amendment No. 6, the current Act does not have such a provision and it is not normal government practice to include such a provision in legislation. The question of compensation would normally be taken into consideration by the Minister in considering issuing a direction. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, on amendment No. 7, it is not appropriate to put this provision in the legislation, given the new, more commercial orientation of the Wheat Board. However, in recognition of the industry's concerns, the Minister's commitment to appointing a grower-chairperson was made clear in the second reading speech. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats strongly support this amendment. I reiterate our approach to the Government's argument: It has, for as long as the Democrats have been in this place, been our policy that growers should control their own operations as far as possible. The Government is saying that, because we are now moving into a commercial situation, we should not be having wheat growers in a controlling situation. That is a contradiction of its argument for the whole legislation in the first place, which is that growers can go out and do their own marketing, that they do not need the Board to do it for them. If that is the case, every grower is an expert. We accept that we do want good expertise on the Board. We believe that we can best get it, in the interests of the wheat industry, from wheat growers themselves. This is a consistent policy position for the Australian Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We also oppose this amendment and perhaps with a degree more vigour than we have opposed the others. We say that the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) now has a broad commercial charter. The Board needs to comprise the best people who are available, with a balance of production, marketing and finance skills. If it does not have this expertise, this will be detrimental to the growers' returns. I think, therefore, that to argue as Senator Powell has argued is in fact to put people without the necessary skills to maximise the returns for growers in a position of marketing for the Board. The wheat growers are able to determine board membership through their majority representation on the AWB selection committee. We oppose the amendment. We would not want to see the incorporation of a wheat growers' club running the AWB. We believe that it needs a wider commercial membership and that is why--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats support these amendments. I comment quickly on amendment No. 12 to exempt the pools from the provisions of the Trade Practices Act. The Trade Practices Commission itself is concerned about the position of rural producers in the marketplace in general and its discussion paper The Rural Guideline makes some very cogent points in that area. The committee which produced this report has been very concerned about the need to enhance producers' bargaining power where there are very many small producers in a market with many fewer large buyers. Therefore I think this amendment in particular is essential.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government opposes these five amendments Nos 12 to 17. Advice from the Attorney-General's Department on amendment No. 12 is that such a specific exemption is not required. The Bill provides, after all, clear authority to the Australian Wheat Board to operate pools and such operations are therefore automatically authorised under section 51 of the Trade Practices Act which provides specific exemption for the activities of statutory marketing authorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of amendments Nos 12 to 15, while growers do have a wide range of marketing choices, the export monopoly remains and the Australian Wheat Board is still a receiver of last resort. Some growers will still have no alternative but to deliver to the Board and on these grounds it could be argued that the offer to cash-out from the pool should remain mandatory. The act of grace payments are a matter for the Board's commercial judgment in our view and for that reason we oppose amendment No. 16 proposed by Senator Lewis.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of amendment No. 17 I say that Government policy recognises, even in the absence of a formal guarantee, the potential ultimate liability of government if statutory authorities proved unable to meet their borrowing liabilities. For those reasons we oppose this block of amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been pointed out, this is the cornerstone of the four conditions for the Liberal Party to agree to the deregulation of the domestic wheat market. I also want to put on record that I agreed to not cross the floor of the Senate on the basis that we would stand up solidly for this. We do not intend to back away from it. I am not going to go into the reasons why the guaranteed minimum price (GMP) should remain at 95 per cent. Despite what anyone might say, the GMP will be the floor price on the domestic market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to point out where Senator Walsh this evening misled the Parliament when he spoke about the GMP being higher than the Government proposes. He gave figures on what the Government would have paid out in 1986. Since he spoke I have obtained figures here from the Australian Wheat Board. In 1986, when the GMP was set at $125.72, the pool returned $125.50 which is 99.8 per cent of the GMP. In other words, if the trigger was to be set off under this sort of legislation at 95 per cent estimated GMP, it would have had to be set at 99.8 per cent for the Government to pay.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government resists with all the passion that is equal to that expressed from the Opposition, but with a little more to overwhelm it, the amendment that has been moved by Senator Lewis and supported by the Australian Democrats. This for us is one of those issues that we would contest strongly, and I have no doubt that when this legislation now goes back to the House of Representatives the Government will be defending its position again. However, I do not propose to call for a division but note for the record that had the call gone against us, as I would expect given the remarks around the chamber, we would have sought a division to record our position on the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should say in passing as well that Senator Panizza made a statement that Senator Walsh, my ministerial colleague, misled the Senate. I would have normally raised a point of order. I did not due to the lateness of the hour, but I would assert on Senator Walsh's behalf, absent as he is, that that is not the case, and allow the argument between Senator Panizza and Senator Walsh to flourish at another time. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now address myself to the reason why it is that the Government feels so strongly about this amendment. Government policy is to phase underwriting down, consistent with its broader policy of reducing government involvement in statutory marketing, industry taking greater responsibility for its own risk management and greater commercialisation of the board. it should be remembered too that that level is initially 90 per cent, phasing down to 80 per cent, the reduction in the level is therefore gradual. Even with underwriting at 80 per cent the wheat industry is favourably treated compared with other industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision is also made for the industry to fund advances in excess of the underwritten level. I understand however that the industry is not disposed to do this because it considers it is not worthwhile. </PARA>
<PARA> If it is true that in pre-Gorbachev Russia some of the best novels remained in the drawers of their authors for fear of persecution, it is also true in the way in which we are dealing with this legislation that some of the best speeches that could be made in the Senate remain in our drawers. I would have liked to have made a good speech on this subject. I will not tonight; maybe I will get an opportunity later. But we indicate that we resist this amendment with the energy equal to that which would take it to a division if necessary. </PARA>

I will not delay the Committee as long as I would like in relation to the deregulation of labour. But this is where the Hawke Government has absolutely failed this country. It is failing the nation by not addressing this major handicap to our industries overcoming the massive debt burden that the country is suffering. In this amendment the coalition parties set out how the Hawke Government could go about the deregulation of labour practices. It sets out quite clearly what we will do when we get into government, and it sets out what should be the future course of this nation in relation to labour practices. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats vehemently oppose this amendment, as indeed we vehemently oppose those additional aspects of clause 88 which deregulate the transport, handling and storage of grain. In clause 88, amended or unamended-and it will be unamended-we find an odious situation. In proposing to extend deregulation beyond what the Government has as a result of the deal it did to get deregulation of the wheat marketing system, the Opposition has exercised an interesting political ploy, to the extent that Senator McKiernan had to get up in this place during the second reading debate and object to the union bashing that was going on. As I pointed out at the time, that was only to be expected because here we have a piece of legislation that is the result of a deal between the Liberal Party, the privatisers of the New Right, and the economic rationalists of the Labor Party. The legislation flies in the face of the interests, certainly of the rail unions and therefore of employment generally, especially in small country towns and surrounding areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A recent study by the Bureau of Transport Economics, which is part of one of this Government's Federal departments, found that the damage caused by the average truck cost over $35,000 more than the freight charges that are being paid. Yet the Government and the Opposition are saying that they are levelling the playing field, that they are getting some real competition and, worse, that they are going to save grain growers $10 a tonne. If some save any money it will only be in their grain marketing. They will have to pay the taxes to cover the high cost of accidents on the roads, and that is only because of the deregulation of transport. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition now puts before us an amendment which proposes to deregulate the whole of the labour market associated with grain transport, handling and storage in a highly confrontationist way. As with amendment No. 11 that was moved earlier this evening, that shows us that, although there may have been some cosmetic changes at the top in the coalition leadership recently, there is certainly no fundamental change, that we are in for industrial confrontation should the electorate go down that path at any stage in the future. The Australian Democrats totally reject Senator Lewis's amendment to clause 88 and most vehemently object to the other deregulation aspects of clause 88 which are part of the legislation as a result of a deal done with the Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party and acquiesced in by the National Party as a party within the coalition. Were there more time, not only would we have more brilliant speeches but we would have another division on this. But because of the lateness of the hour we will not call for a division.</PARA>

I recognise that the Opposition is not able to assess the real change objectively because of its philosophical commitment. I could make a long speech on this but I will not.

<PARA>This amendment will require the Commonwealth Minister to consult with the State Ministers for primary industries or agriculture through the medium of the Australian Agricultural Council before any regulations are made to prescribe State laws for the purposes of section 7 or section 88 of the Act, that is, to ensure that the States have at least some forewarning of any Commonwealth attempt to override State legislation in regard to the storage, handling, transport or marketing of grain. While it would be desirable to require the Commonwealth Minister to advise State Ministers at a formal meeting of the Agricultural Council, an acceptable compromise might be to require the Commonwealth Minister to advise the members of the Agricultural Council in writing of any proposed action in regard to sections 7 or section 88.

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In some veterans' cases, recently, there appeared to have been a change in the manner of application of the long standing merit test. Following discussions between Commonwealth and Commission officers the situation appears to have been satisfactorily resolved. A means test was imposed by the Commission for a short period last year, but this was later withdrawn. A contributions policy recently applied to veterans' war-caused disability pension cases has now been withdrawn following correspondence and discussions with authorities in New South Wales.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) Material made of 100% polyester has worse burn effects on a wearer than cotton. However, this has no relevance to the new camouflage uniform as it is made from a 50/50 blend of cotton and polyester. There are significant differences in fire resistance between cotton/polyester (CPE) blends and 100% polyester. When comparing the burn effects between cotton and 50/50 CPE, the difference is minimal. In fact, some research has indicated that cotton fabrics can cause slightly worse burns than CPE blends.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The CPE material used in the new camouflage uniform does not melt and adhere to the skin at all. In the CPE blend, the ash formed from the burning cotton holds the molten polyester in place. This is known as the `scaffolding effect' and prevents the melt-drip phenomenon which occurs in 100% polyester material.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The CPE blend material used in the new camouflage uniform does not create more difficult wound healing and scarring than burning cotton material. At worst, the new camouflage uniform would perform in a similar manner to all cotton fabrics of the same mass.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) An answer to this part of the question cannot be provided at this time. It has been necessary for the Australian Defence Force to contact the United States Naval Attache in Canberra and request an answer. The Attache, in turn, has requested an answer through the United States Department of Defence in Washington. The United States' response is still awaited. No firm indication can be given by the United States Naval Attache as to when a response will be available.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Community Services and Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Overseas studies, particularly in New York, indicate that the lifestyles of the homeless young place them at great risk of exposure to AIDS. While there is little information on the risk of exposure to AIDS among the homeless young in Australian cities, measures are being taken to co-ordinate agencies in Australia working with homeless youth. A national workshop of policy makers, youth workers and youth held in Sydney recently, reviewed current programs and established mechanisms for evaluation, co-ordination and development of AIDS education and services.</PARA>
<PARA> The AIDS Working Group of the Council of Social Welfare Administrators has recently completed a detailed examination of programs and policies required for youth as clients of social welfare departments. Their report was endorsed by the Council of Social Welfare Ministers at Burnie on 20 March 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Although the provision of health and welfare services, including for the young, is primarily a State responsibility, the Commonwealth provides funds to State/Territory Governments through a number of major programs designed to alleviate homelessness, AIDS and drug abuse. These include:</PARA>
<PARA> Supported Accommodation Assistance Program: From 1989-90, support for homeless people over the next three years will be increased by $40 million bringing the total Federal Government support to $220 million over the next three years. The new Program will provide a wider range of assistance to those in need, by providing better access to training, employment assistance and other Government services and place greater emphasis on medium and long term accommodation in the mix of accommodation services available;</PARA>
<PARA> AIDS Program: Through the Inter-Governmental Committee on AIDS (IGCA) formed in 1987, youth networks are being expanded and drawn upon to combat high risk activity. Many educational and support programs are now well established including crucial outreach programs. These include streetwork, mobile clinics and needle and syringe exchange programs;</PARA>
<PARA> National Campaign Against Drug Abuse: Young people have been identified as a key target group under the Campaign. Under the NCADA cost-shared program, funds are provided to the States and Territories for treatment, rehabilitation and counselling services as well as for drug prevention education programs. At the national level, during the next triennium of the NCADA there will be campaigns directed at young people targeting alcohol and heroin. A comprehensive national statement on school based drug education curricula development and implementation will also be developed.</PARA>
<PARA> Following receipt of the Report of the National Inquiry into Homeless Children by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (Burdekin Report)-Our Homeless Children, Federal and State Governments have established a joint working party to address the problem associated with youth homelessness.</PARA>
<PARA> The working party will assess the Report and report back to a special meeting of Welfare Ministers in June 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Reliable estimates of the number of children on the streets at night are not available. There are an unknown number of young people who, for a variety of reasons, do not use available accommodation services.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Information is not available on the number of homeless young people resorting to prostitution. Outreach programs directed towards young male and female prostitutes are achieving promising results.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) See (2).</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Drug treatment and rehabilitation services are administered by the States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Establishment of rehabilitation centres for drug addicts in the Territories is a matter for the Northern Territory Government or the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories in the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
