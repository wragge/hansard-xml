<TITLE>Company Tax Collection System</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's Budget decision to change the company tax collection system will be a crippling blow to many small businesses, already suffering as a direct result of the Hawke Labor Government's high interest rate policy.</PARA>
<PARA> The earlier remittance of company tax payments to the Government will substantially reduce the cash-flow position of thousands of small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA> Many small businesses will be driven under as a result of the Government's decision-unable to find funds for both tax commitments and new stock, only able to borrow at record high interest rates and unable to claim any tax relief on such borrowings to meet their tax commitment.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's proposed changes to the company tax collections system has only been introduced as a greedy grab for more tax revenue.</PARA>
<PARA> The small business community would prefer the Government to completely abandon the proposal rather than make only minor alterations to the original Budget decision, which are not likely to alleviate the situation to any significant extent.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA> The documents read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>NATIONAL HEALTH REGULATIONS (AMENDMENT) STATUTORY RULES 1989 No. 292</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's concerns with this instrument related firstly to the livelihood and personal rights implications of the change effected by the instrument to the definition of accident and sickness insurance business in the parent Act to prevent the payment of benefits on the basis of periods of hospitalisation. The Committee was also concerned at whether the Regulations were authorised by the parent Act and whether their subject matter was more appropriate for parliamentary enactment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee regards the right to earn a livelihood as a basic personal right which should not arbitrarily be removed or subjected to unreasonable limits. The Committee accepts that it may be appropriate to restrict this right by delegated legislation in order to ensure standards of competence or safety. In cases such as the present, however, where there is a blanket prohibition on the undertaking of a type of activity previously practised, the Committee is always concerned that such a prohibition should be introduced with as little disruption as possible to existing procedures. The Committee asked for an assurance that existing insurance policies would not be suddenly inoperative, with consequent disruption to insurers and with the deprivation of protection to policy holders, who may have arranged their personal affairs on the basis of these policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee welcomed the Minister's advice that existing policies may continue until expiry, thereby avoiding any enforced, abrupt alteration of existing rights. The Committee carefully considered advice from the Minister and the instrument and the Explanatory Statement in relation to the period of notice given before the Regulations were made. The Committee also discussed at some length whether these matters should be dealt with by the Parliament itself. The Committee finally agreed to accept the advice of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee thanks the Minister for Community Services and Health, the Hon. Neal Blewett MP, for his co-operation. </PARA>

<PARA>The Hon. Neal Blewett MP</PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Community Services and Health</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the National Health Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1989 No. 292, considered by the Committee at its Meeting of 30 November 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has a number of concerns about the regulations. One important concern is with the effect on existing policy-holders of insurance contracts providing for the payment of benefits based upon periods of hospitalisation. The Regulations, which effectively prevent the payment of benefits under such contracts, come into effect upon 1 December 1989. The Committee seeks your confirmation that such existing contracts of insurance will remain in operation after 1 December 1989 until expiry. The Committee noted in this context the provisions of regulations 29aaa (2) which refer to contracts entered into force 1 December 1989 which include a condition guaranteeing renewal of the contract. The Committee expressly seeks your advice, however, on contracts entered into before 1 December 1989 which do not provide for guaranteed renewal. The Committee understands there may be considerable numbers of these. The Committee would appreciate your assurance that all present policies will not become void on 1 December 1989, with policy-holders suddenly lacking cover that they thought they had. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee would also welcome additional advice on other aspects of the regulations. Firstly, your confirmation is sought that the new r.29aaa (1) is authorised by s.67 (4) of the parent Act. The Committee always looks carefully at legislative instruments which amend or affect the operation of Acts. As this is such a case and as the regulations have important commercial and personal implications your assurances are sought in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> Next, the Committee noted the Explanatory Statement advised that the commercial insurance industry was notified of the proposed regulations in September 1989 in order that insurers could restructure their products so that accident and sickness insurance payments are related to factors other than hospitalisation. Your assurance that you believe this period of notice was sufficient would be welcome. The Committee would be assisted if you could indicate the number of persons affected by the new regulations, both policy-holders and insurers. The Committee would wish to know whether insurers, in the context of the restructured products mentioned in the Explanatory Statement, will be deprived of perhaps a substantial market or whether this gap in their livelihood can be covererd by the new products. Conversely, could you advise that policy-holders, who may have arranged their personal and financial affairs taking into account the exluded policies, will be able to obtain broadly similar cover. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, your advice would be appreciated as to whether consideration was given to effecting the changes made by the regulations through an Act of Parliament. Even though some changes made by delegated legislation may be technically valid the Committee has reported that where such instruments make a fundamental change in the law, introduce major innovation into pre-existing legal, social or financial concepts, or impinge in a major way upon the community, then Parliamentary enactment may be appropriate. </PARA>

<PARA>Chairman</PARA>
<PARA>Senate Standing Committee on Regulations</PARA>
<PARA> and Ordinances</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Bob</PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for your recent letter about National Health Regulation 29aaa, Statutory Rules 1989 No. 292. </PARA>
<PARA> I can assure you that guaranteed renewable policies written before 1 December 1989 are not affected by the regulation. A guaranteed renewable policy is generally regarded as one which includes a condition allowing the insured the right of renewal on payment of the appropriate premium. Benefits may be subject to variations in accordance with a formula specified in the policy; in this way the liability or potential change in liability is assumed at the time the policy was initially effected. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of whether or not non-guaranteed renewable accident and sickness insurance policies written before 1 December 1989, which relate benefit payments to periods of hospitalisation, continue until expiry is primarily one for decision by the insurance underwriter. I understand that these type of policies may be varied or revoked at the option of the insurer and therefore it would be open to the insurer to substitute the basis for payment of benefits from periods of hospitalisation to, for example, periods of disability or incapacity as certified by a medical practitioner. In this way, the insured's entitlements would not be degraded. From the Government's viewpoint, however, there is no question but that non-guaranteed renewable policies may continue until expiry date. </PARA>
<PARA> In any event, I would be surprised if there were in fact very many accident and sickness insurance policies that were not guaranteed renewable, since such policies would be of little longer term value to the subscriber. I enclose for your information brief summaries of a number of policies, all of which provide for guaranteed renewability. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of Regulation 29aaa is to exclude insurance policies from the definition of ``accident and sickness insurance business'' which relate payment of benefits to hospitalisation periods. This means that the intention of the legislation, whereby only registered health benefits organisations may conduct health insurance business as defined and then only within a community rated environment, is clear. The making of regulations excluding certain kinds of business from the definition of ``accident and sickness insurance business'' is expressly provided for in paragraph 67 (4) (b) and Regulation 29aaa fits squarely within that provision. </PARA>
<PARA> In our view, the period of two months advance notice of the regulation was sufficient to allow insurers to consider variations to existing and consequently future policies. The regulation should not result in any loss of business or gap in insurers' livelihood, but this would obviously depend on the ability of individual insurers to respond in a timely manner. Moreover, removal of the ability to limit accident and sickness insurance benefits to days in hospital, when accident and sickness invariably does not begin or end at the hospital door, could well lead to the development of policies more closely aligned to their stated intentions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department does not have details of either the number of policies or persons covered and such information is not available through the office of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. However, the number of policies or persons covered is not the real issue. </PARA>
<PARA> On your last query, it was not considered that amendment of section 67 of the National Health Act 1953 would be appropriate, since the regulation making mechanism to exclude certain types of insurance business from the definition of ``accident and sickness insurance business'' was provided for in paragraph 67 (4) (b). I cannot agree that Regulation 29aaa is of the same character as the 3 kinds of statutory instruments whose purpose would be more appropriately covered by legislation which would amend, in this case, the National Health Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Yours sincerely</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence and everybody else. When the Prime Minister was torpedoing Mr Beazley over the proposed move of the Royal Australian Navy to Jervis Bay did he say that the environmental impact statement (EIS) had itself thrown up `a number of serious environmental impacts in relation to the proposal'? Is it not a fact that chapter 19 of the study done by Sinclair, Knight and Partners Pty Ltd-that is, the environmental impact study-says that there could be some possible environmental impacts but studies of these impacts are not conclusive and they could be reduced by safeguards; that they do not warrant abandonment of the project; that there is no basis at this stage for rejecting the proposal in principle; and that it recommends further studies as a final decision does not need to be made for several years? Can the Minister say how the Prime Minister came to mislead the Australian people by misrepresentating what was in the EIS? Was it deliberate or by accident? Will the Minister now release the draft EIS in its entirety so that the extent of the Prime Minister's deception can be revealed, or does he intend officially to delete or censor chapter 19 and confine his selective handing out of this and other relevant documents only to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, not to the Parliament or the people?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not take down every detail of that question but I hope I can do it justice. Firstly, I do not intend to censor anything and that is certainly not the intention of anyone in the Government. I do not have section 19 of the Sinclair, Knight draft with me, so I cannot confirm that it says exactly what the honourable senator says, but I will take his word for it and assume that it does. It has never been the case that what is wrong with this EIS, and indeed what was wrong with the proposal to move the whole fleet to Jervis Bay, is necessarily what is in the draft EIS. A part of our concern is with what is not in it. If one goes back to the expression of concerns that my Department gave to the Department of Defence on this issue, it related to the fact that a whole host of items were simply not adequately covered in the draft, or were not covered at all. We were very concerned about that. I pointed out some months ago that I thought there were grave difficulties with this EIS, and because my Department has pointed that out over time it should not have come as any great shock that the Prime Minister announced the decision he did the other day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the draft EIS is concerned, and its publication, I indicated in the Senate last week that the Government would be looking again at its terms of reference because we are proceeding with an environmental impact study into the move of the armaments depot and whether or not it should take place. So it is a matter of looking at what the terms will be. Certainly there will be publication of something. I cannot undertake to tell the Senate now what document that would be. That would depend on negotiations that I have with Defence. As a general point it ought to be noted that the studies that have already been done in this EIS, particularly the marine studies in Jervis Bay, are significant studies. They certainly will not be wasted. Jervis Bay is one of the most beautiful spots on the coast and I would have thought that all the work done so far can be of use, to both the Commonwealth Government and those who live there, in working out the best way to protect the area in the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I wish to ask a supplementary question. I thank the Minister for his response and I note that he now says that the major problem was not the matters that were revealed by the EIS at all, but what was not in it. If the Prime Minister was referring to other studies, or comments other than those in the EIS, because after all the Prime Minister did say that the process had thrown up a number of serious environmental impacts-and now the Minister has conceded they were not in the EIS because the EIS says they are not sufficiently important anyway-what were these other impacts, where were they revealed and when and where will those documents that reveal these serious impacts be released to public scrutiny? Was the Prime Minister relying only on the assertions, not supported by any evidence whatsoever, that are contained in the two letters from the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories that the Minister leaked to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation as part of his anti-Beazley campaign and which I now seek leave to incorporate in Hansard?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>JERVIS BAY PRELIMINARY DRAFT EIS</PARA>
<PARA> I am writing in relation to this Department's examination of the above document.</PARA>
<PARA>2. The comments in and the report attached to this memorandum, combined with those set out in and attached to my previous memorandum of 2 June 1989 as well as some specific points in relation to Part C of the EIS which will be forwarded as soon as possible, comprise this Department's final comments on the adequacy of the above document in relation to the agreed EIS guidelines and its suitability for public review. In addition to the points emphasised in my previous memorandum, the following deficiencies in the preliminary draft EIS are highlighted:</PARA>
<PARA> The discussion of impacts is inadequately based, particularly in relation to biophysical impacts</PARA>
<PARA> in relation to marine ecology, for example, the EIS acknowledges that the marine environment of Jervis Bay is not well understood but nevertheless conclusions are drawn about the level and significance of impacts and no clear explanation is given for these conclusions;</PARA>
<PARA> Discussion of the potential impacts on Sydney needs to be drawn together to give a clear picture of the likely effects there;</PARA>
<PARA> The document does not clearly explain how the proposed safeguards/mitigation measures will work, or how effective they are expected to be;</PARA>
<PARA> There is no clear assessment of the relative significance of operational and environmental differences between options;</PARA>
<PARA> There is insufficient analysis of the costs and benefits of the proposals to support the conclusion that there will be an overall benefit to the community.</PARA>
<PARA>3. Consequently, we repeat the recommendation that the draft EIS not be published until the problems identified, in this memorandum plus ours of 2 June 1989 and the attachments to both, have been rectified.</PARA>

<PARA>JERVIS BAY PRELIMINARY DRAFTS EIS</PARA>
<PARA>I attach comments, from Allen &amp; Associates (JAA) and the Australian Heritage Commission (AHC), on the adequacy of the above document in relation to the agreed EIS guidelines and its suitability for public review. The comments from JAA only cover Part A of the preliminary draft. Our comments on the complete document will follow as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA>2. On the basis of the attached comments and this Department's evaluation of them, we consider that the preliminary draft EIS does not adequately meet the requirements of the Administrative Procedures under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 or the EIS guidelines, in its present form. Accordingly, it is recommended that the draft EIS not be published until the problems identified in the attachments to this memorandum have been rectified. In particular:</PARA>
<PARA>The structure chosen for the document (against this Department's advice) makes it unnecessarily difficult to follow critical arguments and find essential information. The Reconciliation does not materially assist either, as it contains gaps and inaccuracies</PARA>
<PARA>our recommendation is that the document be restructured to follow the format of the EIS guidelines, as previously recommended;</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 17 of the Preface states that `The primary requirement set out in the guidelines is for the proponent to assess the cumulative impact of naval relocation proposals on Jervis Bay . . .'. That statement is inaccurate and misrepresents the function of the EIS. The introduction to the EIS guidelines (Section A.2 paragraph 3) particularly emphasises that priority should be given to the questions of need and alternatives. Furthermore, this Department has constantly emphasised that the need and justification for the proposed relocation and the rigorous evaluation of alternative locations to Jervis Bay are of the utmost importance and that if these matters are not convincingly argued then the rest of the EIS will lack any credibility. This was of course also the concern of the former Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment, Mr Cohen, as expressed in his letter of 9 December 1986 to Mr Beazley;</PARA>
<PARA> Part A, which purports to justify the need for relocation and the choice of Jervis Bay, is seriously deficient</PARA>
<PARA> the way in which the objectives are presented is too narrow and pre-empts the evaluation process</PARA>
<PARA> arguments in the EIS supporting the need to relocate the armament complex away from Sydney appear to be critically dependent on use of the NATO principles. However, it is not at all clear: (a) why these principles were or had to be adopted and (b) precisely how they are more restrictive than the previous regulations-in terms of Navy's operations and public safety criteria</PARA>
<PARA> the arguments which attempt to justify moving the fleet base and other facilities are unconvincing, possibly because there is no present need for its relocation. If this is the case, it would be preferable for the draft EIS to acknowledge it, and present arguments for the need to identify a site for its future relocation, should that ever be necessary.</PARA>
<PARA> also, it is not explained how Garden Island Dockyard will be able to operate indefinitely when, presumably, it will be subject to the same constraints as the other naval facilities in Sydney Harbour. Paragraph 69 (Chapter 1) refers to HMAS Waterhen as one of the `constrained' facilities but there is no reference to the fact that this base is to be substantially upgraded (to cater for an increased number of vessels) and is intended to continue to operate ` . . . well into the next century' (Waterhen NOI) as a base for mine countermeasure vessels despite the alleged constraints. These issues should be fully explained in the draft EIS</PARA>
<PARA> the evaluation of alternative locations for both the armament complex and the fleet base is inadequate and superficial</PARA>
<PARA> the criteria used at each stage of the evaluation are poorly defined, inadequately justified and are heavily biased towards operational requirements (while there is no objection to sites being rejected if they are operationally unsuitable, sites which are environmentally unsuitable should also be rejected-in particular it appears that the use of different criteria at different stages of the evaluation and the inadequate level of detail provided at each stage has prevented this)</PARA>
<PARA> the level of detail of the discussion of alternative sites within Jervis Bay is inadequate for that purpose, but is appropriate for the evaluation of alternative general locations (i.e. the choice between Jervis Bay, Twofold Bay, Port Stephens etc), for which the existing level of detail is inadequate</PARA>
<PARA> the level of detail of the discussion of environmental impacts of development of preferred sites is inadequate for that purpose, but is appropriate for the evaluation of alternative specific sites at whatever general location is chosen.</PARA>

I would not call that smearing. The EIS processes certainly pointed up potential impacts on marine habitats, changes to water currents and changes to water quality. I do not think it is possible to dispute that some of these factors-in particular, the loss of marine habitats on adjacent shorelines-could not readily be mitigated. We have also seen in the EIS plenty of examples of potential hazards such as spills. Accidental spills and increased soil erosion hazards are always a problem. There were quite a number of problems. Given the spectacularly clear water that exists in the Bay, the factors that I have just identified are very important. They might not be important to Senator Michael Baume but that does not mean they are not important-it probably confirms my view that they are.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen press reports of the decisions referred to by Senator McKiernan, including some letters to the editor of a newspaper over the signature of Jim Crawley, the Executive Director of the Marriage Guidance Council of Western Australia. One of those letters included the incredible allegation or prophecy as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> WA soon won't have any counselling services under your Government's-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Federal government's-</PARA>
<PARA>present policies.</PARA>
<PARA>That is typical of the exaggeration that has accompanied what is a very difficult situation in providing funds for an important service in our community.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that there have been no cut- backs in funding to the Council during the period in office of the Hawke Labor Government. On the contrary, grants to the Council increased by 104.4 per cent during the past seven years-a 34.5 per cent increase in real terms, consistent with the overall increase of 36.8 per cent in real terms to all agencies for the same period. During the equivalent period of seven Liberal Budgets, all agencies received a real increase of only 4 per cent, and the grant to the Council actually decreased in real terms by 6.8 per cent. Those figures show a vivid contrast which, in fairness, ought to have formed part of the propaganda campaign mounted by Mr Crawley.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;His allegations of funding cuts by the Federal Government are not borne out, as the figures I quoted earlier clearly show. Mr Crawley has been unwilling to accept or understand the realities of funding for this very important area of government policy. Senator Chaney says that Mr Crawley has not talked about cuts. He stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Western Australia soon won't have any counselling services under your Government's present policies.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that that could be the case only if there were severe cuts in Federal Government funding for marriage guidance counselling in Western Australia, and that is simply not the case. The case is that the Council received a marriage counselling grant for 1989-90 of $685,600-a 7.31 per cent increase on the 1988-89 grant and just under 9 per cent of the total marriage counselling budget. In addition, the Council received a grant of $20,000 to establish a new family mediation service, and a marriage education grant of $9,600.</PARA>
<PARA> The Council's increased income from fees for service has enabled the agency to decrease its dependence on Government grants from 94.9 per cent in 1982-83, to 61 per cent, which was the average for all funded agencies last year. The Council's very high level of annual growth-18.3 per cent real growth per annum-was maintained in the past two years by deficit budgeting. The agency now recognises that it cannot sustain a level of growth greater than that supported by the 34 per cent growth in Government grants, and has had to restrict its expansion.</PARA>
<PARA> An amount of $30,000 for Mandurah was included in the Council's current grant, a level sufficient to maintain that service until its funding can be re-examined next year. The Council opened the Midland service on its own initiative in April, fully aware that there was a risk it could not be funded in the current Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> The problems of the agency are exacerbated by an overall movement by marriage counselling services towards employing full time professional staff, rather than lay or sessional staff. I am sympathetic to the agency's need to take hard decisions, particularly its decision to dismiss sessional counsellors in order to produce a balanced budget. However, the Council has been considering this move for some years to reduce loss of its counsellors to better paid full-time professional positions. I do not believe that the present campaign waged by Mr Crawley either does justice to the very real support, particularly of the present Attorney-General, to marriage guidance counselling throughout Australia, or deals sufficiently with what is an Australian-wide phenomenon, namely, that there is a move to more professional full-time staff away from the lay and even volunteer staff that were for many years the backbone of many of these agencies. It is a difficult move because it means the loss of staff who have dedicated much of their lives to achieving recognition of marriage counselling as a profession. But as one moves from well intentioned persons to full professionals with a great deal of expertise in this field of human relations, then it is inevitable that the sort of restructuring undertaken by the marriage guidance service in Western Australia will continue.</PARA>

<PARA>Dear Senator Chaney,</PARA>
<PARA>I have to write to tell you that the Marriage Guidance Council has been forced to make major cuts to its marriage counselling services. These cuts are due to Commonwealth funding this financial year being $174,000 less than the amount the Council had indicated to the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department as being the amount necessary to maintain its present level of services.</PARA>
<PARA> A number of staff members who have been made redundant have indicated that they will write to their Federal M.P.; this letter is to brief you about the situation.</PARA>
<PARA> The Council can only reduce its expenditure by reducing staffing; and any reduction in counselling staff results in a corresponding reduction of income from counselling fees.</PARA>
<PARA> To achieve a balanced budget in 1989-90, the Council has had to:</PARA>
<PARA>close two counselling centres in Mandurah and Midland;</PARA>
<PARA>retrench its entire team of 25 part-time counsellors;</PARA>
<PARA>retrench three part-time administrative staff.</PARA>
<PARA>These measures, which will reduce the Council's marriage counselling capacity from 12,500 to 7,800 counselling interviews per year (i.e. by some 40 per cent), will enable the Council to operate within its available income for the first time for many years. Had this action not been taken, the Council would have accumulated a deficit in excess of $160,000 by the end of this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA> The action has not been taken lightly; an independent financial consultant's advice was obtained to ensure that no other alternative was being overlooked.</PARA>
<PARA> The consequences are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>enormous waiting lists will develop-in fact the Council's waiting lists will be closed for some months to come-meaning that many hundreds of couples will not get the counselling they seek;</PARA>
<PARA>25 counsellors, some of whom have been with the Council for many years, who have in many instances paid for their own training as marriage counsellors, and who have been employed for years at exploitative salary levels are now redundant; their talent and their commitment to the community is lost.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government's ``saving'' of $160,000 on the funding of this organisation this year will result in an increased payment by the Australian taxpayer of at least $1,000,000-and probably twice that amount. This is in addition to the human suffering caused by broken marriage and family relationships that could have been avoided.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also pertinent to recall that marital breakdown is the second major cause of child poverty in Australia, and is a major causative factor in youth homelessness.</PARA>
<PARA> As this Council has pointed out repeatedly over recent years-backed up by the National Marriage Guidance Council of Australia-the present approach to funding of marriage counselling is completely inadequate. A telephone check this morning indicated that all constituent organisations of the National Marriage Guidance Council of Australia are building up deficits and/or reducing services. Additional funding in recent years for marriage counselling has been spread widely and thinly, presumably for political purposes, rather than being used to address the fundamental problems.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to finish with one example, which is a telling one.</PARA>
<PARA> Base-grade counsellors in the WA Family Court are paid on a salary scale $36,618 to $40,554 p.a. This compares with a salary for base-grade counsellors in this organisation of $21,547 to $29,858. That this Council has been able to maintain its level of service in recent years is due to the dedication of its staff; but we have now, sadly, reached the end of the road.</PARA>

<PARA>STATEMENT ON FINANCIAL SITUATION</PARA>
<PARA>For some years the Council has been attempting to maintain, and even to increase, the volume of marriage counselling undertaken, and to do so on an inadequate funding base.</PARA>
<PARA> Despite the temporary lull brought about by the introduction of fees for counselling, the problem of attempting to do more with our income than is in reality possible remains. Each year the financial deficit the Council has to juggle grows bigger.</PARA>
<PARA> For the present financial year, the Council indicated to the Commonwealth Government that it would need an increase in grant of some $170,000 to maintain its existing services (including the Bunbury Centre, to which we were committed).</PARA>
<PARA> An increase in grant of the size requested has not been forthcoming, and it has become apparent over the last three weeks that we face a considerable financial crisis in the form of a deficit of $161,000 on our operating budget. Even this figure is misleading because it is arrived at after cutting corners-for example, not paying the 3% occupational superannuation we are morally obliged to pay, not making provision for long service leave or depreciation, etc.</PARA>
<PARA> The Management Committee, mindful of this situation, requested me to prepare a `balanced budget' on at least a cash basis-this is, a budget that would not show a deficit of income over expenditure even though items like long service leave and depreciation would not be provided for. In making this request, two other factors that are likely to affect the Council over the next two years or so were also taken into account. First, the general economic situation and high interest rates, which would make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the Council to cope with a large overdraft. Second, there are serious moves afoot for the Council to be covered by an industrial award-and the likely conditions of an award would precipitate a crisis for the Council given the corners we have been cutting in some areas, notably the basis on which we pay sessional counsellors.</PARA>
<PARA> At a meeting last night, the Executive Committee of the Council adopted a final budget for the year which does not allow for a deficit.</PARA>
<PARA> The consequences of this budget are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) The Midland and Mandurah Centres will close for the rest of this financial year, with effect from 23 December. The premises will be retained until we know the level of Commonwealth funding for 1990/91.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) No sessional counsellors will be employed after the end of 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Counselling interns may continue their training up to the point of accreditation if they wish.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Staff counsellors at Midland and Mandurah will be offered the option of working at West Perth and Fremantle respectively.</PARA>
<PARA> (v) The staffing of reception at West Perth will be reorganised to achieve cost savings.</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) The West Perth and Fremantle Centres will be open only two nights per week from 1 January 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> I deeply regret having to make these cuts to our services. Not least because people's jobs and livelihoods are affected. They are, however, inevitable: we have gone as far as we can for as long as we can trying to manage our service on a totally inadequate funding base.</PARA>
<PARA> Individual letters will be sent to all staff members personally affected.</PARA>
<PARA> A meeting for all staff has been called for 5.15 p.m. tomorrow, Thursday 30 November, so that I can explain matters in more detail and answer any questions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories aware that the United Nations General Assembly called for special regional follow-up conferences to the World Commission's Report Our Common Future with a view to a global conference in 1992? Has the Minister initiated any conferences or meetings in our region? Is he aware that four topics have been identified for these regional conferences: firstly, the economics of sustainability; secondly, awareness raising and public participation; thirdly, sustainable energy use; and, fourthly, sustainable industrial activity? Finally, what action has he taken in each of those areas, especially in the important matter of awareness raising and public participation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am aware of the United Nations General Assembly's call for those regional conferences. As far as initiating conferences or meetings in our region is concerned, I think it could be said that, if I wanted to, I could attend one a week around the world at the moment on those questions. There are a great many meetings but I do have some other things to do. I have actively encouraged Australian participation at meetings, even where I have not been able to attend. Attendances at regional conferences have included: the Fourth South Pacific Conference on Nature Conservation of Protected Areas in Vanuatu, the theme of which conference was to look at the role of protected areas in sustaining Pacific island countries; and the Asia Pacific Consultative Meeting on Conservation and Critical Ecosystems and Economic Development held in Bangkok, under the auspices of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will be attending the Globe '90 conference in Canada in March 1990-God and an election willing. That is about global opportunities for business. I am a member of the board of that conference. It will focus on the global environmental industry challenges and the opportunities with special emphasis on Asia and the Pacific. That is a particularly important one. The Senate would be aware that I was at The Hague meeting in November which was focusing on the dangers we face as a result of global warming and climate change. The highlight of that conference was the acknowledgment that substantial additional resources would have to be provided to implement action in developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia will be hosting the eighteenth session of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources in November 1990. I think I am making a joint announcement with the State Premier on the exact place of that today but as it has not come out yet I do not think I will steal the thunder of the Premier involved. The Assembly will be approving the World Conservation Strategy Mark II which deals with sustainable development and will probably be the most significant conference on that issue to be held in 1990. We will also be playing a leading role in the development of an international convention for the protection of biological diversity. One realises that the Brundtland report specifically referred to that. We are also looking at hosting a conference of plenipotentiaries if member governments of the United Nations agree on that convention. I do not think an announcement on that, however, would be forthcoming until the new year. As Senator Coulter can see, we have been pretty well represented at all of the conferences, in their various forms, that have dealt with sustainable development. They are not all a result of the United Nations' call, but they are a result of the growing awareness amongst the world community that ecologically sustainable development is a global issue.</PARA>
<PARA> In question three I was asked whether I am aware of the topics identified for regional conferences. The answer to that question is yes. In response to question four, as the Minister who was responsible for environment at the time the Brundtland report first hit the headlines, I think in terms of raising public awareness I have done as much as anyone can do. Last week I did a bit more. For the last year or so, sustainable development, as a term, has been constantly referred to in the media. I think the Prime Minister's statement probably put it into some focus for Australia. As Senator Coulter would be aware, in a series of industry councils over the next 12 months we will be attempting to define a proper definition of it in the Australian context.</PARA>

The only conference I have been to was the one which was held in The Hague. I will be going to the one which is to be held in Canada. I wish I had been to the others, but I have not. What I said was that I ensured Australian representation at the other conferences. I would not want Senator Coulter to think that I had been overseas all that long. As far as NGO's are concerned, we try to include representatives of NGOs on delegations wherever possible. I do not have any more money in my portfolio, however, to fund representatives of NGOs attending any more conferences. I have made them understand that, in the course of the next 12 months, there just will not be funds available for that. Nonetheless. I think my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and other departments which will be represented will do a more than adequate job in representing Australia's interests and those of NGOs which will be consulted about Australia's position at those major conferences prior to our departure for them.</PARA></TALK.START>

Is the Minister aware that all of the athletes selected in the team of 85 have a qualifying performance considered good enough to place them in the finals at the Auckland Commonwealth Games? Is the Minister aware that the decision to deny the 15 young Australian athletes an opportunity to represent Australia in the Games is solely the result of a bureaucratic dispute being fought out by sporting officials?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen a report in today's Sydney Morning Herald stating that environmental groups have decided not to be part of the consultative committee that I have established to advise the Government on what action it should take in view of reports that are imminent on various aspects of forest management and environmental concerns in the south-eastern forests of New South Wales. However, it is unfortunate that, like the occasion when SEFA released its so-called peace plan, SEFA has not approached me with any reasons why it made this decision. Therefore, it is not competent for me to advise at first-hand what its reasons might be, although I do note a press report by one of its spokespersons that, in view of the loss by SEFA of a court application against the New South Wales Forestry Commission, we should now take action under the corporations power to achieve an outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The concern I have is that this week we are expecting a report from a team led by Professor Bryant Richards that has been studying the flora and fauna properties of the south-eastern forests. It will be an interim report. It appears likely that the team will require more time to complete its full report, and this Government has not put any restraint on its time. It believes that the report should be consistent with the scientific integrity of the reporting team. However, the interim report will be a significant step towards getting in place all the information base necessary to make a long range plan for the management of the south-eastern forests.</PARA>
<PARA> Early next year we will receive a report from consultants on the viability of a flitchmill process in the south-east, and a further report into the better use of small and round wood-material that would normally be left or burnt on the forest floor. So we are looking at efficient use of the basic resource. As well, early next year we will get a report on proposals for further value adding to the sawmill process. I also announced just a few weeks ago a consultancy which will look at the promotion of plantations in order to generate an alternative resource in the south-east of New South Wales with a specific focus on encouraging farmers to use part of their marginal farmland as a plantation resource for industry on a guaranteed buy-back basis as well as broad acre plantation cropping for the south-east.</PARA>
<PARA> It was intended that all those reports would come to a regional consultative committee, comprising unions, loggers, woodchippers, environmental groups, the community, the New South Wales Forestry Commission and the Federal Government. That regional committee would not be a voting but an advising body. Its purpose would be to consider those reports and make recommendations to the Government on how best to manage the entire resource from both an environmental and a forestry point of view. It now appears from what is being said in the media that we are being requested to abort that process and proceed to a new process. I think it is appropriate for me to say that we want the consultative council process to be the means by which we decide what the long range managerial plans for that area should be and how we meet the environmental aspirations of the community as well as protect the future livelihood of the up to 700 families whose futures depend on a viable timber industry in that area.</PARA>
<PARA> More importantly, perhaps, we also want to see a timber industry that efficiently utilises the resource at its disposal and develops a whole industry plan, which means that we stop exporting the cheapest commodity-woodchips-and start exporting more value added commodities to earn more on our trade account and provide a future career for people in the sawmill industry.</PARA>
<PARA> So I am disappointed that SEFA has taken this action. I hope it will see the value in joining the consultative council and will recognise that we are in a period of transition from the old, wasteful way of managing that forest to an efficient way of managing it. In fact, we are now doing many of the things that SEFA put up in its peace plan and in a way which meets environmental objectives as well.</PARA>

For example, we have the Ranger mine there, and OSS's principal responsibility has been to monitor it. Senator Tambling has certainly not heard me, in the Senate or outside, urge that it be closed. All I have indicated is that, in the light of the values associated with the catchment of the South Alligator River and, for example, Justice Fox's report, we felt there was a need for that area in particular not to have exploration and mining in it. It does take place in the region now, although not in the South Alligator catchment, at Ranger, and the Government has been more than happy with the efforts of the company to protect the environment. I think it can be said that in all the years of monitoring that operation we have yet to see one serious environmental problem.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw. Basically, we set out to find out where the poverty was and to set measures of adequacy in terms of our responses to it. A number of times I have actually gone through our record in that area in terms of addressing the issues. A number of times I have drawn attention to the fact that the measures we have put in place are helping the 1.2 million children in low income areas as a result of the family allowance supplement proposal. I have also traversed a number of times the measures of adequacy in terms of government funds in this area, including family allowance, rent relief and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have also canvassed the other part of the question that Senator Watson raised and which goes very much to the heart of the report released last week. Adequacy measures and benchmarks are appropriate. They are the ones we have set. The Government has always recognised, and does recognise now, that the social infrastructure involved also needs to be addressed. In respect of social infrastructure, we are talking about aspects of Government policy that have been affected. We are talking about employment growth and the fact that 1.6 million Australians now have jobs that they never had in 1983. We are talking about assistance in public housing, we are talking about rent assistance to low income families and we are talking about education. In respect of education, we are talking about the highest retention rates in schools in Australia's history.</PARA>
<PARA> We are not addressing this problem in a superficial way. So, the Government has addressed structural inequality. Only last week the Prime Minister wrote to the State Premiers outlining a most comprehensive plan to approach structural inequality in our society and the question of poverty. As I said, in terms of income support, we have a very proud record. It is one which meets the pledge made by the Prime Minister in terms of attaining benchmarks.</PARA>
<PARA> It has been recognised both by the mission which Senator Watson mentioned and by others that the question of poverty is one that goes wider than income support. I have already mentioned those social justice measures. Let me refer to Bishop Hollingworth of the Brotherhood of St Laurence. In May this year he said that there needs to be a major thrust in the broad area of community services to buttress and strengthen family life. He basically said that the question is one that has to be faced by society and by all tiers of government. Last week the Prime Minister announced a further initiative in the attack on child poverty. He announced that he is seeking the cooperation and commitment of all Premiers to the improvement of a range of services available to children and families with children. In that respect, we have proposed, in cooperation with the States, the establishment of a ministerial committee on services for children. That committee will have the job of examining the range of services provided by Commonwealth, State and Territory governments. It will also have the task of focusing on family support services, such as some of those I mentioned earlier-health, education, community and legal services-identifying geographical and other weaknesses and examining better ways of coordinating these services. So, not only have we achieved benchmarks but also the issue is very much on the Government's agenda and needs to be responded to a constructive and comprehensive way.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me end on this note: I do not want to go back through the record of Senator Watson's party. I do not want to go back to the days when Senator Chaney was the Minister for Social Security, during which he presided over 150,000 children who, in one year, fell below adequacy lines. I do not want to go into great detail about the fact that in seven years of government the coalition saw fit to help children from low income families only once by giving them $2.50. Nor do I want to go--</PARA>

I might interpolate that I see that Senator Chaney is going through some sort of paroxysm of pain. These statistics may well offend him. They are statistics of the mining industry's record of achievement. It seems that his main criticism is about downstream processing. That is a point that I will come to and address in a minute. The Agriculture and Resources Quarterly for September, released by the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics, reveals that growth in exports in the mineral resources sector is expected to be 15 per cent in 1989-90, taking it to a total of $23.5 billion. That is hardly a scenario in which it can be contended that this industry is in deep trouble.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has also introduced the Resources Assessment Commission (RAC) to make independent inquiries into resource competing claims. The RAC is backed by the Mining Industry Council but, I might add, was opposed about this time last year by the Opposition. Nonetheless, it is a way in which we can resolve the competing claims between environmental objectives and the need for mining access to land of high prospectivity. These achievements have to be seen in the context of our micro-economic reform agenda. Reforms have already taken place.

The objectives of that reform will be achieved. But they will not be achieved by the confrontation and humiliation of ordinary Australians that Senator Stone holds as the banner for his type of reform. It will be achieved in a way in which that reform can be undertaken successfully and remain enduring. As well as that, we have a continual program for micro-economic reform with the Industry Commission which has been set up with a comprehensive set of references, including investigations into energy generation and distribution, mining and minerals processing, construction costs of major plants and availability of capital for Australian industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion, given that one of the criticisms related to the cost of energy, Australia in terms of petrol prices is ranked fourth lowest in the Western world behind the United States of America, Canada and Turkey. Our Diesel fuel is in the low price bracket on the world stage and our coal-fired power stations provide the third lowest electricity tariffs for industry in the developed world after Norway and Canada. This has enabled the mining industry to generate these profits which I hope will be reinvested in further development. It will also enable the mining industry to be poised to move into downstream processing in a much bigger way so that we can realise in total our micro-reform agenda.</PARA>

It is also true that the Vietnamese Government has instituted improvements in the field of human rights in recent years. The Australian Government conducts a dialogue with the Vietnamese authorities on individual human rights cases which has brought positive results. United Nations bodies, for example the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, other international organisations, such as the International Migration Organisation, and various non-government organisations are already active in Vietnam, monitoring the return of persons who have been determined as not being refugees and others who have returned voluntarily.

Despite Mr Beazley's advice to the Association that, following a 1987 departmental review, there were no grounds for altering the conditions governing awards of the Vietnam medal and the advice of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel of the unchanged findings of a further review in 1989, representations have continued to be received. The situation has been exacerbated by the number of unsubstantiated claims made by the Association which have, nevertheless, been carefully and extensively researched.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Thursday Senator Haines asked me a series of questions on logging the National Estate forests in Victoria. To date there is no trigger for Commonwealth involvement in the Victorian Government's decision to harvest sawlogs in National Estate forests in East Gippsland. The Victorian Minister for Conservation, Forests and Lands, Kay Setches, is being cooperative and has freely made available information to Senator Cook's Department and to my Department. We are working with Senator Cook on this and I am also in direct contact with Minister Setches. She clearly wants the National Estate to be protected wherever possible. Her Department has produced a detailed public position paper which places in context National Estate issues in relation to their forest planning management processes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Victoria has a very good record on national park creation. About 80 per cent of East Gippsland National Estate forests are now protected in national parks and conservation reserves. According to Minister Setches, the logging is a necessary part of the Victorian timber industry strategy which aims to reduce harvesting levels to a sustainable yield. The yield in East Gippsland has been reduced from 350,000 cubic metres per year to 179,000 cubic metres. This strategy is a genuine attempt to maintain jobs in the timber industry, to maximise the economic return from each tree that is cut, and to protect the environmental values of the forests.</PARA>

<PARA> This discussion is not about the past nor is it about the present, and it will not involve any denigration of any kind of those things that the present Government has done. Those things have been done and those initiatives have been taken, generally with the support of the Opposition parties. The benefits which were enjoyed by certain groups have had the backing of all sections of the Parliament. So we do not object to them and we will not criticise them. But, to the extent that the Australian Labor Party's approach has been limited to certain categories of people, it has ignored the needs of others. Labor's values have been reflected in the policies. They have been reflected in the ways its policies have worked, whom they have supported, for whom they have made things easier, whom they have not supported, and for whom they have made things a whole lot more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not contest that some people have been assisted. It would be churlish to do so. It is unnecessary to do so. But equally it would be churlish and improper for Government speakers to deny some other parts of the current picture, especially in relation to measures of continuing need yet to be addressed by the Government. First, it would be churlish of Government speakers to deny that some groups have not had much benefit from Labor Government initiatives. Second, it would be churlish of Government speakers to deny that many Government policies, including major economic, fiscal and monetary policies, have contributed in a major way to the difficulties that families face and to the hardships with which they are attempting to cope. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleagues will deal with particular parts of the picture and will indicate where our approach will be better. Senator Messner will concentrate on the economic burdens on families and children-on the direct contributions to family hardship, to poverty, to need, and to failure to cope which have been produced by the Labor Government's actions. Senator Messner will indicate where our action plan will assist these groups. Senator Reid will discuss some aspects of family dissolution. She will discuss some of the ways in which family breakdown contributes to child poverty and to difficulties for families. She will outline some of the financial burdens which have been aggravated under Labor, which themselves have contributed so much to family stress and breakdown. She will indicate how these burdens will be eased when the Liberal and National Economic Action Plan is put into effect. I will discuss some aspects of our plans to provide new opportunities and options for the care of children. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently I had the privilege of opening a new private child-care facility-a facility at which most places had already been taken. The audience contained many parents-men and women-whose children used that centre. The women, incidentally, were part of the new Australia. They represented a significant change that has occurred, a change which now sees many Australian women working in paid employment as a matter of deliberate choice. As Senator Amanda Vanstone has pointed out, we Liberals recognise, we accept and we would support-just as we would wish to support all other women who make different choices-the women who have made this move and this choice to continue in paid employment. We also support those Australian women who choose to stay at home to care for young children. </PARA>
<PARA> Be that as it may-I come back to the child-care facility-I saw many men and women there who were in paid employment. For families with both parents in paid employment, or for single-parent families with that parent in paid employment, child-care is not an optional extra, it is not a luxury; it is a necessity. The parents with whom I spoke, the young people I know, all wish to have children but because of the economic problems that couples face many have had to put off having a family in order to secure their economic future. Many parents have also found that they must both continue to work after their children are born. They have found that they need two incomes if they are to own a home and maintain their families as they were taught to do by their own parents. As I say, they do wish to have and to care for children. They do wish to discharge their role as citizens and as caring family members. They care very much about their children and about the welfare of those children. They need access to child-care in one or more of its forms to enable them to discharge this duty. It was apparent when I opened this particular private child-care facility that for many of those parents child-care had generally not been available where they needed it and when they needed it, and had not been available in the form in which they needed it. In part that is because the Labor Government is not interested in them and in the kind of child-care facilities they are seeking. This means that it has been more difficult for them to be good parents; more difficult for them to organise their families as they wish to do; more difficult for these men and women to make for their own children the best provision within the situation in which so many of them work, and are forced to work because of economic policies which are not of their making but for which they have to suffer. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been the same for many years. I remember 20 or so years ago that my wife and I had young children and we required access to child-care from time to time. It was wonderful if we could turn to our families-to our extended family-to get access to that child-care, but we could not always do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Newman says, mobile families cannot. Child-care is an absolute necessity. But in those days, a generation ago, it was devilishly difficult for us to find access to child-care for our children. Our friends at that time who were looking for full day care, long day care, occasional care, after school care or vacation care found the task almost impossible. The problem has not disappeared; it has not disappeared in a generation or two generations. Parents know this, and this is why so many parents have given so much support and have welcomed so much the program and proposals of the Opposition. The coalition's plans in the area of child support are to build upon, to extend, to complement what the Labor Government has done-not to abandon it, not to replace it, but to augment what already exists. We intend to redress some of the unnecessary imbalances which have characterised the approach of Labor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because this Government has concentrated on poorer families and on single parent families-as I said, most of the measures have had our support-we intend to offer new programs, new support, and new opportunities to classes of parents and their children who have been largely ignored in the past seven years. We will do this in several ways. First, we will introduce a system of tax rebates for families caring for children. We will do this to improve what is called technically in that trade, horizontal equity. We will do it to make life easier for those families. The rebates will be available to all families with at least one taxpaying parent. The amounts are quite significant: for the first child under 13 it will be $250 a year; for slightly older children, $350 a year; and for the second and each subsequent child it will be $200 a year for the younger and $300 a year for the older child. These amounts are contained in a table taken from the Opposition's Economic Action Plan. I seek leave to have this table incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The cost of that initiative, that is, the initiative to introduce a series of tax rebates for families caring for children, will be $1,000m each year. That is a very significant contribution to the support of Australian families. Secondly, under the Liberal-National Party's Economic Action Plan we will adjust the arrangements for the dependent spouse rebate to ease the benefit withdrawal where extra income is earned and we will raise the threshold below which the full rebate can be claimed. Thirdly, and this brings me back to the question of child-care, we will make expenditure on child-care tax rebatable-$20 per week for the first child under five years of age and $10 per week for each other child-for families with at least one parent in paid employment. We have made it rebatable because that is a fairer system of tax expenditure; fairer than making it tax deductable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was just a couple of years ago that women were taking the Australian Taxation Commissioner to court to try to obtain some kind of tax relief for the child-care expenses they were incurring for the services they required. Labor opposed these women in the courts as recently as a few years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of our policy we now propose to make expenditure on child-care tax rebatable. This new Liberal-National Party approach will leave maximum power and maximum autonomy in the hands of the parents. It will provide more flexibility. It will allow the development of more child-care places than at present. It will confer more benefit on many children than is presently possible. It does not matter whether a little child's parents are poor or wealthy; what is needed are the very best services here, now, where and when they are required. Parents will decide, in the light of their own circumstances, where they wish to enrol their children and where they wish to incur costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the proposed new subsidy will cover only part of the costs; parents will still have to find some part. But the arrangement we have proposed will improve markedly what exists today. It will be a major improvement for parents with young families. It is a declaration of coalition values and priorities. It complements rather than replaces the existing arrangements. It will create many winners amongst Australian parents and children. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that when we were able to get some feedback from the public about our Economic Action Plan, this feature was one of the most appreciated and most welcome. I remind the Senate, too, that the Government cannot, after almost seven years in office, try to beguile us with a litany of what it might be willing to do in the future. The Government has had seven years to do all these things. Nor can the Government address and expect us to be impressed by what it has done-with our support-in the past. That will not wash, either. The Government has to recognise something that it often ignores: being active and busy is not the same as being effective. We know that the Government has been busy but we argue that that has not translated from busyness into effectiveness. It is not just a question of how many places are being provided; it is also a question of how many places are still needed, of how many places have not been provided for parents wanting child-care. It is a question of how many parents cannot find full day care, long day care, occasional care, after school care or vacation care for their children now, here, today, in Australia. There are many such parents. Again, that is why our program and our promises have been so welcome and so well received. </PARA>
<PARA> We call the extent of the lack of child-care places in Australia at the present time the level of unmet need. The Department of Community Services and Health referred to this when it presented its papers to Senate Estimates Committee F. In its explanatory notes for the recent estimates examination, the Department referred to unmet need-it talked about it as `notional demand'. In those explanatory notes, the Department of Community Services and Health actually gave figures to show just how great the notional demand is in relation to the amount of child-care actually available. The Department, through the Office of Child Care, which is the official government agency in this functional area, said some pretty disturbing things. The Department told the Estimates Committee that the figures contained in the explanatory notes meant that the present provision meets only 20 per cent of the present demand for occasional care-only one place in five; that the present provision meets only 25 per cent of the demand for outside school hours care-only one place in four and that the present provision provides less than half of the demand for work-related long day care-less than one place in two. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures are pretty dramatic. They show the levels of unmet need for child-care in Australia today. We submit to the Senate and to the people of Australia that our program will help fill some of that gap and provide some of those places. The figures provided by the Department of Community Services and Health are contained in a table which I have shown the Minister and which I now seek leave to incorporate in the Hansard record. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are asked to acknowledge and pay credence to the Opposition's Economic Action Plan. The words of the matter of public importance being discussed are:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The extra opportunities for families and children under the Liberal/National Parties' Economic Action Plan. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a plan which already has been discredited, with a shelf life, I suggest, shorter than Andrew Peacock's attention span. It is a plan which, in its genesis, was misguided; in its detail was wrong; on the major economic issues, was silent; and which is riddled with inequity. It is nothing more than a superficial attempt at policy development which reflects a lack of understanding of the major issues of the day by the Opposition leadership. </PARA>
<PARA> It is supposed to be an economic action plan, but let us look at where it takes us. What does it do about fiscal policy? What does it do about monetary policy or wages policy? In the words of Mr Peacock, `Who is to know'. On the major economic issues of the day we are offered a leap into darkness. It is promoted as an economic policy but it does not address economic issues. It is promoted as a tax policy but it contains no tax policy detail. As to interest rates, who is to know? Who do we believe? Do we believe Senator Stone and Dr Hewson, who say that there will be no change, do we believe Mr Peacock, who cannot believe himself or do we believe the body of economists who have no doubt that the Opposition's leap into darkness will lead to higher interest rates?</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's policy is one that, in any sense of the word, cannot withstand analysis. It is superficial, a policy whose shelf life-like that of the Leader of the Opposition-has already expired. Do members on the other side not wish that they had stuck with John Howard? It is a policy which essentially is one of catchy themes as a substitute for hard, serious policy analysis. It is based on market research, not on social research. Were the policy to be based on social research, we would have a degree of targeting which this Government has followed over the last seven years and one endorsed by Senator Chaney when he was Minister for Social Security in 1982 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we should be approaching the problem in a way that tries to define the people who are in the difficult situation and directing assistance to them rather than universally increasing levels of assistance at very much greatly increased cost to all taxpayers . . . </PARA>
<PARA>An endorsement of the targeted policy that we have now. There is not even the pretence from the Opposition that it is serious about eliminating poverty in the community. Instead, there is a policy-a plan-designed to con the electorate, based on generalities, and there are reasons for this. </PARA>
<PARA> We shudder to think what else may be included on the Opposition agenda. On 25 July 1989 the Sydney Morning Herald published the contents of a secret letter from Mr Peacock to his shadow Ministers asking for a list of policies that should not be highlighted in the election campaign. There will be two sets of policies. There will be the sugar coating that Senator Peter Baume has talked about, the public list based on market research; and there will also be the secret hit list-a secret hit list which has already been leaked and exposed-based on ideological reaction to progressive social policy. Senator Peter Baume, having had experience of secret hit lists in recent days, should understand what they mean to the electorate. For instance, the people of New South Wales know full well what happens when a government with a secret hit list is elected. The action plan will be used as an excuse-as it was in New South Wales-to put social policy and social justice back 100 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's policy is also unfair. When we are looking at assistance to families, and an overall policy, we have to look at who pays. We have to make sure that people pay according to their capacity to pay. In this respect the action plan which we have been asked to endorse will impact on families most unfairly. Under the Fraser-Howard-Hewson regime, tax avoidance and evasion were the only significant growth areas. Avoiders and evaders became rich while tens of thousands of families were thrown into poverty. We remember the figures-billions of dollars were involved in avoidance and evasion-and we know who paid then; it was the ordinary Australian taxpayer. It took a Labor Government to seriously tackle the integrity of the tax system. Central to that was the capital gains tax which took away the options for the wealthy to convert their taxable income into tax-free capital gains. The first figures on capital gains tax showed that less than one per cent of all taxpayers paid capital gains tax. In the corporate sector, only 2 per cent of taxable companies paid capital gains tax, and 85 per cent of all receipts came from fewer than 500 companies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition plans to abolish the capital gains tax and replace it with a tax which will distort investment in this country and be most unfair. As the Treasurer (Mr Keating) pointed out to highlight the inequity of the tax, it would involve a gift to the Liberal Party President, Mr John Elliott, worth millions of dollars. That is a saving against his contingent liability for capital gains tax. Who is to pay? The benefit-the tax subsidy-that Mr Elliott will get out of the Economic Action Plan of the Australian Liberal Party will be the equivalent of a full year's pension for over 1,500 age pensioners. If the Opposition is concerned about families and ordinary Australians, it should realise that they are the ones who will pay. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of who is to pay, there is nothing more central to services for families-and Senator Peter Baume made this point-than medical services. We do not know who will pay in that respect, because Mr Peacock does not know. Not only does he say he does not know but he also refuses to spell out the principles which would guide the Opposition. What we do know is that we would be driven by the same bloody-minded ideological commitment to return us to those stop-start health policies of the Fraser-Howard years when no-one knew what was going on. </PARA>
<PARA> Health services are important, and wages are vitally important. Not only does the Leader of the Opposition not know what his wages policy means, but Opposition members when asked about the matter quite recently also time and again could give no commitment to ensuring the maintenance of the Industrial Relations Commission or minimum wages. In this very important and direct area of income to families the Opposition proposes to dispense with the protection which families receive through the industrial relations system. What will happen? There will be what there was in the mid-1970s. Very few will get a lot out of the system. Many more of the lower paid work force, and those with little labour market power, will see their incomes decimated in real terms. That is what happened during the Opposition's last term of office, and that is what it is offering again. </PARA>
<PARA> I leave the macro-economic policy for a moment and turn to what the Opposition promises in the very definite and closed area of family policy. I put aside for the moment the three important basic social measures of Medicare health services, wages policy and the fact that, under this Government, the most important family income support measure-employment-has been a major success and achievement of this Government in that 1.6 million jobs have been created during its term of office, and are still being created. What is the Opposition talking about in terms of social policy? The Opposition is very free with its talk of opportunities for families, but does it have any real idea of what that means? A true concern for families, as I said, includes the areas of health care, jobs, child-care and schools. A true concern for Australian families means a concern for a range of services and opportunities which only an integrated social policy can deliver. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's action plan is silent on all these things. At the heart of the action plan is a series of tax giveaways based on market research. We are not getting that range of services and an adequate and comprehensive social policy based on good reason from the Opposition. The direction the Opposition will take is pretty clear. For an analysis of that direction we should refer to a statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in 1987. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is just impossible with any credibility, to proclaim concern for families and then proceed to smash every part of the social infrastructure that determines the welfare of Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet that is a measure of our opponent's hypocrisy. That statement was true then and is even truer now because there is exactly the same hypocrisy in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> For instance, the Opposition plans to discard on the scrap heap of special benefit thousands of unemployed families and their children. They will be condemned to poverty. We should not be surprised at that approach because, in every year of the last Government, 50,000 children of beneficiary families were added to the scrap heap. In its last year that Government added another 150,000. With that record, and more of the same promised, how can Senator Peter Baume talk with any degree of credibility of opportunities for families?</PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned jobs. Jobs are crucial for family opportunity, yet the Opposition of Senator Peter Baume left Australia in 1983 with an unemployment rate of 10.9 per cent. This Government has reduced that by creating 1.6 million new jobs. More importantly, it has also reduced the number of long term unemployed-those who would, once again, deliberately be consigned to the scrap heap under the Opposition's policy. The number of such unemployed was reduced from 108,000 in 1983 to 47,000 in 1989. If we are really looking at areas of need and high poverty concentration, we are looking at the long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> One cannot underestimate the importance to people in the community of health care and health services. Access to cheap, quality health care is crucial to creating opportunities for Australian families as we move into the 1990s. Yet, as I have said, there has not been a concise or clear statement or costing from the Opposition on its health care policy. We know-and Mr Shack, the Opposition spokesperson on health has made it clear in private meetings-that the Opposition wants to abolish Medicare. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition's record on health is quite well known. In 1983, low income families paid 7 per cent of their incomes on health care. Under Labor most low income families get health care free through Medicare, and the maximum that is necessary to be paid is 1.25 per cent. It is worth noting, when we address this issue, when we address what the Opposition is creating to be a problem for itself, that over 71 per cent of Australians now support the continuation of Medicare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of basic essential family policies, the Opposition cannot turn away from education. What would be of greater concern to Australian families than educating their children? Retention rates here are a great benchmark and indicator of this Government's performance in this area. We have increased year 12 retention rates to 61 per cent. When we came into government they were a lamentable 36 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> These issues-jobs, health care, and education-are just some of the issues which must be addressed if the Opposition is to come in here and tell us about the adequacy of its Economic Action Plan, and that it wants to improve the opportunities available to Australian families. Yet on this whole range of issues it is very silent. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not mentioned the extra 58,000 child-care places this Government has introduced; I have not mentioned the 3.7 million children who are attracting family allowance or the 1.2 million children who are attracting family allowance supplement or its equivalent; I have not mentioned the spread of superannuation, with all that it means for family savings and retirement; and I have not mentioned this Government's further commitment to new tertiary education places, to new child-care places, to more public housing and to better health. On those crucial social policy issues, the Opposition is once again silent. It is quite apparent that it is concealing an agenda which does not promise families opportunities. It basically promises devastation of the infrastructure that is there to assist families in this country. This is clear from its record and the little it has said today. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at another part of the Opposition's record in this area, before I go on to an objective assessment of its Economic Action Plan. Basically, what it was able to do in the past was to ensure that people remained dependent on social services. In 1975 there were 30.9 people dependent on income support for every 100 people in the work force. In seven short years it managed to raise that to 43.7-43.7 mothers, fathers and children trapped in the social security system. This Government has reduced it back to 1975 levels-to 33.6 per cent. That is hundreds of thousands of families who have been lifted from dependence on social security. The consequent effect of that, of course, is benefits to the taxpayer as well. Let us bear that in mind. But the Opposition comes in here and puts this particular proposal. Suffice it to say that the heartland of the Opposition's support is the rural sector, or so it claims. Let us go to the Country Women's Association of Australia. </PARA>

The Country Women's Association makes a very clear and definite point and one that Senator Puplick should let permeate through his thick outer shell. A report in the Australian Rural Times of 19 October says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>`It seems more money will go to the more successful families and less money will go to the less successful families,' said Mrs Jean Tom, the national CWA president. `Just because children live in rural areas doesn't mean to say that they shouldn't have the same opportunities as city children.'</PARA>
<PARA>It recognises the gross inequity in the Opposition's proposals. It recognises that support needs to be targeted. It recognises that the Government's approach has been quite fundamentally important in that area. We have targeted areas of need and we have addressed them. We have done that in a rational comprehensive way and in a scientific way, based on social policy, not on market research. </PARA>
<PARA> In reality what we have on the other side is an Opposition desperate to win the middle ground out there. There is a constant search for popular sentiment, even though, as we see almost daily, popular sentiments do not necessarily fit into serious policy making. No-one within the Opposition is doing the serious work designed to meet the social and economic challenges of the 1990s and the next century. That is what distinguishes this Government from the Opposition. That is why the community will say two things to us: `We cannot trust Andrew Peacock to deliver' and `We think Senator Chaney is going to be disastrous'-and they probably would say not much better about Senator Puplick. The Opposition knows that and that is why it is quiet. It made the mistake and dumped Howard. It replaced him with a bloke whose motto is not `Read my lips' but `Follow my eyelashes'-and they flutter all over the place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance before us today proclaims:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The extra opportunities for families and children under the Liberal/National Parties' Economic Action Plan. </PARA>
<PARA>The most important thing to do in this debate is to ask the question, and attempt to answer it: Which families and which children? We will need to look at the plan and attempt to answer that question. In essence, much of the comment at the time and subsequent to the announcement of the Liberal and National parties' Economic Action Plan does answer that question. One comment which has recently been published in the news magazine of the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) is that of its president, Merle Mitchell, saying that the plan is `unfair, hypocritical and economically damaging', and that it:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . represents a blatant attack on the most disadvantaged people in Australia: the jobless, recently-arrived immigrants, aborigines, students, and sick and disabled people. </PARA>
<PARA>I would add to that, people living in the country. Obviously, a family with children who do not come into any of those categories might have some positive things to say in this debate, but that is quite a long list. The ACOSS analysis goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the . . . proposals are badly targeted. They will fundamentally damage both the economy and the victims of our current economic difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said, a good deal of the comment at the time was similar, in essence, to that kind of approach. Indeed, upon announcement of the package, Ross Dunn made this point in the Australian Financial Review:</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Peacock, shifted the Liberal Party significantly to the right yesterday by asking the most disadvantaged groups to suffer the burden of a decision to focus more government spending on families. </PARA>
<PARA> Those with the least ability to pay-</PARA>
<PARA>we have the same list-</PARA>
<PARA>the unemployed, Aborigines, migrants and students-will be targeted for big spending cuts to boost the incomes of families, under the Opposition's tax policy. </PARA>
<PARA>When Ross Dunn mentions families, obviously he is not including the families of those groups of disadvantaged. So the only conclusion can be that if the matter of public importance read, `The opportunities for families not in disadvantaged categories', maybe we could see some under this plan. </PARA>
<PARA> To look at the taxation measures in the Economic Action Plan, I will deal first with those taxation measures which relate to payments for families directed towards children, where we have the child tax rebate and child-care rebate. Obviously, there are positive things which Senator Peter Baume has said and which can be said for a rebate system of this kind. The concern centred around this part of the package has been that the rebates certainly do not cover full costs and that the whole program, as outlined in the statement, actually looks to be costing more than the entire children's services program currently in place and there are no guarantees of extra child-care places. Clearly, certainly to the Australian Democrats, the provision of extra child-care places must be a priority. It is clearly not a priority under this scheme. It is really not so much what is there as what is not there that is of concern for those of us who are interested in increased provision of child-care in our community. That ought to be all of us, because full utilisation of the working capacity of all members of our community is essential if we are to improve our economic status. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, we need to look at who benefits from this particular package in terms of child-care. That point was made again by Kenneth Davidson. On 13 October in the Age he pointed out that the people who would benefit from that package of child payments would be mainly middle and upper two-income families. He then went on to comment on the capital gains tax changes, which I will move on to now. As has been well canvassed since the Economic Action Plan came forward, the Opposition is walking away from the current capital gains tax and putting forward a speculative gains tax option at a cost of $450m. This option will reduce the taxes paid by the wealthiest Australians, making capital gains tax optional. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the figures in respect of what has been happening with capital gains tax in its current form, we can see who benefits from this measure: 76 per cent of capital gains tax revenue in 1987-88 came from taxpayers with taxable incomes above $35,000 per annum; 62.3 per cent in that year came from taxpayers with taxable incomes of over $50,000; 28.3 per cent of that revenue came from taxpayers with incomes exceeding $500,000; and 14.4 per cent came from people in receipt of total income in excess of $2m. Clearly, this is a tax which will advantage the best off in our community. The windfall of $450m will go virtually exclusively into the pockets of the richest members of society-not least John Elliott-who in the past, and again in the future, it seems, under a Liberal-National government, have been notorious in escaping their taxation responsibilities. Under this Government, this group, which has escaped from the disadvantages of wage restraint and has been part of the economic picture in the time of the Hawke Government, has benefited greatly from the property and share boom and has received the biggest marginal tax rate cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> All of this has come about under the Hawke socialist-according to the Opposition-Government. Clearly, the Opposition's capital gains proposal would direct even more of the private sector energy into arranging and rearranging affairs to avoid the speculative gains tax, reopen the tax avoidance industry which flourished under the Liberals in the 1970s, distort investment decisions by encouraging investors to hold assets for tax reasons, and push more funds into longer term investments, such as property, at the expense of the share market and the investment that we need for active industrial and technological development in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at aspects of the Economic Action Plan involving spending-most of them really involve saving-we will see that unemployment is a major and significant item. I am a little bit surprised in that I have decided to quote Greg Sheridan on this matter. On 21 October in the Australian he made some interesting comments with which I concur. He says that the policy of removing the unemployment benefit from the long-term unemployed after nine months-there are a whole range of extra stringencies, in what is already a very stringent system-is confusing. I think this aspect of the confusion is worth putting on the record. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> After nine months your dole-</PARA>
<PARA>a term that I would prefer not to use myself, but I am quoting from Greg Sheridan-</PARA>
<PARA>will be stopped unless you qualify for a special benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> To qualify for the special benefit you will be interviewed by welfare bureaucrats. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet to qualify for the dole now you need regular interviews with bureaucrats.</PARA>
<PARA>That has been implemented very heavily by this Government with its work test. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Where is the change?</PARA>
<PARA> Many of the long-term unemployed are in bad shape. </PARA>
<PARA> If these interviews are to involve intensive counselling, much less any rehabilitation or retraining, they will involve still more bureaucrats, an increase in the welfare state, and will save no money. </PARA>
<PARA> If the policy does not involve such extensive counselling I would say it would survive about three or four weeks of implementation. </PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on to picture a genuinely needy family-someone forced into beggary, prostitution or crime-appearing on the Jana Wendt or Derryn Hinch programs and showing up what is a heartless and actually unworkable Opposition policy. We also had a similar scenario put to us on 22 October by Paul Lyneham in the Melbourne Sunday Sun in which he pointed out the devastating effects that the Opposition's proposals would have on the long-term unemployed. He saw the development of a whole new group of people in our community. In a very ironic way he suggested that this might actually turn into a tourist attraction with the reinstitution of beggars in the streets. In particular, he said that tourists could be taken out into the country to see colourful swaggies sitting around the campfire. He also suggested that it would be even more colourful if we could teach the long-term unemployed a little of Banjo Paterson. In his article Paul Lyneham stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Suddenly a drive into the country could be a whole new experience for the kids. It would also be a winner with Japanese tourists, especially if some of the long-termers could learn a bit of Banjo Paterson. </PARA>
<PARA>These are scenarios that really do not bear thinking about; nevertheless, they certainly are there. The Australian Council of Social Service, in its analysis, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Of the $1,500 million the Coalition aims to save by cutting off unemployment benefits after nine months, $835 million is budgeted to transfer 50 to 60 per cent of long-term beneficiaries onto Special Benefit. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> There remains, of course, a crucial question: what happens to the 40 to 50 per cent of jobless people and their families who will be denied Special Benefit?</PARA>
<PARA>That is the crucial question. In their own way, the other commentators are asking that question. </PARA>
<PARA> In the brief time I have available, I think I should address the question of Aboriginal families. Obviously they are the most disadvantaged people in our community. I think it is interesting that the Opposition spokesman on Aboriginal Affairs, Warwick Smith, has expressed concern about the depth of the cuts in this area which is one of the hardest hit sectors in this field. Mr Smith was quoted in the Melbourne Age on 13 October as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> My challenge is to improve administration and remove duplication . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We know what that means-Aboriginal affairs will go back to the States. We know what that means for Aboriginal people. This would be against the wishes of the Australian people who have said that this is a national responsibility. In the Sydney Morning Herald of 14 October the Chairman of the New South Wales Aboriginal Legal Service, Mr Paul Coe, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . cuts in funds for Aboriginal legal services would result in greater numbers of Aborigines in jails because many would not get proper representation. </PARA>
<PARA>We know that there is a major problem with Aborigines in gaols. The policy is described as `genocidal' by Ms Linda Burney of the New South Wales Aboriginal Education Consultative Group. So we must be concerned about that area. </PARA>
<PARA> What about students? The Government's proposal is being taken that one step further. As is pointed out by Kenneth Davidson in the Age of 13 October, the revenue that will be generated by this version of charging for basic tertiary education will be used to fund the promised concessions to middle and upper income groups rather than expand tertiary education funding. At least we can say that this Government has targeted its charges in respect of students into increased education funding. I think that is something that this Opposition should be condemned for. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned that country people will be disadvantaged by the Opposition's Economic Action Plan. The disturbing thing is that we have an economic package from the Opposition which does nothing to address the question of interest rates. I did not think I would be standing here quoting Ross Gittins but he talks about the unstated part of the policy which is continuing high interest rates. All Australian families have to be concerned and are concerned about that. Under the Opposition's policies, rural families will have their basic services to rural areas cut. Their country link will go as will their rural counselling service, access to education and training programs. It is very difficult to see which families will actually be advantaged by this policy. As Greg Sheridan said, it is a policy of mirrors. It is a policy which has many costs built into it. Obviously, those costs will have to be met by further cuts in basic community and public services-health, education and housing. As this policy gets more exposure I am sure Australians will become more concerned about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I strongly support my distinguished colleague Senator Peter Baume in his constructive proposal for discussion today. Having just heard the Australian Labor Party and Australian Democrats speakers issue forth a barrowful of red herrings, we know that there is absolutely no substance to their argument because red herrings always throw such a smell across the trail. Those speakers have no points to debate today. As Senator Peter Baume has made abundantly clear, this policy, the Economic Action Plan, is directed to the future. It is about the future direction of policies in this country to strengthen, not weaken, Australian families. It offers security, not uncertainty. It is to support families, not to condemn them to lives of dismay leading to and bordering on despair. It is hope for the future that drives this country; it always has. In the practical world of Australian politics, that can be spelled out as one thing, which is quite clear in our policy-a fair go for all. Governments of whatever shade should direct their policies to that central theme to develop a future in which proper and relevant standards are encouraged and in which the common interest we all have in the success of the fair go is the cornerstone for a stronger, more prosperous Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us dwell on the point of common interest for a moment. Many people mistake the concern for families, expressed by many on this side of the Senate, as being nostalgic, old-hat and, cynically, even irrelevant to the needs of the people. Nothing can be further from the truth. Looking back to judge from where Australian families have come, we see that our policy is not a longing for a return to the good old days; it is to determine the extent of the changes that have occurred in Australian society since those days in order to recognise the needs for the society in the future, to spell out positive policies which address these needs, and to look forward to the increasing challenges to families as we enter the last decade of the twentieth century. This is to take the realistic view of the less than ideal state of Australian society. This is positive political action, capable of being undertaken by any government, even the Hawke Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take some examples of the future needs of Australian families resulting from a likely lower level of home ownership caused by high building costs and astronomical interest rates leading to a higher dependence on government supported housing: the decline in the role of the family and the extended family in caring for the aged; the pressures for income support in retirement-there we have the answer of reducing superannuation tax; a need for child-care caused by the economically driven entry of more women into the work force. We will offer tax deductions for child-care. In the past all these needs have been met by some degree of family support by government. But what of the future if that support is not so freely given by families because of pressures of divorce, separation, lack of security in housing or the need for two incomes in a family to pay the bills each week, to pay the taxes and the interest on the mortgage? They are the vital questions that go to the heart of our society, to the basis of political debate in this country, and to the rising scepticism of Australians towards Australian politicians and political processes. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the questions that the Liberal and National parties answer in their policies, particularly in the Future Directions statement which was put forward by John Howard last year, and more recently in the Economic Action Plan put forward by Andrew Peacock. These are the positive steps which a future Liberal and National party government must and will take. The commitment is there to meet the needs of the future based on a hard-headed assessment of the state of present day Australian society. Our policy statements are not mere rhetoric like the turgid recitation of Government initiated benefits in the past and such as we are surely going to hear later from Government speakers. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not deny that the Government has taken some action to assist families. We are not making cheap political points on the adequacy or otherwise of those actions. We have supported those in the past and we will support them in the future. That is not our complaint. Our point is very different. These recent government measures are redistributive measures. What the Australia of the future needs is direction to solve the cause of economic hardship. This is a contemporary imperative because of the crisis in the economic circumstances of families. </PARA>
<PARA> How has this crisis manifested itself in cold, hard statistical facts? Firstly, in the period of this Government since 1984-85, real disposable incomes have fallen sharply for all income units dependent on one income. The falls have ranged from $30.61 for single people to $47.85 for couples with four children. In the same period, the percentage of couples with children with both partners employed has risen from 46 per cent to 55 per cent of families. This growth in two-earner families indicates that some families have offset the falls in disposable income by increasing their participation in the work force. Thus, the recently rising trend of more women in the work force is economically driven; it is not necessarily a matter of free choice by spouses. So when the Government claims higher work force participation for women, in many cases this can be seen as `have to' rather than `want to'. This is where the Liberal and National parties' Economic Action Plan with child-care, children's rebates and dependent spouse rebates offers direct help now to alleviate these crises for battling families. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, housing has become significantly less affordable for families in the 17 years since 1972 of which Labor has governed for 10 long years. The Poverty Commission in 1972-73 found that 6.7 per cent of all income units then were below the poverty line after taking into account housing costs. But in 1985-86 under this Hawke Labor Government that figure doubled. This means that fewer people, particularly young people, can afford adequate housing than was the case 17 years ago. The reasons for higher housing costs have been well documented. We all know that it is associated with building costs caused by high regulation, especially in the labour market, and the obscene level of housing interest rates under the present Government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties' Economic Action Plan will address the crisis by attacking the causes such as the deregulation of the labour market and changes in work practices in Australian industry. We will introduce measures to help our export and import industries through the development of more competitive and efficient waterfront practices, better transport systems and the freeing up of the telecommunications industry. Finally, average income tax rates have risen under successive Labor governments. For instance, one-income families on average weekly earnings and with two children under 13 years of age have seen an increase of 6.9 per cent in their tax rate-that is an average tax rate-since 1976-77. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has not mentioned that, as Senator Peter Baume points out. Secondly, they have reduced household disposable income by substantial amounts-upwards of $50 per week-since 1985, particularly for one-income families with four children. Thirdly they have imposed higher and higher average rates of income tax on the average weekly earner. It is no wonder that families are battling in Australia today. It is no wonder that spouses are now entering the work force to a greater extent than ever before. It is not because of choice-although we do not deny the choice; that is very much a feature of our policies. Clearly, there is an economic imperative for people to enter the work force which is evident from the statistics I have cited. It is no wonder that people are looking for an alternative direction for the future. It is no wonder that people have received so warmly the Liberal and National parties' Economic Action Plan. This policy shows that the future direction for the Australian Government is to deal with this emerging crisis for families. That is why, at the first available opportunity, Australians will elect a new Liberal- National Party Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon the following matter of public importance is being debated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The extra opportunities for families and children under the Liberal/National Parties' Economic Action Plan. </PARA>
<PARA>In proposing this matter for debate, Senator Peter Baume has described that these extra opportunities are going to be provided on the basis of a very superficial package of taxation rebates. He went on to describe this as a declaration of the coalition's philosophy and priorities. If this is the case, I only say the coalition is suffering from being `pot-bound' or `root-bound'. If taxation rebates are the only response that the Opposition can find to the needs of Australian families, it is high time that the Opposition, to continue the analogy, had a thorough shaking out and repotting. The families that the Opposition is talking about, quite clearly, are probably least in need of the sorts of solutions that the Opposition believes it has found. </PARA>
<PARA> I quote from one of the many thoughtful journalists who are not fooled whatsoever by the Opposition response. Adele Horrin in the Sydney Morning Herald pointed out the inadequacies in the rebate system that the Opposition has cobbled together. She says:</PARA>
<PARA> Low income families who pay no tax due to unemployment, sickness or sole parenthood will not get a dollar extra from child tax rebates. The family allowance and family allowance supplement (of the Hawke Government) is a perfectly adequate system, since the Hawke Government indexed it, of channelling money to families in a fair way. Under Mr Peacock's tax rebate plans, the people at the bottom miss out while everyone else gains. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite Senator Messner indicating that the Opposition may have caught up with the fact that many families are in distress as a result of family dissolution and that a fairly large proportion of Australian families no longer fit the stereotype, the Opposition is still looking at Australian households as if the single income nuclear family were the stereotype. The families that the Opposition is talking about include very few students, Aboriginals, chronically ill and certainly, by definition, no single supporting parents. The Opposition has completely overlooked the fact that, in paying for this package of taxation rebates-and I believe we are looking at well over $1 billion-it is going to greatly disadvantage the long term unemployed, who, in many cases, are members of families. Even by quite a narrow definition, there are currently something like 40,000 long term-that is, for nine months or more-unemployment benefit recipients, about a quarter of the total, who have between them nearly 90,000 dependent children. They are the very families who are going to receive no assistance whatsoever from the Opposition's system of taxation rebates. </PARA>
<PARA> It has taken a long time for the Opposition to bring forth what it sees, apparently, as the solution to the need, for example, for children's services. I do not doubt the Opposition's sincerity for one second, but the Opposition's solution is extremely inadequate. Senator Peter Baume went into considerable detail about the unmet need, but he did not give any indication whatsoever how this unmet need was to be resolved. Certainly there are fewer occasional child-care places, out of school care places or long day care places than we would wish. It was not until 1972 that child-care even got a place on the political agenda. I can recall Mr Peacock, when he was Minister for Labour and National Service, introducing the outline of a child-care program just before the election at the end of 1972. Child-care was truly on the political agenda after the Whitlam Government came to power, it faltered under the Fraser Government and it has taken off again under Hawke. In 1983, we inherited 46,000 child-care places. By 1992, that figure will have increased by nearly 100,000 places, but it is clear that that is nowhere near enough. We have carefully crafted and funded plans to increase the number of child-care places in a way that will slowly but surely fulfil requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the coalition going to do? There are no details, and we can only infer that the Opposition is planning to see the number of places increase as a result of the greatly increased private for profit sector, which we know at this stage does not fulfil the requirements of people, certainly not those on low incomes. The Opposition's policy does not provide care for very young children, care for which there is an enormous demand. It certainly does not provide care for children with special needs, disabilities, language and behaviour problems, for children in low income communities and rural areas. Is Senator Peter Baume honestly saying that we should go the way of the 1950s and 1960s-encouraging the private nursing home sector, pouring government money into the private for profit sector, with very little control about where places will be provided, at what standard places will be provided and what needs they will fulfil? After many inquiries we have all the evidence in the world that this is not the way to go, not the way to fulfil community needs for child-care or anything else. </PARA>
<PARA> Tax rebates, which will cost an enormous amount-about five times what we are currently spending on our community child-care system-are an extremely inefficient way to try to redistribute this sort of money. It is a reduction, of course, in the amount of tax that a person has to pay. The rebate is the same regardless of the level of income, provided tax liability exceeds the value of the rebate. People on very low incomes, including those in part time work for which they receive less than $5,000 or $6,000 a year, will get no rebate. Assuming a rebate per family of $2,000 per year, a family receiving $19,000 per year and one receiving $50,000 per year would each receive $2,000 per year. This does not look like horizontal equity to me. It is better than tax deduction in terms of equity, but on many measures of fairness it would still remain inequitable. Would it be fair, for example, that a wealthy parent in a luxurious city apartment who could afford to advertise for a live-in nanny at a wage of $250 a week plus keep would get the same assistance from Mr Peacock as a struggling sole parent on $15,000 a year. There are many reasons why rebates are inequitable and inefficient as a way of assisting people who need some extra help with their families. We have taken a number of extremely important initiatives, and I am glad that most of the speakers on the opposite side have acknowledged that. Those are measures which will continue, which will expand, and which we have guaranteed to index. Where is the Opposition's guarantee of indexing anything at all, I ask Senator Peter Baume?</PARA>
<PARA> The disadvantages in rebates and other such options are many and varied, but I would like to get these on record. An intelligent debate is occurring at last, and I am glad to see that it is being encouraged. Firstly, if financial assistance is available only to families already using child-care and not to those outside trying to get in, it is not at all clear how the supply of child-care places will be improved. I am one of those people who are completely in the dark as to how that supply of child-care places is to be improved by the coalition's policies. We all agree that improvement is absolutely essential. Secondly, there is no guarantee that cash available through tax options will actually be spent on child-care. Certainly, it does not necessarily go to the caring parent, it goes to the earner in what the Opposition believes is a typical single income, nuclear family; nor is it evident that such a general benefit could provide sufficient financial support for less well off families, given the cost of child-care. Thirdly, these options could have an inflationary effect and push up the price of child-care, thereby negating any benefits which might accrue-one of the very real dangers of depending upon market forces for such an essential community service. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, rebates are open to abuse in so far as people using unpaid family arrangements may attempt to claim a benefit when no cost is actually incurred. Once again, this is a very real danger in the Opposition's suggestion of rebating expenditure on child-care. Fifthly, supply would be totally market driven and there would be no guarantee that the needs of disadvantaged groups would be met. That is, there is no needs-based planning, and I have already touched upon that. Sixthly, major disruptions would occur if the present service-based system of funding was fully or partially replaced by a tax option. As far as we know from the coalition's policies, this is its only response. Seventhly, a further consideration for any government would be the open-ended nature of taxation benefits. It would be very difficult to predict the costs and contain them to budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Women have been given a very high priority in all of our strategies. We have sought to broaden the choices available to women through the expansion of job opportunities and child-care. Amongst the many people who have been assisted by the wide range of policies are sole supporting parents. They do not seem to get much of a look in, in the coalition's policies those who are dependent or even partly dependent on social security. Is the jobs, employment, and training (JET) scheme one of the programs that the Opposition is planning to abolish? I note that Newstart and Skillshare are to be phased out. Through JET a substantial number of women are back into education or training, or into work. This has made substantial changes to the percentage of sole mothers who are employed. For the first time ever, in 1989 more than half of all sole mothers are employed: that is nearly 52 per cent, as against 39 per cent who were employed when we came to government in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> Until recently, only about 25 per cent of sole parent pensioners received any support from the other parent. Our child support scheme has been introduced to overcome this problem, and there are now 20,000 custodial parents receiving an average of $100 per month through our child support scheme. This makes a great difference to their disposable income, but it is an issue that, apparently, has been completely overlooked by the coalition in its concern for extra opportunities for families with children. By definition, of course, there are children in all of these families. The proportion of sole parent pensioners receiving child support has increased from 25 per cent to over 35 per cent in the relatively short period since June 1988 when this scheme started. Sole parents are increasingly independent. For women, generally, there are growing opportunities. Disposable household income is ever-increasing, as I made quite clear during a similar debate last week. Over the last six years there has been an annual increase of 3 per cent in household income. </PARA>
<PARA> I really think it is time we put to bed this notion of women being conscripted. The economic imperative is there for men and women. Men and women work to support themselves and their families. Under the Labor Government, they have had a great many more opportunities of obtaining work and maintaining their families in dignity. We will continue along the way we have started, with tried and true programs that we have set in place and are continuing to implement. We are maintaining our commitment to the families of Australia in a way that the coalition does not seem even to have grasped and apparently has no intention of extending. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we are discussing today is the policy of the Liberal and National parties, published as the Economic Action Plan, which will provide extra opportunities for families under a Liberal-National Party government. It has been disappointing that the trend of the debate has been for Labor Party speakers to talk about what Labor has done and about some of the things it thinks are wrong with our plan, without recognising that what we are saying is that we recognise what the Government has done under its policies; we also recognise that the promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) of no child living in poverty by 1990 cannot and will not be met in the next 13 days and that, in fact, in 1990 a lot of children will still be living in poverty. We are talking about what needs to be done in 1990 to see that families get an opportunity to get on with their lives in a way that they have not been able to do under years of Labor government. I recall Senator Giles mentioning the jobs, education and training (JET) scheme and child-care being one of the things advertised as being offered with the JET scheme. Only advice is offered under the JET scheme. To understand what we are talking about we need to get the facts straight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Bolkus talked about what Labor had done and the needs people have, and he referred to Medicare. I recall him saying that access to cheap, quality health care was needed. He said it was vital. I only wish it were true that we had cheap, quality health care in this country for those who need it. We need health care that is available for people who need it, which is not the case at the present time. We need only to ask those who have been sick and in need of health care whether or not Medicare has been provided. Just think of the number of times that we in this chamber over the last few years have discussed and debated the way the health care scheme has been cut back. One cannot get a lot under it any more. </PARA>
<PARA> I think all of us were disappointed that Senator Bolkus, having the portfolio he has, could do nothing more with our Economic Action Plan than talk about its being discredited or having wrong details. He used a number of what I would call hackneyed phrases to try to discredit it, but at no time did he actually discuss the detail; nor was he able actually to discredit the economic plan as it relates to providing for families in the 1990s. It was interesting that the Minister would not discuss the topic. Honourable senators might recall that at one stage he raised the question of who would pay under a Liberal Government. I laughed to myself. My reaction was, `Under Labor, who receives?-Kodak, the major banks, the airlines and the Waterside Workers Federation'. We know who receives under Labor. As each day passes and we get closer to the next general election more and more of the friends of Labor are receiving and, no doubt, will continue to do so. </PARA>

I will look at one aspect of children in poverty that has not yet been touched upon. It was raised in Question Time today when Senator Watson asked what the Prime Minister would do about it. Recently the Sydney City Mission stated that the number of homeless young people is double that of 10 years ago. Senator Bolkus tried to make his speech in an answer in Question Time today; he finally got the chance in this debate. We are talking about economic policies which have stifled the growth of our economy and we are talking about Liberal policies which will enable the economy to thrive so that those who are being thrust into poverty under Labor policies will have an opportunity to make the choices to run their families in the way that they wish.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the significant things under Labor is the added pressure placed on marriages because of Labor's economic policies and their consequences. Marriages are breaking down at an alarming rate. The divorce statistics have risen from 39,800 in 1985 to 41,007 in 1988. Of those divorces, 17,422 were of couples who had no children and 23,585 were of couples with children. It is those children that I am particularly concerned about. In addition to the single parent families that come about as a result of divorce, there are those which come about as a result of the death of a parent. The latest figures on family structures show that 8 per cent of household are made up of one parent families. The vast majority of those parents of course are women. They make up about 90 per cent of the 330,000 or so people receiving the sole parent benefit as at last June. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that family breakdown results in enormous economic and social costs. One can only wonder at a government which does not require more effort to be put into making marriages work when one considers the enormous costs of dealing with the marriages once they have failed. The amount of money that is put into marriage counselling, teaching people about some of the aspects of marriage and living together, is paltry when one really looks at the number of divorces. As the statistics show, the costs are borne by women and children. </PARA>
<PARA> The study by the Institute of Family Studies in 1985 showed that, at the time of separation, dependent women-that is, women dependent on their husbands' salaries-tended to have relatively young children and husbands with higher incomes compared with women who supplemented their husbands' incomes or had their own income. These more independent women had usually passed the state where the children were particularly in need of parental care and were facing the cost of older children. The study showed that two-thirds of the women who had been dependent or merely supplemented their husbands' incomes, three years after separation, had household incomes which put them barely within 20 per cent of the Henderson poverty line. They found it difficult to re-enter the work force. Very few had uninterrupted work histories. They had taken one or more breaks to have and raise their children. Men were, and are, much more likely to have furthered their education during the marriage. Often the husband had done so while the wife worked and supported him while he pursued his education prior to embarking upon having a family. A man's further education was more likely to have allowed him much greater career mobility than the wife. The report concluded that the time spent at home caring for children had substantially depreciated income earning potential. I do not think any of us would doubt that in the slightest. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost to women of performing the function of rearing children is realised in a very significant way at the time of a dissolution of a marriage. We then have a group of women with children to house, feed and clothe, with minimal opportunity to resume their education, to improve their qualifications or to gain employment. There are many disincentives in the system as it presently operates to their doing so. A women is frequently deterred from obtaining employment for fear of what will become of the children if they get sick or because she does not know when she will be able to get back on social security. Likewise with education. The disincentives that operate at present are enormous. As a consequence, many of these women and children are living in poverty. That cannot be denied. Certainly the Prime Minister cannot deny it and it will not change in the next 13 days. The numbers are increasing. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to that we have the number of homeless young Australians. Although one might be able to argue about the number, it is obvious that there are no fewer than about 25,000 young homeless Australians. That number comes from the report of Brian Burdekin. Many of these children have been forced, through circumstances, to leave their homes because of domestic violence, family breakdowns and a range of other causes. I want to refer to an article in the last December issue of Family Matters. It gave a very detailed analysis of the effect of marital disruption on children. One can only conclude that it does lead to more and more children being forced to live in poverty. One of the other conclusions in the article referred to was that women are more likely to suffer long-term economic consequences of separation and divorce as they are less likely to have paid employment. They are also more likely to have the expense and responsibility of bringing up the children. Children are more often in the custody of the mother. Therefore they too, along with her, suffer the consequence of the lowered income. </PARA>
<PARA> Many one parent families live in poverty. The conditions attached to the supporting benefit mean that extra income earned by single parents reduces their benefit to such an extent that it is just not worth trying to make the effort. That is the sort of thing we want to eliminate from the system. We want to make it worth while for families to try to get on and run their lives as they wish. People are forced into either undeclared income or devices of that kind which are not really acceptable or the way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> A 1987 study-it has been referred to and reported in Family Matters-showed that 55 per cent of all one parent families are in poverty and that single parent families have the lowest level of disposable income of any family type. One parent families are often housed in poorer areas of a city, in public housing or in private housing, in poor locations such as in industrial areas and near major roads, with limited places for children to play and with bans on pets. They no longer have the opportunity to establish a home because of the interest rates which we all know families have to bear at present. In recent times how many families have been forced to sell their homes and move to other accommodation? Think of the disruption of changing schools, making new friends-all the sorts of things which really make it more difficult for a child to get on in the world and to have the basis of pursuing education. </PARA>
<PARA> Today Government members talked about the increased number of people who are completing secondary education and taking up tertiary education. That may be so, but we are talking about the many thousands who are homeless and who are still living in poverty. Our Economic Action Plan deals with that and will deal with it. We are not happy just to leave things as they are. We want to get on with finding solutions to the problems of this country. Many people have been interviewed and there are a myriad of reports. From the information available, there is no doubt that, as a consequence of living in poverty, more young people stay away from school or are truant. More young people are also involved in vandalism or can get caught up with drug abuse, carnal knowledge, stealing, prostitution and driving offences. What hope then do they have of getting on with their lives?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government and the people of Australia cannot ignore these facts. The Prime Minister ignored this legacy in 1987 when he made his outrageous claim that no child would live in poverty by 1990. We are not denying that certain things have been done-I say that for the third time. But we want to reach a situation which is markedly better than the one at present. The Labor Party's policies have contributed to making life more difficult for many families-two parents or one parent. They have much less left from their incomes because of the taxation policies of this Government-and think of the effect of inflation, especially on those families in receipt of pensions. Interest rates are so high that many are forced into poverty. People who really believed that they were looking after their families in a proper fashion have not been able to buy clothes and food in the way they have in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> The Child Support Agency has been mentioned. I spoke about that last week. The Agency is failing many families because of the way in which it is operating. The Minister at the time said that it could be looked into. Parents who are dependent on maintenance to look after their children may wait almost six weeks for payments where there are not any problems or difficulties. The Agency is holding money which it chooses not to pass over for some reason that it decides is relevant. The Child Support Agency is undoubtedly responsible for seeing that some parents who were not paying maintenance before are now paying it. We supported its establishment. However, the Government needs to look very closely at the way it is operating because it, too, is contributing to the number of children who are living in poverty. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`The extra opportunities for families and children under the Liberal/National Parties' Economic Action Plan' is the subject matter for today's matter of public importance. It probably will be the subject matter of many debates in the run-up to next year's election, which probably-and I have no inside information-will be held in May. I suppose that this would give people on the opposite side of the chamber somewhat of an advantage because they are used to having elections in May. A couple of very important elections were held in May of this year when they again changed the leadership of their parties. That change was supposed to unite them but, unfortunately, it has not done so. An element of the fractured, divided nature of the Opposition even came to the fore in this afternoon's debate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does Senator Reid want to see the notes? `Future directions', of course, was the theme of the previous Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, in his supposedly early run-in to what was then expected to be an early election. We awaited it in the hope that perhaps incentivation would also be mentioned but unfortunately that did not happen. But again that is a very large word and would cause some problems in the memory blocks of some of those opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This has been a very interesting and worthwhile debate. In the run-in to the next election the people of Australia will have to make clear choices as to whom they want to govern this nation as it enters the 1990s and approaches the twenty-first century. This debate has exposed many of the weaknesses that are undoubtedly in the Opposition's Economic Action Plan, a plan which has some merit in some areas but which in others will be a disaster for many Australians. We have heard a lot of talk about families. While `family' may have been defined earlier in this debate or previous debates, I am still not clear what it means in the minds of Opposition senators. Does it consider a family to be two parents-husband and wife-and 2.2 children or is it one parent and seven children? Is it two parents and no children? What is the family? Back in Perth in my home last year we had a Christmas dinner attended by something like 16 people from three separate families with three different names. Is that a family? What exactly is a family? This is something that must be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> The plans proposed by the Opposition probably have advantages to some families and family members. However, how much is in the plan for a black or Aboriginal family? The Economic Action Plan proposes that $100m will be slashed from Aboriginal affairs. Will that make the most disadvantaged sector of our community any better off in the lead-in to the twenty-first century? I doubt it very much. </PARA>
<PARA> The Economic Action Plan also proposes cuts in a range of other areas. I think Senator Powell in her contribution to the debate this afternoon mentioned country people particularly. When I first read the Economic Action Plan I was disappointed when I looked at the range of proposed cuts for people in the country regions of our great nation. Of course, Western Australia, occupying one-third of the nation, holds a great number of those people. Some $4.6m will be cut from present programs such as the country link program, the rural education access program, the marketing skills program, the innovative rural education and training programs, the rural women's access grants program and the rural community-based education programs. </PARA>
<PARA> I am particularly disappointed because the Economic Action Plan has been proposed as a coalition plan. It has been advanced in this chamber and in other places that the National Party of Australia, formerly the Country Party of Australia, represents the rural sector of Australia. It may hold to that view but it does not carry out that function particularly well. I need no convincing on that, of course; it is country people themselves who need to be convinced. Fortunately for them, I do not believe that they will be inflicted with these proposed cuts because I do not think the people of Australia will put this Government out of office next year and put in the alternative. However, in saying that about country people I recognise that, while the Australian Labor Party holds more country and rural seats than any other individual political party, generally speaking the Labor Party does not go to the country for its base support. Perhaps that is a misunderstanding and it may be one of the consequences of the tyranny of distance that we have to put up with in this vast and wonderful land. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area I want to talk about in my brief contribution to this debate this afternoon concerns the family groups that are going to be massively disadvantaged if this Economic Action Plan ever comes into being. Following the launch of the plan, with all the fanfare that went with it, we had very explicit comments from senior Opposition spokespersons about what the plan means. It means different things to different people in the Opposition, as it does to people in the community and to our media commentators. One area where we have seen a fairly unified approach from the coalition is in its attitude towards those on unemployment benefit. There is an acceptance within the Opposition's plan, as printed and distributed, that half of those 160,000-odd unfortunates in our community who are now registered as unemployed are actually bludgers. Eighty thousand people out of 160,000 would be targeted to save government expenditure. They would be targeted because some of them have been long term unemployed. The unemployment benefit would no longer be available to those who have been out of a job for more than nine months. These people could apply for special benefits under the plan, but the document shows that half of them would not get that. The figures supplied by the Department of Social Security show that 45 per cent of those people are over 45 with children and families. What are they going to do? Who is going to look after them should the economic rationalists of the Opposition ever get into government?</PARA>
<PARA> What would the prospects be for a 45-year-old worker-I can certainly empathise with a 45-year-old-who loses his job after 20 years with the same company? The Oppositions proposes that this person should use up all annual and long service leave entitlements before becoming eligible for the unemployment benefits. It may therefore be six months or more before that person would receive the first payment. After nine months without any assistance to re-enter the labour market he would be labelled a bludger by the Opposition. If he had any savings left he would not be eligible for a special benefit. His retirement savings would be eaten away before the normal retirement age. There would be no prospect of a higher age pension under the conservatives' proposed aged pension plan. These are some of the people we have to think about. I am certain that all senators, in their role as representatives of the people, come into contact with those people out in the community. Those people come into our offices seeking assistance. They are the people who are unfortunate enough not to be in the right place at the right time when job offers are being made. They are not there at the right time to get them. What is the Opposition going to do for those people? Until that question is answered the Opposition's Economic Action Plan as it stands at the moment will have no credibility. In the Age newspaper on 13 October of this year Kenneth Davidson wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>The most generous thing that can be said about the coalition package is that it is a crude attempt to increase savings by redistributing money from the poor who can't save to the rich who can. </PARA>
<PARA>I think the Opposition's policy is probably about more than that. It needs to address the question of what happens to those people with families, the long term unemployed who are not eligible for special benefits. What is the Opposition going to do with them? Is it going to leave them to rot, as happens in some other countries around the world? Is Australia going to be reduced to that?</PARA>
<PARA> This is a good debate. I will not use up all the material that I have this afternoon in the last two minutes available to me. I am looking forward to the election campaign, be it in May or whenever. I am certainly looking forward to advancing the arguments and hopefully exposing the grab for wealth, power and influence that this policy represents. We have a responsibility as elected representatives of the people to represent all of the people. We do spar across the chamber and in the community from time to time on different things. Unfortunately, from time to time we get a bit too personal and we use individuals' names to highlight the claims that one side is making over the other. We have done a bit of that this afternoon. I have tried to avoid it. I will resist the temptation to conclude my remarks by making reference to what some media commentators have labelled this proposal as. Certainly it is an economic plan that will suit some but I think the vast majority of Australians, the working class-if a working class is left in Australia-will be severely damaged in the long term should this Economic Action Plan ever be brought to fruition and implementation. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The 1988-89 annual report for the Prices Surveillance Authority brings to attention once again the question of the PSA's recommendations dealing with the price of books in Australia. Page 45 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>An inquiry into book prices was also announced at the end of the year. The PSA was concerned with restrictions on competition in the book industry where overseas publishers operated exclusive book distributorships in Australia under the protection of the importation provisions of the Copyright Act 1968. As a result of these restrictions the full benefits of the rise in the $A may not have flowed through to consumers. </PARA>
<PARA>As you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, the recommendation of the Prices Surveillance Authority was for an end to this British exclusive monopoly of book sales in Australia. On a number of occasions the Government has indicated that it appeared to be vaguely sympathetic to that particular course of action. I was therefore very surprised to see on the fourteenth of this month an article in the Sydney Morning Herald which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has shelved its proposed book publishing reforms, prompting speculation that it does not intend proceeding with them before the next election. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Acting Deputy President, as you would know, a great deal of pressure is now being applied to the Government by established literary figures and people with a vested interest in maintaining the monopoly position that exists within the Australian book market at the moment. The Government appears to be caving in to that pressure. The other day I presented a petition to the Senate organised through the customers of Dymocks books who, in the course of a couple of weeks, had collected more than 8,600 signatures of people in New South Wales, and Sydney in particular, calling for the adoption of the PSA recommendations and, as a consequence, for the lowering of book prices in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Donald Horne, who has never been known for his belief in allowing the free flow of the market to operate-much as he may pretend to believe in the free flow of ideas-has engaged in one of the ultimate cultural cringes by basically saying that we need some sort of protection of the market in order to keep foreign publishers, foreign books, foreign ideas and foreign authors either out of the country or at least at prohibitive levels of cost within the country. I am glad to see that the article which Professor Horne-he has recently been reappointed, much to my distress, as the Chairman of the Australia Council for yet another year-put into the Australian newspaper on the eighth of this month was vigorously answered by Fred Brenchley, Director of the University Co-op Bookshops in Sydney under the heading `Australia's great book cringe'. He quite clearly indicates the intellectual paucity of Donald Horne's arguments once again. </PARA>
<PARA> John Forsyth, Chairman of Dymocks Book Arcade Ltd, had a letter in the Australian Financial Review on 12 December 1989, again referring to these recommendations of the Prices Surveillance Authority and indicating, under the heading `Open market will not raise book prices', that that is the the correct way to go. He concludes:</PARA>
<PARA> If the Government is serious about reducing the price of books, it has no other alternative but to adopt the recommendations of the Prices Surveillance Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have said, a vigorous assault has been mounted on the recommendation of the PSA. Mr Muller of the Australian Book Publishers Association has mounted an attack on Robert Haupt, a journalist with the Sydney Morning Herald who has been crusading for some years to get lower book prices in Australia. In an article in the Sydney Morning Herald Mr Muller says:</PARA>
<PARA> In not getting his way on what he regards as his own personal crusade for copyright reform, he-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Robert Haupt-</PARA>
<PARA>is showing all the petulance of a sore loser. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope it is not that Mr Muller has been tipped off by the Government that Mr Haupt is to be a loser and the Government has decided not to make recommendations in favour of the adoption of the PSA report because it is afraid of the consequences from its so-called intellectual friends in this country. If this Government really wants to be a friend to the people of Australia it will take the steps to lower book prices. It will start by adopting Neil Brown's private member's Bill for the introduction of the report of the Shepherd committee on copyright reform and it will give serious consideration to the PSA report and not attempt to bury it until after the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak to the  1988-89 annual report of the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) and I would like to comment on petrol product prices. I was disappointed that there was no definitive report on petrol product prices in the report of the Prices Surveillance Authority. On 20 June 1989 the Minister for Consumer Affairs, Senator Bolkus, asked the Prices Surveillance Authority to investigate petroleum prices in Australia. By doing so he effectively prevented the Trade Practices Commission from bringing down its guidelines for `rack pricing' until the Prices Surveillance Authority had brought down its report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is great uncertainty in the petroleum marketing industry amongst retailers, distributors and fuel and oil companies. At the moment, all sections of the industry are waiting for the Trade Practices Commission to bring down these guidelines so that some certainty can be restored in the industry. Until those guidelines are brought into this Parliament, there will be problems in the industry. At present a number of small service stations are just holding on by their finger nails. A number of distributors are saying that the prices they are getting now do not allow them to carry on their duties as distributors. As I have said, the oil companies are waiting for these guidelines from the Trade Practices Commission that cannot be brought down until the Prices Surveillance Authority has brought down its report. So it is with some disappointment we see the reference in the report of the PSA to petroleum pricing. In only a paragraph the PSA states that it will investigate this matter at some time. The time is now and the need is for urgency. </PARA>
<PARA> I think I have appealed to Senator Tate when he has been in the chamber-although he is not the Minister responsible for the PSA, he is the Minister in the Senate responsible for the Trade Practices Commission-for some getting together and for some exchange of ideas between the PSA and the Trade Practices Commission so we can get some definitive answer for the petroleum industry. If this is not forthcoming in the next three or four weeks, a number of service stations will feel the pinch and a number of service stations will not survive unless they get a reasonable profit margin. This can be achieved only if the Trade Practices Commission brings down those guidelines as a matter of urgency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the 1988-89 annual report of the Prices Surveillance Authority. I hope that this is the second last report that this body will bring down, as it is the Opposition's intention, when in government, to remove it. It is one of that multiplicity of bodies which, frankly, are not worth the price-and the price is $1.8m a year simply in staffing, apart from the enormous costs it incurs in the private sector. Many corporations in very competitive environments have to provide extraordinary volumes of reports and do an immense amount of work to meet the needs of what is no more than a toothless tiger anyway. The Prices Surveillance Authority exists only for appearance. As the report itself states, it is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . an important part of the Government's Prices and Incomes Policy based on its Accord with the Australian Council of Trade Unions . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is part of dressing up that act for the benefit of the trade union movement but it has no effective powers and it wastes most of its time dealing in highly competitive areas which the report itself admits are a waste of time. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Prices surveillance cannot offset these fundamental demand and supply forces but it can play a beneficial role in helping to promote understanding of the forces at work and to ensure that firms which do not operate in conditions of effective competition are held accountable for their pricing decisions. </PARA>
<PARA>There may be some case for the existence of some governmental body to supervise the pricing policies of the Government's own instrumentalities. There is no doubt that this is evident from the way the Prices Surveillance Authority intervened in the matter of the Overseas Telecommunications Commission and Australia Post where prices of the Government's own monopolistic bodies were cut, and that is the key point. Believing that there is a role in the highly competitive environment for government surveillance and intervention and intervention in the marketplace is an anachronistic concept. The marketplace, of course, is where this body spends and wastes most of its time and spends and wastes taxpayers' money. It is evident, from looking at the list of things it had to do, that its greatest successes involved simply looking at government monopolies. The references that the Minister Assisting the Treasurer for Prices, Senator Bolkus, in his interventionist way made to this body indicate that he asked it to have a look at various things such as jams and marmalades. I see that on 25 July 1988 the Minister declared that jams, marmalades, cordials, soft drinks and mineral waters are to be notified goods for the purpose of the Prices Surveillance Authority Act. When we look at what it has actually done about jams and marmalades we see that one notification was received from Cadbury Schweppes during 1988-89 seeking a 3.5 per cent wholesale price increase to recover increased costs of production, and this was endorsed by the Authority. What a dramatic and exciting thing-a 3.5 per cent wholesale price increase at a time when the cost of living was going up by 8 per cent. Yet this was an industry that was so risky, in terms of a rush of price rises, that the Minister declared that these items should be under the control of the Prices Surveillance Authority. This shows the absolute humbug of the great bulk of the work it has been doing. I did not select that example just out of some kind of desire to find one such case only; there are many others. The Minister declared chocolate and sugar confectionery to be notified goods for the purpose of the Act. When we look to see what happened we find that during the year the Authority approved an 8.4 per cent increase in the weighted average wholesale price of confectionery products. That is roughly in line with the inflation rate. Why was there this desperate need by Minister Bolkus to declare these goods? Day old broiler chicks were declared, dressed table chickens were declared, and if we look to see what happened to them we see there was clearly no need in a very competitive market for this Minister, and this Government, to be interventionist and seek to paper over, if you like, the cracks in its deal with the Australian Council of Trade Unions which the PSA simply represents. The Price Surveillance Authority is a sham. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague Senator Michael Baume used the term `humbug' when he described the work of the Prices Surveillance Authority. It seems indeed to be a very sensible word to describe it, and it is epitomised by a report in this morning's paper stating that Senator Bolkus, no doubt trying to use the silly season to announce something equally silly, wishes to refer to the Authority for investigation the high price of greeting cards. The examples that Senator Baume has given as examples of humbug seem to be well matched by this purported inquiry. The newspaper reports that the Minister stated that the nature of consumer demand for these cards suggests that suppliers have the scope to charge high prices. Of course, they equally have the scope to charge low prices. Anyone who shops in a supermarket on a regular basis will find very inexpensive cards either of the ordinary greeting variety all through the year or, particularly, Christmas cards at this time of the year when their price is low enough that they can be used for attaching to gifts as well as for sending through the mail. If the Government is really sincere in its concern about the costs that people incur at Christmas time it has only to look at what has happened to the cost of postage stamps and the expense that people are having to go to to keep in contact with each other. Of course, over that particular item it has no control.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to note, at a time when the Government is so concerned about Christmas cards as a whole, that parliamentarians send out lots of Christmas cards. Some are supplied through the Parliament, but as I found out last year if one wants to have additional cards printed at one's own expense the cost of doing it through the Australian Government Printing Service is absolutely extortionate. If one had any sense one would go into the private sector where a much more sensible price was able to be obtained. This morning I had a call to my office from a constituent who had seen this report in the press and was highly incensed, having received a very expensive card from an officer of this Parliament. Certainly that person had exercised his choice in sending an expensive card, and presumably he made whatever arrangements were necessary for the cost of that card. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this is yet another example of the hypocrisy of the Government in attacking an industry which is meeting a consumer need. There are inexpensive cards readily available on the market but clearly the most expensive component of sending greeting cards is the postage stamp that goes on it. As I repeat, this seems to be an announcement by a Minister desperate to get his name in print in what can only be described as one of the silliest items of the silly season. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to speak to the Australian Honey Board's annual report, and in doing so I inform the Senate that the beekeepers of Australia are finding greater and greater difficulty in maintaining their industry due to the control of certain of their main feedstocks and the development of land. Also, things such as leatherwood being locked up in National Estate areas and being unavailable for beekeepers and the biological control of blackberries and Paterson's curse have had a great effect on the industry. Things are now getting much more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise these matters because of the enormous importance of beekeepers in the agricultural and horticultural crops industry, particularly in regard to crops such as clovers, lucerne for seed, vegetables and vegetables for seed, and fruit crops generally-apples, pears, berry fruits and so on. The beekeeping industry, because it is relatively small in size and number, is often by government. It is not a large organisation; it does not have a lot of money. We have to look now at resources that we can provide for beekeepers if we are to keep them in business and have them look after the agricultural crops that we need them for so desperately. A healthy beekeeping industry is absolutely essential. </PARA>
<PARA> Those in the industry are not just a noisy minority, which is the way that many government departments and larger groups see them. That clearly is not so. They also have difficulties when it comes to things such as quarantine because they are a small group. I will give the Senate two or three examples. Two or three years ago we faced the question of whether to import leafcutter bees from New Zealand. It was not certain that these bees would come in disease free but when I took this up with the quarantine people of the day they said, `Oh, yes, the lucerne people want leafcutter bees and if we don't let them come in legally they will bring them in illegally anyway'. I do not regard that as being a quarantine excuse of any sort. </PARA>
<PARA> More recently I have been taking up, on behalf of the beekeepers, the question of a disease called chalk brood, also from New Zealand. New Zealand has some of it and in fact it is quite common in other places around the world. Recently I asked in Question No. 1088:</PARA>
<PARA>Is it regarded as one of the major diseases in the beekeeping industry. </PARA>
<PARA>The answer I received was:</PARA>
<PARA>It is regarded as a serious exotic disease by the Australian beekeeping industry. Internationally it is not regarded as a major infectious disease of honeybees. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course it is not. Nearly every country in the world has it and they are doing nothing about trying to get rid of it. We do not have it and the beekeepers do not want to have it. It is quite a nasty complaint and it affects the effectiveness and profitability of beekeeping. I want to support the beekeepers of Australia and I call on others to give them more support. They deserve to be supported as an industry in their own right and for what they do for agriculture generally. Although I have not yet shown these documents to the Minister in the chamber, the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard two questions and answers which I have recently asked on the subject. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Senator Archer asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 16 June 1989:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Does the beekeeping disease `chalkbrood' exist in New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Does it exist in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Is it regarded as one of the major diseases in the beekeeping industry. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) If established in Australia, would it affect the production and the export capacity of the industry; if so, to what extent. </PARA>
<PARA> (5) Do quarantine regulations exist to prevent the importation of honey into Australia from countries where the disease exists. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) It is regarded as a serious exotic disease by the Australian beekeeping industry. Internationally it is not regarded as a major infectious disease of honeybees. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) Chalkbrood can lower honey production in weakened and/or badly managed hives by reducing the survival rate of bee larvae. Several factors affect the severity of the disease and an accurate estimate of the likely extent of any production loss if chalkbrood disease established in Australia cannot be made. Production losses within colonies will be greatest at the beginning of an outbreak and will then decrease over time. </PARA>
<PARA> (5) Under the Quarantine Act (1908), Proclamation No. 132A, the importation of honeycomb and honey containing honeycomb is prohibited unless the Director of Quarantine is satisfied that its importation is not likely to introduce disease. </PARA>
<PARA> (6) According to statistics supplied by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, from 1 July 1984 to 31 June 1989 approximately 626.7 tonnes of honey were imported into Australia from New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA> (7) Procedures for the inspection and clearance of imported bee products are well established and the level of enforcement has proved successful in preventing the introduction of chalkbrood and other exotic diseases into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>(Question No. 1285)</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Senator Archer asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 27 October 1989:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) In relation to the Minister's reply to my Question on Notice No. 1088, (see Senate Hansard of 26 September 1989, page 1363) on what evidence is his comment based that, internationally, chalkbrood is not regarded as a major infectious disease of honeybees. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Does the Minister's comment that chalkbrood can lower production in weakened and/or badly managed hives imply that the disease does not lower production in strong and/or well managed hives. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Is it correct that of 15 samples of honey taken from shop shelves in New Zealand, 12 had chalkbrood spores. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) Is there a danger of introducing chalkbrood through importation of honey; if so, why does proclamation no. 132A include bulk honey and honey pre-packs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Chalkbrood is not considered a major infectious disease of honeybees by the Office International des Eqizooties (OIE), the recognised international reporting body on animal diseases and it is not listed in either of the OIE List A or List B categories. As Australia is free from the disease, however, quarantine restrictions are in place to address the risk of the disease reaching the Australian bee population. The import of bee products is currently under review due to concerns raised over the import of chalkbrood fungus in such products. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Chalkbrood may lower production in strong, well managed hives, but it is usually of less economic importance in such hives. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Informal advice is that a research project performed in New Zealand obtained this result. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to make a few remarks on this report. Soil conservation in this country is very important. I am very pleased to see that it has reached the standing in the public and political minds that for many years we have wanted it to do. However, when looking at the advisory committee's annual report I am reminded, as we all ought to be, of the major goals of the national soil conservation program and in particular the first of those goals, as stated:</PARA>
<PARA> that all lands in Australia be used within their capability;</PARA>
<PARA>I have always been pleased to see that as the first of the goals. Perhaps the fifth goal is equally important:</PARA>
<PARA> That the community adopt a land conservation ethic. </PARA>
<PARA>On the question of the capability of Australia's soil, I really think that we still have not met the major part of the problem: that before we can achieve that goal, we first need to assess that capability on a national basis. While we have had increased interest in soil conservation-perhaps more broadly expressed as land degradation-in this country, a recognition of the fragility of that resource base upon which so much depends for our economy and our lives generally and the need for more funding, we have not come to grips, even in `the world's greatest environment statement' made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in July with this question of an assessment of land capability on a national basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts entitled `The Effectiveness of Land Degradation Policies and Programs' to show that others share my concern. In that report the Committee expressed surprise at the decision of the Australian Soil Conservation Council that things were proceeding adequately. The problem is that the current program is based on the involvement of local land care groups. While that is definitely the way to go, it is not the only way to go. A great deal of land in this country will not come under those land care groups: extensive pastoral lands, particularly those owned by absentee owners; Aboriginal lands; and other similar areas which are particularly sensitive. While this is going on when we do not have a full picture of the capability, we cannot address the problem fully. The problem has been walked away from to too great an extent. I simply place on record that until, through the national soil conservation program, we come to grips with the need to have that total picture-on a national basis, not in a parochial State-by-State way-we will always have the continuing problem, particularly in the most fragile areas of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This report is significant for two reasons. Firstly it entirely endorses the general thrust of the Opposition's policy in relation to recommendations about the Office of the Supervising Scientist. Recommendation 43 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>All Sydney based staff be transferred to the Northern Territory as soon as practicable, most or all policy and management staff to be located in Darwin, and most or all scientific and technical staff in Jabiru. The Supervising Scientist should be based in Darwin as from the commencement of the next term of appointment. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, the report gives the lie to the claims made by a large number of Labor Ministers about the nature of mining in the Alligator Rivers region. On page 17 the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>The operation of the Ranger mine immediately adjacent to the Magela wetlands has demonstrated that mining activities under strict environmental requirements can be carried on successfully in environmentally sensitive areas. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The review concludes that, with the appropriate environmental controls, there is no technical reason why exploration and mining in the ARR are necessarily incompatible with the protection of, and the public's enjoyment of, the region's natural and cultural value. </PARA>
<PARA>In relation to existing mining operations, on page 16 the reports states:</PARA>
<PARA>These arrangements have been successful to the extent that mining operations have continued and been profitable without any significant detriment to the environment. </PARA>
<PARA>I could go on at some considerable length. For instance, on page 11 in relation to mining operations in the Territory and in the Kakadu zone in particular, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>The effect of run-off water from the project-</PARA>
<PARA>referring to the Ranger uranium project-</PARA>
<PARA>has been barely detectable. </PARA>
<PARA>It indicates the extent to which within the Northern Territory it is possible for the uranium industry to be expanded, for mining to take place within the Alligator Rivers region under strictly controlled environmental conditions. It endorses the comments made along those lines by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in its report to the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) and the conclusions arrived at by the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories when it was looking at the Coronation Hill project. This review by Professor Taylor, a most distinguished Australian scientist, is a useful one. It not only endorses the general thrust of the Opposition's policy in this regard, but it nails absolutely some of the lies, the furphies, the misstatements, and the deliberate misrepresentations about the nature of the mining industry and the uranium industry, particularly in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government of the Northern Territory and my colleague Senator Grant Tambling will undoubtedly find many of the things that they have said vindicated entirely by this report. I trust that the Government will now have the good sense to adopt the recommendations in Professor Taylor's report and to pay more heed to his very sound conclusions. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>This is yet another report in the saga of the huge cost rises of the new Parliament House building. This building is far too expensive for what is being delivered. That is not a new concept. It is one that Senator Walsh-who is sitting in the chamber-as a Government Minister acknowledges and accepts. In fact, he is on record in the Canberra Times dated 14 February 1987 as saying:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It says, `ongoing'. Perhaps Senator Walsh has been misquoted on almost every second word. However, he is quoted as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>`. . . the whole administration of the new Parliament House had been a mess, beginning with the ``fast-tracking'' of the project . . .'</PARA>
<PARA>The Waste Watch Committee, along with Senator Parer, discovered many examples of excessive costs. As the Senate is aware, the wheel almost had to be reinvented in the building of this structure. The Waste Watch Committee estimated that something like $200m of unnecessary expenditure had taken place in the construction of this building due, largely, not to the fast-tracking of the project but to the manner of the administration of the fast-tracking of the project and also the requirement that it be completed almost at any cost as long as it was in time for the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to get the Queen to open it in the bicentennial year. Also, costs emerged from the desire for many items which could not be mass produced but which were produced specifically, on a one-off basis, for this building. </PARA>
<PARA> I look back on the revelations of the Waste Watch Committee with a certain degree of pride because, apart from a couple of inconsequential matters, I believe they now stand up to scrutiny very well. Following the reports by the Waste Watch Committee, the Parliament House Construction Authority was the subject of an inquiry by the Australian Audit Office. The report of the Audit Office on the Authority's construction project management was then subjected to detailed examination by the Authority itself which presented its response to the Auditor-General's comments. That response generally claimed that the Auditor-General was basically wrong. The Auditor-General, in this report now before the Parliament, deals with that response item by item. I must say that that report appears to me to be very persuasive. It states that the Audit Office examined the Authority's response carefully and found that in many instances the Authority's statements were incorrect. For example, it states:</PARA>
<PARA>In a general comment at page 83 of its response, the Authority said that the response provides evidence that the efficiency audit report was deficient or in error in many cases and demonstrates that, even where procedural shortfalls were identified, corrective action had generally already been taken. </PARA>
<PARA>The Audit Office also states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the response itself was deficient in not facing issues raised in the audit report. As for procedural shortfalls identified, the audit report disclosed numerous instances where corrective action had not been taken and appeared unlikely to be taken. </PARA>
<PARA>As Chairman of the Waste Watch Committee, my particular concern was the lack of effective cost controls. It appeared to me that there was a massive gap in that area which was plugged very late indeed. It seems to me that had this gap been plugged, multimillions of dollars of taxpayers' money would have been saved on this project. The Auditor-General appears to share that view. I must say that it is heartening that he should do so. The Auditor-General continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Although it was disappointing that the Authority's-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Parliament House Construction Authority's-</PARA>
<PARA>response contained misleading and incorrect material and misrepresentations of ANAO positions . . . it was pleasing that the Authority had moved to implement certain of the ANAO recommendations-this was in contrast to its former position that `nothing of any practical consequence is likely to flow from them' . . . In October 1987 staff of the Authority gave evidence to the Senate Estimates Committee E. The evidence contained errors which ANAO found it necessary to correct. It was apparent that the Senate Committee was concerned about the erroneous information given by Authority representatives. Senator Parer remarked in the Senate in respect of one of the matters that:</PARA>
<PARA> `It is apparent from the Auditor-General's letter, to which I have just referred and which came to my desk today, that, in one way or another, the members of the Senate Committee were misled by the construction authority. I am not sure whether this was deliberate or not, but we were misled'. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not want to rake over old coals. All I want to stress in the brief time available-because the Senate has a very heavy schedule in front of it-is that this is not simply a battle between one government instrumentality and another about whether this project was effectively or efficiently run. This is a matter of real substance because the lessons to be learned from the mistakes made in the construction of this building have an immense impact on the pockets of Australian taxpayers. I regret that the level of hostility and argument between the two antagonists in this matter-the Parliament House Construction Authority and the Auditor-General-has reached the stage where one side is clearly saying things that are simply untrue. The Auditor-General goes through this lengthy report of the Construction Authority's comments, point by point, saying, `This is incorrect'. </PARA>
<PARA> From my own knowledge, it seems to me that the Auditor-General has a basic tendency to be correct more often than the Construction Authority on the matters that are raised. For example, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Authority says that the audit was conducted too late in the project to allow the possibility of the results being used in subsequent phases of the work but not late enough to provide a sound basis for the proper evaluation of the project delivery method. </PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General responds:</PARA>
<PARA>This is incorrect. The audit was not too late; the fieldwork was conducted in 1986, well before the Authority began its biggest year for outlays on the project. </PARA>
<PARA>Outlays for the year beginning 1 July 1986 were $284m and the following year, 1987-88, they were $294m. Surely it was not too late for evaluation of the Authority's management operations? The Auditor-General points out:</PARA>
<PARA>The Authority had been operating since 1980, long enough to assess operations.</PARA>
<PARA>I also want to say that the Authority seems to be on the wrong track by complaining that the Auditor-General was attacking the concept of the fast-track principle. Obviously, the fast-track method was necessary in order to try to meet the planned opening date. It was simply the administration that was the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems silly to me that the Auditor-General should have to reply, item by item, to misstatements made by the Construction Authority, even to the extent of saying what the date was by which it was supposed to be opened. The Auditor-General quotes the statement made by the Prime Minister in 1979 outlining that the building was supposed to be ready for occupancy by Australia Day 1988. Yet the Parliament House Construction Authority had said, `Oh no, it was simply to be opened some time in 1988'. Why are we having this sort of silliness? It does the Parliament House Construction Authority no good at all when one can go back and see exactly what the announcements were. The Auditor-General's report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Authority says that the only `target date' given to the Authority by the Government was in 1978 by the then Prime Minister who said that the Government anticipated the opening of the building would take place in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> That is incorrect. The then Prime Minister, in 1979 in his second reading speech for the Parliament House Construction Authority Bill, said:</PARA>
<PARA>As was announced by me in November last the Government has accepted the advice of the Joint Standing Committee and has decided to proceed with the design and construction of a new Parliament House with a view to it being opened on Australia Day, 26 January 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>I use that as just one of the many examples of the silly sort of nonsense that has gone on from the Authority, which, frankly, does it no credit in trying to respond to what I thought was a very substantial comment by the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> My general conclusion is this: the Auditor-General was subjected to heavy criticism by the Parliament House Construction Authority. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that the audit report is deficient or in error in many cases and demonstrates that, even where procedural shortfalls are identified, corrective action had generally already been taken. </PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General's response was:</PARA>
<PARA>That is incorrect. The Response provides no evidence that the audit report is deficient or in error in many cases. On the contrary, the Authority's Response has been shown to be deficient in not facing issues raised in the audit report . . . </PARA>
<PARA> As for procedural shortfalls by the Authority, the audit report disclosed numerous instances where corrective action had not been taken and appeared unlikely to be taken. </PARA>
<PARA>This is another matter where the Authority was incorrect. The Authority says that the Audit Office:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . refers to the extraordinary difficulties under which the project was being constructed but does not appear to have taken these into account in focusing its views. </PARA>
<PARA>The Audit Office says:</PARA>
<PARA>This is incorrect. The Audit Office, when forming its views, took account of the difficult circumstances . . . but made it clear that the Authority should have managed the project better, given its corporate objective to function as an efficient management organisation. </PARA>
<PARA>Its last comment is:</PARA>
<PARA>The Audit Office accepted that fast track was necessary for the project. The Audit Office's view was that the building might have been completed in less time and at less cost had the Authority's management of the project not suffered from the deficiencies summarised in the audit report. </PARA>
<PARA>I conclude on this note because, quite frankly, this is the issue that the Waste Watch Committee was concerned about: that the management of the construction of this building by the Parliament House Construction Authority was such that there was a considerable waste of money. Whether anyone could have done it better is another question altogether. I must say that I think Australians should congratulate the Authority and the project managers for getting this building up in time for the bicentennial. It is the biggest structure ever put up in Australia. It contained massive problems which had to be overcome. They were overcome, but at enormous expense. Surely the Construction Authority would be doing Australia a service if it recognised those areas where, in fact, it could have done better. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad to say that the Construction Authority is now putting into effect what the Auditor-General recommended; that is, putting out a report on what actually happened and what lessons should be learnt from the construction of this building. Let us not pretend-because it will diminish the capacity to learn from mistakes-that mistakes were not made. Also, let the Construction Authority come much cleaner on this matter. I commend the Auditor-General for his perseverance and determination to proceed with this matter. I hope that the lessons to be learnt from the mistakes in the construction of this great public building-even though I think at times it is an appallingly bad parliament building, it is a very great public building which attracts an enormous volume of tourists-are not lost by the Parliament House Construction Authority trying to pretend that the mistakes were not made. This Auditor-General's report underlines the fact that there were mistakes, and we should learn from them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, the Bill before the Senate, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill, is one of potential benefit to many of my constituents-not only Aboriginal Territorians but also other citizens of the Northern Territory. It is designed to give effect to the agreement reached on 6 and 7 September this year between the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) so that under this Bill Aboriginal people can receive grants of land, either as something like 150 excisions for living areas from pastoral leases-under Northern Territory law-or by means of grants of 27 individual parcels of land on stock routes or reserves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that I have been concerned about this matter for some time. My concerns were summed up in the important notice of motion I have had on the Senate's Notice Paper since 15 August. I seek leave to have that prophetic notice incorporated in Hansard. I obtained permission earlier from Senator Tate. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The notice of motion read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>+173 SENATOR TAMBLING: To move-That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) notes that, in a Return to Order of the Senate tabled on 24 November 1988 pursuant to Standing order 358, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs purported to provide an explanation for the Minister's failure to move to proclaim certain sections of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Act 1987 which:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) declined to provide any timetable for proclamation of the amendments, and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) omitted any reference to section 74 of the Principal Act, an amendment to which is also unproclaimed;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) notes with concern that, even though, by circular dated 16 January 1989, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet informed all departments of the Government's acceptance of the Senate's criticism of department's failure to proclaim legislation, amendments to the Aboriginal Land Rights Act remain unproclaimed;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) is most concerned to note that the failure of the Minister to proclaim amendments to section 50 of the Act is the principal cause of the stalemate in negotiations over excisions of Aboriginal living areas from Northern Territory pastoral properties, with the result that many Aboriginal people continue to live in unacceptable conditions;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) views, with concern, therefore, the exchange of correspondence between the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) (letter dated 22 August 1989) and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory (Mr Perron) (letter dated 23 August 1989) in which the Commonwealth has sought to impose unacceptable conditions on the Northern Territory which:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) strike at the essential nature of Territory self-government, and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) can only have the effect of causing further delay in the grant of Aboriginal living areas for those Aboriginal people needing them;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) considers that the Northern Territory Government's offer, as set out in the Chief Minister's letter to the Prime Minister dated 11 July 1989, provides a satisfactory basis for settlement of this issue; and</PARA>
<PARA> (f) calls on the Government, therefore:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) to move forthwith to proclaim the amendments made to the Aboriginal Lands Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 2 years ago, and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) to enter into constructive negotiations with the Northern Territory Government and the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association, with a view to facilitating the early grant of living area excisions from pastoral properties in the Northern Territory for Aboriginal people in need of them, on the basis of-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) recognition of a `needs' basis for the excision of Aboriginal living areas, as distinct and separate from the criteria for the grant of Aboriginal land under the Aboriginal Lands Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) observance by the Commonwealth of the principle of Northern Territory self-government, in particular in relation to land title and the capacity to acquire land for any proper public purpose. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The Opposition supports this Bill in principle. We shall vote for the second reading. However, for reasons connected with the way the present Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) does business, we shall be proposing some amendments at the committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill has application only in the Northern Territory and I remind the Senate that my constituency includes a higher proportion or Aboriginal electors than anywhere else in Australia. Nowhere else is the achievement of proper relations between black and white more central to maintaining community harmony. This Bill represents the culmination of the efforts of the Chief Minister, Marshall Perron, to get that community balance right. I know he has been mindful of the need to achieve a solution to the longstanding problems which Aboriginal people living on pastoral properties face. Because they have no title to land, public funds are not available for improvements to be made. The rabid propaganda of the Minister and the land councils suggest that neither the Northern Territory Government nor the pastoral industry have had any concern for this situation. Yet the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, in his second reading speech in the House of Representatives, recounted the long history of official and pastoral industry efforts to meet Aboriginal needs. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not need to retrace that history, which Mr Hand acknowledged went back to the Gibb report-the Committee to Review the situation of Aboriginals on Pastoral Properties in the Northern Territory-recommendations of 1971, 18 years ago. But it is important to look back over the last few years, particularly the period of Federal Labor administration. In 1985, the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Holding, resolved to seek a solution to this long-drawn problem. He obtained the agreement of all parties that, in return for the cessation of all Aboriginal land claims over stock routes and reserves, the pastoralists would facilitate Aboriginal applications for excisions from their leases to provide living areas on those pastoral properties. Minister Holding undertook to amend the principal Act, and indeed he did. He introduced an amending Bill in 1986 and in 1987 the amendment was passed. Among other provisions section 50 was amended to insert subsections 2d and 2e. These would cease all land claims over stock routes and reserves. But then came the sting. These subsections were to come into force only when proclaimed. Since that Bill was passed, however, people have been beavering away in the Labor Party Caucus undermining Mr Holding's promise which had been honourably made and, until then, honourably adhered to. Just who was setting this promise aside? It was the present Minister, Mr Hand, and his mate the member of the House of Representatives for the Northern Territory, Mr Snowdon-not surprisingly, an employee of the land councils before entering Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> When the new Minister took office in July 1987, he secretly set about negating his predecessor's undertakings. He told no one of his intentions. But as 1988 wore on-not the best of years in Aboriginal affairs-people got to learn that the new Minister was not going to proclaim the amendments. He told no one. However, I asked a few questions about the matter in Estimates Committee E last year. I refer honourable senators to pages e289 to e291 of Estimates Committee E Hansard on 25 October 1988. Suddenly it became clear that there would be no early action-indeed no action ever-to proclaim the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Macklin picked this up, too, on 24 November last year when the Senate received details of all legislation that had been passed by the Parliament but not proclaimed. Senator Macklin said:</PARA>
<PARA> On 1 September I moved a motion which was carried by the Senate on the following day. The motion reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> That there be laid on the Table of the Senate, on or before the 25 November 1988, details of all provisions of Acts which come into effect on proclamation and which have not been proclaimed, together with a statement of reasons for their non-proclamation and a timetable for their operation. </PARA>
<PARA>Speaking again on 12 April this year, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> However, I am certainly not happy with others. The Aboriginal Land Rights Legislation Amendment Act appeared on the old list as well as this one. It was debated quite extensively in this place. In fact, the reasons that are pointed out here for not proclaiming those pieces of legislation are the matter of contention in the debate, which I find absolutely extraordinary. The Government set about refuting it so that it could get this Bill passed and now presumably believes that it was correct in hindsight. </PARA>
<PARA>At the time Senator Macklin spoke I was also asking further and detailed questions in Senate Estimates Committee E. The replies to those questions showed clearly that the Minister was running a secret agenda that had absolutely nothing to do with honouring the intentions of the Parliament, still less those of his colleague, Mr Holding. It was then that my other constituents-the pastoral lessees-realised that they were being taken for a ride. I ask for leave of the Senate to table two documents which detail the course of negotiations between the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association Inc. and the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory governments on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Faced with mounting evidence of the kind detailed in these folders, the cattlemen had had no choice but to withdraw completely from all further negotiations about excisions. The Northern Territory Government also found it necessary to cease any discussions with the Commonwealth. The Northern Territory Chief Minister, Mr Perron, remained concerned, however, at the conditions in which so many Northern Territory Aboriginal citizens were compelled to live. He took the initiative and sought a meeting with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). That meeting took place on 6 and 7 September. The results are set out in the historic memorandum of agreement dated 7 September. Under the terms of the memorandum, the Northern Territory Government agreed to legislate for the grant of excisions, if need be by means of compulsory acquisition. Territory and not Commonwealth law would regulate this process. The Northern Territory Government has now legislated as promised. I refer honourable senators to the Miscellaneous Acts Amendment (Aboriginal Community Living Areas) Bill 1989 of the Northern Territory. The Commonwealth, for its part, agreed that the land rights Act would be amended so that `a small proportion only' of claims of stock route/reserve land would be granted and that further claims over these areas would be disallowed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has no quarrel with this deal. I note that the memorandum came about because of Marshall Perron's determination to settle this long-running dispute. I respect his negotiating skill in achieving the outcome he did. But what an indictment the memorandum is of the Minister, Mr Hand, whose secret agenda had to be exploded by his own leader. The memorandum gave the basis for a settlement of the matter. But there was an important further process that then had to be followed. Because the claims over stock routes and reserves were to be granted-that is, `a small proportion only' of them-the selection of areas to be scheduled took on a special importance. The memorandum said the areas would be decided on by the Commonwealth and Northern Territory governments. The land councils knew all along what areas would be selected. But pastoral lessees, many of whom had worked and lived for years in the areas concerned, were not informed, let alone consulted about the areas to be scheduled. It is not that they did not ask; they repeatedly approached the Minister and the Prime Minister, seeking some kind of reasonable information about the areas and about the detriment their businesses would suffer. They have had no substantive reply from the Government of any kind. I ask for leave of the Senate to table correspondence between the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association and the Government relating to the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will see for themselves the lack of courtesy with which the lessees have been treated and the paucity of information provided, by a supposedly caring Labor Government. On 1 November, I set out in a letter to the Minister a number of practical concerns that the Opposition had about this Bill. Despite many phone calls to his office-over some 41 days-the letter was not replied to until Monday, 11 December. It is dated 8 December, even though I was informed that it was signed on 11 December, and it was casually sent in the rounds and not received until midday on Monday, 11 December. The Minister's responses are derisory. The discourtesy has been shown not just to me, as a senator whose constituents are vitally affected in the matter, but of course, also to those people, whether Aboriginal or not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the committee stage, I shall show just how inadequate some of the responses are and how misleading and contemptuous the Minister has chosen to be. It is apparent, however, that this Minister has extended no more courtesy or consideration to the Northern Territory Government. It was also necessary, therefore, for the Chief Minister to continue with concerned correspondence to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I seek leave to table copies of that important correspondence. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is apparent from Mr Perron's letter of 20 November 1989 that the potential effects of these proposals-once some of the detail became known-had been closely considered by the Northern Territory Government. The detailed comments on the areas to be granted were provided to the Commonwealth, but there is no evidence that these matters then received the careful or specific analysis that they deserved. As the Chief Minister said on 20 November 1989, in a letter to Mr Hand:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I must express my extreme disappointment at the manner in which you have handled . . . the selection of areas to be scheduled as Aboriginal land. </PARA>
<PARA>The issue of most concern to my worried constituents relates to how the areas in schedule 1 to the Bill have been selected and what consideration has been given to the practical effects on pastoral operations. In his second reading speech the Minister purported to give details of `undertakings' given by the Aboriginal claimants which, he said, would demonstrate that pastoral lessees would not suffer any detriment by the grant of land proposed. We have asked for the actual text of those `undertakings' to be provided and so have the cattlemen. As I speak, the Minister and the Prime Minister have just ignored those requests. </PARA>
<PARA> At the committee stage, I intend to table a document which seems to include the texts of land council letters setting out the claimants' `undertakings'. It will be clear to the Senate that the Minister's account of those undertakings-for example, who sought them and on the basis of whose advice-and the actual text of the letters are somewhat at variance. It is not that we are unused to this Minister playing fast and loose with the truth in this Parliament. But honourable senators might think by now he would have learned a few lessons. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week, on Monday evening, 11 December, I tabled a number of letters to the Minister from individual pastoral lessees who are affected by the proposed land grants. They show that the lessees have not had answers to their legitimate questions. Their concerns have not been addressed. There has been no negotiation with them. They are presented with a fait accompli-like it or lump it. Let me just quote to the Senate from some of the letters the cattlemen have sent to the Minister. The solicitor for Amaroo Station wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> Our client uses the Honeymoon area as a trucking point for cattle which includes yards, water and holding paddocks. It would be of significant detriment to our client's pastoral business . . . if the area under claim . . . were granted. </PARA>
<PARA> No consultation whatsoever with our client has taken place. </PARA>
<PARA>A letter from Deep Well Station stated:</PARA>
<PARA>We feel very annoyed, after having had generations on our land, for over 100 years, at having gotten the message the way we did. No consultation, no letter, no prior advice from you at all . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The solicitor for Hamilton Down Station wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>The scheduling has been proposed without reference to, consultation or consideration of our clients' interests. The result is that our client is to be deprived of resources which will have an adverse effect on his pastoral undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA>A letter from Stirling Station stated:</PARA>
<PARA>In good faith, traditional owners were given an excision in 1979-one of due to the first excisions to be formalised. </PARA>
<PARA> The traditional owners from Wilora community do not want the stock route excised or given away to other Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA>In this last case, there is even a letter to Mr Hand from the Wilora Aboriginal community. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>I wish to advise that the Manager of Stirling Station and myself have been having talks about a living area for my family, Tommy Jungala, and other people who have traditional ties to the area around the Forster Range. </PARA>
<PARA> The stock route that is to be given to us is not what we want and will affect the agreement we have with David Bayly, the Manager of Stirling Station. </PARA>
<PARA>What was the Minister's reply? Absolutely nothing! So much for all the talk about Aboriginal self-determination. It is okay, until the Aboriginal people try to do something the land councils do not like. Then it is goodbye to self-determination mighty quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many such letters. I urge honourable senators to read them. They really show that these people's concerns-my constituents' concerns-are genuine. They really show how their concerns have been utterly disregarded. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's only response to the cattlemen has been to say that he would discuss their concerns after the Bill has been passed. What is the good of that? By then, the whole thing would be set in concrete. The Minister could look forward to an interesting discussion, but everyone-including the Minister-would be powerless to change anything. How damned idiotic-but typical of Mr Hand's logic. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that the other half of the 7 September deal has still to be given effect. The grant of living area excisions will require tact, negotiation and goodwill between Aboriginal claimants and pastoral lessees. The Minister's failure to consult the pastoralists must make the next stage harder to achieve and that will be to the cost of Aboriginal people. These are the very people the Minister says he wants to help. </PARA>
<PARA> I inform the Senate that the Opposition proposes to move two amendments to the Bill. The first seeks to ensure that the 1987 amendments relating to the removal of stock routes and reserves from land claims do enter into force. Thus, the amendments would make entry into force of the present Bill dependent on proclamation of the 1987 amendments. In my letter of 1 November to the Minister-the letter that took the Minister 41 days to reply to-I asked when those amendments will be proclaimed. I ask Senator Macklin to note his reply. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> I am not in a position to tell you the precise date. </PARA>
<PARA>I will have more to say about this at the committee stage. The second amendment proposes an administrative law process for the assessment of detriment to holders of land which is in the vicinity of the areas set out in schedule 1, before the area can be granted to Aboriginal claimants. It is really a principle of natural justice. </PARA>
<PARA> Neither of these amendments would have been needed if the Minister had dealt frankly and openly in this matter. But we do not trust him. We do not trust him on his record in this matter. More importantly, we do not trust him on his record overall. Let me read to the Senate an extract from the 1989 annual report of the chairman of the Northern Territory Chamber of Mines. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>I also have a letter from Mr Hand dated 23 August 1989, some three weeks before the date on the printed Bill. In his letter Mr Hand declines to review the exploration and mining provisions of the Land Rights Act until . . . those provisions of the Act are operating normally. </PARA>
<PARA> I am told that Mr Hand's Department was working on amendments to the provisions-the Bill-at the time that he wrote to me to say that it was in-appropriate to review the provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments proposed in the Bill have the potential to impact seriously on the freedom of mineral explorers and miners to go about their work. The proposed amendments are, in several ways, compounding the problems that the Chamber sought to lessen by cooperative approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hand's refusal to undertake a review of the provisions-in his letter to me as President of the Chamber-is therefore doubly surprising. First, it is most likely that the provisions were already under review, as explained above. Second, my request for a review followed a pledge made in June 1987 by the then Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator the Honourable, Gareth Evans to the Northern Territory Mining Industry that a review would be made two years after that date, viz in June 1989. This commitment has now been dishonoured. </PARA>
<PARA> I have given the details of this interchange because it illustrates what I consider to be a very real problem. It seems that trust can no longer be assumed to govern the conduct of business between Mr Hand and this Chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless I am missing certain critical pieces of information-and I think not-I am disinclined to do further business with this Minister. I would be likewise disinclined to do business with any company which went about its work in a similar way. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Geoff Sherrington, the President of the Northern Territory Chamber of Mines, was referring to yet another broken promise. This time it is a clear commitment by Senator Evans that, two years after the 1987 `mining regime' amendments to the Land Rights Act had operated, they would be reviewed. I wonder if he asked Senator Evans before he dobbed him in? `But', says Mr Hand, `the land councils are too busy'. The land councils have indeed been busy, spending a record amount on administration; on treaty discussions; on organising the controversial Barunda festival and the stolen ceremonial secrets; on putting down my constituents in east Arnhem Land who want their own land council; and doing the Minister's political footwork on the ill-fated Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. They have been busy in fact with everything except their job, and they have been stirring up demands for excisions which they have no legal power to negotiate for. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt the land councils knew all about the amendments to the so-called 1987 mining regime-part iv of the Act. The Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) who is at the table cannot deny that an earlier draft of this Bill had a whole heap of changes which would have affected mining operations. As Mr Sherrington notes, the last thing the Minister thought of doing was to consult the mining industry. The fact that his Cabinet colleague, Senator Evans, had given a solemn undertaking was, of course, irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to inform the Senate that the Opposition has no difficulty with those amendments remaining in the present Bill which deal with mining matters. I understand that these amendments are likewise acceptable to the Northern Territory Government. I inform the Senate that I intend to pursue the issue of the land councils' financial accountability under the relevant provisions of this Act and in the forums of the Senate. I have already called for a royal commission into this profligacy. The Minister has allowed the secretariats to spend at least $35m since he took office without a thought for the effectiveness of what they spent it on, not to speak of the amount he has let them run up in debts. Consequently, the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account has serious problems and has depreciated capital reserves due to the delinquent actions of the Minister. He has indulged the land councils with his secret agenda for the grant of claims over stock route and reserves and locked everyone else out. Neither the Minister nor the land council secretariats have paid any attention to the damaging effect their thoughtless and arrogant actions have had and must continue to have on community relations in the Northern Territory. For those of us who live in the Territory, no such luxury exists. The aspirations of the Aboriginal people for living area excisions and for some of the land this Bill proposes to grant are legitimate. Equally, the concerns of the cattle industry, which earns $130m export income every year, are legitimate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is easy to characterise one group or other of my Northern Territory constituents as those with all right on their side. It is much harder to work for a sensible and sensitive balance in Aboriginal matters as Marshall Perron has always done, and as the Opposition has always sought, in and out of government. The Bill, as we propose it should be amended, will achieve that reasonable balance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that two elements of the speech we have just heard need to be picked up immediately. Senator Tambling implied that in some way Aboriginal people were laying claim to a vast amount of the Northern Territory and/or a section of the Northern Territory which was extremely valuable and extremely likely to interfere with the `legitimate' concerns of the Northern Territory cattlemen. It is important to make clear at the outset that the area of land under claim within the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 1989 is 0.17 per cent of the Northern Territory. In a quick calculation, we are talking about one six-hundredth of the area of the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we are talking about natural justice, I think it is important to go back in history to somewhat beyond the 1970s and 1980s with which Senator Tambling was dealing and look at the way in which Aboriginal people occupied the Northern Territory for a very much longer period of time before that and, indeed, developed their cultural and religious roots in that Territory in a way which made dispossession from that land a very important element in their survival and the survival of their culture and whole reason for being. If one goes back in time, one recognises that when the Aboriginal people were dispossessed of the land, no question of natural justice or compensation was raised at all; they were simply pushed aside to make way for those who wished to use the land for other purposes. I recognise that that process was based on a legal understanding of terra nullius, as it was in other parts of Australia, and clearly our law does not recognise those Aboriginal claims. However, morally the Aboriginal people have an enormous and natural claim to the whole of the Northern Territory, and that needs to be recognised when we are dealing with this minuscule fraction to which they are now laying claim. </PARA>
<PARA> If one moves on from that initial dispossession, one finds that there were periods when Aboriginal people lived on the fringe of cattle properties. For a long time they were able to find part time employment in that industry which, I suppose, provided them with some sort of sustenance and living related to those areas with which they had a natural and historic association. But as the cattle industry developed, particularly after the Second World War, even that level of sustenance and association was taken away from them. As the cattle industry developed other means of transporting and herding cattle and so on, there was less and less need for Aboriginal people to have even that tenuous connection with their traditional areas. So one finds that not only was there a dispossession in the early years but that in recent decades that dispossession, that loss of dignity, of sustenance and of association with their traditional areas, was made worse. If one moves on to 1971, one finds Aboriginal people living across the Territory in absolutely appalling conditions. Even 18 years ago, the report of the Gibb Committee to Review the Situation of Aboriginals on Pastoral Properties in the Northern Territory recommended that there should be excision from pastoral leases to provide community living areas for Aboriginal people close to and associated with those areas with which they had a traditional association. </PARA>
<PARA> We move on to 1974 when the Woodward Aboriginal Land Rights Commission again underlined and underscored the need for Aboriginal people to acquire some secure tenure of land in association with those areas with which they had a traditional association. The Whitlam Government of the early 1970s appointed Mr Justice Ward as an Aboriginal Land Commissioner. Mr Justice Ward recommended very much the same thing: the appropriation of small parcels of land so that Aboriginal people could have secure tenure of land and redevelop an association with their traditional roots. After the Whitlam years, one finds that the coalition governments took no action in this matter at all. One then moves to the matters which have been covered by Senator Tambling who, however, did not develop that background. We now have the situation in which real attempts are being made to excise, to provide, small areas-and I emphasise again that it is 0.17 per cent of the whole area of the Northern Territory-of secure land for Aboriginal people to redevelop these associations with their traditional land, to have a place where services can be provided reliably for them-water supplies, sewerage, housing and the like. </PARA>
<PARA> When Senator Tambling talked about this proposal to remove this minuscule area of land from the pastoral leases, he talked about natural justice and the way in which the pastoralists were going to be disadvantaged. It is interesting to notice that many of the cattle properties in the Northern Territory have recently changed hands. The value for which they have changed hands, or the sorts of bids that have been made for these properties, has been such as to indicate that, indeed, there has been very little decline in value. Quite the contrary: the property values have been increasing substantially-for instance, in the Ranken River locality and the Soudan locality. These areas are adjacent to five pastoral leases covering approximately 14,000 square kilometres and held by the North Australian Pastoral Company and run as Alexandria Station. The North Australian Pastoral Company has been the subject of a number of takeover bids in recent years. A large volume of its shares have changed hands. A number of other public companies have also been linked with these bids and takeovers, including Elders IXL Ltd and the Australian Agricultural Company. So, indeed, there has been considerable interest in these properties and the purchase of them even while Aboriginal claims to small portions of the land have been in existence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Jinka pastoral lease was bought in 1988 for $1.3m. That is hardly a property badly affected by Aboriginal land claims. In the Birdum locality two pastoral leases have changed hands in the past few years. Interestingly, these pastoral leases in the Northern Territory have been subject to considerable speculative exchange by foreign companies; they have been bought and sold. Elsey, formerly owned by an Israeli company, was sold to a Hong Kong company. I wonder whether Senator Tambling is attempting to protect the interests of foreign pastoral owners against the claims of indigenous Aboriginal people. The major interest of the new owner is believed to be not in cattle at all but in the development of the homestead area for tourism. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the Amaroo pastoral lease, which Senator Tambling mentioned, the claim over Amaroo is approximately one-fortieth of the total area of that pastoral station. Even while those claims were in place, in 1987 Amaroo station was sold for approximately $1.8m. The purchaser of the pastoral lease in that case was the owner of a neighbouring station and therefore a person well aware of the land claims which lay against that station. Even though that person was aware of the land claims-the claims had been in existence for some time-that station still sold for $1.8m. It is hard to argue that the land claims are significantly decreasing the value of this minuscule portion of land to which the Aboriginal people are laying claim. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, prices paid for pastoral leases have increased sharply in the last three years. Tanami Downs recently sold for $2 1/2m. Two other stations are on the market at the moment for $2.6m and $1.8m. Several stations were transferred on 15 December 1989 for prices believed to be in the region of $1.5m and $2m. Muckaty was sold to a foreign company for tourist development earlier this year for $2m. So the claim which lies behind Senator Tambling's words `for natural justice' I am afraid ring with rather a hollow sound. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not detain the Senate for long. It is not necessary to go over the ground of the history of this debate because it has all been said before. I can recall-it seems like ancient history now-delivering a speech years ago in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly on this matter when the Chief Minister, Paul Everingham, was foolish enough to suspend Standing Orders to allow me to have as much time as I wanted to debate the issue. I spoke for four hours and he never made the same offer again. The reason I recall that is that the combined speeches of all the Northern Territory members who spoke in that debate were put together in a single volume and, for some reason-I am not quite sure why-were sent off by Paul Everingham to every Federal member and senator. No doubt they were thrown straight into the nearest rubbish tin. That is simply an indication of just how long this debate has been going on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have risen briefly tonight to indicate that this debate has been going on for long enough. It started 100 years ago in round terms when pastoral properties first became viable enterprises, in a big way, in the Northern Territory. Those cattle stations became viable largely on the basis of the Aboriginal labour that was employed. Although there has been very much discussion about the history-and it is a fairly unhappy history, indeed-of Aboriginal people on those cattle stations, it is worth reflecting on something that Senator Coulter said before the suspension for dinner that was perfectly true. Rightly or wrongly-whether or not one objects to this being said now, I think it deserves to be said and I am glad Senator Coulter said it-it is interesting to reflect on the amount of discussion that we have so far heard about natural justice in respect of cattle stations because there was not a lot of natural justice in the way Aboriginal people were treated during the history of possession of Aboriginal land by pastoralists in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> I will include one other little piece of history, and one only, in this debate which relates to the way Aboriginal people were treated on cattle stations. People can make their own assessments as to the justice or otherwise that has been meted out to them since. I have a short extract from an extremely handy publication called Equal Wages for Aborigines by Dr Frank Stevens. This is an academic synopsis of the very famous wages case involving Aboriginal pastoral workers in the Northern Territory. It is interesting to note that when the pre-eminent pastoralist of the Northern Territory, Lord Vestey, was running into considerable problems because of declining numbers of Aboriginal workers on his cattle station in the Northern Territory, he sought the assistance of Dr Berndt. Much to Dr Berndt's discomfiture, he discovered that the fact that Lord Vestey was seeking his assistance had nothing to do with the new enlightened attitude on the part of Vestey towards his Aboriginal employees but that he simply wanted Berndt to advise him on what anthropological information would be handy in order to recruit more Aboriginal stockmen for his cattle stations. </PARA>
<PARA> When he did so Berndt made a number of rather radical suggestions to the management of Vestey's as to how perhaps the company could encourage more Aboriginal people to put themselves forward to work for 14 hours a day, which was the average, seven days a week, which were the working conditions on cattle stations, and probably still are. Berndt put forward the extremely radical proposal that in order to attract more Aboriginal people to work these hours Vestey's may consider the prospect of actually paying them for working. The response was very interesting. It is outlined by Dr Frank Stevens in his publication Equal Wages for Aborigines:</PARA>
<PARA>Over a period of time Berndt made a series of suggestions to the management concerning the improvement of conditions for the Aborigines and the introduction of a small cash wage. The company was at first incensed by some of his suggestions and they endeavoured to manipulate the administration into carrying out the improvements. </PARA>
<PARA>The administration is the administration of the Northern Territory Government. I continue:</PARA>
<PARA>A recommendation for the introduction of cash rewards was flatly rejected with the terse reply: `We are opposed to the payment of wages to natives, and consider that there has been enough trouble with wage systems. Money seems to be the root of all evil'. </PARA>
<PARA>Coming from Vestey's, I thought that was pretty cute. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. As Senator Tate has interjected quite accurately, one of the things Vestey's was famous for in its operations in Australia was that, despite the millions of pounds, as the currency then was, that it extracted from this country, it was proud of the fact that it never paid taxes. Berndt went on to comment on the company's rejection of his radical suggestion that Aboriginal people might actually be given a little bit of money for their work. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Here were the same tendencies that marked the control of `white' workers in Europe in the nineteenth century before the `sweating' of labour for quick profits began to give way to more enlightened tactics. In both cases, there were assumptions that workers were plentiful, that it was unnecessary to worry about the future supply. </PARA>
<PARA> Vestys is anxious to retain the status quo-at least as long as they can manage it. They resent any interference with `their natives' and look on Government regulations as unjust and annoying `red tape' to be circumvented wherever possible. Some, on these stations, as on others, actively dislike the Aborigines, and express indifference or positive pleasure at the thought of their ultimate extinction. </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately for the people of those days, Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory succeeded in surviving with their culture and lives to some extent intact. Here we are today, a hundred years on, debating the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter also said accurately that in respect of the areas provided for scheduling in this Bill we are debating 0.176 per cent of the Northern Territory's land mass. It is interesting that many people in government in the Northern Territory-I recall quite well when this happened-can embrace with great pleasure and public enthusiasm the prospect of a Northern Territory pastoral property, thousands and thousands of square kilometres of it, being acquired by an absentee Los Angeles dentist but at the same time find it extraordinarily difficult to come to terms with people who have been indigenous to this country for thousands of years occupying the same land. </PARA>
<PARA> Another statistic which is very relevant to this debate and to the amendments that have been brought before this chamber by Senator Tambling is that only 26 per cent of all of the land that is legally available for claim by Aboriginals-that is, stock routes which are claimable-is the subject of scheduling under this Bill. On balance I do not think that is a bad deal for all concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be reluctant to see this debate prolonged any further. Obviously, as is always the case with these debates, neither side will get a reasonable percentage of what they want. Certainly, Aboriginal people do not think that they are getting a magnificent deal from this legislation. They have some validity to feel that way. Nevertheless, at long last, unbelievable as it may seem, we are within touching distance of achieving a resolution of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason that I have risen tonight is that I am very conscious of the fact that this week we are spending the last days of the parliamentary decade in this chamber. The 1980s are a few days away, in parliamentary terms, from being finished. It would be a major disgrace and a major scandal for this Parliament if, after 100 years of this problem, and if after at least 20 years in contemporary history of no resolution of this problem on behalf of what are arguably-in my view, beyond argument-the most deprived citizens in this country, we finished this decade of the 1980s in this Parliament without having resolved it. I urge all members of the Senate to approach the balance of this debate in that spirit and let us have done with it. Let us have this legislation processed. Let us have it go back to the House of Representatives to be finalised. Let us have it assented to by the Governor-General. Let us at long last in the 1990s get on with the job of actually providing titles and giving people some decent living conditions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After the eloquence of Senator Collins, drawing on very extensive knowledge, I feel that my contribution can only be rather threadbare. It is an historic moment, as Senator Collins has suggested, because we are within touch, or perhaps, to use a more Australian expression, within cooee of passing the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 1989. It needs to be emphasised that not only is it a matter for this chamber to come to a resolution tonight, as I understand it will, for the House of Representatives to concur and for the Governor-General to signify his assent-we are the national Parliament engaged in this great enterprise on behalf of the most disadvantaged people in the Australian community-but I think it is only fair to say that this is a joint enterprise with the Government and the Parliament of the Northern Territory. The success of this particular project will depend on the continuing goodwill, no doubt, of those who have been associated with the very extensive and arduous negotiations which have reached their high point over the last several months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory are to be commended for the agreement which they reached at that high and exalted level, taking political responsibility for the compromise, as Senator Collins quite properly calls it, which is embodied in this legislation and in complementary legislation by the Northern Territory Assembly, and whilst they take the political credit, I think one has to say that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, deserves much of the political credit for his continual concern for a resolution of this issue. I believe that, if it had not been for his persistence in the face of many hurdles being raised, we would not be at the stage that both governments and both parliaments are very happily at, at the end of 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Tambling's caricature of Mr Gerry Hand has even a touch of being correct, it is a misinterpretation of the passionate concern that Mr Hand has had for the betterment of the living conditions of those Aboriginals living in the pastoral areas of the Northern Territory, his passion that they should have such a secure title to land that they can enjoy that feeling of security and that bonding with the land, which I think we can in a measure understand but which has such a depth to it in the relationship of Aboriginal people to these areas of land. The obtaining of justice for these Aboriginal families, groups and individuals will be a significant breakthrough. </PARA>
<PARA> When one considers the history of Aboriginal people in relation to the pastoral proprietors, as outlined in part by Senator Collins, one can see how the Australian community, as represented by both its governments in parliaments, has reached a much more mature understanding of the proper way in which those Aboriginal communities ought to be able to enjoy some secure title to their land. That struggle, which has appeared so fruitless and with which people have persevered against great odds over the last decade or so, is now reaching its fulfilment. I believe that it is to the credit of all those concerned that we have reached this necessary prelude-and it is only a prelude in my view-to the improvement in the living conditions of the Aboriginals concerned. I believe that secure title will enable the provision of those facilities in those areas and give Aboriginal communities those minimum living conditions which are so essential for their health and well-being. In particular such living conditions are essential for the health and well-being of the babies and youngsters who will be born into, be nurtured in and live part of their lives in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> This is indeed a very significant moment and, despite what Senator Tambling said, I believe that it is the result of extensive and considerable consultation. It is certainly the result of extensive, considerable and long-running discussions-one might say that is a slightly different word-but I believe that `consultation' is certainly the correct term to use in relation to consultations with the Northern Territory Government. The working party formed in 1987 was an important part in this process of consultation. It is certainly the case that, after the signing of the memorandum of agreement by the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister, consultation continued with the Northern Territory at officer level. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that those consultations have been going on and will go on because it is quite clearly part of the scheme of this Bill that regulations can be made which will help deal with misgivings or difficulties that might arise in the way in which the boundaries are scheduled. Of course, once the grant is made of the interest in land that will be the end of it and the process has to stop; there has to be a reasonable coming to an end of the consultations. But there is no intention in the passage of this legislation tonight, or through the Parliament in the next few days, for there to be some sort of cutting off of the consultation, either with the Northern Territory Government as an elected representative group representing all Territorians, or with the pastoralists, perhaps represented most notably by the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association Inc. Those consultations can continue; the Bill specifically envisages that those consultations will continue; and I am quite sure that, if any case can be made out that there is some unreasonable interference with cattle operations on pastoral properties as a result of the way in which a boundary is drawn, that can be dealt with, and I am sure an undertaking supplementary to the drawing of boundaries can also ensure that the legitimate interests of the pastoralists are accommodated. </PARA>
<PARA> But the primary interest to be accommodated at this historic moment, as Senator Collins puts it and I am sure it is supported by all honourable senators, is the future of our Aboriginal brothers and sisters in the Territory. I believe that this is a moment in which the whole Parliament can take great pleasure. We have a justifiable pride in our democracy, in our ability to take a contentious issue and, even if it takes longer than many would hope, in the end we resolve it in a relatively peaceful, non-violent manner by the coming together of the heads of our respective elected governments. This legislation flows from those agreements. I certainly commend the second reading of this Bill to the chamber and I hope that the Senate will give the rest of the proceedings a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA> (1). Page 1, clause 2, lines 9 and 10, leave out the clause, insert the following clause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``2. This Act commences at the commencement of subsection 50 (2d) and (2e) of the Principal Act.''. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment No. 1 relates to the commencement clause which is, of course, most important. As I alluded to in the second reading debate, the amendment would make entry into force of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 1989 dependent on the proclamation of the 1987 amendments which will put an end to any further claims over stock routes and reserves. The fact that this matter was recognised so strongly by the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Holding, was expressed in the 1985 agreement between Mr Holding, the Northern Territory Government, the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association and land councils which was clearly based on a cessation of all claims in return for a system of granting excisions. The long history of the negotiations in that period since 1985 was very well set out in the two comprehensive folders that I tabled during the second reading debate. </PARA>
<PARA> In the saga of seeking to resolve this matter, and I accept most of the comments made by Senator Tate in his closing address, the issue needs to be addressed very profoundly and in a very historical context. As will be noted, the Opposition supported the second reading of this Bill and in fact it supports the major principles and the memorandum, that was reached between the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. Our major problems relate to technical and administrative matters. The Committee will note that the three amendments that I will be moving this evening are all of that nature. This particular amendment reflects very much on our belief that unfortunately we cannot trust Minister Hand because of the process that has gone on since he became the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in 1987. I think I demonstrated that during the second reading debate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting also to note the comments over the last year or so of the Australian Democrats, and in particular Senator Macklin. I am very well aware that the Australian Democrats supported the important provisions of the legislation that was passed in 1987 and has not yet come into force. I would also remind the Senate that I incorporated some correspondence in Senate debate last Monday, 11 December. The correspondence was between the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and myself. One of the questions I put to him was this:</PARA>
<PARA>The 6/7 September Memorandum says that, upon enactment of the scheduling legislation the Commonwealth will then proclaim the June 1987 amendments. Page 7 of your Second Reading Speech says, after referring to the `granting of certain parts of existing land claims' that the 1987 amendments will be proclaimed `at the same time'. My understanding of the September agreement is that the proclamation would be made upon enactment of the present Bill, that is, on the very same day. Since the words used in your speech give rise to uncertainty would you be prepared to state in the parliament, exactly when the amendments will be proclaimed?</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will have noted from that incorporated correspondence that the Minister's reply was anything but reassuring. I hope that the Democrats paid particular regard to the reply of the Minister where he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am not in a position yet to tell you the precise date on which the amendments to section 50 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 will be proclaimed. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Government is really serious about meeting its commitment under the memorandum, I believe it will have no difficulty in accepting this amendment. If the Democrats are really serious about the expectations that they have of the Government meeting the full commitment that it was a party to in respect of Aboriginal people, I believe they also will have no difficulty in accepting the amendment. I will be very interested to hear the comments of the Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite clear that there is a sequential idea built into the memorandum of agreement which I referred to in my second reading remarks. The memorandum states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Upon enactment of the scheduling legislation the Commonwealth will then proclaim the June 1987 amendments to the Land Rights Act . . . </PARA>
<PARA>When we look for the further elaboration of that in the second reading speech, it is tolerably clear that priority is the amendment of the legislation which we are undertaking now. This legislation provides for the granting of certain types of existing land claims to stock routes and reserves. It is important that the legislation be proclaimed so that this matter can be finally and comprehensively dealt with. It is important, I acknowledge, that the proclamation of section 50 of the land rights Act proceed as quickly as possible, limiting the right to claim stock routes and reserves. In other words, the existing claims-or the remainder of the claims-will be withdrawn and the land will be available for inclusion in the relevant pastoral leases if the Northern Territory wishes to take that action. I have no doubt that it generally will. </PARA>
<PARA> With this legislation we are trying to ensure that the will of the Parliament is carried into effect fully by the granting of certain interests in land. That is what this Bill is attempting to achieve. When enacted, I hope it is effective for that purpose. As soon as those grants of land are finally made, it would be an appropriate time to proclaim the amendments to section 50 of the land rights Act. I am sure that the undertaking given and understood as part of the general settlement of this issue undoubtedly will be acknowledged and the undertaking will be observed. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think, given the goodwill that has been evidenced on all sides by the two governments involved, we need hold any fears about the actual proclamation of the amendments to section 50 of the land rights Act. It is well understood that that is the deal. As soon as the secure title is granted to the Aboriginal communities-and, in principle, everyone in this chamber has agreed that they ought to obtain that title-the proclamation will then occur. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The amendment we are dealing with involves an interesting principle. The difficulty is that we are dealing with a piece of amending legislation which relates to the 1987 legislation. This principle has been raised recently in another piece of legislation by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee which pointed to the problem that we are now facing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Tambling points to the fact that I successfully moved an amendment which had some interesting ongoing ramifications for drafting procedures in this place. It dealt with the time of proclamation of various Acts. I have been seeking to establish a definite exercise with regard to when Acts will come into force and when they will be proclaimed. Senator Tambling pointed to a number of speeches I made on unproclaimed legislation in which I quite clearly pointed out that unless a piece of legislation is going to be proclaimed, it seems very sensible simply to repeal it and not have it sitting on the books. However, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee asked-Senator Collins will probably remember this better than I-with regard to, I think, crimes legislation, whether it would be possible to go back and look at the proclamation date on previous pieces of legislation which had not yet been proclaimed and to which an amending piece of legislation was being moved. The difficulties that have arisen with that suggestion are outlined fairly well in the Minister's response, and they also would occur with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tambling is seeking to go further with this amendment and to tie the two together in such a way that one would be dependent on the other in terms of proclamation. He asserted the Australian Democrats' support for the previous piece of legislation, which is probably putting it a bit too strongly. If Senator Tambling read my speech carefully he would see that ours was a very lukewarm response to, and support for, that piece of legislation. Indeed, I quote from the committee stage on 27 May 1987 when I said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . I must admit I still have some unease about moving back in any way from the strong position of a veto being available to Aboriginal people over their land. I am reminded particularly of the various royal commissions and other commissions of inquiry, such as the Seaman Aboriginal Land Inquiry, which pointed very strongly and very forcibly to the fact that recovery of land is sensible only in the context of total control of that land. It is a proposition that I support very strongly and hence I have unease about any propositions to put more pressure on the traditional owners to come to an accommodation with a mining company when they may not necessarily wish to come to an accommodation with the mining company, at least not in a time frame. </PARA>
<PARA>The point I was raising was our unease with that piece of legislation. However, I went on to point out that we would not be opposing the legislation since, immediately prior to its passage in 1987, the then Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Evans, had gone to the Northern Territory and had got agreement from the traditional owners to that piece of legislation. It did not make any sense to oppose it, but I did not express great support on behalf of my party for it. It seemed to us at that time, and still does in many ways-although it has led to a better outcome than we could have predicted-that it was moving away from the very strong control which we have as a policy, and which we wish to see Aboriginals having over title to their land. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not so enamoured of the earlier piece of legislation that we want to do cartwheels to get it into force, but there is an additional difficulty with this piece of legislation, and that is the one which has just been pointed out by the Minister for Justice. We are dealing with a piece of legislation which, by negotiations, is dealing with a problem in the Northern Territory. As much as Senator Tambling would want me to put my faith totally in the Northern Territory Government, I cannot say that I am all that enamoured of doing so. I am quite happy to leave the Commonwealth Government with as much leverage on the Northern Territory Government on this particular matter as it can possibly get. I refer particularly to the extraordinary amount of litigation the Northern Territory has entered into on such matters over the years as being a very good reason why one should be very careful in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that care on behalf of the Commonwealth on this, in taking its responsibility for this particular Act, is exceptionally important. On my reading of the exercise that we are dealing with at the moment, any ratification or proclamation of the 1987 Act would, I think, leave us in the legal situation-I would not ask the Minister to comment on this legally, but I understand that this would probably be the case-whereby the Northern Territory Government would in fact have the power at that stage to allow people to build on the land, in which case it would then become alienated land, in which case it would then be removed from the ambit of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not about to go down that track, because that would be the complete opposite track to what the Australian Democrats have always stood for-to give as much power as possible to the Aboriginal people in these types of negotiations. We would not have any interest in removing that type of protection offered by section 67a of the Act to the Aboriginal people, and by tying these together we would be forcing the Commonwealth's hand, in part, in that type of negotiating process. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us say that these negotiations have gone on-I do not know how amicable the whole thing has been; it certainly has gone on at length-and are now moving towards some type of conclusion. I think that is probably better left in terms of the negotiating strategies of both of the governments. I believe that the situation has been so fraught, with possibly even double dealing, but certainly quite different perceptions of what everybody else had said up to date, that I think it is far better to leave the Commonwealth untrammelled by such a legislative obligation and give it the maximum negotiating power to conclude what this Act, and, I hope, the complementary Act in the Northern Territory, has already done-that is, to provide those people on pastoral leases with at least some land that they can call their own. </PARA>

I am sure that Senator Tambling would not have foreseen that one of the results of his amendment would be to make the land which appears in parts 2 and 3 of schedule 1 no longer land under claim. That would mean that the protection afforded by section 67a of the Principal Act, which prevents the Northern Territory from granting estates or interest in land under claim, would be lost, and the Northern Territory could, in other words, grant an interest or estate in land in those designated areas. I am quite sure that that is inconsistent with the whole scheme of the Act. I took it to be an unintended consequence. Therefore, I did not press it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This clause is designed to improve the existing definitions of `exploration licence' and `mining interest' for the purposes of part IV of the Act, the so-called 1987 mining regime. As I mentioned in my speech on the second reading of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill, this is the area where Senator Gareth Evans gave a number of commitments to the Northern Territory. It is noted that in relation to clause 2 the Government has already changed its mind about these definitions. I understand that these changes were made at the Northern Territory Government's request.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives it contained a clause 9 which related to the definition of `intending miner'. As we all know, this legislation was put through under the guillotine, as seems to be the case, unfortunately, with so much Aboriginal legislation in the House of Representatives. As Senator Collins said earlier this evening, we give such legislation substantive and good debate and discussion in this chamber. However, the Government put forward two separate amendments to clause 9 and in the end that clause was deleted and does not appear at all in the Bill that is before the Senate. Can the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) assure the Senate that the amendment to the mining regime in an earlier draft of the Bill that never saw the light of day will not be proceeded with? If it is to be proceeded with, what discussions have taken place with the Australian Mining Industry Council or the Northern Territory Government?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important to realise that the history of the matter that Senator Tambling put forward as to the progress of the Bill through the other place is partially correct in that there was such a rush to get the legislation dealt with at 3 a.m. that some difficulties arose in deleting comprehensively those clauses which the Northern Territory Government was unhappy with in relation to what it calls mineral claims. Therefore, some amendments were attempted in the House of Representatives in order to help achieve that amicable resolution which is beginning to characterise the way in which the Federal and Territory governments deal with these matters. I cannot give any undertaking about whether any further legislation dealing with exploration or mineral mining matters may be brought forward in a new parliament, presumably-I do not know when the election will be held, so perhaps that is not correct-or in the next year or so. I believe that what has been evidenced now is the type of consultation which will ensure that what does come forward will have been the subject of the fullest reasonable round of discussions, always retaining the proper primacy of this Parliament in relation to these matters. But I give Senator Tambling the assurance he seeks, at least in relation to the extensive discussions that would precede any such legislation. I do not know of any such legislation. I am not trying to divert attention from some scheme or proposal, but I cannot give the undertaking that there will never be legislation. I simply say that legislation would be brought forward only after that full round of discussions which I believe, as I say, is beginning to characterise our approach in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think there is a sequence here which is quite obvious. Clearly, there were provisions contained in the Bill, so that must have been the subject of government decision. When the Northern Territory expressed concern and said that it had misgivings and that the matter was not fully in accordance with its understanding of what would be appropriate, this Government, in the spirit of cooperation which has marked this exercise, withdrew those clauses. Whether those matters are brought forward and, if so, whether they are in an in principle or an amended and better form from the point of view of the Northern Territory Government are all matters which I honestly believe will be for future decision-making. The question of bringing in a separate Bill in the future will have to be the subject of a separate series of decisions by government, preceded by the sorts of consultations which would attempt to allay those fears which led the Northern Territory Government successfully to ask us not to proceed with those clauses at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendments to section 35 of the principal Act are designed to require the payment of money by land councils to local Aboriginal communities to be made to incorporated bodies. The amendment to section 35 was originally part of a group of amendments, the others of which were taken out of the Bill before it was introduced. Those amendments would have enabled the land councils to make grants, loans or guarantees to Aboriginal incorporated groups. There can be no objection, I believe, to the proposed amendments, which accord with general policy. However, they raise important questions of what is to happen to paragraph 23 (1) (ea) of the Act. That paragraph was inserted in the Act in the 1987 Holding amendments, but again was never proclaimed. If proclaimed, it would be a function of the land councils to: `assist Aboriginals in the area of the Land Council to carry out commercial activities, including resource development, the provision of tourist resources and agricultural activities in any manner that will not cause the Land Council to incur financial liability or enable it to receive financial benefits'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is it the Government's intention to bring this provision into force? All it needs to do is proclaim it. What are its intentions? The Minister for Justice might well recall my letter of 1 November in which I asked the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) whether there was an intention to proclaim section 23 (1) (ea). Mr Hand's reply was peculiar: `It is not my intention to proclaim the paragraph in its present form'. In what form does the Minister think he can proclaim an Act of Parliament other than in the terms in which it has been passed and assented to? Does he mean that he will be proposing other amendments to the Act in the future? Why does the Government not move for the repeal of this paragraph? The provision was originally proposed by the Northern Territory Government to help the Tiwi Land Council and, strictly speaking, it is probably unnecessary. The objective could have been achieved by other means. I direct those questions to the Minister with regard to that clause. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite clear, in principle, that there can be no proclamation of anything other than the section passed by this Parliament, which is to be brought into effect by the proclamation. Obviously, there can be no subterfuge attempt to thwart the will of the Parliament in that respect. I understand that this whole area will need reconsideration in the light of the dropping of the clauses which were not proceeded with in this Bill. Some of those clauses were an attempt to deal with problems which were seen in the application of section 23 (1) (ea). Now that they have not been proceeded with, I am advised that this whole area will need to be reconsidered. Therefore, it would be fair to conclude from the advice I have received that there need be no fear of imminent proclamation of that particular provision. It may well be that if its proclamation would not be as effective as was hoped when the Parliament enacted that particular section, it would need to be amended. That would be a matter for proper consideration by both Houses of Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>

As the Minister will be well aware from questions, debate and documents that he tabled in this Parliament last week, the Northern Land Council is in effect facing very serious problems. In fact, the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account (ABTA) will be broke in three years unless the land councils pull their horns in. So much depends on the mining royalty areas, which must to a certain extent grow even less in the future.

As we all know, a major review into the financial situation of the land councils, particularly the Northern Land Council, is also being undertaken.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The provisions contained in clause 9 relate to the provisions which were originally contained in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 1989 and which related to interests under the Northern Territory Mining Act called `mineral claims'. After discussion with the Northern Territory Government, officers of that Government made it clear that the provisions proposed to be adopted in this Bill might not adequately mesh with the Northern Territory Mining Act. The bulk of those provisions were therefore removed in that very early morning session that we have already discussed. However, the provisions of clause 9 were inadvertently overlooked. This clause has no effect given the deletion of the other provisions relating to mineral claims and ought to be removed. In other words, it is a piece of housekeeping which ought to have been undertaken in the other place in order to acknowledge comprehensively the concerns of the Northern Territory Government about the way in which our draftsman had attempted to be helpful in dealing with mineral claims as understood under the Northern Territory Mining Act. This is merely an attempt to finally dispose of the matter in a way which is agreeable to both governments. Therefore, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>

An earlier draft of the Bill that I saw had been expressed to assume that Coronation Hill was or would become Aboriginal land, but this did not make it to the Bill as introduced into the Parliament. I note that there is no Aboriginal land in the Coronation Hill area, although some is certainly under claim.

The proposed section will apply only if the land or any part of the land referred to in the proposed section is or becomes Aboriginal land.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clause 12 relates to the functions of the Aboriginal land commissioner. Some of the issues are similar to those that we raised in our consideration with regard to clause 2 relating to commencement. This clause as drafted appears to give effect to the 6-7 September agreement between the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Northern Territory Chief Minister which says that, upon enactment of the scheduling legislation, the Commonwealth will then proclaim the June 1987 amendments to the land rights Act. In the second reading speech, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) put the matter rather cautiously and in a different way. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Under the terms of the memorandum, the Commonwealth undertook to amend the Land Rights Act as a matter of priority, to provide for the granting of certain parts of existing land claims to stock routes and reserves. At the same time the earlier amendment to the Act limiting claims over stock routes and travelling stock reserves will be proclaimed. </PARA>
<PARA>That leads to the question: at the same time as what? Why does the speech refer to limited claims when the 1984 deal related to their abolition? It takes the issue a bit further. On 1 November I wrote to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs pointing out the discrepancy between his words and those of the agreement. In that letter to the Minister I said:</PARA>
<PARA>The 6/7 September Memorandum says that, upon enactment of the scheduling legislation, the Commonwealth will then proclaim the June 1987 amendments. Page 7 of your Second Reading Speech says, after referring to the ``granting of certain parts of existing land claims'' that the 1987 amendments will be proclaimed ``at the same time''. My understanding of the September agreement is that the proclamation would be made upon enactment of the present Bill, that is, on the very same day. Since the words used in your speech give rise to uncertainty, would you be prepared to state in the parliament exactly when the amendments will be proclaimed?</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister's reply to me was arrogant and gives rise to some very real concerns. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am not in a position yet to tell you the precise date on which the amendments to section 50 . . . will be proclaimed. </PARA>
<PARA>He now says that he is not bound by the memorandum; nor will he keep to what he said in his second reading speech. The Minister is hedging his bets. What is needed now is a clear mechanism which will ensure that no further claims over stock routes or stock reserves will be allowed. The Minister has failed to honour Mr Holding's promise by proclaiming the 1987 amendments. It would have been desirable had we been successful with the amendment to clause 2. I therefore seek a further statement from the Minister with regard to his statement of `at the same time' and the limiting effects of the claims. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have to understand that tonight we are involved in the legislative culmination of a very arduous political process. It was clearly understood by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Chief Minister that both governments would ensure and, with the cooperation of this chamber, achieve the passage through their respective parliaments of legislation which would provide secure title for the living areas of Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory. It is in relation to achieving that objective that the proclamation of those sections which would limit claims over stock routes and travelling stock reserves would be achieved. When that parliamentary intention is fulfilled by the granting of interests in land the proclamation will be undertaken. There is no attempt to subvert or unduly wrench the memorandum of agreement away from its original meaning or intention between the Chief Minister and the Prime Minister. It must be acknowledged that there has to be a certain sequence, that the carrying into effect of that primary intention is the necessary condition which must be fulfilled before the proclamation can occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the next few days we will be setting the scene for that proclamation to be made which has eluded all political movers in this particular saga over many years. We are now laying the very secure basis for that proclamation to be made. It will not occur on the same day as the enactment of the legislation. It will occur. It is part of the political settlement. It has to be seen in that light. I believe that with the goodwill that has been evidenced from all parties, certainly at a government to government level, there is confidence that that undertaking will be honoured. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the convenience of the Committee I will deal with clause 14 first. This particular provision provides for access over alienated land to areas of land described in new parts 2 and 3 of schedule 1, which are parts of this legislation. The Northern Territory Government agreed to legislate in its own Parliament for a similar provision. This has now occurred and indicates the level of cooperation between the two governments which has characterised the process which has led to the passage of this legislation. In other words, this provision is no longer necessary because the Northern Territory has achieved exactly the same object through its own parliamentary methods. So the Commonwealth is happy to withdraw the clause in deference to, and in recognition of, the move by the Northern Territory to achieve the same objective. That having been done, clause 5 can also be further amended to delete reference to proposed new subsection 68a (1). This provision would have given the land councils power to enter into agreements for the purpose of obtaining access under proposed new section 68a to land contained in new parts 2 and 3 to schedule 1. As the Government now proposes not to proceed with proposed new section 68a, this provision is no longer required. So, in short, what we sought to achieve has been achieved by the Northern Territory Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (5) The Minister must give written notice of the application to the Land Council for the area in which the area to which the application relates is situated and the Land Council must inform, in an appropriate fashion, the Aboriginals who are entitled by Aboriginal tradition to the use or occupation of the last-mentioned area of the particulars of the application. </PARA>
<PARA> (6) The Minister, after taking into consideration:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the reasons given for the application and any further representations made by the applicant; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) any representations in relation to the application made by or on behalf of the Aboriginals who are entitled by Aboriginal tradition to the use or occupation of the scheduled area or gazetted area;</PARA>

<PARA> (b) where the decision involves the alteration of the boundaries of the area-whether the legitimate use and enjoyment of the land in the area by the persons likely to live in the area will be unreasonably effected as a result of its boundaries being altered. </PARA>

<PARA> (13) In this section:</PARA>
<PARA> `modifying' includes the substitution of a description or diagram for another description or diagram. </PARA>
<PARA> `Tribunal' means the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>Schedule 1 lists all of the properties which, when the Act began in 1978, were automatically capable of being granted to Aboriginal land trusts, once formed. No claims assessment process by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner was needed. Schedule 1 to the present Bill sets out the list of areas to be inserted in parts 2 and 3 of schedule 1 of the principal Act; thus they are automatically capable of grant to land trusts, once formed. The only other time that this procedure was followed was when Uluru-Ayers Rock-was transferred and, in that case, the deal involved a lease back to the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. In the case of the present Bill 2,312 square kilometres or, as was mentioned earlier, 26 per cent of the ambit claims, are to be transferred. That is not a bad outcome for the land councils and the claimants. This clause will allow the Minister to vary the descriptions of land by regulation up to the time of their actual grant to a land trust. That the Government saw a need for such provisions shows just how hastily the whole schedule has been drawn up. As a matter of law the Minister could vary the areas by increasing or decreasing the areas in the Bill quite substantially. In his second reading speech the Minister, Mr Hand, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The provision is not intended to permit major changes to the area of land to be granted and the power will not be available until the land has actually been granted. </PARA>
<PARA>That is in Hansard, page 2157. That is all very well but as I have said earlier, how can the Minister be trusted? If we look at clause 4 of the Bill, the power to change would be available for two years during which time a lot of bargaining could go on. I refer again to the letter I wrote to the Minister on 1 November in which I asked whether he would be prepared to give an assurance that the modification would be limited only. His reply was to decline to give such an assurance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's amendment proposes a different approach. We propose a new section 77c. The section would lay down a procedure which would require the Minister to make sure, in relation to each area listed in parts 2 and 3 of schedule 1, that a person with an interest in land in the vicinity of the land to be granted had been given an opportunity to have his representations considered as to any detriment that person might suffer and for the Minister to consider and respond to such representations. The land in parts 2 and 3 of schedule 1 was listed without any consultation with the affected pastoralists. I tabled copies of these letters to Mr Hand on Monday, 11 December which show this to be the case. Nobody knows how the areas were decided on. The Minister has reported to Parliament that the Aboriginal claimants have made undertakings about access to water and similar matters for pastoralists in the vicinity. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has taken steps to ensure that pastoral operations are not unreasonably interfered with by the granting of these areas of land. Where appropriate I have sought relevant undertakings from the Aboriginal claimants for the continued use of station roads, bores or infrastructure by the pastoral lessees. In some instances, the areas have been amended to exclude access corridors or areas of particular concern to pastoralists or the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I go into the detail of the undertakings that have been given, or the land which has been given up by claimants, I want to make two general observations. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, these undertakings are really about sharing the country and the resources. In acceding to my requests for undertakings, the Aboriginal claimants have again demonstrated a willingness to share their land with pastoral operations. This continued willingness to share, and to compromise, is a real tribute to the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, where possible, every effort has been made to resolve issues of particular concern raised with me by the Northern Territory by a letter of 25 September, 1989. However, I wish to express my disappointment that the Northern Territory has not continued to inform me or officers of my Department of its concerns in relation to the areas to be scheduled as consultations have progressed. While Aboriginal people have remained willing to compromise, the Northern Territory has again shown a disinclination to consider realistically how detriment issues might be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, it seems that it is the Aboriginal people who are expected to make all the compromises, and I want to detail now the undertakings they have given. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee will note that the Minister talked of Aboriginal people being asked to make all of the compromises. Who asked them? Not the cattlemen; they were not consulted at all. Not the Northern Territory Government-Mr Perron has made that quite clear. In truth the compromises were all dreamed up by the Minister himself. In his second reading speech the Minister then listed the undertakings he said he had given. I have obtained a document, apparently prepared officially, containing extracts from what appear to be letters from the land councils. I ask for leave to incorporate this document in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since 1 November I have been trying to get answers to a number of questions about the areas to be scheduled and what the Minister did in relation to detriment. Even though his Department provided him with a reply to my letter, the Minister chose to reply to me only last Monday-41 days after the original letter. I asked the Minister for copies of the actual texts of the undertakings. He has declined to provide them saying that they will be discussed with the lessees after the areas have been scheduled. Of course, it would be too late then to do more than make minor adjustments to the boundaries. I am forced to draw the conclusion that the Parliament, once again, is not to be told all that it is entitled to know.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Letters to the Minister from many pastoral lessees explaining in detail how their livelihoods will be affected were tabled in the Senate last Monday evening, 11 December; yet, we have seen no sign of concern nor willingness to consult by the Minister. All he has said is that he will talk to the pastoralists after the Bill goes through. What is the use of that? The Opposition is proposing a procedure under which the Minister will be required to consider representations as to detriment before the areas in the schedule can be granted. None of this would have been necessary had the Minister talked frankly with the pastoral lessees before settling the schedule. But he just ignored their requests, quite reasonable in the circumstances, and settled what went into the schedule in some kind of deal with the land councils. </PARA>
<PARA> Our amendment seeks to give those adversely affected some belated and limited rights to put their cases and to have their concerns as citizens determined in accordance with the principles of natural justice. The question that remains is: who will pay for the fencing, the rebuilding of stockyards and the like, the new bores and the related works which these grants will necessitate? Will the Minister who is sitting at the table, Senator Tate, give an answer to those matters? The limited guarantees proposed in our amendment would not be needed had the land claims made over stock routes and reserves been subject to consideration by the Land Commissioner in the usual way. Then the issue of detriment would have received proper attention. The Minister has paid no attention to detriment issues. Instead he has had some kind of secret talks with the land councils and has then given Parliament a partially true account of what was agreed. The record shows that. As the automatic scheduling process bypasses the usual checks and balances, that is the very reason why our amendment is needed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to the beginning of Senator Tambling's remarks. It is very clear from the Minister's second reading speech that the method of modifying the boundaries is clearly set out in that most formal indication of the Government's intention in relation to the Bill where it states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>There is a provision which will allow for the modification by regulation of the boundaries of the areas granted under the new parts of schedule 1. This power is provided to allow for minor correction of descriptions of the land where further survey or other evidence suggests that the boundaries have not been accurately described. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision is not intended to permit major changes to the area of land to be granted and the power will not be available after the land has actually been granted. </PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear from that that the fears which Senator Tambling seems to harbour, that there could be some large scale subversion of the will of the Parliament as expressed in the schedule, could not be realised. He claims that he did not receive satisfactory assurances from the Minister that anything but minor amendments might be sought to be achieved by the use of this regulation-making power. I understand that the Minister, in his response to Senator Tambling, pointed to his second reading speech and I think I have clarified exactly what he pointed out. I am sure that the Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and its Chairman, Senator Collins, would, when looking at that regulation-making power, have due regard to the second reading speech and ensure that this chamber were alerted if it were thought that that the regulation-making power had moved outside what was intended by this Parliament in giving it its passage. That is the first point to be made in my answer. </PARA>
<PARA> The second series of assertions made by Senator Tambling concerns the lack of consultation, as he sees it, with the pastoralists in relation to these matters. I hate to fall into the use of truisms and so on, but it takes two to tango. My understanding of the history of this matter is that, when both governments set up a working party in 1987, with the intention of negotiating agreement between the parties concerned for the grant of land, they went on a bit of tour of the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association (NTCA) was invited to participate, but declined, and attended some meetings only as observers. Representatives of the working party visited a large number of pastoral properties affected by the proposals. However, some pastoralists declined to meet with the working party. At this time the salient features of each area of concern were on the table for discussion. Pastoralists cannot now say they have not been consulted. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite all this, Mr Hand has recently written to the President of the NTCA, Mr Dyer, reiterating the Government's intention that the grant of these areas will not cause unreasonable interference with cattle operations on pastoral properties affected. In particular cases the Minister has sought and received certain undertakings from the Aboriginal claimants, some of which have been pointed to in the Minister's second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have already pointed out, the passage of this legislation and its enactment by the assent of the Governor-General, does not bring to an end the sorts of consultations which can lead to a modification of these boundaries in order to ensure that the legitimate interests of the pastoralists are protected. But Senator Tambling would have to agree that for many years the areas concerned have been pretty well known to the parties involved. The pastoralists, who were members or supporters of the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association, have not always participated, even when invited to do so by the working party set up and supported by both governments. </PARA>
<PARA> In that situation there comes a time when the elected representatives have to make the decisions-as Senator Tambling said during the second reading debate, which I listened to in my office-on behalf of all the constituents and residents of, and persons with interest in that Northern Territory. That has been done in terms of the schedule. It is not absolutely hard and fast. I am sure that if Mr Dyer and the pastoralists-when confronted by the reality of the expressed wills of the governments and parliaments at the national and territorial levels-come to their senses in the amendments in which they seek to ensure that they will not be unduly or unreasonably interfered with in regard to the operations of their land, some rescheduling can take place, subject, always, to the disallowance power of this Senate which, I suppose, remains the final arbiter of any modifications which are attempted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate many of the issues just raised by the Minister and the need for delicacy in dealing with this particular problem. In fact, during my speech in the second reading debate I tabled two very comprehensive documents which set out in a lot of very fine detail the process of negotiation that has taken place since 1985. I would certainly commend those documents to the Minister for very close appraisal, because they certainly need it. I am well aware that many pastoralists believe that the actual areas to be granted, the bits and pieces of stock routes and reserves, are unlikely to become, in some cases, real lived-in areas. In many cases the grant of these pieces of land may be little more than symbolic. The Senate will recall that one of the quotes I gave during my second reading speech was from some Aboriginal people who very seriously disputed the particular piece of land that was to be made available and the conflicting issues that were arising with regard to Aboriginals. That was on Stirling Station and the representation was made by the Wilora community, who felt that there could be some subsequent issues arising.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In any case, the usefulness of many of these areas will be limited unless they are fenced and serviced with water. As I said earlier, we need to establish who will pay for many of these issues and whether the discussions between the respective governments have reached any understanding. It may well be argued that it could be some time before these areas could become occupied. I would hope that the Commonwealth Government, in honouring the commitments that it is making in this legislation, will ensure that the budgetary provisions are available for the proper servicing of infrastructures that will be so important for communities where Aboriginals will be living with these particular grants. I would hope that the Minister is not proposing to hold off the proclamations of section 50 (2) (d) and (2) (e) until the grants of land have been completed. If he were to do that, it would entirely contrary to the spirit of the September memorandum between the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Chief Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the Northern Territory Government understood that there would be a need for the sort of fine tuning that is represented by the regulation-making power that we are discussing, but was insistent upon making it clear in the Bill-I heard about this some time this morning-that when the grant of an interest is made, that ability to make a modification ceases. In fact, that has been put in in the very express terms that are used at the request of the Northern Territory Government, and with a sunset clause of two years. So in fact, this particular provision has been the subject of discussion with the Northern Territory Government, as I understand it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to Senator Tambling's worries about the way in which finance may be made available to deal with the grants and excisions concerned, there are, I guess, many levels of responsibility that might be assumed. Quite clearly, one of the purposes in trying to give secure title to certain Aboriginals in relation to their living areas is to then provide a secure base for the provision of those facilities which will be made available under many of the ordinary programs which are funded by the various agencies under Commonwealth legislation. More particularly, in relation to Senator Tambling's query about fencing and water diversion-I did not make a note-I am advised that in each of the last three years Commonwealth Budgets have been drawn up and an appropriation has been sought from the Parliament of some $2m in relation to providing precisely the sorts of moneys that might be required to carry out the consequential matters on the ground that would flow from the coming into effect of these particular provisions. So already the Commonwealth has, in its own Budgets, indicated the sort of commitment to make moneys available in relation to the grants and excisions which Senator Tambling refers to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to Senator Tambling's amendments, I ask whether there is a printing error in clause 4 in that presumably it is intended to insert after subsection (1a) proposed subsection (1aa), rather than after subsection (1). While that is being considered, I will move on to the more substantive matter; that is, the alternative regime proposed by Senator Tambling. I have heard what the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) has said and I think in the normal course of events when one considers discretions contained in Acts of Parliament there has to be a fair degree of goodwill accorded to the decision-maker or the person charged with exercising the discretion, in most cases the Minister. In this case I think that there is some very real concern that the way in which the clause is currently worded there would be available enormous discretion which may well result in the striking of a balance which would not be regarded as an even one. I heard what the Minister said in retailing Mr Hand's second reading comments, but the reality is that relatively minor changes can be made which can have relatively major consequences. The definition of `modifying', as far as I can see, simply comes down to making a change, perhaps somewhat lesser in degree than what is sought to be amended; nonetheless, there is a fair degree of scope for change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not see why in this area there should not be the ability to approach the courts and to have the exercise of a judicial discretion struck effectively on the balance of probabilities in order to determine whether there has been a significant detriment. As I say, there may be a minor change, but if as a result of that there is a significant consequence and that consequence results in an unreasonable affecting of the rights to or use or enjoyment of the land, then I fail to see why in this instance the Government would not allow what by now are normal administrative procedures to operate. As the Minister will be aware, I think that the 1970s was a decade when we saw a plethora of administrative law ranging from the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act through to the establishment of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Ombudsman and freedom of information legislation. All of those Acts really required decision-makers to provide reasons, to act impartially and to provide the opportunity to be heard which we now find encapsulated in the concept of natural justice. That overwhelms administrative law in this day and age. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought the Minister would be assiduous in wanting to promote those sorts of rights as a matter of course. What we seem to have here is a significant exception to the general rule which could mean that there is a significant detriment which can be addressed only by the good offices of the Minister. I would have thought that applicants and respondents would both feel much happier if the ultimate decision were to be made by an impartial tribunal in the event that one is dissatisfied. That is really all that Senator Tambling is seeking to achieve. It seems to me that there is, as it stands, quite a considerable degree of latitude for the Minister to horse-trade, to come up with what may be on the surface only relatively minor amendments; nonetheless they have fairly significant consequences. As things stand, absolutely nothing could be done about that other than perhaps to plead for mercy. I invite the Minister-and indeed, the Australian Democrats who presumably espouse the cause of natural justice-to indicate why it is that in this situation one should not have those normal rights that are accorded to litigants in other areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would rather put this matter in a more positive way than have Senator Tambling and Senator Alston. This Parliament wants to retain control over the definitions of boundaries so that it is not left to the good offices of the Minister to `plead for mercy', as Senator Alston put it. Because these amendments are to be made by regulation, the very distinguished Chairman of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Senator Collins, will be able to inform this chamber whether the modification of the areas falls outside the regulation-making power as interpreted, quite properly, by reference to the second reading speech of the Minister to which I have referred. We are not in a situation where some sort of arbitrary, unregulated, unsupervised power can be exercised by the Minister in regard to the schedule which is, after all, put there as an expression of this Parliament's understanding of the areas which will be properly claimed by or available to the Aboriginal people as their living areas. If there is to be a modification of the Parliament's will, it is to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal that one should look for assistance in determining whether the modification is in accordance with that will; it is to this Parliament. I believe that we have the mechanisms in place and the personnel to discharge that duty on behalf of this chamber and this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not heard the Minister address the point which I sought to flesh out which was that, in accordance with the spirit of the second reading speech, we can have what is not a major change but one which may result in a major consequence. As the Minister has spelt it out, we are left to rely upon the good offices of the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances or, indeed, a majority of the Parliament, to make a judgment about what does or does not constitute a major consequence or a major change. It would not then be a matter of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) making that decision. The regime spelt out by Senator Tambling envisages that it would only be in the event that that change resulted in a significant detriment that the AAT would be in a position to afford relief. It seems to me that that is a fair and reasonable proposition. One would have to establish two propositions before one was able to succeed at the AAT. One would have to show not only that a change had brought about a significant consequence but also that the change had caused one detriment. That would, of course, only be reasonable in the circumstances because, presumably, that is what would be agreed on both sides of the chamber to be the ultimate intention even though it is not spelt out in the second reading speech excerpt that the Minister has pointed to. I simply ask again: Why should not the Government allow the AAT to make a judgment about a situation where detriment has flowed from a major consequence from a minor change?</PARA></TALK.START>

I believe that the consultation which has taken place-and which we have indicated will take place-in relation to the way in which the modification regulation will operate is quite clearly a saving provision put in to assist those parties involved-principally, of course, the pastoralists concerned. It is an advantage and a concession to them. By listing certain areas of the schedule this Parliament is saying, `This is what we intend should be the living areas available to the Aboriginal people. But, as a concession, we will allow for some modification, some consultation leading to those modifications, to take place over a limited period of time, and that can be best achieved in the way set out in this Bill'. I believe that this is a very comprehensive political settlement. It is not every day that one would say that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) should not have a role in relation to certain exercises of power, but I believe that this is one of those occasions where, after many arduous years of discussion and negotiation, a position has been reached where the schedule represents the will of the Parliament and whatever minor modifications might take place will be in effect brought back for scrutiny to this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So in effect we would be simply agreeing to a rewriting of the schedule. That is the task about which we are concerned this evening. We are in effect endorsing the schedule. We will have an opportunity through the processes of this chamber in relation to disallowance either to confirm the schedule or to rewrite it. In other words, we will be talking about a parliamentary action at all stages, and in that situation I do not believe that the AAT itself has a role in determining the merits of the schedule. In effect, Senator Alston's proposal would lead to-and I am glad I have now come to the point where I think I have a good argument-the AAT being able to modify the schedule or determine whether the schedule should be modified in a particular way or not. That is properly a parliamentary role, and I believe that the processes that I have outlined will secure that role in a way which is traditionally accepted by this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Macklin is waiting, I will sit down. The one point that confused me was the argument in Senator Coulter's speech in the second reading debate with regard to natural justice. Senator Coulter appeared to pick up many of the concerns that all honourable senators share with regard to the plight of Aboriginal people throughout the Northern Territory, and indeed in many areas elsewhere in Australia, where these issues need to be properly addressed. The intention of this legislation is to do that and it meets with the support of all parties in this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But Senator Coulter concentrated on the areas of cultural significance to Aboriginal people, original dispossession and a number of other issues which I thought were rather erroneous given the subject of the debate. He went off at a tangent to discuss recent values of various properties that were changing hands in the Northern Territory. I believe he muddied the waters and confused the debate, whereas this amendment seeks a process for the assessment of detriment, where it is found and how that is to be resolved in a proper and convenient manner. I certainly believe that the amendment proposed by the Opposition should enjoy the support of the Democrats, and I hope that we are not back to seeing another of the `McLean' rules where the Government is calling on the Democrats to cooperate again with it as part of the daily, weekly or monthly process. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. It is always a bad thing to be accused of, but I spared the chamber this during the second reading debate. A constant thread has run through what Senator Tambling has been saying in this debate, which is that one side of the argument, the cattlemen's, is being ignored. It was fascinating in that context to hear Senator Tambling say that, by getting 26 per cent-and I note he agrees with that figure-of that area of land to which Aboriginal people are legally entitled to pursue their claims, the land councils and the Aboriginals, to quote Senator Tambling, got `a great deal out of it'. It was fascinating that he totally excluded every other party from the argument. It is fascinating just how one-sided Senator Tambling can be in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point out to the Committee that indeed that is the case-that the 2,000 square kilometres we are now talking about, which is a matchbox in size compared with the pastoral leases of the Northern Territory, involves only 26 per cent of the land to which Aboriginal people are legally entitled to pursue their claims. I also point out to the Committee that 60 per cent of that area involves only four reserves and that only 400 square kilometres involves stock routes, which is one of the potentially contentious items. That is one of the reasons why this has been such a difficult agreement to achieve. That is, 400 square kilometres of stock routes are involved or 6 per cent of the total area of stock routes which were available for claim by the Aboriginal people. In other words, they have voluntarily abandoned 74 per cent of the entire area they were able to claim and 94 per cent of the entire area of stock routes that they were able to claim. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say in all fairness, in terms of what Senator Tate has quite correctly asserted is a political decision-and I know Senator Alston has come very late to this debate, but it is something he should appreciate--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say at this point in respect of that interjection that it is very easy for Senator Alston to sit back and say, `So'. He is totally unaffected by this debate. Senator Alston has the hide to come in here during the committee stage and reel off references to things such as extinguishing people's rights and denying people natural justice. For Senator Alston's information, I will tell him, in terms of extinguishing people's rights and denying people natural justice, how I became politicised. I went to the Northern Territory when I was 20 years of age, wet behind the ears and off the land. I am still a very conservative person, a person with a predisposition to support the pastoral side of an argument. During my first year in the Northern Territory-I noted with some interest just a few months ago that I seem to have something in common with the Opposition's Leader in terms of the story he was telling about his early life-I was forced as a 20-year-old extension officer for the Department of Agriculture to work on a Northern Territory cattle station. We are not talking about 100 years ago now; we are talking about 20-odd years ago, in a place near Katherine. The station was run by a white station manager and Aboriginal staff, stockmen, who lived in a camp near the homestead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was a 20-year-old from a fairly strict background, I might add, in terms of the religious instruction that I had belted into me. I was a person who in those days would not, as the Australian expression goes, say `shit' for sixpence. I shared that homestead with a white station manager and, to my horror, discovered on my second day that it was his practice to cohabit, about 10 feet away from where I had to sleep in a single-room bough shed, which is what the homestead was, with a different girl from the Aboriginal camp every night, who had no choice in the matter. We were marooned from civilised society. I was stuck out there for six weeks with no way of getting back to town. He was regularly and routinely sleeping with Aboriginal kids who, had they been white kids living in town, would have been in primary school. My objections to that practice fell on deaf ears. I also witnessed the same bloke knock unconscious an Aboriginal stockman with a shifting spanner because this bloke happened to do the wrong thing while he was changing the wheel of a tractor. I was there when it happened. It was a vicious physical assault. Had it happened anywhere else, and to someone who was white, it would have got him two or three years in prison. </PARA>
<PARA> This same person was responsible for something even more horrendous. He was an alcoholic, as so many of these people were in the Northern Territory in those days. He used to go into town regularly on a binge. In fact-and I saw this with my own eyes-it was the practice for the station overseers, who were very badly paid by any standards in those days-almost as badly paid as the Aboriginal people who were employed, which I guess resulted in the type of person who worked in this situation-to get paid a lot of their wages in booze, rum in fact. In those days we called it crinkly-Beenleigh in corrugated bottles. He chose to be paid in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> Every six months or so, perhaps every 12 months, he would go into town on a bender. On one renowned occasion he went into town on a bender to get on the booze for three or four days and he took with him a young Aboriginal girl. He tied her up in the back of his truck so that she could not get away. He left the truck parked under a tree outside Katherine. He then got on the booze and forgot about her for a couple of days. When it was time for him to go back to the station, she had been lying in the back of the truck, tied up, with no food or water, for 48 hours, and it was the dry season. He went back to the station in this truck. On the way back, he stopped the truck when he decided he needed a bit of sexual relief. Because of his drunken condition, the girl was able to get away from him. But she did not make it back to the station; she died of thirst on the way back. It was only a week or so later, when the Aboriginal people who lived in the camp on that station worked up enough courage to report it, that a search party was put out for that girl and they found her dead body within a day's march of the station. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is with some degree of frustration that I speak in this debate. Senator Alston says that he has come late to this debate. So what? I am sitting here tonight in the dying moments of the decade of the eighties listening to Senator Alston, who knows nothing of these issues, talking about extinguishing people's rights and denying people natural justice. Senator Tate has said quite correctly that this is a political decision that has rightly been made to a political problem. It comes at the end of a long and tortuous process of negotiation which, as I said before, has occupied the major part of this decade. One would hope that we can go into the 1990s trying to put right some of these wrongs that are not just textbook academic matters that have been written up in books by Berndt, Stanner or others; they are things I have seen with my own eyes. They revolted me at the time; they revolt me now. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be instructive for Senator Alston, perhaps, to allow his colleague from the Northern Territory, who knows more about these issues than does Senator Alston, to carry this debate rather than have Senator Alston sitting there in total ignorance talking about the extinguishing of people's rights and liberties and natural justice. Tonight we are trying, by a political decision, to correct in some small measure not just the injustices of 100 years ago but injustices that still exist today. We are almost there, and we would get there a lot faster if Senator Alston were to leave it to his colleague from the Northern Territory to have carriage of this debate and if Senator Alston did not intrude on affairs in which he has taken only a very late interest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am loath to rise but I have to plead severe provocation. I intruded into this debate in the context of a limited committee stage amendment. I regarded that as an opportunity to canvass what I regard is a proper and legitimate question-that is, a question of rights, a question of balance, which is what the second reading speech is all about. Instead, by way of harangue from the other side of the chamber, I have just been subjected to one of the most ignorant and utterly deceitful and deceptive statements that could ever be anticipated from someone who professes to have great sympathy for and understanding of his fellow human beings. He proceeds on the basis that somehow those who are concerned to contribute to a small proportion of a debate have no wider understanding of, let alone sympathy for, the broader issues. It is not only offensive but quite dangerous if debate in this chamber is to be driven in a way that Senator Collins would have it-purely by one's commitment to a cause and one's anguish and concern about what has happened over the last decade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If Senator Collins had any awareness of what has happened over the last 10 years he might even be aware of the activities of the United Nations Association of Australia, of which I happened to be the Federal President some 12 years ago. In that capacity I travelled through the Northern Territory in company with Senator Collins's colleagues Senator Ted Robertson and John Dawkins and a number of others, including Paul Everingham as the Northern Territory Chief Minister, and Ian Viner as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Following remarks made by Mr Grassby in his role as Commissioner for Community Relations I also proceeded with other officers of the Association to Ceduna. </PARA>
<PARA> The Association pursued the question of racial discrimination. In terms of Australia's breaches of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination I made representations to that effect to Andrew Peacock who was then foreign Minister. Over a considerable period of time, both in my capacity as Federal President of the United Nations Association and later as Chairman of the Australian Council for Overseas Aid, an umbrella organisation for now some 85 organisations, I would claim to have had some awareness of the plight of Aboriginal people and a great degree of sympathy for them. If Senator Collins chooses to parade his own concerns to somehow deprive others of any ability to contribute to a debate, that is not only one-sided but very damaging to the democratic process. I intended to leave the carriage of this debate to Senator Tambling, who knows a lot more about it than almost anyone in this chamber. Certainly he is someone who has a very deep understanding of the broader issues. I therefore confined my attention to a matter about which I have some professional knowledge and understanding, one in which I have been involved at a number of levels in relation to both deportation applications and freedom of information matters. I have some understanding of what is meant by striking a balance of rights. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Collins pretends that somehow rights do not matter because he is driven by emotion and has a mortgage on all the concerns for the underprivileged. He feels, therefore, that none of us should have the right to stand up and talk about what we regard as fair and reasonable when this Bill is meant to provide for rights-not just one-sided rights on either side but a balance of rights. If that is the basis of our concern in the Committee stage, for Senator Collins to come in here and pretend that all that is irrelevant strikes me as not only an absurdity but an obscenity. I hope in the future when we are debating matters of limited substance we will not be distracted by someone who claims to be the moral saviour on the broader issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is precisely why I rose. I simply point out to the Committee once again that the question of balance is important in this debate. I recalled earlier during the committee stage the endless debates-and I mean endless debates-that have taken place over the last 10 years on the issue in the Northern Territory Parliament. I look forward to the decade of the 1990s being an opportunity to do what Senator Tate quite correctly mentioned earlier-providing the actual improvement in living conditions for which this legislation provides only the bare basis. It is not until the titles are granted, and it is not until, subsequent to those titles being granted, the infrastructure is established, that the lives of the people we are talking about will be substantially improved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I simply point out to the Committee that in terms of the balance-and I rose because Senator Tambling tried to portray this as being simply a one-sided deal of great benefit, as he said, to the land councils and the Aboriginals in respect of the stock routes-the Aboriginal people, in order to secure this agreement, have voluntarily given up 94 per cent of those stock routes which were claimable. In terms of a political decision being implemented into legislation, I think that is a reasonably fair deal for all sides in this matter, not just the land councils and the Aboriginals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish briefly to address the scheduling and the provisions of the scheduling in this area. I note that the areas to be granted must also be assessed in the light of the undertakings which the Minister informed the Parliament had been entered into by the Aboriginal people making the various claims. It is clear that there were considerable and detailed discussions with the land councils about these areas before the Bill's introduction; yet the pastoral lessees, who are intimately involved, were not even informed of what was proposed. Their association, the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association Inc., has been ignored and, most pointedly, is not among the groups to whom the Minister referred at the end of his second reading speech. This is not consultation at all, particularly in light of the fact that the Northern Territory cattle industry is a most important industry. It must be acknowledged that any industry that attracts export earnings of the order of $130m per annum is very significant. Senator Tate, Senator Collins and a number of other honourable senators have commented that we must strive to achieve a very great degree of balance in the community. I said in the early part of my speech in the second reading debate that the Bill represents the culmination of the efforts of the Chief Minister, Marshall Perron, many officers, both Commonwealth and Northern Territory, and many Aboriginal people-involved in both organisational areas and many other areas-who have striven to get the community balance right. The Opposition does support the legislation that is before the Parliament. As I said in the second reading debate, and I think it is something that has come out in the debate tonight, it is easy to characterise one group or other of the Northern Territory constituents as those with all right on their side. It is much harder to work for a sensible and sensitive balance.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak further to a matter that I spoke on in an adjournment debate in the Senate about 10 days ago concerning the registration of political party names and the procedures that are available under the Electoral Act. An example which has occurred recently lends weight to the need for the Act to be amended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have discovered that it is possible for people who belong to a political party to change that party's name without reference to its membership, without having to prove to the Australian Electoral Commission that it has 500 registered members. The example I mentioned in the Senate recently concerned the Democratic Socialist Party being renamed; it changed its name to the Socialist Workers Party. I have since discovered that, in accordance with the Act, that party was not required to prove to the Australian Electoral Commission that it had 500 members. If a new party were being formed, it would be required to prove that it had 500 members. The Democratic Socialist Party does not have to prove that because it is only changing its name. When the original party was first registered, in 1984, the Act did not even require production of proof of 500 members. I believe that is a deficiency because it means that a very small group of people who register a name can keep that name basically for all time despite the fact that it may never run a candidate at an election and that it may no longer support the aims of the party it originally registered. This is a considerable weakness in the Act. I have explained how I thought that it was an absolute fraud for the Socialist Workers Party to rename itself the Democratic Socialist Party because as far as I am concerned there is a world of difference between the ideologies of what those names stand for. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also discovered that under the Act when a party changes its name it is not required to consult its membership. Those people who registered the Socialist Workers Party about four or five years ago changed the name without reference to the membership-if it had a membership. That is another deficiency. I imagine that if any of the major political parties represented in this chamber-the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party of Australia, the National Party of Australia and the Australian Democrats-attempted to change their name without consulting the broad range of their membership there would be a fair riot and disagreement amongst the membership were it to be done by only two or three people. As I understand it, that is what the Socialist Workers Party has done recently. It claims that it had some consultation but the Party was not required to prove that to the Australian Electoral Commission. That is a weakness in the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> A further weakness which should be looked at concerns the fact that a party, once registered, can keep that name for all time. It should be a requirement of the Act that, at least once every five or seven years, the Electoral Commission should conduct an audit of all parties registered with it, particularly those defined as non-parliamentary parties, so that there can be a check of the membership list. I further understand that under the present Act the `membership list' for those registering for the first time is pretty loosely defined. In fact, it appears that just getting people to sign a petition can be taken as evidence that they are members or supporters of a particular party. There is no requirement for them to be issued with membership tickets or for non-parliamentary parties to keep records. I believe that, again, is a deficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> I also discovered that one can actually be a member of a political party that is already registered as a non-parliamentary party, and one's membership can be counted when another new party is being registered. That is a loophole which is far too wide and makes a joke of the registration provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> These are areas that the Parliament-particularly, the Government-ought to have a look at. I hope that all political parties represented here, irrespective of our different ideological positions, realise that there is a need for these areas to be tightened up. As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I hope that some time in the near future we can conduct a brief inquiry into this section of the Act and make recommendations to Parliament to tighten up the procedures, if they are not already tidied up. I understand there is a Bill before Parliament at the moment, which may be debated later this week, containing amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. These matters could be looked at then. </PARA>
<PARA> An example of what caused me to further raise this matter is the extraordinary circumstances which recently occurred in New South Wales concerning the selection of candidates for the so-called Green Alliance. I must confess that I come from South Australia so the ins and outs of New South Wales party politics may have escaped me from time to time. What happened with the Green Alliance is an extraordinary procedure for any political party which tries to establish itself with any credibility in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I have since discovered that the Green Alliance includes not only people who have had the name `Greens' registered from 1984-which was a take off of the German Green Party-but also people who were registered initially as the Socialist Workers Party, whose name has now been changed to the Democratic Socialist Party, and those who were registered as the Aboriginal Land Councils of New South Wales. They have registered individually, but have put together what is called a Green Alliance ticket. How they arrived at this ticket gives weight to the matters which are of concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I have obtained a copy of a brief statement which the Green Alliance put out earlier this month explaining how it was selecting its candidates. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Sunday, December 10, Sydney University, Manning House, 9.30 am, the Green Alliance* Senate team for NSW will be chosen. </PARA>
<PARA>This is extraordinary to anybody who has had any involvement in party organisation, particularly someone like myself who has spent many years as a full time party official in South Australia. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA>The selection conference will be an open, public event held in Sydney &amp; networked throughout Pegasus. </PARA>
<PARA>I have subsequently found out that Pegasus is actually a computer system. Apparently, the selection processes for the New South Wales Green Alliance means that one can turn up at an open, public meeting-one does not have to be a member of the Alliance in any way, but could claim to be interested in environmental issues in the broadest possible sense-and vote to select candidates. But, if one could not make it to the meeting, as I think this statement makes clear, one could participate by using one's computer terminal in the Pegasus system to indicate which of the candidates one wishes to support. There was a list of about 13 candidates standing for preselection for a position on a team of six. It said that the meeting would:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . also discuss policy, accountability and the question of rotation. If you are green you can attend the conference, or tune into Pegasus via, gpn: green-forum conference and vote in this selection or nominate for a position on the team. </PARA>
<PARA>I know we all believe at times that existing parties may get a little bureaucratic in all our procedures, but I do not think any of us believe that a political party should have such a system open to what I would call perverting the political process for anybody who chose to turn up who may be completely anti-environmental in their policies and could participate. It says further:</PARA>
<PARA>The Green Alliance was formed at the 9-10 September 89 conference by 250 people from all over New South Wales and is open to all individuals, groups and organisations who subscribe to the four basic principles of the German Greens: an ecologically sustainable economy; grassroots democracy; social and economic equality; and disarmament and non-violence. </PARA>
<PARA>I suppose basically we would all say that those are motherhood positions which everybody in the community would believe are quite reasonable. They then selected, out of those 13 people, six--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have about three minutes. They then selected their candidates and, at best, about 150 people voted. We do not know whether they voted by computer or voted by turning up at the public meeting. The candidate who topped the ticket got a grand sum total of 35 votes and the person who came sixth got eight votes. The person who topped the ticket admits to being a member of the Democratic Socialist Party, formerly the Socialist Workers Party, yet is seeking to lead, and be selected to lead, the Green Alliance. Again, I believe that indicates a weakness in the Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must say that some of the descriptions of people who sought preselection do raise one's eyebrows about how serious they are. For example, there was a Brenda Lloyd, who is described as:</PARA>
<PARA>Formerly of the World Wildlife Fund and the Green Party in the UK, practical Green who has installed a composting toilet in her eastern suburbs home and begun a campaign against the Water Board's $80 `environment' levy. </PARA>
<PARA>I know that people often describe Australian politics in unkind words, but I have never heard of a candidate claiming as a basis for his selection that he has a particular type of toilet installed in his home. We also have people such as Larry O'Brien, who is described as:</PARA>
<PARA>Manager, qualified in education and communications, an inner-city green. </PARA>
<PARA>Also, we have Julien Droulers, described as:</PARA>
<PARA>Taxi driver with a long established interest in independent political representation, particularly interested in gaining corporate support for green politics. </PARA>
<PARA>All in all, it is a range of people. Whatever we may think of their particular standing, what they have done is open to an accusation of abuse of the system of party registration. It is clear that they do not have anywhere near 500 party members but at the best they could get about 150 people to vote; and to get 150 people to vote they said that anybody could turn up at the public meeting, or, if they could not turn up, they could tune in via their computer terminal. I do not believe that the Electoral Act, which was passed in 1984 and subsequently amended, should allow this sort of process to go on. I believe that when the people of New South Wales come to vote at the next Federal election, and particularly for the Senate, they ought to have a very close look at the composition of the so-called Green Senate Team and, in particular, the Parliament should have a close look at the Act to ensure that this sort of procedure is not allowed; otherwise it will bring the operation of the Electoral Act into disrepute. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to address a matter which has been of great concern to me since I came into this Parliament in 1985-the question of our relationship with the United States in the ANZUS alliance. The recent changes in Europe, which seem destined to make both the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact redundant, have implications for Australia and the ANZUS alliance. As the Cold War is proclaimed to be dead and the threat of confrontation in Europe recedes, both the United States (US) and the Soviet Union are considering massive cuts in their military expenditure. The Europeans are looking at new defence options. Finlandisation is no longer a dirty word and concepts such as non-offensive defence and even social defence are being discussed. The military realise that they can no longer automatically order their next expensive generation of toys and there is an ongoing debate over where the cutbacks will have to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> United States and European journals are giving wide coverage to this debate and economists are hopeful that peace will bring great economic benefits to the United States which has been crippled by the doubling of military expenditure under the Reagan Administration. Sadly, none of this is reflected in Australia. Here we watch the defence budget slowly continuing to grow while the Government tries to double military exports in order to pay for military imports costing us over $1 billion per year and contributing significantly to the balance of payments deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) continue to pledge allegiance to ANZUS. Australia continues to side with the conservative Bush Administration in Washington rather than a Labour government across the Tasman which had the foresight to see the irrelevance of nuclear weapons in the South Pacific and dared to challenge its alliance partners. The Cold War is over; ANZUS is redundant, yet few politicians appear willing to get up and say so. There is great interest in the situation in Europe, but no lessons seem to be drawn for the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth considering how ANZUS began. The central rationale for the creation of the Pacific Pact, as it was first known, was a direct result of unease in Canberra and Wellington over the future potential threat posed to them by a resurgent and rearmed Japan. Some American officials considered that Australia and New Zealand were hysterical in their concern of a repeat of a future Asian threat to their security. Their defence needs stipulated that any threat to them should be met as far away as possible and within a collective security arrangement. In other words, it was a continuation of the forward defence strategy under United States auspices rather than under the British. </PARA>
<PARA> When the concept was first floated, the United States showed little interest. However, the Truman Administration had committed itself to a policy of military containment of the Soviet Union by 1947, culminating in the formation of NATO in April 1949. The idea of containment spread quickly from Europe to Asia as the doctrine assumed the much wider purpose of resisting any communist or revolutionary movement likely to challenge the United States concept of world order. In the meantime allied wartime links were further developed. Intelligence cooperation was formalised in 1947 with the United Kingdom-United States of America Agreement--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. As I was saying, the wartime links were further developed and the concept of containment spread rapidly from Europe to Asia. When the United Kingdom-United States of America Agreement was signed in 1947, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), with the British intelligence agencies, helped to set up the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Australian Secret Intelligence Service in 1949 and 1950.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> United States interest in the Pacific Pact grew following the Chinese revolution in October 1949 and the outbreak of the Korean War in the following year. Unable to construct in the Pacific a single strategic system comparable to NATO, the United States began to explore the possibility of a series of separate military arrangements. The intention was to create a loose but effective anti-communist coalition centred on the United States but comprising the countries situated on the rim of the Western Pacific. In the end, treaties were concluded with the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, followed by the Manila Pact, better known as SEATO, or the South East Asia Treaty Organisation. Curiously, a poll in 1951 showed that 74 per cent of those asked in the sample had read or heard of the new defence pact. But in 1982, only 65 per cent of a sample of 2,000 Australians had heard of ANZUS, and of that percentage only 41 per cent knew that the United States was a member. </PARA>
<PARA> There was little public fanfare in the early days of ANZUS. This was partly due to the creation of the SEATO in 1954 and the prominence it played in the diplomatic affairs of South East Asia until the late 1960s. However, realising that the ANZUS treaty was particularly loose and did not guarantee United States intervention in support of Australia should a crisis arise, Prime Minister Menzies and the then Foreign Minister, Lord Casey, invited the United States to consider the option of putting military bases on Australian soil knowing that, if the United States had a military presence or bases which were significant to it on Australian soil, it would be much more likely to get involved in rescuing Australia in a time of crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> The first permanent American installation in Australia was the seismic station at Alice Springs. This agreement was signed in 1955, but the true nature of the installation was not disclosed until February 1973. So there is a huge time gap between the installation first being assigned and that knowledge being made publicly available. As Des Ball, the head of defence and strategic studies at the Australian National University, has written:</PARA>
<PARA>The secrecy, evasion and deception associated with the American installations in Australia seems to be intrinsic to them; it goes back to their origins during World War II and has characterised all subsequent developments. </PARA>
<PARA>The most obsessive secrecy has been over Pine Gap and Nurrungar. The then Minister for Defence in 1969 emphasised military reasons for secrecy over Nurrungar in 1969 but Prime Minister Gorton talked wholly in terms of Pine Gap's enhancing the strength of the ANZUS alliance as the Hansard records of the day so clearly show. The Labor Government which followed was hardly any better. It continued to relate the bases to ANZUS. Yet the ANZUS document itself does not say anything about the installation of bases on Australian soil, nor about the visits of nuclear-armed and nuclear-powered warships to our ports. </PARA>
<PARA> The myths of ANZUS and the dependency relationship are so powerful that John Gorton, William McMahon and Gough Whitlam all admitted that they were ignorant of major aspects of the operations of the satellite ground stations in central Australia. It seemed that they neither knew nor cared about what went on at Pine Gap in particular, until Gough Whitlam became concerned-and we know what happened to him in 1975. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IG4">Senator VALLENTINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, they were then called `joint facilities' which is a misnomer and a euphemism. Australians were up against governments which did not believe in consulting them on issues of defence and national security, nor were they in turn willing to ask questions of the United States, even supposing they would be given an answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When Robert Menzies announced the establishment of the North West Cape facility in my home State of Western Australia, he said it was to provide radio communications but he never mentioned submarines, let alone missile-carrying submarines. Later, in 1973, the United States used the North West Cape to communicate the general alert to its convention on nuclear forces in the region at the time of the Yom Kippur war in the Middle East but did not inform the Australian Government. Five years later Jim Killen as Minister for Defence was caught out when the Australian Financial Review carried a story about a new satellite ground station at North West Cape, but the relevant US authorities had never told him that the contract had been let. There was no attempt at consultation; he was not even told. </PARA>
<PARA> Using the ANZUS myth, the US has taken Australia for granted. Australian governments either have not cared or have been too scared to protest at their humiliation at being kept in the dark by our so-called wise and powerful friend. The TRANET station at Smithfield in South Australia was operating for 12 years before the Defence Department thought to ask the Pentagon what the strategic role of the station was with respect to the navigation of fleet ballistic missile submarines. It is, therefore, not surprising that so few Australians can identify these bases on our soil and know even less about what they do. In fact, we do not know how many of these bases there are which are tied into the American military system or exactly what they do. There has been little debate about them in Parliament and, when the issue is raised by the Australian Democrats, by me, by Senator Dunn-and, I should add, when questions were asked by the Australian Labor Party when it was in opposition-or by the occasional member of the Liberal Party, there is a continuing wall of silence despite this Government's assertion that it is more open than its predecessors were about the bases. </PARA>
<PARA> As an exercise in testing the openness of the Labor Government, in 1986 I asked a question of the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Hayden, about the operations of the facility at Pine Gap. I copied the exact wording of a question that he had asked when he was in opposition of the then Prime Minister, Mr Fraser. Guess what answer I got? It was exactly the same answer that Prime Minister Fraser had given to Bill Hayden. The excuse given was `national security'. It is not our national security that is protected by such stupid answers but the national security of the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> If it was not for the courageous women who went to Pine Gap some years ago and other actions at North West Cape and Nurrungar, as well as those organised by the Australian anti-base campaign coalition and the Alice Springs peace group, even fewer Australians would know what was happening on their own soil. The active phase of ANZUS did not really begin until the United States intervention in Indo-China and the ill-fated decision to send Australian troops to Vietnam. It was a confusing period, because in 1966 the British Government announced that it would eventually withdraw its forces from the Far East and the Indian Ocean, and in 1969 President Nixon enunciated what became known as the Guam doctrine on a stop over there on his way back to the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> Proponents of self-reliance within the alliance often date the changes in Australian defence thinking to this time, because President Nixon spelt out in the Guam doctrine a fact which should have been understood right from the beginning of the signing of the ANZUS Treaty but which was never acknowledged by the Government, not in public anyway-that the United States does not intend to come to the rescue of any of its alliance partners, that alliance partners have to be prepared to defend themselves. Yet the myth has been perpetuated by government after government of either political complexion in Australia that because we are in ANZUS the United States would come to our rescue-and it is a lot of nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> During these same years, up to 1972, conservative governments in Australia and New Zealand were prepared to pursue foreign policies which were often unpopular at home, such as continued support for the Vietnam war and refusing to recognise the People's Republic of China despite substantial trade ties. Not surprisingly, there was something of a backlash when Labor governments came to power in 1972 in Canberra and Wellington, but the dependency upon a great and powerful friend was deep and I doubt if we shall ever know how active the CIA was in destabilising the Whitlam Government before the coup in 1975. Suffice to say that it was this Government which first lifted the lid on three key United States bases that had been established during the Menzies years-first, North West Cape, then Pine Gap and Nurrungar. But even then we did not learn too much because on the famous occasion on 11 November 1975 when Gough Whitlam was ready to make a speech it was never made. Paradoxically, it was a coalition government under Billy McMahon which imposed a moratorium on the visit of nuclear-powered warships to Australian ports, which lasted from 1971 to 1976. At that stage there were, very surprisingly, no bleatings about our obligations under ANZUS to let these nuclear powered warships into our ports. That ban was lifted by the Fraser Government when Ian Sinclair was Minister for Defence in 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this Government, there was a swing back to the special relationship with Washington as the arc of crisis developed in the north-west corner of the Indian Ocean, and United States warship visits peaked in the years after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. These were the years when an increasing number of United States warships were becoming nuclear-powered, when Malcolm Fraser allowed B52 bombers to stop off in Darwin and when he was prepared to offer the United States Navy the use of facilities at Cockburn sound if it needed a permanent home port there. Thankfully, it did not take up his offer. The offer was repeated later by John Howard when he was Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Hawke Labor Government, the claim of a special relationship was maintained, particularly in regard to the relationship between the Prime Minister and United States Secretary of State Shultz, their golf matches being renowned. There were frequent charges that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Bill Hayden, was not so popular, because at times he would speak his mind and assert a different line to the prevailing United States line on certain key issues. However, in the end, the Minister knew that he had to toe the line and that the prevailing myth of ANZUS had to stay intact. Australia worked hard for a comprehensive test ban treaty but was thwarted by opposition from the Reagan Administration and the lobby that wanted the United States to develop a third generation of nuclear weapons for the star wars program. </PARA>
<PARA> Bill Hayden raised the issue of naval arms control as well, but the United States Navy has adamantly refused to talk about that. That is one of the reasons why the United Nations General Assembly Third Special Session on Disarmament in New York last year was a flop. No agreement was signed at that meeting because the United States Government refused to allow the issue of naval arms control to be put on the agenda. Every time it was mentioned, the United States wiped out that paragraph; it was just not allowed by the United States. So the best disarmament efforts that have been put forward by this Australian Labor Party Government have been thwarted by our so-called great friend and ally. We have been stymied at every opportunity that we have taken. The United States, as a sea power, has always dominated the oceans while the Soviet Union, as a land power, put the emphasis on land-based missiles. Now the talks are under way on land-based missiles, the United States still refuses to discuss naval arms control. This issue is important for Australia, because it is the area that directly involves us through the symbolism of ANZUS. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a children's story about the emperor who had no clothes. I am sure that honourable senators are familiar with that story. Australia is rather like one of the people in the crowd who knew perfectly well that the emperor had no clothes but was too intimidated to say so. (Quorum formed) Only the child spoke in this case, the junior partner in ANZUS, that is, New Zealand. It dared to stand up to the emperor. I refer, of course, to the ludicrous `neither confirm nor deny' policy, when everyone knows that the United States Navy deploys nuclear weapons on 80 per cent of its warships but hardly anyone is prepared to challenge the `neither confirm nor deny' myth. It is curious that only small countries, the children in the legend, such as Belau, Iceland, Malta and New Zealand, are prepared to shout, `The emperor has no clothes'. Big countries such as Australia kowtow to the emperor, to the United States or to our colonial masters, the British. Australia is afraid to speak out-a mark of our subservience. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told that ANZUS allows us to have more influence with the United States. I think that is arrant nonsense. When a journalist from the Sydney Morning Herald came back from her post in Washington a few years ago, she said that the United States listened to what Australia had to say and then ignored us. The root problem is that after 200 years the non-Aboriginal people of Australia are deeply rooted in a cultural framework that is today based on three false assumptions: firstly, that we cannot defend ourselves; secondly, that we therefore need a great and powerful friend to protect us; and thirdly, that since 1942 the friend in question, the United States, has been a reliable ally. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Director of the Australian National University Peace Research Centre, Andrew Mack, observed in 1986, `the popular case for ANZUS does not have a great deal of currency in the Australian Government, where an altogether more sophisticated argument holds sway. This is the argument we refer to as the central balance. Mr Beazley then adds that under ANZUS we also get cheap, highly sophisticated, state-of-the-art technology which is necessary for the defence of Australia. He has christened his approach `self-reliance within the alliance'. This is a contradiction in terms. There is also the issue of shared intelligence but we are not allowed to know what that constitutes. All we do know is that we are a very junior partner in this intelligence arrangement with the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand. The UK-USA Agreement of 1947 is one of the most secret agreements in the world. At some later date I intend to speak about this issue of secrecy and intelligence because it is time it was challenged. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem in Australia is that few politicians have been willing to challenge these myths. I believe that with the rapid fading away of the Cold War, it is now time to challenge the myths of ANZUS and to seize the opportunity to declare Australian independence. For nearly 40 years we have been locked into an East-West view of the world when the reality for our part of the world is a concern for economic security or north-south issues. We have allowed hysteria about the Soviet Union and Libya and other alleged stalking horses to cloud our judgment. We have ignored the views of our South Pacific neighbours, who know that the Soviet Union has no great interest in this part of the world and poses neither a military nor an economic threat. In fact, it pays for the fish that the American Tuna Association plundered for years. Because of ANZUS we took on the American view of the world. Its enemies became our enemies. We say everything in terms of East-West issues that were entirely irrelevant in the South Pacific. We adopted its agenda as part of the cultural cringe. Our farmers saw that the so-called partnership was worth nothing when it came to bread and butter issues such as trade and protection but the cry went up from both major parties that we must not confuse economic issues and concerns about military security. Why not?</PARA>
<PARA> This brings me to the whole issue of alliance politics. A New Zealand academic, Jacob Berkovitch, edited a book of essays which has just come into the Parliamentary Library, entitled ANZUS in crisis: Alliance management in International Affairs. In it, he quotes a survey of post-war alliances, which identify 10 alliances involving two large powers, 86 involving a small state with large powers and 50 small states with other small states. It is patently obvious where Australia and New Zealand fit into this survey. Berkovitch comments that relations between a small state and a large one are inherently difficult. Small states seek security, yet resent being mere appendages of a great power. They want protection but do not wish to be unduly influenced. Apparently Machiavelli's advice to the prince of a small state was not to align himself with a more powerful state. I suspect this is about the only occasion on which I shall approvingly quote Machiavelli but I prefer his advice to that of King Bob of Australia because it is sound. It is humiliating to read about our delegations to the United States, which rank as headlines here, but do not even make the news in the United States. Every country goes there and few rank any mention in the United States media. Why do we persist in this ridiculous nonsense about our influence on and special relationship with the United States? We are spurned on bread and butter concerns, we get sent third-rate ambassadors, our representations are ignored, and yet we go on conning ourselves that we matter in Washington. </PARA>
<PARA> ANZUS is a symbol. It has allowed the United States to put bases on our soil with no community debate and rarely any parliamentary debate. We host the visits of nuclear warships, which only 28 per cent of Australians are now in favour of, yet are denied the chance to challenge this in the Parliament because of the bipartisan policy of the major parties, afraid to speak out after 200 years of subservience to great and powerful friends. When New Zealand rightly points out that there is nothing in the ANZUS treaty about nuclear warships it is frozen out of the club and Australia wimpishly concurs. This is an absolute disgrace. The ANZUS Treaty commits us to a yearly meeting-that is all-and a phone call in the event of a crisis; nothing else. The treaty fits on a single page. It is totally vague and deliberately so. All the secret agreements since 1951 have been drawn up in the spirit of ANZUS but there was never anything in the original treaty about them. How many honourable senators have read the text of the ANZUS treaty? One woman in Adelaide spent six weeks trying to get a copy from government departments because no-one had one. That is the essence of the myth because, in the end, few Australians really know what it is about but everyone pays lip service to it. As we count the cost of the Bicentennial in 1988 and move towards the real centenary of the Commonwealth of Australia in 2001 it seems that one appropriate reassessment might be the value of ANZUS. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators returning to their homes for the Christmas break should be thankful if they come from somewhere other than my State, New South Wales. A Public Works Minister in the former New South Wales Labor Government, one L. Brereton, will be remembered, if at all, for inflicting that idiocy known as the monorail on the streets of Sydney and for putting a harbour tunnel crossing at the wrong place. It was Mr Brereton who decided that the people of Sydney should subsidise the harbour tunnel through a rapidly increasing toll on motorists using the Sydney Harbour bridge and who has, by this means, given a private company a stranglehold on this nation's first city. The Brereton influence was so odious that the electors of New South Wales did not hesitate to throw out the decaying Unsworth Administration, under which Mr Brereton prospered, when opportunity presented itself in the March 1988 election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, that is all it was-an act of retribution against a moribund and arrogant Government. It was not until after the smoke had cleared that the voters looked around to see what they had done. And what had they done? They saw that they had installed the Greiner-Murray coalition Government, a possibly unique Harvard hooligan type of government that has set for itself a course of running this country's largest and oldest State alternately as a field for corporate management experiments and as an opportunity for plunder and rampant cronyism. While Premier Greiner nominally leads the New South Wales Government, it is his coalition partners in the National Party who are contributing much of its substance and style. Mr Murray is more than a mere politician; he is a dominating feature, a mountain of a man who rises up out of the New South Wales political scene to form an awesome overhanging prominence. It does not seem to make any difference that, as so many have observed, there are not many signs of life at the summit. The vast shadow of Wal Murray has darkened the landscape of New South Wales. We are in a dark age. </PARA>
<PARA> While Mr Greiner's administration has made some tentative moves towards accommodating the impacts of climate change, Wal Murray has publicly rubbished greenhouse. In a crass attempt to steer Government policy against scientific opinion, Mr Murray has tried to dismiss the greenhouse effect as unproven. All the work done in this country by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) seems to have had no effect whatsoever on Mr Murray's thought processes. No doubt, he believes that the CSIRO should stick to its role of finding better sheep dip and other practical things of use to rural producers and should keep away from all this suspicious environmental stuff. A former head of Mr Murray's Department of State Development readily admitted in a talk given at a seminar on coastal development in Sydney earlier this year that soon after the Murray-Greiner Government took office Queensland's shonky developers, the gruesome white shoe brigade, began streaming south across the border with millions of dollars to spend on Gold Coast style developments. Wal Murray, as the New South Wales Minister for State Development and Minister for Public Works, has welcomed that procession and has, I believe, used his position to encourage it. </PARA>
<PARA> Within months of Mr Murray's accession to power we saw badly sited, overdone and environmentally objectionable proposals for tourist and resort developments springing up like daisies-or should I say toadstools? They have become the focus for public concern and outrage up and down the New South Wales coast. A discussion paper issued in November this year by a parliamentary inquiry into coastal development confirms the picture. This inquiry, which was conducted by the New South Wales Upper House Standing Committee on State Development, surveyed public opinion on coastal issues and found that out-of-control tourist developments were a major public concern in New South Wales. That is not a surprise. The 10 coastal developments most frequently objected to by respondents were all-apart from the recently abandoned Jervis Bay naval base proposal-proposed tourist resorts. Honourable senators present will surely have heard the names of some of them: Ocean Blue at Fingal; Bonville at Coffs Harbour; Pepper's Anchorage and Caves Beach on the central coast; and Aquamarine at Bega. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not long before a National Party Minister, Matt Singleton, was brought down for attempting to conceal his financial interest in another coastal development proposal. But that was in the early days of Mr Greiner's Administration, when the Premier naively imagined that he could contain the damage to his Government from National Party rorts to some manageable level. When the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption got into the act, it very quickly uncovered an alarming level of impropriety, if not corruption, in the administration of development approvals at both local and State government levels. We saw bagmen, dodgy consultants, bribery, donations to the National Party handed straight over to National Party Ministers and the suspicious expediting of certain development applications by Ministers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The view expressed by the National Consumer Affairs Advisory Council about the quality of products have been fully supported by the government. In February 1988, Senator Button issued a comprehensive statement outlining the Government's strategy on standards, accreditation and quality.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the main features outlined in Senator Button's statement is the establishment of the National Industry Extension Service's Quality Forum which gives recognition to the importance of developing a national quality strategy aimed at raising the actual quality of products as well as consumer awareness of product quality. The Forum is examining issues such as improving the quality of goods supplied to retail stores and developing curriculum modules on quality issues for inclusion in existing Technical and Further Education courses. Individuals from industry, standards association, the ACTU and the Australian and State Governments are represented on the Forum.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Government is also aiming to develop and broaden the scope of existing standards setting organisations such as Standards Australia. Standards Australia's adoption of international standards for quality management should encourage the development and use of internationally accepted safety and quality standards in Australia which will prove attractive to industry. I am also currently considering means for the promotion of safety in the design and manufacture of consumer products.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I believe that the above initiatives will improve the quality of Australian made goods and consumer awareness of quality issues. I will also continue to ensure that full attention is paid to the safety, health and environmental aspects of consumer products.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The reason for approving a floor price of $US26.00 for the Kansai and OKG contracts at that time was set out in my media statement of 4 September 1989. In short, a floor price of $26.00 was considered appropriate in the light of the state of the international uranium market and the circumstances surrounding the contracts.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I am aware of the press speculation to this effect, but I understand it primarily applies to the US market where spot prices have been more prominent as a factor in long term contract pricing.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) ERA and its Overseas Equity Holders, with the exception of RWE, have successfully concluded settlements for deliveries in 1990 and 1991 at a floor price of US$26/lb. I have approved these settlements.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) I am aware that in current market circumstances some high cost US producers are questioning the benefits of long term contracts in the US market. In general, I understand that most producers and customers still see advantage in medium to long term uranium supply contracts.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Neither Olympic Dam nor ERA has sought approval to sell their production on the spot market.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Yes. However, I understand some industry analysts estimate that spot sales will probably account for approximately 20% of the total uranium market in 1989. If this is correct, it would represent a relatively small increase over the traditional level of approximately 15%.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) No. ERA remains a major low cost producer of uranium whose production continues to account for the bulk of Australia's current uranium exports.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Community Services and Health, following advice from State/Territory nurse registration authorities, State/Territory Health Departments, the National Office of Overseas Skills Recognition and the Australian Nursing Assessment Council (ANAC), has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) There are no countries with which Australia has reciprocity in respect of nursing qualifications. To be considered for registration as a nurse in Australia, a person must have qualified in a country with a health care system similar to that of Australia in terms of culture, technology, licensure and language. The following countries generally meet this requirement:</PARA>
<PARA>Canada, New Zealand, Republic of Ireland, South Africa, United Kingdom and the United States of America. In certain cases, a nurse who qualified elsewhere, but who has substantial experience as a fully registered nurse, or gained a post-basic qualification from one of the countries listed above, may be considered for registration.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Registration of overseas trained nurses is a responsibility of individual State and Territory Governments. Any pre-registration bridging courses for overseas trained nurses deemed appropriate to meet Australian registration standards is also the responsibility of those Governments.</PARA>
<PARA> Courses have been conducted in South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania to meet a recognised demand. I understand that Western Australia has applied for Commonwealth funding to conduct a pilot course.</PARA>
<PARA> For those courses which are available, the requested information is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Courses offered are all State pre-registration courses.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) There are no costs to applicants for courses offered.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) New South Wales-eight weeks. South Australia-fourteen weeks. Tasmania-twelve weeks full-time or twenty weeks part-time. Victoria-thirteen weeks minimum.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) College of Nursing, Glebe, New South Wales. College of Advanced Education, Bedford Park, South Australia. Tasmanian State Institute of Technology, Launceston, Tasmania. Austin Hospital, Box Hill Hospital, Western Metropolitan Regional Office, Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) Entry Requirements-New South Wales-NSW Nurses Registration Board assessment. South Australia-Assessed by ANAC and the Nursing Board of SA. Tasmania-Eligible for registration in Tasmania and basic competence in the English language. Victoria-Varies across the three institutions offering the course, and includes acceptance by the Victorian Nursing Council.</PARA>
<PARA> (f) New South Wales-Satisfactory completion of a period of assessment at an approved hospital, and recommendation for registration from the Director of Nursing of the employing hospital. South Australia-No conditions. Tasmania-Character reference and medical certificate. Victoria-Victorian Nursing Council acceptance.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes. However, nurse registration is a State and Territory responsibility and therefore the Minister for Community Services and Health cannot assist overseas trained nurses in any specific manner.</PARA>
<PARA> Initial assistance is provided by the Australian Nursing Assessment Council (a non-statutory body under the umbrella of the National Office of Overseas Skills Recognition within the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET)). This Council is responsible for directing overseas nurses seeking registration in Australia to the National Office of Overseas Skills Recognition to undertake the occupational English Test and, on their successfully passing the test, co-ordinating the professional nursing examination in the States/Territories where it is required.</PARA>
<PARA> In the States/Territories where specific courses for overseas nurses are conducted, nurses are advised to contact the nurse registration authority in that State or Territory for advice concerning an appropriate course.</PARA>
<PARA> It is the officers in nurse registration authorities who render assistance to any nurse wishing to enter the workforce. Course co-ordinators are available to help advise nurses wishing to enter bridging programs or courses.</PARA>
<PARA> Over the last few years, Commonwealth monies have been available for retraining of nurses under the National Skills Shortage program, and have been available to assist States and Territories in providing programs to tap the pool of overseas trained nurses. The onus has been on the individual States/Territories to take up this offer. Recently, the Government announced strategies for reforming the recognition of overseas skills including overseas qualified nurses.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Bowen, released on behalf of the Commonwealth on Friday 3 November, 1989, a policy statement outlining the Government's strategy for reforming migrant skills recognition. With the cooperation of State and Territory Governments, the Commonwealth expects to significantly improve the recognition process applying in Australia to skilled migrants, including nurses.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 27 October 1989 Senator Sheil asked me the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Is it a fact that the decision to pay family allowances on a fortnightly basis instead of a monthly basis means that, in the first year of operation, families will be paid less than under the previous arrangement? Why has the Government refused to reveal findings of the Social Security Advisory Council's report on the matter? Can the Minister tell the women and children of Australia why the matter was referred to the Council in the first place if the Government has no intention of accepting its findings? Will the Minister now come clean and tell the Senate how much families are being short-changed by this decision?</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Social Security, Mr Howe, has provided the following answer.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Social Security has carefully considered the report of the SSAC's Working Party ``Report on the Effect of Family Payment Changes''.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the Minister does not endorse the Council's recommendations in this area. While the Minister accepts that there can be a variation in the amount of the final payment a given family may receive when the last of their children attracting family payments ceases to be eligible for them, it is difficult to accept the argument that ``losses'' have occurred or that such families should be compensated given prevailing standards of targeting areas of need and spending priorities.</PARA>
<PARA> The Council's major recommendation on adjustments rested on three principles:</PARA>
<PARA>legislative change should not reduce reasonable expectations about continuance of statutory entitlements unless clear notice is given before the legislation is changed;</PARA>
<PARA>in assessing the impact on families of the December 1988 change, the value of the July 1989 Family Allowance increases should be partially offset because of a decline in the value of Family Allowance since 1976-77 and that there was a likelihood that some of the decline would have been redressed in the short or medium term; and</PARA>
<PARA>increases in Family Allowance Supplement should be disregarded because that payment is for a different purpose than for Family Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister accepts the first principle but does not accept that it is correct to speak of ``losses'' from one step in the rationalisation of family payments, especially when those ``losses'' have been more than compensated by other direct steps in that rationalisation process. Those ``losses'' the Council identified for some families would be wholly or substantially offset by including all related steps the Government has taken in the area of family assistance, such as the very substantial increases in Family Allowance rates, Child Disability Allowance and Family Allowance Supplement and additional pension and benefit rates in recent time.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also relevant to note that the Council's report does not make reference to the enhanced Common Allowance Structure now in place for student assistance which provides real gains for many of the affected families.</PARA>
<PARA> When the many related initiatives the Government has taken in the families area since the publication of the Social Security Review's Issues Paper No. 1 in October 1986 are taken into account, the Government's commitment to family assistance is clear. In the Family Allowance program alone those initiatives will add some $400 million (net) to outlays in 1989-90. It is disappointing that some have chosen to divorce one aspect of the many initiatives and raise concerns about it in isolation of all elements of the package. This is particularly so when the isolated issue in question is obviously a product of well forecast legislation and is totally in accordance with it.</PARA>
<PARA> The report proposed additional expenditure but avoided the issue of what savings measures would be necessary elsewhere in the portfolio to cover the additional expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the Minister has noted Council's view that the only potential area of losses occasioned by the change to fortnightly Family Allowance payments is in respect of families who lose their last child for family payment purposes within a relatively short time following December 1988. In the Minister's view, what are seen as losses are offset by other beneficial elements of the families package.</PARA>
