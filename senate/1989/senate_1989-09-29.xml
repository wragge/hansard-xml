<TITLE>Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled, we the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's attack upon the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has cast grave doubts over the future viability of our community pharmacies and their ability to provide much-needed service to the community, including particularly those in rural areas;</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will further jeopardise the viability of pharmacists;</PARA>
<PARA> The latest decision to slash PBS payments to pharmacists by an average $1.05 per script is simply unacceptable and will force the closure of many pharmacies.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners respectfully request that the Senate urge the Government to ensure adequate remuneration levels for pharmacists, so that they may be able to provide a high quality health care service which is the right of every citizen of Australia.</PARA>

<TITLE>Pornography</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That we, the undersigned, having great concern that Canberra is now the ``Porn Capital'' of Australia and because of the spread of moral pollution in our nation, call upon the Federal Government to introduce immediate legislation in support of existing State legislation:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. To provide strict controls over the importation, production, sale, hire or mailing of video cassettes, particularly in the ACT, with the open sale and/or hire of only `G', `PG' and `M' rated video cassettes; and the total prohibition of the sale or hire of `R' rated video cassettes, so that `R' rated films can only be viewed in an adult theatre by persons over 18 years. We totally reject the concept of ``X'' rated or ``NVE'' rated video cassettes, which would allow the legal sale and hire of hard core pornographic videos for viewing in the homes of our nation, which would endanger our children; and</PARA>
<PARA> 2. To give whole-hearted support to Senator Walter's Private Member's Bill to implement the recommendations of the Select Committee on Videos; and</PARA>
<PARA> 3. To dramatically improve the Federal Attorney-General's Guidelines for Classification of video tapes/discs, which restrict the importation, production, sale or hire, screening in private homes and especially mailing by Australia Post, so as to include the total prohibition of any pornographic, obscene or blasphemous video cassette, or film, which exploits or degrades women as sex objects, or which contain child pornography, bestiality, sodomy, group sex or violent sex acts with women, such as rape and pack rape, sadism and torture, etc., or which promotes homosexuality or lesbianism.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your honourable House will protect our society, especially women and children from moral pollution and its harmful effects.</PARA>

<TITLE>Privacy Legislation</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled; the humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Labor Government's Privacy Amendment Bill concerning Credit Reference Reporting will</PARA>
<PARA> (1) prohibit many legitimate uses of credit information by organisations such as real estate agents, mortgage underwriters, insurance companies, businesses selling goods on credit, and companies renting or leasing goods and equipment</PARA>
<PARA> (2) add to the cost of business and increase interest rates, and insurance charges and lead to over commitment by borrowers</PARA>

<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, that:</PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned about the increase in violent television programmes for children and particularly those programmes promoting violent toys that are available for sale in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray;</PARA>
<PARA> That you support the Broadcasting (Prohibition of Violent Programmes for Children) Act 1988 which has been presented by WA Independent Senator for Nuclear Disarmament, Jo Vallentine. This act aims to prohibit the broadcasting of children's TV programmes that are violent and that promote toys modelled on characters, weapons or other war accessories which are also available for sale in Australia.</PARA>

<TITLE>Home Ownership</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:-</PARA>
<PARA> Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.</PARA>
<PARA> Note, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Hawke-Keating government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many Australians out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families.</PARA>

<PARA> The Members of the Australian Armed Forces who served in Vietnam from 1962 to 1973 did so with distinction, valour and professionalism, upholding the traditions of the Armed Forces.</PARA>
<PARA> After World War 2 and the Korean War, the Australian Government approved an end of war list of gallantry medals for individual acts of bravery that were not rewarded during wartime.</PARA>
<PARA> The Whitlam Government refused to approve such an end of war list at the end of the Vietnam War.</PARA>
<PARA> Your humble petitioners pray that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government reverse the decision of the Whitlam Government, and thus approve an end of war list for the Australian Armed Forces personnel that served in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA> Upon the approval of the end of War list, the case of Warrant Officer Kevin Conway, Australian Army Training Team Vietnam, be considered for the award of a posthumous military honour.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The last time the Committee met I moved amendment No. 45 which relates to circumstances under which an elected person shall not be able to hold office. At the time I moved it there were objections particularly to the provision that we included an undischarged bankruptcy as one of the grounds under which a person should not hold office. There was, as well, discussion across the chamber about the particular conditions that we had suggested in the amendment. As a result of that the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) made certain suggestions and some drafting was done by the Parliamentary Counsel. I seek leave of the Committee to substitute for amendment No. 45 the circulated amendment No. 45a, as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (c) in any case-the Federal Court of Australia, on application by the person, declares that in spite of the person's conviction, he or she ought not to be disqualified from being appointed as a Commissioner. </PARA>

They include the provision that any person who has been convicted of an offence against a Commonwealth, State or Territory law involving dishonesty and who has been sentenced to imprisonment for three months or longer will be unable to hold office. The Government has conceded our principle and has written it in a slightly different form. The amendment as redrafted alters the period of disqualification from our proposed five years to two years. That redrafting is quite acceptable to the Opposition. That is the reason I have moved the redrafted amendments in that form.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs reported to this Parliament some time ago in relation to the disqualification of members of the Federal Parliament. In that report the Committee indicated that the old ethos surrounding the status of bankruptcy had been superseded by perhaps the frequency with which such unfortunate events occur, given the way in which credit is made available in our modern community as distinct from the times of the 1890s when the Constitution was being drafted. Indeed, that Committee recommended that if any constitutional amendment were to be made to those disqualification provisions, then the provisions relating to bankruptcy ought to be deleted. It is on that basis, and I believe also on the basis of a similarity to the provision relating to disqualification of candidates or members of the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly, that it has been decided to bring this into harmony with that report of one of our own standing committees. The Government accepts the substituted amendments as now drafted and circulated to be made by the Opposition in relation to these various disqualification clauses.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may be of assistance to the Committee if I indicated, by reference to the numbers heading the various amendments proposed by the Opposition, which of those were acceptable to the Government. I have circulated a paper to Senator Coulter and to Senator Peter Baume indicating which of the circulated amendments of the Opposition-honourable senators will be aware that there are many-the Government can now accept. Amendment No. 46 within group 9 is accepted, except that I have indicated to Senator Baume that there would be a difficulty with subclause 4 relating to public access to disclosure; but I have already discussed that matter informally and privately with him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can now be more specific and definite in relation to the other numbers. In group 11, amendment No. 60 is acceptable to the Government. In group 12, amendments Nos 61, 62 and 63 are acceptable. Amendments Nos 65, 67, 68 and 69 are also acceptable. In group 13, amendments Nos 71 and 72 are acceptable. In group 14, amendments Nos 76 and 77 are acceptable, amendments Nos 78, 79 and 80 are acceptable, amendment No. 84 is acceptable and amendments Nos 85 and 92 inclusive are acceptable. In group 15, amendment No. 94 is acceptable. I indicate that the Government, in saying that these amendments are acceptable, still believes that the Bill would be more adequate and complete if its clauses, as originally proposed, were carried by the Committee. But in the interests of focusing the debate, and believing that these particular matters, perhaps, do not go to the heart of the legislation, the Government now indicates its acceptance of those amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is very grateful to the Government for its expression of support for a number of amendments. It is the Minister's view that the amendments do not go to the central matters about which the Bill is constructed. Therefore, it follows quite logically that some of the other amendments which the Opposition proposes to move may be more contentious. It may be convenient for the Committee if I move these amendments as we come to them. However, I may wish to speak briefly on a couple of them. The other amendments are moved seriatim in the order that we have circulated them. In that way, things will be kept in better order.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not know when the Australian Democrats wish to interpose their amendments-they have circulated several. I think that some of them relate to the ATSIC Commercial Development Corporation. During that section of debate, they may wish to move some of their amendments. I indicate that we will persist with a number of our amendments which we think are matters of some importance. I am grateful to the Government for the concessions that are contained in the Minister's announcement, which help considerably in the process. </PARA>

That is one amendment which may involve some debate. As the Minister knows, if that motion is successful, I will immediately move for a separate debate on the preamble and for it to be put as a separate motion to be debated cognately with this Bill. It might expedite the debate if the Minister indicates his attitude to that proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand it, Senator Coulter wishes to put the substance of the preamble in a separate motion, which may be adopted also by the House of Representatives and, therefore, become a joint resolution of both Houses. The Government will not oppose that. Nevertheless, it would wish to persevere with the placing of the substance of that resolution within the preamble to the Bill. In other words, the preamble would adopt the resolution which was recently passed by the Senate. That is the way in which the Government would wish to proceed. The technicalities of that would occur at the end of this debate. Perhaps we could discuss the technicalities during the lunch hour.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition's intention at this stage would be to discuss the matter at a later stage-when we get to it. I indicate to Senator Coulter that it is the Opposition's disposition to support the separation of the preamble, for reasons which will be made clear by Senator Puplick when the time comes, and to have it taken out of the Bill and considered as a separate motion almost immediately. As soon as we have finished the discussions on the Bill we could go on to discuss the preamble. As we understand it, that is Senator Coulter's intention and he would have the support of the Opposition in taking that course. I now formally wish to move amendment No. 46 which is an amendment to insert a new clause after clause 36 at page 20 of the Bill. The new clause concerns disclosure of interests by commissioners. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (46) Page 20, after clause 36, insert the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA>Disclosure of interests</PARA>
<PARA> ``36a. (1) Each Commissioner shall make to the Minister a written disclosure of the [financial] interests of the Commissioner and the members of the Commissioner's immediate family equivalent to the disclosure of financial interests required to be made by officers of the Australian Public Service who are members of the Senior Executive Service. </PARA>
<PARA> ``(2) A Commissioner shall make a disclosure under subsection (1) within one month after being appointed as a Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> ``(3) A Commissioner shall from time to time make such further disclosures as are necessary to ensure that the information available to the Minister about the financial interests of that Commissioner and the members of his or her immediate family is up-to-date. </PARA>
<PARA> ``(4) The Minister shall ensure that the information provided to him or her under this section is available, on request, for inspection by members of the public. </PARA>
<PARA> ``(5) In this section:</PARA>
<PARA> `Commissioner' includes an acting Commissioner.''. </PARA>
<PARA>I am grateful to the Minister for his indication that the Government will support subclauses 1, 2 and 3 of that amendment but that he will do so subject to the deletion of proposed subclause 4. The proposed amendment is designed to put into statutory form a practice which has been followed since the Aboriginal Development Commission began its operation in 1980. I should say that it has been followed except when the acting commissioners appointed by the present Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, took office in May 1988. Up to that time the practice had been followed. This practice required a disclosure of interests by commissioners and the disclosure was in the form which is proposed in this amendment. If a commissioner has financial interests which may relate to the work being done by the Commission, then it is proper that the other commissioners know of those financial interests. This clause is drafted merely to try to make that clear and to put that provision into statutory form. I seek clarification from the Minister on that matter. I note that the circulated amendment has the word `financial' in subclause 1 in square brackets. I take it that that is there because there is some question as to whether it is desirable to have the word there. I would just like an indication or a bit of advice from the Minister as to whether he thinks it should be there. I think it probably should be there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate to the Committee that there is no need to move amendment No. 47 as we dealt with a replacement amendment a few moments ago. I now proceed to amendment No. 48. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (48) Page 21, subclause 38 (7), lines 3 to 7, leave out the subclause. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment No. 48 seeks to leave out proposed subclause 7 of clause 38 which appears on page 21 of the Bill. The first thing to ask ourselves is why subclause 7 has been inserted in the Bill. The subclause proposes that a commissioner shall be taken to be guilty of misbehaviour-I quote from the subclause:</PARA>
<PARA> if he or she has voted in favour of, or knowingly participated in, a contravention of a lawful direction given by the Minister to the Commission, whether under section 12 or 73 or any other provision of this Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly this subclause has been inserted to meet what the Government sees as the problems encountered by the Minister in early May 1988. That was the time the Minister actually issued a direction to the then commissioners. The then commissioners determined to test that direction by going to the Federal Court. They advised the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs-a committee on which Senator Coulter, Senator Boswell and I served-that had the Minister's direction been found to be lawful, they would have obeyed it. They were not certain that it was lawful for several good reasons. Firstly, no Minister had ever given such a direction. They thought it appropriate to test it and the Federal Court was the appropriate place to do this. To be fair, I recall that Senator McMullan asked whether they could guarantee that they would not have appealed had they lost in the Federal Court. The point remains that had the commissioners found they were facing a lawful direction they would have obeyed it. </PARA>
<PARA> This subclause is drawn in such a way that it would be enough to have voted in favour of a contravention of a lawful direction given by the Minister; that is to say, if one voted not to accept a direction from the Minister today, sent it to the court and three months later it was found to have been a lawful direction, it could be said that one had voted against it. The Minister wishes to intervene and I yield to him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Baume and I had a brief private discussion on this subclause of clause 38. I indicate to Senator Baume and Senator Coulter that I agree entirely with Senator Baume's general proposition that if members of such a commission-I use his terms-found that they were contravening a lawful direction, they would change their behaviour and obey it. There is no question of that. The point is that they need to know. I propose that in clause 38 (7), line 4, before the word `voted' we insert the word `knowingly'. The clause would then read:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . knowingly voted in favour of, or knowingly participated in, a contravention of a lawful direction given by the Minister to the Commission. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that means that a person then has full knowledge that what he is doing is in opposition to a lawful direction. I think most members of this chamber would agree that the consequences indicate that it should flow. </PARA>

<PARA>So we have two matters there which do not make it immediately compelling, coercive or mandatory, which I think is the terminology used; there has to be consultation with the Commission.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the discussion so far has been somewhat oblique. The real point is the time at which the action the Commissioner takes is judged to be lawful or unlawful. There is some uncertainty about whether a direction is lawful and that is the point Senator Baume raised initially. The lawfulness or otherwise of a direction could be subject to testing in the courts. So a commissioner may, in good faith, have voted or acted in a way which was contrary to a direction, believing that the direction of the Minister was unlawful. It really does swing on the word `knowingly', which the Minister is seeking to include. Does `knowingly' mean that the matter has been fully tested before the courts and in the light of that information being known to the commissioner, that that commissioner then votes or behaves in a certain way, or does it mean simply believing at the time that it was lawful that the commissioner votes or acts in a certain way subject to the matter being tested before the courts? My own view on this is that the clause clearly has to be there. The appropriateness of the action which the Minister will take will be judged in the light of any court challenges which may either precede or follow the voting or the action. In the light of that judgment it will be judged whether the direction was lawful or not.</PARA></TALK.START>

As the passage is presently drafted there seems to be a clear contrast between knowingly participating in a contravention of a lawful direction and simply voting with or without the knowledge that one is contravening a lawful direction.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I sought leave to move all those amendments together earlier. They were taken in globo because they were all in the same form, and we actually determined them at that time. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (52) Page 50, subclause 116 (2), lines 21 and 22, leave out the subclause, insert the following subclause:</PARA>
<PARA> (2) A disclosure under subsection (1) shall be recorded in the minutes of the meeting and the member shall not:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) be present during any deliberation of the Regional Council with respect to that matter; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) take part in any decision of the Regional Council with respect to that matter.''. </PARA>
<PARA>As subclause 2 exists, it simply says `a disclosure under subsection (1)'. This is a disclosure of the interests of any regional council, so that if a member of a regional council has a financial interest in any of the matters coming before the council, at least his or her fellow regional councillors should know that fact. The subclause, as drafted, merely says that disclosure shall be recorded in the minutes of the meeting. We have sought to leave out that subclause and insert another subclause, which says:</PARA>
<PARA> A disclosure under subsection (1) shall be recorded in the minutes of the meeting and the members shall not:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) be present during any deliberation of the Regional Council with respect to that matter; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) take part in any decision of the Regional Council in respect of that matter. </PARA>
<PARA>The effect of that would be that if I had a pecuniary interest, direct or indirect, in a matter to be considered or about to be considered by a regional council, I would then declare that interest, it would be recorded in the minutes of the meeting, and I would then, if this amendment was carried, withdraw from the meeting and not take part in any decision, because I should not take part while having a direct or indirect pecuniary interest. </PARA>
<PARA> I advise members of the Committee that I represent this Parliament on the council of the Australian National University (ANU). It is now public knowledge that at our last council meeting we had to discuss the question of amalgamation within the Australian Capital Territory, and one of the members of the ANU council raised with the Chancellor in advance the question of whether the Vice-Chancellor had a direct or indirect pecuniary interest. The reason for this was that, if we chose to amalgamate and there was a new amalgamated institution, as the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) had already indicated, our Vice-Chancellor would become the Vice-Chancellor of the new amalgamated institution. It was interesting that the Chancellor quite properly referred that matter to the university solicitor, who decided that the Vice-Chancellor had no direct or indirect pecuniary interest under the meaning of the Act but that the Deputy Vice-Chancellor did. At the ANU Council, that was recorded in the minutes, and when the matter came up for discussion the Deputy Vice-Chancellor then withdrew from the meeting and took no part in the discussion or the decision, as he was required to do. If there is a matter in which I have an interest and it is to be determined in a collegium such as a university council represents, then I should not take part in that decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what might happen in a regional council. Regional councils should be in the business of making decisions about the allocation of resources. They are in the business of making decisions which will be in favour of one and against another. They will be making choices about using limited resources to meet very great demands. They will be in the business of saying yes to some and no to others. We know already that the voting system proposed is a proportional voting system. We can suspect that the largest identifiable group may well have the largest number of members on a regional council. What I want to avoid is that all the money goes to them. I want to make sure that decisions are at least taken on some reasonable basis. We are in a quandary, because if I say that no-one is able to speak on his or her own behalf, then who will speak for that person? On the other hand, if a person has a dominant voting position, that person can affect the distribution of resources, the preparation of the draft budgets, in an unreasonable way. </PARA>
<PARA> In reporting to the Parliament on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill 1989, the Senate Legislative Scrutiny Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills looked at this matter. It discussed the clause that dealt with disclosure of interest. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>This clause is in similar terms to clause 101 in the previous Bill and requires a member of a Regional Council to disclose a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in a matter before the Council, and that interest is to be recorded in the Minutes of the Meeting. </PARA>
<PARA>The Scrutiny of Bills Committee went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>This provision is compared with:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Clause 36-where a member of the Commission-</PARA>
<PARA>this is a member of the Commission now as opposed to a member of a regional council-</PARA>
<PARA>is required to disclose any pecuniary interest which is duly recorded in the Minutes. Subclause 36 (2) provides that the Commissioner cannot be present, or take part in any decision relating to that matter. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate that we have already determined that should commissioners have a direct or indirect pecuniary interest, not only must that be recorded in the minutes but also the commissioners cannot be present and cannot vote. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Subclause 159 (1) and (2) are similar provisions relating to disclosure by a Director of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Board. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has yet to get to that part of the Bill but we are aware that ahead of us lies the question of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation board. It has similar provisions. If there is a direct or indirect pecuniary interest it shall be recorded in the minutes, the person shall not be present and shall not vote. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee sought comment from the Minister on the reason for the difference between the disclosure of interest provisions for members of Regional Councils, compared to those imposed on a Commissioner or a Director of the Board. </PARA>
<PARA>Because we are trying to be fair here I will read the second paragraph of the Minister's response to that, which was in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>The reason for the difference relates primarily to the role and functions of regional councils. Regional councils will frequently deal with matters that will necessarily directly or indirectly affect the pecuniary interests of all the regional councillors. In such circumstances, a provision requiring councillors not to take part in decisions and decision-making would prevent the regional council from fulfilling its functions. </PARA>
<PARA>Then the Scrutiny of Bills Committee thanked the Minister and recommended nothing. I believe that we have to test the Minister's response. Unless the Minister's response is sustainable, I believe it is of no force. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>Regional Councils will frequently deal with matters that will necessarily directly or indirectly affect the pecuniary interests of all the regional councillors. </PARA>
<PARA>It would have to be a very indirect interest to have that happen because, while it may be direct for some, it would be quite indirect for others. One might say that someone involved in a question of allocation of resources has a direct pecuniary interest in every vote. Only if one believed that the Opposition's amendment would make the operation of regional councils impossible-and that is not the intention of the Opposition-would one wish to oppose our amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee's acceptance of the Minister's advice is not well based. The closer people are to the issues-that is, the issue which may be under discussion in a regional council: `Do we fund a new medical service in such and such a town?', for example-the greater will be the difficulties where people actually have a pecuniary interest and the more important it will be to separate people, to take out people who have a direct interest and ensure that they are not part of the decision and the vote. The option of remaining in the meeting with the agreement and consent of the other people there was not recommended for attention and the same principle should apply in regional councils. When I say it was not recommended for attention in the Commission, we are now looking at one level down from the Commission-at the regional councils. We believe that if it was good enough not to be recommended for the Commission the same principle should apply to the regional councils. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment proposed by the Opposition would do three things: it would require that the matter be recorded in the minutes, that a person not be present in respect of that matter or that a person not take part in a decision. Unless someone can say that that would render the regional council unworkable, I believe there is no really good, sustainable argument against the amendment and I do not understand the proposition-I am open to be convinced-that it would render the regional councils unworkable. Unless that can be demonstrated, I think that this is another amendment which will not only help improve the legislation, but actually help the public perception about the fairness and propriety of the legislation and, to that extent, would actually help Aboriginal Australians in the job they have to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is another aspect which Senator Peter Baume has not mentioned; that is, when the regional councils deal with financial aspects, they will be dealing with budgets, and those budgets will be subject to amalgamation with the budgets of other regional councils, scrutiny by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) and then, finally, an overview by the Minister. I would have thought that in relation to direct pecuniary interests the recording in the minutes of the interest of a particular person who has had a hand in the decision at the lowest level-that is, the regional council in relation to these draft budgets-so that that fact is known to both ATSIC and the Minister, would be sufficient for ATSIC or the Minister to consider, `Perhaps this has been influenced in some way which is not in the interests of the overall community which the regional council is attempting to help'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that there is an element of truth in the argument which the Government is putting; that is, the small regional councils will represent sectional interests and probably many of them will have, in some sense or other, a pecuniary interest in the outcome of particular decisions. It may well make the councils unworkable if one were to deny access to the decision-making process of all the people who had an interest. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a matter of balance; it is a matter of sufficient revelation of the fact of a pecuniary interest combined with the other protections which are built in and which I think can be adequately implemented through the disclosure in the minutes procedure and that should be balanced against the desirability of having the whole regional council involved in the decision-making process. For those reasons the clause, as printed in the Bill, should be an adequate protection against those things which Senator Baume has drawn to our attention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendment that the Opposition has moved is quite reasonable. If a person has a monetary interest in a particular program, he should absent himself from the meeting. Where members of regional councils come together, it could well be that a member of a council is interested in developing a particular project-it could be a fishing boat, a farm, or anything else that one cares to mention. If that person attends the regional council meeting at the time that the project is being discussed and evaluated, I believe it will inhibit free and frank discussion. The regional councillors will be inhibited in making a statement in open debate. They may fear that there will be repercussions or that they will offend one of their colleagues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is normal business practice on any council or board for a person who has a particular interest in a project, to absent himself from the room and leave the remaining people to debate the issue without his personal involvement. I do not see that what is being proposed now moves away from the way that business is run throughout Australia. I know that Senator Coulter would understand that if a person on a regional council wanted a particular project to go ahead his colleagues might not be able to debate the matter in an open way for fear that they might offend him. I do not see what the Opposition is moving here as being in any way different from the practice followed by any other board, council or institution in Australia. With this legislation, we are establishing a commission that will be massive in terms of money and influence. I urge the Australian Democrats to support this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a bit surprised at Senator Boswell's response to what I was saying. He seems to be mistakenly implying that, like other boards of companies and other organisations, the regional councils will have hands-on day to day financial management. That will not be the case. The essential point is that most of the decisions they will be making will be of a more general, non-financial and philosophical nature. The financial part of their deliberations will be with respect to the draft annual budget, which will go through the processes that I have outlined. That is subject to significant safeguards, so I do not think that Senator Boswell is correct in drawing the sorts of parallels that he has. The question really is whether we want to exclude from these more general discussions people who might have pecuniary interests even though, in the specifically financial and budgetary deliberations, there will be oversight mechanisms through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and through the right of ministerial veto.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What has been mentioned by Senator Coulter and Senator Peter Baume is that we need to get a fair and workable system in place. The approach that the Government has taken is the only workable and balanced way to go about this particular matter. What we are proposing is that if there is a potential conflict of interest there needs to be full disclosure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Baume rightly referred to the Minister's response to the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills to the effect that there may often be situations where regional councillors have a pecuniary interest. They may, for example, be members of a particular corporation which has a claim on a budget which the council has to make a determination on. That could very well put them in a conflict of interest situation. It is also appropriate to look at another scenario. In a particular region a number of people may be on a whole range of bodies. Such people would need to prioritise their interests. To draw an analogy between the situations that we are trying to address with their peculiarly different characteristics and the university situation, as Senator Baume did, may be trying to apply a principle too rigidly in the sorts of circumstances we have to address. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I want to make is one that I am glad Senator Coulter made. It is that regional councils will not handle money. They have decision making power in terms of prioritising and allocating funds, but there is a clear distinction between this situation and the one that Senator Boswell mentioned. In summary, it is very much the Government's clear submission that what we need to achieve and what we have achieved through a position of disclosure rather than the preclusion of people from a role on regional councils is the only workable way to go about this process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must respond to a couple of points that have been made. First, it is simply not correct to say that the regional councils will have only the budget making decision where this question might arise. At this stage, I am the only person in the chamber who has actually been the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I know of the situation where money is allocated through a budgetary process and at a local level decisions then have to be made as to who will get the benefit of that money. I will give honourable senators an example. A housing association is given money to build four houses for which there are 15 applicants. I submit that the people who get the houses have a pecuniary interest in the matter. It is not simply a social interest but in many cases it is quite a pecuniary interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By just looking back a decade I can well remember-I think I have already mentioned it to the Committee-that in Kempsey violence went on between the members of the local group. Axes were put through the sides of motor cars because one group believed it was being unfairly treated in terms of the local allocation, well after the budget process was complete. Administrative matters which will involve advantage and disadvantage will be in the hands of regional councils when Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission becomes operational. They will represent a kind of pecuniary interest. That is the first thing. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing I draw to honourable senators' attention is clause 36 of the present Bill which deals with the situation facing the commissioners of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. It will become apparent from the words at the top of page 20 that the words we have proposed to add to clause 116 at page 50 are words which we have taken unchanged from an earlier clause of the same Bill. We have changed `Commissioner' to a `member of a Regional Council', but we have substantially taken the words unchanged from an earlier clause and moved them to clause 116 (1), so that the rules which apply to commissioners who have to declare or disclose an interest would apply to members of regional councils. We have not introduced any matter that was not in the Bill. We have simply said that what was good enough to apply to the commissioners should also apply to those at regional council level. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) that I cannot believe that such a provision would, as it were, nobble the regional councils in carrying out their proper function, but if that is the view of the Government I ask the Minister whether there is not some middle reasonable road. I do so because I believe that a mere recording of a pecuniary interest in the minutes is not sufficient. It was not sufficient for the commissioners, and the Government's Bill includes the other provisions in relation to commissioners. I believe that something more is necessary. One way of handling it might be to ask our Parliamentary Counsel to look at some middle road. I cannot believe that a direct pecuniary interest would stop the operation of a regional council, and I find it very difficult to believe that an indirect pecuniary interest would stop it, but the Minister says that that could be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision which we have proposed is consistent with that which is proposed for the Commission itself. It is appropriate that it be included for the regional councils and if, for technical reasons, the Government believes it goes a bit too far, then I would ask the Government to have our Parliamentary Counsel look at some other form of words which would achieve the kinds of safeguards which we believe are desirable, and which would provide a course of action consistent with that which will apply to commissioners in a way that would not place the position of regional councils in unreasonable jeopardy. I ask the Minister for some response to that proposal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is fair to say that Senator Peter Baume's concern is one that is recognised and understood. While understanding the sort of problem he raises, the Government has responded to it in different ways, given different situations. Senator Baume rightly pointed to the rules governing the disclosure of interests by commissioners of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, when he referred to clause 36 (2) at the top of page 20 of the Bill. As I said earlier, and as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) said in his response to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, regional councils, however, are in a peculiarly different situation. As I also said earlier, to make them workable we have adopted this particular approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Baume talks of a middle course. It is fair to say, when looking at the totality of the administration and the oversight of regional councils, that the Government has put in protections to accommodate Senator Baume's concerns. Clause 95 (6) provides that the Commission may ask a regional council to reconsider its draft budget. Obviously the situations that Senator Baume is concerned about could very well be taken into account by the Commission, by invoking its powers under that clause. The ultimate oversight is contained in subclauses 1 and 2 of clause 59, under which the Minister has the power to approve estimates of expenditure of the Commission, including the budgets of regional councils. So there are those two oversight mechanisms as well as the important requirement to disclose an interest. It is very much our opinion that that is probably as middle of the road as we can get in responding to the sort of problem raised by Senator Baume. We recognise the problem and we have tackled it in this way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for the courtesy of his response, but we are still some distance apart. He is a Minister of the Crown. He will know that if a commission or a Minister were faced with the fact that at the local regional council level a group was unable to attract support for a project it is very unlikely that the Minister or the commission would seek to overturn that. The provision to which the Minister directed me merely provides that the regional council may be asked to re-examine its budget in specified ways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has proposed the addition of two subclauses, (a) and (b). I indicate that we feel particularly strongly that no-one with a direct or indirect pecuniary interest should take part in a decision. If I were forced to say which of those two was the more important, I would say (b). People should simply not take part in a decision if they stand to gain from it. I cannot understand why the Committee would want to vote against that part of the amendment. We have suggested in option (a) that they should not even be present. I am willing to say that it might be the view of the Committee that perhaps people should be present, but we do not think they should take any part in the decision. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been close to the administration of these matters and I know what will happen. I am concerned to see these regional councils operate without bringing Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders into disrepute. I have seen enough newspapers in country towns in which decisions have been laid out and dissected to know that this can easily happen. I believe that the provision which has been proposed by the Opposition, particularly proposed subclause (b), is a necessary and wise provision.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Heaven preserve this Parliament and the people of Australia from academics and lawyers. I have an academic sitting beside me and the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus), who is in the chamber, is a lawyer. I can understand Senator Peter Baume's anguish over this clause because he has been Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and has been faced with the stark reality of Aboriginal corporate management in the field. When the white man arrived in Australia the Aboriginals did not have a cash mentality, let alone a cash economy. It has been only in recent decades that they have started to get a smattering of it. Part Aborigines, of course, are a bit further down the track towards a cash mentality and economy and moving to handle corporate affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When it comes to the administration of Aboriginal corporate affairs, there needs to be a supervisory role for the Government with regard to Aboriginal corporate management in the field. Senator Baume has described how it has led to violence in the past. Even now Aborigines do not distinguish between pecuniary interests, practical interests, and property interests, but they do understand that they can use corporate machinery to advantage one person and not another. They have practised this sort of thing. A long learning process will be involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister and Senator Coulter may think that they are helping Aborigines by giving them greater licence to operate in this area, but Aborigines should learn that they have to declare pecuniary interests. If they have a pecuniary interest, or if it involves their own people-the skin debate, as it is referred to-they should learn not only to not take part in the debate-Senator Baume is proposing that they not take part in it-but also not to vote on the matter. So the Minister's attitude and Senator Coulter's attitude are entirely impractical. They do a disservice to Aborigines. If Senator Baume is willing to search for a middle ground, I do not see that there is a middle ground; one is either in business or out of business-we should accept his amendment. </PARA>

If it is revealed in the minutes that somebody has a pecuniary interest and it is seen by the Aboriginal community that money has been disbursed in a particular way with respect to housing, what happens at the next council election? I would have thought that that in itself would provide the type of control which would ensure that things would be fairly distributed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Woorabinda and Cherbourg will make up a regional council on their own. With proportional voting we could be pretty sure that Woorabinda would always have a majority. If the allocation was weighted 100 per cent to Woorabinda, at the next election it would still have a majority. I suspect from experience that the local loyalties would continue to predominate. I am just using that as an example. I am not making any particular accusations against those two Queensland communities. Voting, in my experience, runs along clan and kinship lines. If that is the case, I do not think people will adjust their vote, as Senator Coulter and I might have thought they would, on the basis of any demonstrated unfairness in administrative matters. All we are asking is that we do what we can to prevent these unfairnesses happening. I do not think that at the next election the matter would be fixed. I put to Senator Coulter that one of the things that he and the Committee want is to get a package which in the end is workable and which will now bring the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission into disrepute at any particular level.

It would be a matter which can be corrected through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) and the Minister. If, as in the example used, two communities are pushed together into one regional council, and one community continually dominates through a perfectly legitimate representational process, and uses that strength to allocate resources unfairly in one direction rather than in another, surely that is precisely the situation in which either ATSIC or the Minister will step in and say, `You really have to move your allocation towards the minority grouping within the regional council'. That is the point I was making earlier. It seems to me that it is a process which is in place which does have the potential to correct these anomalies.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to direct the Committee's attention for a moment to clause 118. Clause 118 concerns persons taken to have resigned from regional councils in certain circumstances. I observe that, under clause 116 as it is drafted, the clause with which we have been dealing and which involves the disclosure of pecuniary interests, there is no sanction written in to discipline a councillor who fails to declare a pecuniary interest. Clause 116 states that a member of a regional council who has a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in a matter shall:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . as soon as possible after the relevant facts have come to the member's knowledge, disclose the nature of the interest at a meeting of the Regional Council. </PARA>
<PARA>That is clear enough. The question we then ask is: What happens if that regional councillor fails to undertake that procedure? The question of sanctions then becomes one that the Committee should consider. There is a belief that such a failure to declare a pecuniary interest ought to disqualify a councillor from office, just as it should do for a commissioner of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission; as we discussed earlier. In fact it does disqualify a commissioner of the Commission. Clause 38 (6) (d) provides that, if a commissioner:</PARA>
<PARA>fails, without reasonable excuse, to comply with section 36; the Minister shall terminate the appointment of that Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA>So a sanction is written in for a commissioner, but no sanction is written in for a regional councillor. The question then is whether clause 118 should contain a sanction of the same kind. Clause 36 has no provision for an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), to make the matter reviewable by it. Clause 36 simply states that, if a commissioner does certain things, the Minister shall terminate his appointment. That is designed for good and proper reasons to make sure that, if a commissioner carries out certain actions that are unreasonable or improper, his or her appointment shall be terminated. I ask the Committee to explain to me why there is no similar provision for regional councillors. I indicate that it had been the intention of the Opposition initially to move not only that the regional councillor might be dismissed but to question why that should be reviewable by the AAT when a similar provision for the commissioners of ATSIC is not so reviewable. Before I move the amendment, I would like to hear some argument from other members of the Committee and to proceed from there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Peter Baume raises a point which has been considered by the Government. Like much of the Bill, in terms of the mechanics and operation of it, we have had to take into account a whole raft of considerations on this. On the one hand, Senator Baume has raised an isolated part of the problem, a sanction for non-disclosure. The obvious sanction there would be to have the Minister remove the councillor. The Government is concerned that that sort of power in the hands of the Minister, given the complexity of the whole concept of conflict of interest and the way it would be understood and applied on the ground, could in fact lead to excesses. It could lead to a situation where a person or a Minister may make a decision for removal of a councillor on less than the direct reasons involved. In fact, a person could set himself up-that is what I am getting at-and then be open to removal for reasons that are less than related to the actual lack of disclosure.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The lack of disclosure may take place inadvertently-quite often on the ground-and, as a consequence, a person may leave himself open for wide use of ministerial power. Having said that, however, the Government recognises that there is a problem that needs to be addressed. The way in which the Government has chosen to address it is through clause 120 of the Bill which provides for removal of the whole council where a petition is initiated by an eligible person. Members of the regional council concerned would be eligible persons. We have a whole structure to provide for those petitions. We anticipate that those petitions will take place for a whole range of reasons. One circumstance that would be covered would be where there has been misuse of a regional councillor's power or a lack of disclosure which tries to conceal some sort of indiscretion on behalf of the councillor. Instead of making the councillor liable to the penalty and making that at the whim of the Minister, we feel the most democratic way to go is to make the council responsible for its own operations and make that council responsible to its own constituents.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have read clause 120. I wish to go back and read clause 118. It is clear that the concerns I started out with have not been met satisfactorily at all. Clause 118 refers to two circumstances: where a member of a regional council does not live in the region and where a member of a regional council has not lived in that region at all during the immediate preceding six months. Both of these are quite reasonable. For example, somebody may come from Brewarrina but have been away from Brewarrina for eight or nine months doing some other work. Such a person would be picked up by that subclause. I do not object to that at all. But a provision should be included to cover a person who has failed to disclose a pecuniary interest. What the Minister is proposing to the Committee is quite unsatisfactory. He is saying that, if in a regional council of, say, 20 people, it is discovered that one of those people has failed to disclose a pecuniary interest, the only remedy is for the whole regional council to be dismissed, using the petitioning procedure. That is unsatisfactory. It means that if I was on a regional council, and did not like that regional council, I could set the council up for dismissal, could I not? The Minister has now said that the only remedy would be to use the petitioning provisions and seek to have the council removed. As I said, I have not yet moved an amendment. I propose to the Committee that, if the Government is sensible and if the Committee will agree, we certainly should arrange that those who fail to disclose an interest should themselves-not the whole council of which they are a member-be liable to be included in the provisions of clause 118. It could be handled fairly simply by adding a subparagraph (c) to clause 118 (1). Clause 118 (1) states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Where the Commission is satisfied that a member of a regional council:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) does not live in the region; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) has not lived in the region at all during the immediately preceding period of six months;</PARA>
<PARA>If Parliamentary Counsel can draft the correct words, we propose a subparagraph (c) along the lines of `has failed to disclose an interest as required under section 116'. If that could be done, it would overcome much of the problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On that point, and in the interests of being fair and reasonable, I suggest a way that we can get around this. We could defer this for formalisation later. The most appropriate place to tackle this particular problem is in clause 119, where we have the provision for persons to cease to be on regional councils in certain circumstances, by the insertion of a clause after clause 119 (1) (a) to read:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Where the Commission is satisfied that a member of a Regional Council has knowingly contravened section 116 the Commission shall, in writing, declare that it is so satisfied . . . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take it that the Minister is offering to have that provision drafted and that we come back and deal with it at an appropriate time. On that basis I indicate that the Opposition does not intend to move circulated amendments Nos 53 and 54 because the problem has been overcome in a better way as a result of what the Minister has proposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now turn to circulated amendment No. 55. I seek the advice of the Minister and the Clerks. The proposed amendment which I have not yet moved also relates to clause 119. It also proposes to put in the same kind of disqualifications that we put in earlier about people who become subject to imprisonment. I think that the proper way to handle that-if we have not already agreed to it; I do not think we have-is for me to seek leave to move not amendment No. 55 as has been circulated but amendment No. 55 in a form which I hope the Parliamentary Counsel could get ready for us. It will be in the same form as those amendments which we dealt with when the committee stage began today. In other words, the same disqualifications-imprisonment for one year or longer, conviction for dishonesty with a prison term of three months or longer and so on-will be inserted with exactly the same wording as in previous amendments but the provision relating to bankruptcy will be omitted for the reasons that it was left out before; that is to convert that amendment into the same kind of amendment that we had previously. If we did that it could be inserted before or after the proposed subclause which Senator Bolkus has stated should go into clause 119. I would like some indication from the Government on this matter so that I know what course the Opposition should take. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having clarified some of the points I think we have an amendment No. 55 which has been drafted and Senator Tate indicated acceptance of it this morning. Having had another look at that, subclause 1 (c) of that clause picks up the point that Senator Peter Baume is making in terms of removal of councillors in conflict situations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister is quite right. I have picked it up. That matter is now dealt with and we do not have to go back to it. As the circulated amendment says, `has failed, without reasonable excuse to comply with section 116', so the problem is overcome. The Minister is quite correct. I now move amendment No. 56:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (56) Pages 85 and 86, clause 222, lines 36 (page 85) to line 6 (page 86), leave out the clause. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment has been circulated in the name of the Opposition. It relates to page 85 of the Bill and to clause 222. The Committee will recall that some time ago we dealt in group 3 with the Opposition's proposal to amend clause 221 of the Bill. The argument in this case is not really very different. The Opposition's proposal is that the clause be left out. The amendment actually proposes that. Clause 222 did not appear in the 1988 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill which appeared before the Parliament. The effect of the clause will be to enable the Minister to delegate his powers-I suggest that honourable senators look at the words-either to the Department or to an officer of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC).</PARA>
<PARA> This clause concerns the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act. It is proposed that the Minister could delegate his powers under that Act either to the Department or to an officer of ATSIC. Now this raises an issue which goes to the heart of the question. Who administers Aboriginal portfolio legislation under the new ATSIC proposal? This question was dealt with by the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs in paragraphs 2.9 to 2.22 of its report. I will just refer honourable senators to that section as it is the one which deals with ministerial advice. It drew to the attention of the Senate in the agreed majority report the very great difficulty that existed for the Minister in receiving advice from a department or from a statutory commission. The Senate Select Committee recommended:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a separate office of Aboriginal Affairs be retained within Employment, Education and Training portfolio . . . responsible for advising the Minister-</PARA>
<PARA>I want to emphasise the next words-</PARA>
<PARA>on all matters relevant to the portfolio-</PARA>
<PARA>I want to emphasise the next words-</PARA>
<PARA>including the administration of legislation and the exercise of delegations . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is what Senator Boswell, Senator Coulter and I recommended to the Senate just a few short months ago. We chose our words carefully-that is at paragraph 2.22-in that Senate Select Committee report. We recommended that there be a departmental presence to advise the Minister on all matters relevant to the portfolio, including the administration of legislation and the exercise of delegation. But what the Government has proposed with this Bill is the amendment of most portfolio legislation to allow for a share-up of delegations between ATSIC and the Department. If we look at part 6 and division 5 we find that clause 222 refers to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, clause 224 to the Aboriginal Land Grant (Jervis Bay Territory) Act, clause 225 to the Aboriginal Land (Lake Condah and Framlingham Forest) Act, and clause 226-a very important and quite sensitive clause-to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Select Committee believes that the Minister should receive advice and retain his delegations. He should not pass them on to a statutory authority. We will reach a position where statutory authorities will deal with State and Territory governments saying that they have the carriage or authority under certain State legislation. It is an extremely provocative provision. Who will administer various parts of various Acts? Some bits will be administered by the Department and some bits will be administered by ATSIC. It is not an academic question. An officer working in ATSIC, or whatever office is created to advise the Minister, as required under the Constitution, will have to find out whether he or she has delegated authority or whether it belongs in the other place. We do not believe that the Government has paid any significant attention to the recommendation of the Senate Select Committee, to which at least three of us in this chamber were parties. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes that ATSIC will administer all these pieces of legislation under the delegation of the Minister. We believe that that was always the Government's intention. That is not what the Senate Select Committee recommended unanimously. Technically, the Minister administers legislation, but he has to have a department, staff or someone to perform the multitude of tasks which that legislation requires of him to make all the decisions contemplated by the legislation he administers. The constitutional propriety that has grown up over almost a century is that a Minister's department assumes the role of advising and assisting the Minister and accepting delegations. That is reflected in the Administrative Arrangements Order. </PARA>
<PARA> In the original ATSIC proposal there was to be a vacuum, because originally it was proposed that there be no department. I draw the attention of honourable senators to the transcript of evidence before the Senate Select Committee, particularly pages 223 to 229 and 235. That evidence established quite clearly that it was intended that ATSIC would administer all Aboriginal portfolio legislation, including the ATSIC Act. That was what the Committee was told by the officials who were preparing the ATSIC proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee came down with a recommendation which drew attention to the constitutional requirements and the practicalities. The Government's only reaction to the Senate Select Committee's recommendation was set out in the Minister's `The Way Ahead' statement of 11 April 1989 which appears at page 1336 of the Weekly Hansard of the other place. The statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the first recommendation of the Senate Select Committee that a separate Office of Aboriginal Affairs be retained within the Employment, Education and Training portfolio, I should point out that the ATSIC Bill does not restrict the advice available to the Minister to that provided by ATSIC. Indeed, it was always envisaged, under the ATSIC proposal, that there could be circumstances where the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, and also the portfolio Minister, might occasionally require separate departmental advice on issues concerning ATSIC, and that this advice would come from the portfolio Department. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise `might occasionally require separate departmental advice'. That is not what the Senate Select Committee recommended. This situation is unprecedented in Commonwealth legislative dispositions. I will draw on some examples. Should an elected social security commission, chosen from a pensioner constituency, administer all pension laws? Should a veterans' commission, drawn from returned service men and women around Australia, administer all veterans' legislation? Should farmers elect some of their members to run the Department of Primary Industries and Energy? I am not talking about a statutory marketing authority: I am talking about the Department. A department of state is a constitutional entity which exists for a purpose. What is proposed here is quite unprecedented. The Minister wrote to his colleagues the State Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs on 5 January 1989 in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>10. Ministerial Responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of submissions to the Senate Select Committee have argued that it is inappropriate that Commission staff should advise the Minister responsible for ATSIC on the administration of legislation. It was argued that it was an established principle that Ministers take advice from their Department, and that the proposed arrangements under ATSIC breached that principle. It was further alleged that this situation would lead to a situation where the administration of legislation such as the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 could adversely impact on mining and pastoral interests. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister's letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> 11. These arguments point to a fundamental misunderstanding of the Westminster principles of Ministerial responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the Minister's argument and I want to present it to be fair:</PARA>
<PARA>In all cases, it is the Minister who administers legislation. The Australian Constitution requires that Ministers be appointed to administer a Department; thus this source of advice is not ruled out by the ATSIC legislation. Nevertheless, there is no principle which requires the Minister to take the advice of the Department or, for that matter, the advice of the Commission-it is the Minister who is responsible, and who is accountable to Parliament for the administration of legislation. Moreover, ATSIC staff will be engaged under the Public Service Act, and will be expected to perform in a professional manner consistent with the norms of the Australian Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA>The allegation of a so-called `fundamental misunderstanding' is rubbish. Of course the Minister is responsible. We have never suggested otherwise. He can be advised from anywhere, but it is also the case that every Minister has a department. It is the department, not statutory authorities, that advises the Minister on the administration of the statutory authority's legislation. Of course, statutory authorities may have their own legislation, but there is still a department to advise the Minister about a statutory authority. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's reference to the Constitution is astounding. Section 64 of the Constitution states that Ministers are appointed to administer departments. Therefore, Ministers without portfolios are unconstitutional. But Ministers are appointed to administer departments. So the Westminster system has a Minister to administer legislation, a department to advise the Minister and statutory authorities which are able to do whatever it is the parliament has said they can do in whatever relationship with the Minister for which the statute provides. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is certainly an aspect on which I have expressed a great deal of concern, both inside and outside the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. Indeed, I sought further advice in relation to the functioning of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission from the ATSIC task force. In that advice attention was drawn both to the advantages and to the disadvantages of ATSIC being the principal source of advice to the Minister, a representative body responsible to an Aboriginal constituency and also the body administering a large bureaucracy which will include the existing bureaucracy servicing the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal Development Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On a number of occasions I have certainly expressed concern that ATSIC will be extremely heavily loaded. The ATSIC task force, in reply to my questions on this matter, pointed to the advantages to ATSIC of being on the one hand a direct source of advice to the Minister, having access to ministerial and government thinking and, therefore, being able to have an input, but on the other hand very often wanting to make an input which is not in conformity with government policy. Of course, the obverse of this is that the Minister then has, as his principal source of advice, a body which, in a very real sense, has a divided loyalty. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has a vested interest in the advice and may be led to compromise on the sort of advice it may wish to give in light of its representation through the various Aboriginal bodies. Of course, if ATSIC then chooses to conform too closely with the desires of the Minister and the dictates of government policy, it will progressively be seen to be out of line with the wishes of Aboriginal people. Aboriginal people will then gradually lose confidence in ATSIC as the representative body and ATSIC will cease to function in the way in which we all hope that it will function. Of course, if ATSIC chooses to give advice too consistently in line with the wishes of Aboriginal people and out of line with government policy, it will progressively lose that contact which is held out as one of the principal advantages to Aboriginal people of the creation of ATSIC and the Minister will increasingly find it necessary to take advice from other sources-advice more in keeping with the policies which government wishes to pursue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This new body, ATSIC, is really being put on a knife edge. I think we have to recognise that it is on a knife edge right from the beginning. How this will be resolved will only become apparent over time. I have certainly consistently taken the view that it would be desirable if the Minister were to keep some small source of independent advice which is responsible directly to him and, therefore, directly to government policy. That would be an alternative source of advice so that ATSIC would be freer, in a real sense, to offer the sort of advice it may choose to give on many occasions-advice which is based on the wishes of its Aboriginal constituency. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage I do not make any response to the specific amendments which the Opposition is moving; I just lay that down as a general situation. I recognise that the creation of ATSIC has enormous advantages for Aboriginal people; it also has enormous dangers. Senator Baume is absolutely correct when he points out that in these clauses one finds one example of the advantages and disadvantages and the difficult task which ATSIC will have before it in fulfilling those three quite separate and, in each case, very difficult roles.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The argument I am developing now will apply to the next few amendments as well; so, in a sense, I am making the same argument in extenso just once. I pointed out a moment ago that the Westminster system provides for a Minister to administer legislation, a department to advise him, and statutory authorities to do whatever it is the Parliament has said they can do in whatever relationship with the Minister the statute provides. On the one hand ATSIC is supposed to advise the Minister about the portfolio legislation. It is proposed now that its officers are to exercise statutory delegations from him to do that, and what we are really arguing about here is the kind of delegations. On the other hand, and quite unprecedentedly, apparently they will also advise him-except perhaps occasionally, if we look at the Minister's letter to the State Ministers-on the ATSIC legislation itself. How can this possibly work? Let us look at clause 222. The Committee will observe that the delegation in paragraph (c) is to-and I quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Chief Executive Officer of, or a member of the staff of, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the part that has been added. The reality is that the chief executive officer must take his orders from the commissioners. We know that. Clause 44, subclause (4) states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Chief Executive Officer shall . . . act in accordance with . . . any directions given, by the Commission in writing. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 53 provides that staff of the Commission must take orders from the chief executive officer as though that officer were a secretary to a department. Not one letter of either of these clauses was changed from the 1988 Bill when the 1989 Bill was introduced. We find that those words have come through unchanged. But while the Bill was being guillotined through the House of Representatives, the Government forced an amendment-proposed new subclause 44 (5)-which turns the chief executive officer into something else. We say that it turns him into a telltale. Although the subclause I have quoted indicates that he is to be the Commission's servant, the amendment now provides the capacity for the Minister to require him to give the Minister any information he wants. That could include spilling the beans on other commissioners-what they may have said or what they may have decided. For example, under proposed new subclause 44 (5), what happens to the advice or information that the chief executive officer or his delegates are required under this Bill to give to the Minister? We know that under clause 12 the Minister cannot direct the Commission as to the contents of its advice to him. Does the same hold true under proposed new subclause 44 (5) in respect of the Commission's own chief executive officer? Just how wide is the compulsion under 44 (5)?</PARA>
<PARA> When we put all these subclauses together it seems to the Opposition that the loyalties of the Commission's staff would lie with the ATSIC commissioners and with the Minister. They are under the Commission's direction in relation to everything they may do in advising the Minister on the administration of the legislation, but it also seems that they will be subject to the Minister's direction. The Minister said that there was a fundamental misunderstanding of the Westminster principles of ministerial responsibility. When we look at the amendments it seems as though the Minister has finally accepted that what we have said is correct, otherwise there would have been no need for those proposed new subclauses in clause 44. The Minister seems to want to make the chief executive officer his permanent head. Will the confusion of roles and functions ever end?</PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted in clause 222 that ATSIC commissioners and officers are expected to have a role in advising the Minister as to the administration of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act. This is in addition to the Commission's own power under clause 7 (h). How would anyone ever be able to tell whether the Commission, the Minister, the Minister's delegates or the Commission's officers are doing the various things the Act will authorise?</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's amendment proposes to leave out this clause which would then leave the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act unaltered. I draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that it is proposed that certain words should be deleted. Those words are `would delegate to a State Minister or an officer of the Department the powers'. It seeks to replace them with `the State Minister, the officer of the Department or the Chief Executive Officer of ATSIC'. The effect of the Opposition's amendment would be to leave the delegations as they presently exist, that is, to a State Minister or an officer of the Department. I have explained how the Department is a constitutional entity and that that delegation is entirely in line with tradition and practice. We seek not to have that delegation's power extended to officers of the Commission itself. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have pointed out already there exists a Commission's power under clause 7 (h) which we looked at earlier in the Bill. Let us go back to that for a moment. Clause 7 (h) states:</PARA>
<PARA>to take such reasonable action as it thinks necessary . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We have amended it slightly to read:</PARA>
<PARA>to protect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural material and information . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission will have such a power even with the amendments we put in. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But it applies to a certain part of the Commission's work in this area. This is about heritage protection. It is not a question of land in that sense. We might argue about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is one final point I want to make. I have asserted that it is not proper to have ATSIC advise the Minister about ATSIC itself. About four years ago the Attorney-General's Department actually gave advice to Treasury. That advice is very interesting. It is quite germane to what we are talking about now. That advice was that as a matter of law it was the Department, not a statutory authority, which advises the Minister in relation to the enabling statute of the authority. That was the advice given by the Attorney-General's Department to Treasury. It is not certain whether that advice had been made public; it certainly has now. The advice was quite clear. The Department advises the Minister on the enabling statute. It is not the authority itself. We look at this proposed amendment and at those that follow in relation to the Aboriginal Land Grant (Jervis Bay Territory) Act, the Aboriginal Land (Lake Condah and Framlingham Forest) Act and the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act and we say that on each of those it is not proper to add the delegations to officers of ATSIC as the Bill proposes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I rise to support my colleague Senator Peter Baume. We have had this discussion before. The Bill as it stands at the moment passes authority from the Federal Minister to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). The officers of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission would have a large amount of authority to administer all decisions on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. In the best interests of Aboriginal communities there has to be cooperation between the States, the State Ministers and the Federal Minister. I put it to Senator Coulter that we are putting this cooperation at risk if we reduce the role of the State Ministers when they only have interface with officers from ATSIC and not at a Minister to Minister level. I think it is a very important point and one that I do not believe my colleague Senator Baume picked up in his argument, although he may have touched on it.

When we go out into the communities the Aboriginals all speak very highly of Senator Peter Baume. He knows that to get the right decisions made for Aboriginal people cooperation is essential between State and Federal Ministers. If Senator Coulter does not support the Opposition's amendment I believe that he is placing that cooperation in grave danger. Senator Peter Baume has alluded to the fact that he, Senator Coulter and I-I am sure it is a unanimous recommendation of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs-agree that a department, even though it be a small department, should retain a separate Office of Aboriginal Affairs to administer Aboriginal affairs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, I say to Senator Coulter that if this amendment is not carried it flies in the face of the Senate Select Committee recommendation that he was instrumental in making. Senator Peter Baume goes on to explain the constitutional propriety of Ministers administering their departments. This proposal breaks away from that constitutional propriety where a Minister does a Pontius Pilate and completely washes his hands of a commission or another instrumentality that he has set up. I do not support that. Senator Coulter has not supported it in the unanimous decision of the Senate Select Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to go back to my first point; it is a very strong point. To do the best for Aboriginal Affairs and for the Aboriginal people of Australia we must have cooperation at a ministerial level between State and Federal Ministers. If that cooperation does not exist, then the people that will suffer will not be the Ministers or the departments but the Aboriginal people themselves. I mentioned before in this debate, and I will mention it again, that I was very sorry that Senator Coulter was not able to make the trip to Queensland to see how Aboriginal affairs has progressed with the cooperation of the State and Federal Ministers. The delivery of services has been tremendous. Senator Peter Baume has alluded to that in some of his contributions. The communities in my particular State have been well run and administered. The results of that administration have only been able to be achieved because there has been cooperation. I fear that if Senator Coulter does not support this amendment, all of that will be put at risk. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government opposes this series of amendments moved by Senator Peter Baume. At the heart of what is being attempted here is that the former functions and powers exercised within departments be transferred to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). Naturally, the Minister, as is required constitutionally, will still be involved in administering a department. He will, as at present, come under the portfolio of Employment, Education and Training, depending on the various administrative arrangements that are made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although I have not seen the legal advice to which Senator Baume refers, it seems quite clear that clause 7 (1)(f), which confers on the Commission the function of advising the Minister on matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission affairs, including the administration of legislation, is constitutionally proper. It may be that in the advice that Senator Baume received that particular enabling or conferring of function clause was not present in relation to the authority to which the advice was given. But, as I say, I do not have access to that particular advice. I do not think there is any suggestion that clause 7 (1)(f) is in any real sense unconstitutional. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear that on some occasions advice will be sought from the Minister from within, for example, the Department of Employment, Education and Training, to put it most obviously, in relation to the question of the appointments of those members of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission who may be appointed by the Minister. Quite clearly, he could not simply rely on the advice of the Commission itself in relation to those appointments, and no doubt there would be a range of public servants within the large department who would have expertise and the ability to advise in relation to a matter such as that. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that this is a unique authority that is being established. It may only be, as Senator Coulter suggests, when the Commission has some experience of exercising a range of functions which have hitherto been distributed between a number of bodies, when we see how the various tensions unfold over the next two or three years, that we will be able to say whether this particular experiment has been a success. I do not deny that, in a sense, we are entering uncharted waters. Nevertheless, I believe it is an arrangement which is now understood amongst the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It has been put to them that that transfer of functions in relation to advising and administering the various matters of importance to them will take place from departments to the Commission. I believe that, if the very essence of this ATSIC proposal is gutted at this stage in the way suggested by Senator Peter Baume's amendment and the two following, one would really be going back on the whole enterprise that the Government is engaged in. Therefore, I think it would really negate the second reading in-principle endorsement of ATSIC that has been given by this chamber. </PARA>

At this stage, before I advance any other rebuttal, could the Minister explain to us, with regard to the piece of legislation we are talking about-I do not have a copy of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act with me-what this extra delegation might mean? What are some of the powers that are conferred on the Minister?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We know that the administration of Aboriginal affairs under the Constitution is a conjoint function of both the Commonwealth and the States. The 1967 referendum provided that what had been a State responsibility became a shared responsibility between the Commonwealth and the States. It is proper that the State Minister be involved. For reasons which I have set out already, it is proper in terms of our functioning as a Westminster parliament that the department for which the Minister is responsible be involved. I want to know, so I can attempt to understand this, exactly the kinds of powers and functions which might be delegated under this Act. For example, do they go to dealing and making decisions with the States? Do they involve giving any directions which might bind the States or other areas? What kind of orders might be involved? Only when we understand this can we understand the extent of what a delegation to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission might mean for day to day administration. </PARA>

That is one way of looking at it. I was arguing another matter. I was arguing whether it was proper-in the sense of constitutional propriety-to go down this track. The reason I offered the Minister that particular advising from the Attorney-General's Department is that it is relevant to the second point I am making-the question of the constitutional propriety of a course of action which would seek to make these various delegations not to a State Minister who actually has constitutional responsibility for Aboriginal affairs, not to an officer of the Department, which is the department of state properly appointed to advise the Minister, but to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, which is a statutory authority created within the portfolio and created under unique conditions within a unique structure.

Those declarations in relation to objects cannot be delegated. In subsection 13 (2) and section 26 the powers are conferred for the making of declarations in relation to an area, object or objects. Section 26 deals with the application of the Minister to the Federal Court of Australia for an injunction in relation to certain matters. Apart from those matters it appears that the Minister may delegate as provided in the regulations or declaration. Section 17 of the Heritage Act says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Minister may, by instrument in writing, designate persons to be authorised officers for the purposes of this Division. </PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly proposed clause 222 would enable that power to be delegated to the chief executive officer or a member of the staff of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. Section 18 of the Heritage Act deals with emergency declarations in relation to areas or objects. My advice is that that is another example of a power that could be delegated to the chief executive officer or a member of the staff of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. As I am advised, when one looks at the Heritage Act in relation to clause 222 there is a limited range of powers which may be otherwise exercised by the Minister which could be delegated to the chief executive officer or a member of the staff of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. In other words, I take it that the Minister retains the powers and the delegations are constrained by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage (Interim Protection) Act. </PARA>

By the way, I do not believe that the delegations are essential to the adequate or proper functioning of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). The functions which we discussed on previous days in the Committee are functions which can be exercised whether or not this clause or the ones following remain or go. This seeks to widen the ambit and powers of ATSIC. The functions which Senator Coulter and I discussed-welfare, housing and economic functions-are really not affected by this.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am still having some difficulty with the Opposition's amendments in this section. I have indicated already that I foresee some difficulty in relation to the operation of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) in that it has a number of opportunities, powers and functions, some of which will be in conflict. The extension of that is that I foresee that it will be necessary sooner or later for the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to re-establish a small department to provide advice separate from ATSIC. I believe that will probably eventuate. That will be the outcome of the evolutionary process to which the Minister has drawn our attention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are going into new territory with ATSIC and it is my prediction-and I believe the Committee's prediction-that a small department advising the Minister will become necessary. Having said that, I do not quite see the connection between that perception of a future difficulty which ATSIC will experience and the amendment here being proposed. This proposed section provides delegated powers to ATSIC. I accept what Senator Peter Baume has said-that that is in a sense unusual in that it extends those powers of delegation, but it leaves in the ability to delegate those powers to an officer of the Department. Is he merely attempting to exclude delegation to the chief executive officer as under clause 222 (c)? Is that the point he is making? If it is, that is a far less significant point than the main point, which Senator Boswell has also picked up, which I have expressed some concern about but which I believe will be taken care of by this evolutionary process. </PARA>
<PARA> Can I ask Senator Baume to explain again the reason why he lays such emphasis on this? If it is simply the powers of delegation in clause 222 (c) that concern him, that is a much smaller part of the whole issue of where and how the Minister gets advice, the powers of ATSIC and the new and uncharted territory into which we are going with ATSIC. </PARA>

This was the appropriate place to put that argument but if one looks at what is proposed in the amendment and then at what the situation would be if the amendment were agreed to, one discovers that the only difference is that proposed clause 222 (c) would not be included.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That does not mean that the argument which I have chosen to mount at this point of time is restricted to paragraph (c). There are two separate things.

I think that is the difference. I do not want to go over the entire argument again because if I do it will just take more time of the Committee. Following the point made by Senator Tate in his address, I seek the leave of the Committee to move amendments Nos 57 and 58 with this one. The three amendments actually cover the same point. I want to keep the fourth amendment, dealing with the Aboriginal Land Rights Act, separate. I seek leave to move the additional amendments, 57 and 58, together so that we can deal with amendments 56, 57 and 58 in one go. </PARA>

<PARA> Pages 87 and 88, clause 226, line 1 (page 87) to line 3 (page 88), leave out the clause. </PARA>
<PARA>The reasons that I advanced earlier today, when arguing the matter on which we last divided-clause 222-apply also to clause 226. What this clause proposes is to give to the chief executive officer of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) or to a member of staff of that Commission certain delegated authority. It then has a further effect-in paragraph (c). I would like the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) to explain what the purpose of that paragraph is. The reasons that the Opposition advanced go to the proper relationship between the Parliament and a Minister of State and that Minister's department, and the proper relationship between that Minister and any officers of any statutory authorities under his control. Those reasons apply to this clause and this amendment as well. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, I raise a couple of matters. Several of us were in the Parliament when that legislation passed and became an Act of the Fraser Government. I was a member here at that time, with Senator Chaney, and we worked hard to get that piece of legislation accepted within our own Party and passed through the Parliament. It has been very major and very important legislation. We have, as it were, a proprietorial interest in the way it works. When I was Minister I had to administer the legislation, and Senator Chaney did the same. I was able to appoint Sir William Kearney as Aboriginal Land Commissioner, and I had dealings with Mr Justice Toohey, who is now a judge of the High Court of Australia, when he was the Land Commissioner. It was a most important piece of legislation. It is proposed here that certain functions under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act should now be delegated to officers of ATSIC. This is a matter which is properly for the Minister and his Department.</PARA>
<PARA> I have to make a couple of sad comments. Recently we have seen the Aboriginal Land Rights Act performing less well than we had hoped. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) quite recently refused to proclaim certain amendments to the Land Rights Act made in 1987. Those amendments are of interest for my colleagues in the Northern Territory, and would have sought to have excluded stock routes and reserves from claim. They passed through the Parliament, but they have not been proclaimed. The Minister's failure to proclaim those amendments was, in fact, a repudiation of a promise made by his predecessor in the office of Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. It is a matter of great regret to this side of the Parliament that Mr Holding's promise, when presented to Parliament in legislative form and when passed by the Parliament as an Act of this Parliament, was not then proclaimed by the present Minister, Mr Hand. That is a blot on his administration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Does the Government agree that the decision to subsidise the major banks to prevent a further rise in their home mortgage rates will put extra pressure on building societies, which are now at a competitive disadvantage compared with the banks? What, if anything, does the Government have in mind to prevent what seems an inevitable rise in the home loan interest rates of those societies and other home-lenders not included in yesterday's deal which provide home finance for hundreds of thousands of Australians?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not agree with Senator Chaney. What happened yesterday in respect of the banks was that the Reserve Bank of Australia changed its method of setting the interest rate it pays on non-callable deposits. Ever since non-callable deposits were introduced 12 months ago, the banks have been arguing for a change to the method of setting the rate. In fact, the Reserve Bank has been enjoying a windfall gain from the banks. It enjoyed that windfall profit as market rates rose. The decision simply corrects that situation. In so far as the banks and building societies are concerned, the situation has always been different with banks since the non-callable deposits replaced the statutory reserve deposits. The result of that for the banks has been a rise in interest rates which has significantly increased the cost to banks. As I understand it, that has not happened in respect of building societies.</PARA></TALK.START>

In light of the fact that at least one bank spokesman has already claimed an improved competitive position for the banks in terms of the home loan market, does the Minister deny that a subsidy or an improvement in the position of one sector of the home lending market does change the competitive position with respect to the balance of that market? Is the Minister denying that this will have any impact on the building societies?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to give the Senate a run-down on the outcome of this very important international conference. I know that Australian local government really welcomed the opportunity for Australia to host this international congress that focused on a range of issues affecting local government. I know that Senator Panizza, who was in Perth for one day of the congress and met with a number of representatives, agrees with me that it was a very important congress and we wish very much that we could have stayed longer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I would like to talk about today is the most important aspect to come out of the congress: the formation of the International Union of Local Authorities (IULA), Asia-Pacific region. It was inaugurated at this, the twenty-ninth, world congress in Perth. We welcome this establishment in the Asia-Pacific region and look forward, as a nation, to participating in that new region. The President of the new region is the Governor of Jakarta, Governor Wiyogo, and the Australian local government representative is the Vice-President of the new organisation, Mr Richard Maslan. Mr Richard Maslan has given sterling service in the work leading up to the hosting of the International Union of Local Authorities conference in Perth this year. The focus of the regional organisation is on training and development activities for local government in the region. Other IULA regional organisations have been established in Latin America, Africa, the east Mediterranean and the Middle East. The regional organisation will support at least one local government training and development centre at a location yet to be decided. The initial headquarters of the new organisation will be in Jakarta.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has supported this initiative because of its belief that the new organisation will contribute to the development of a regional identity for local government in Asia and the Pacific. Australian local government has much to contribute to and learn from such an organisation. In terms of local government training we, as a nation, have a great deal to offer Asian and Pacific countries and we look forward to establishing relations with a number of countries to further promote the needs of local government and, particularly, training in local government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Will the Minister confirm that yesterday's pre-election deal between the Reserve Bank of Australia and the banks offers no hope at all for an early reduction in the crippling interest rates now being paid by home borrowers and will have no effect at all on small businesses and others who are having to pay in excess of 20 per cent on overdrafts?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1535" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, nobody has said that the decision made yesterday will lead to an early reduction in interest rates. Anybody who has been following the debate on this issue knows that such a reduction is a concern of the Government and will happen when the demand in this economy is reduced. Yesterday's decision has nothing to do with that. Secondly, so far as small businesses are concerned, there is a difference between home mortgage rates and rates on advances or loans made by banks to small businesses. The Government does not wish to see the continuation of the rates which are now adversely affecting some small businesses. The fact of the matter is that the interest payable on loans to small businesses is tax deductable as a business expense; it is not tax deductable for people paying off home mortgages.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We know that Australian women artists are not inferior to men. We know that Australian women artists are extremely talented. We know, from the fact that so few women applied for the first round of the fellowships, that Australian women artists are much more modest than Australian male artists. I do not know whether women on the other side of the chamber would agree with me, but perhaps that is a fair comment to make of Australian women generally. Perhaps they are, indeed, more modest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The creative artists fellowships were announced in May. Awards to the seven most eminent artists were made to the Aboriginal playwright Jack Davis, the composer Richard Meale, author Frank Moorhouse, poet Les Murray, pianist Geoffrey Tozer, visual artist Ken Unsworth, and dancer and choreographer Garth Welch. The fellowship recipients were selected from a field of applicants who responded to advertisements in the national media. Overall, the Australia Council received 116 applications, of which only 36 were from women. The applications were assessed by an independent advisory panel comprising Professor Donald Horne-the Chairman of the Australia Council-Tony Bishop, Betty Churcher, Kelvin Coe, Rubin Fineberg, Ross Gengos and Mary Vallentine. In passing, I mention that Betty Churcher is the first woman director of an Australian State art gallery. She has just been awarded the 1989 Excellence in Management award for women, which indicates the increased recognition of Australian women in many fields of Australian life.</PARA>
<PARA> The fellowships were awarded on the basis of merit, as assessed against established guidelines and criteria by the advisory panel. After the announcement of the awards a number of women contacted me-not surprisingly-because women artists and women in the community were very concerned that not one women had been selected. As a result, I wrote to and discussed this matter with my colleague the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, Mr Holding. He advised me of the fact that there were fewer applications. The Australia Council has recently advised me that, as a result of its second round of advertisements for the fellowships, to be announced in October, there has been a significant increase in the number of women applicants. It is most welcome that, perhaps because of the publicity and the great deal of outspoken comment by women who were critical that not one woman had been selected, more women have applied for the second round.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also important to point out that within the Council as a whole, in terms not of fellowships but of applications and grants, there has been an encouraging trend in favour of women in 1988-89. Success rates for men and women are equal, as of course they should be. The average grant for women was slightly higher than for men this year. I take this opportunity to urge women artists not to be so modest and to consider applying for fellowships so that in future years there will be more equal numbers of applicants competing for these important fellowships.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had reports that Mr Mangena Jeffrey Boesman is to be executed today in Pretoria in South Africa. He was accused with others of the murder of a teacher during one of the boycotts in October 1985. I am pleased to say in respect of the impending execution that last night the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Peacock, and the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Janine Haines, made a joint appeal to the State President of South Africa to grant clemency to him. No matter the circumstances, Australia is strongly and universally opposed, as everyone knows, to the imposition of the death penalty, which is an inhumane and degrading form of punishment in violation of the most fundamental of human rights, the right to life. The Australian Government regularly raises its concern over the death penalty with other governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The three party leaders noted in their joint statement that the execution of Mr Boesman would constitute a particularly severe injustice, given that his case was originally heard by a single judge and leave to appeal was refused. Mr Boesman and his fellow accused were also severely disadvantaged at the start of their trial in November 1986 by their lack of adequate legal representation, by the fact that state witnesses were part of the murder scene crowd, and that such evidence might well therefore be tainted by fear of the witnesses themselves being charged. It is a matter of great regret that three party leaders, not four, signed the statement. The National Party Leader, Charles Blunt, was approached with a view to his adding his signature to the appeal for clemency, but I understand he declined to do so. That speaks volumes about the attitude of the National Party not only to the death penalty issue, but also to the question of human rights generally in South Africa. The three party leaders who did sign the statement noted that the State President, in his inauguration speech, pledged himself to a quest for peace in South Africa through fairness and justice. The execution of Mr Boesman, if it proceeds today, would be seen by the world as the first political execution authorised by the new South African Government and prove a major blow to the prospects for peace and justice in South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA> I should say, just by way of a final point, that our ambassador in South Africa made representations to the office of the State President on behalf of Mr Boesman and three others scheduled to be executed for different offences. I note from press reports this morning that the death sentences on two of those others have been commuted.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;She is wrong about that. Her criticism of the Prime Minister is that he is not committed to the green agenda. No-one in this chamber, in this community, or in this country generally could argue that that is true. Obviously, he is demonstrably the leader of the greenest government we have seen in this country. Petra Kelly, who is an independent member of parliament in Germany and who is head of the Green Party, is reported in the West Australian newspaper on 25 September, as Senator Beahan has said, as backing coal-fired power. It is not an uncritical backing of coal-fired power generation; she strongly argues that the best available clean coal burning technology should be used, and we as a government agree with that. She says that that affords a basis for curbing damaging gas emissions from power stations and it also affords an opportunity to investigate further the possibilities of renewable fuels being used more universally in power generation in Australia. She argues-and this may be a contentious view-that therefore we do not need to go down the nuclear route. She sees the nuclear route as being more damaging. It is important to remind the Senate of what the Prime Minister said in his environment statement in July this year. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Following the call by the Toronto Conference in 1988 for a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, the Government will carry out investigations and consult with relevant conservation and industry groups with the objective of achieving a global reduction in total greenhouse gas emissions. This will involve processes such as energy efficient manufacturing and vigorous moves to energy conservation in Australia and abroad.</PARA>
<PARA>Under the national energy research, development and demonstration program this year greater emphasis has been placed on the environmental impact of energy production and its use. Since the program began in 1978, $32m has been committed to projects on renewable energy, $30m has been committed to projects on energy efficiency and end use, and $500,000 has been spent on researching six projects concerning the greenhouse effect.</PARA>
<PARA> In December 1987 the Government announced that an additional $5m would be made available over five years for research on renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy conservation. An additional $500,000 in 1989-90 and $900,000 in 1990-91 has been provided for energy management programs. So we are an active government in terms of energy efficiency and energy management in Australia, following a route that has been advocated by a world-ranking environmental spokesperson. This is in contradistinction to a view put to this chamber by Senator Vallentine who, although a nuclear disarmament senator, has decided lately that her credentials should be green as well. She and Petra Kelly are not of the same mind on this subject. However, I welcome the involvement of Ms Kelly in this debate. It adds a context to and a more serious voice in the discussion of energy management matters in this country from an environmental point of view. It is consistent, I think, with the role played by the green independents in Tasmania, in working with the forestry industry, the trade unions and the Tasmanian Government in reaching consensus on the Salamanca agreement, which has enabled better management and utilisation of timber resources, taking into consideration environmental concerns in Tasmania. What was once said to be impossible-reaching agreement on that front-has now been achieved by virtue of that responsibility in government. It seems that Ms Kelly's attention to the process of government has led to a responsible approach being taken to these serious issues, and I commend that development.</PARA>

I am happy to say, however, that the situation should not continue for very much longer as the necessary technical work to provide the 000 service to this area is complete. It has not, however, been possible to commence providing the service due to an industrial dispute. This is the reason why callers to 000 in this area hear a recorded message advising them to call another number. Telecom has, I am advised, been actively pursuing settlement of the dispute, which is now expected to be referred to the Industrial Relations Commission for hearing. The service should be available within two weeks of the dispute being settled. Telecom is doing all it can to achieve an early resolution.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator for her question. I certainly praise her ongoing concern about this very serious issue, which she raised in the chamber earlier this year. Domestic violence has traditionally been primarily the responsibility of State and Territory governments. Implementation of the honourable senator's proposals would therefore require action at the State level. The Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Bowen, has written to his State and Territory counterparts setting out the honourable senator's proposal, urging them to consider seriously its merits and noting where their existing legislation already provides for victims to obtain injunctions or protection orders against offenders. It would seem that legislation in all jurisdictions already provides means to remove the violent offender from the home. The problem is, however, a perceived reluctance on the part of some to make use of existing remedies. In saying this, I am, of course, mindful of the fact that in some circumstances such remedies will not be suitable because the woman's fear is so great that she will feel safe only if there is no way in which the abuser can locate her.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In other situations, however, there would indeed be good cause to have greater recourse to powers that allow the perpetrator of the violence to be removed from the family home. This would ensure that the victims of such violence, nearly always women and children, would not be further victimised by being forced to leave their family homes, their schools and their communities. It would also ensure that the current costs to children, the family and society, the cost of shelters, new housing, moving and re-establishing, and the cost of single parent benefits and payments for children, would be reduced.</PARA>
<PARA> On the issue of enforcing available remedies, I am pleased to be able to report that in my State of Tasmania, the Attorney-General, Mr Peter Patmore, has responded to Senator Crowley's letter by taking action to increase the chances of magistrates ordering the offender to vacate premises in domestic violence situations. The Tasmanian Minister for Police and Emergency Services, Mr Ken Wriedt, has been requested to draw the availability of the option to request such an order to the attention of the police prosecuting section and all police officers who assist victims to apply for restraint orders.</PARA>
<PARA> The Tasmanian Minister for Community Services, Mrs Judy Jackson, has been requested to have the crisis intervention unit ensure that the availability of this option is made known to those private legal practitioners to whom the unit's clients are referred. I am also aware that Mrs Fran Bladel, as Minister Assisting the Premier on the Status of Women, is taking a close and personal interest in these initiatives in Tasmania. I congratulate the new Tasmanian Government on this prompt and sensible action and urge other jurisdictions to ensure that their legislation is properly applied so that in appropriate circumstances it is the perpetrators of domestic violence, and not the victims, who are removed from family homes.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the issue of providing alternative hostel accommodation for violent men and providing assistance for them to manage their violence is one which will obviously require a considered response. I am pleased to say that to date four State Attorneys-General have replied to Mr Bowen's letter. In each instance they have indicated that they have referred Senator Crowley's proposal to the appropriate person or body for further consideration.</PARA>

To ensure that the purchasing power of these payments is maintained over time, the family allowance and the family allowance supplement rates will be adjusted annually to maintain those benchmarks.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know what all this cacophony is for, but Senator Chaney was there and we both had a delightful morning, as did the representatives of the local councils that border on the Swan River. The report deals with an important issue, certainly from the point of view of Western Australian rivers. In the south-west of Western Australia rivers that once were fresh and flowed freely to the sea are now saline and in some cases show disturbing levels of pollution. The report asked for people to consider rivers in the context not only as transport or as sources of fresh water or irrigation but also in terms of their scenic beauty and the genetic diversity that they contribute to regions and catchments. It asked that the view be taken not just of the waterways themselves but of the riparian boundaries, that is, that a whole catchment view be taken. That is a very valuable contribution to the understanding and discussion of this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was asked whether I support the recommendations that have been made to the Commonwealth. I am aware of only one recommendation, which is to provide for the establishment of long term management plans which would bind the Commonwealth and local government authorities and the public. The Commonwealth Government has long term management plans for rivers that cross more than one State. The Murray-Darling Basin is a good example of cooperative federalism in which the Commonwealth Government and the governments of three States-New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia-work together to manage that river system on a whole catchment basis. But, if the river systems involved are within one State, under the Constitution we do not have any direct authority over them.</PARA>
<PARA> I was asked directly by Senator Jenkins whether we would seek, obviously in certain circumstances, to exercise certain rights and she quoted a statement I made on 23 July. I made that statement on the basis that we were then negotiating with the New South Wales Government an agreement for the management of the south-east forests of New South Wales. At that time it was particularly important for me to make it clear and on the public record that, if there were not a cooperative outcome of those negotiations, the Commonwealth Government would look at what constitutional rights it could exercise to bring about an outcome that the community of Australia wanted. I do not resile from that. I am pleased to say that the Prime Minister also made a strong statement on that basis some weeks later. This Government does not resile from that. I am absolutely certain of Senator Richardson's view. None of us run away from that; we stand by those undertakings. If Senator Jenkins's question invites me to say there is some basis for exercising those constitutional powers in Western Australia, I do not see that. Far and away the best model is to pursue the cooperative approach, negotiate a workable arrangement and work together to implement those policies. If the cooperative approach does not work and there is a real problem that needs to be addressed, this Government has never walked away from taking the strong course, as it did in the Tasmanian dams case in 1983.</PARA>

Is the Government concerned that any such violence would stand in the way of attempts to settle the south-eastern forest issues on a fair, sensible and cooperative basis?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of reports that demonstrations have been planned for the south-eastern forests this weekend and of reports, when demonstrations have occurred in that area in the last few weeks, that violence was involved in those demonstrations. That is an extremely unfortunate outcome and action should be taken to prevent it. The essential points are, from the forestry side, that there were reports of human faeces being spread on forestry workers' cars and offensive behaviour towards forestry workers and, from the demonstrators' side, that there were reports of demonstrators being punched and, in one case, which I saw on television, of a demonstrator being forcibly dismounted from a protest that he was conducting about access to parts of the forest. All of those things are unfortunate. But I uphold absolutely, the right of the demonstrators to make their point of view heard and to conduct their demonstrations. That is a fundamental right that this Government will stand by.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The critical thing is that this Government has concluded with New South Wales an agreement which would enable flora and fauna studies to be conducted and for decisions then to be made about how the maximum utilisation of the forest resources can be arranged, consistent with our environmental objectives. Therefore, the industry and environmental objectives can be met. We have released a study into flitch mills and a study into the better utilisation of small and round wood. We will soon be announcing something on the plantation front. We are trying to compose a community group to advise us from all aspects of the community-environmentalists, workers, industry and foresters-on how we should deal with the outcome of those studies. Therefore, we are in transition from the old way of managing the forest to a new, more enlightened way in which we will manage it better, more efficiently and with foremost in our minds the environmental values as well as balancing those against the timber production values. We are looking at setting a course to move into downstream processing. It will take a while, as we are in transition, for the fruits of that transition to be realised and for the serious approach that we have adopted to be seen as the right approach. In this context, people who have misgivings about our role have a right to demonstrate. They should do that if they feel that way. But it is desirable that some basis of cooperation between the demonstrators and the workers be arrived at. The timber industry workers union has expressed to me its concerns about its membership being used as the meat in the sandwich. I understand its concerns. I also understand how demonstrators, in putting their view in a very emotional situation, can also suffer some danger.</PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence, in the hope of getting both the protesters and the workers together, I have begun to explore to try to find a process in which the demonstrations can proceed but the work can proceed without there being violence and without there being conflict. I am doing this so that the points of view of both groups can be properly viewed and aired as a contribution to the democratic institution that we hold dear in this country. I think there are prospects for that kind of achievement from this type of exploration which I am involved in now.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Wednesday Senator Sheil asked me a question concerning Japanese fishing in Australian waters. I am now in a position to add further to my answer. In response to Senator Sheil's question on Japanese fishing activity in Australian waters I am afraid that the honourable senator has been provided with some rather dubious facts. In an endeavour to clarify these issues, the following information is provided: Japanese fishing boats are permitted access to Australian waters under a bilateral agreement negotiated annually. These boats fish using long-lines which are set to target tuna and billfish. Japanese boats do not trawl in Australian waters. During the 1988 bilateral negotiations, Australia gave notice that the current 12 nautical mile exclusion zone would be expanded to 50 nautical miles off the east coast from 1 November 1989. This will be further discussed at this year's bilateral negotiations, scheduled for next month, and Australia will stand firm on its position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While the Australian fisheries remain largely inshore operations, which is especially the case for the tuna fishery off Queensland, and Australian fishers do not fully utilise fishing resources currently utilised by the Japanese, Australia is required by international law to give Japanese boats access to Australia's waters, always subject to sound resource management.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia receives a number of benefits from allowing Japanese access to its waters. In addition to payment of an access fee of $3.392m, benefits include: direct benefits to Australian fishers through logbook information compiled by the Japanese. This is available to both commercial and recreational fishers. Logbook information is also important to Australian scientists as a means of collecting and supplementing research data on fish stocks and Japanese boats have access to Australian ports which has direct benefits to those local communities and to Australia as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I should report to the honourable senator that the assertions made about these matters by some individuals have been disclaimed by the Australian Recreation and Sport Fishing Confederation which, in a supportive letter to me on 22 September, stressed the continued need for negotiation rather than confrontation.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> I am now in a position to respond further to a question asked without notice by Senator Panizza about reports of incidents related to air safety, particularly in regard to the greater use of smaller aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that the Civil Aviation Authority has taken a number of initiatives to increase its surveillance of maintenance and flight operations of aircraft during the current disruption to airline services, and to raise the level of awareness of operators and flight crew to the need for additional care and vigilance in present circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> On 8 September 1989 the Authority advised all operators and flight crew that additional surveillance is being undertaken and requested the co-operation of all operators in applying both the spirit and the letter of safety regulations.</PARA>
<PARA> On 22 September the Authority issued a Safety Promotion Circular asking all pilots to be meticulous in flight procedures and take account of the greater number of aircraft operating in their vicinity.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the specific questions asked by Senator Panizza, additional surveillance of small aeroplanes is being undertaken by CAA staff and as previously mentioned operators and flight crew have been made aware of this increase in surveillance activity.</PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, increased surveillance of flight crews is being undertaken to check that pilots are complying with limitations on flight and duty hours for flight crews.</PARA>
<PARA> Safety regulations do not permit pilots to fly unfamiliar aircraft. If pilots are being required to do this, as Senator Panizza has suggested, it would be a clear breach of the regulations. However the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation advises that there is no information available to it to suggest this is happening.</PARA>
<PARA> Some pilots may be flying to unfamiliar locations but this is a quite normal situation that pilots are trained to handle.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to air safety incidents, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation advises that there has been an increase in the total number of incidents reported, but this is in a situation where there has been a large increase in the level of activity.</PARA>
<PARA> The majority of reported incidents have involved smaller aircraft and resulted from flight crew errors, rather than problems with the air traffic services system.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bureau advises that in the past three weeks there have been some five occasions where aircraft have come into close proximity with each other. None of these incidents involved foreign or airline management pilots, or major passenger aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bureau has been informed of three instances where complaints were made regarding the command of English by foreign pilots. The incidents were minor in nature.</PARA>
<PARA> The Civil Aviation Authority advises that in instances of which it is aware where some language difficulties were experienced, the foreign pilots were flying at the time under supervision of competent English speaking pilots.</PARA>
<PARA> The Authority further advises that difficulties in radio transmission involving pilots are everyday occurrences among Australian flight crews.</PARA>
<PARA> The overall picture is that while the volume of air traffic, especially of smaller aeroplanes, is much higher than normal, initiatives have been taken to alert operators and flight crews to the need for extra vigilance and increased surveillance of maintenance and flight operations is being undertaken by the Civil Aviation Authority.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter has arisen and needs to be debated today because the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), in the most extraordinary way, has claimed and has been duly reported as claiming that child poverty in Australia has been wiped out. In the terms of this debate we are saying that, in so saying, the Prime Minister is misleading the Australian people. We ought not to be surprised at that, of course, because he continually misleads the Australian people with regard to both the pilots strike and keeping down the interest rate for home loan mortgages. But in this serious matter of child poverty, quite clearly the Prime Minister is misleading by a clever interplay of words.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today in Question Time, in answer to a very important question from my colleague, Senator Reid, Senator Button told us that we really had to look at the Prime Minister's promise in the historic context in which it was made. Let us do that. It was a promise made in 1987 in the lead-up to the 1987 election-just as we are now in a lead-up to the 1989-90 election. The catchcry of the 1987 election speech made at the Sydney Opera House was, `There will be no child poverty in Australia by 1990'. That is the historical context-a promise made by the Prime Minister to the Australian people in 1987. Yesterday he had the audacity to say that he had eliminated child poverty six months in advance of the target. He is not only a miracle worker in that he can achieve what Senator Button admitted this afternoon was a growing problem but also he said, `We have got rid of it six months ahead of target'. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a lot of talk about benchmarks. I will put the benchmarks into context because apparently the evidence for saying that child poverty has been abolished is that the Government has met its benchmarks by which it determines whether people are poor or not poor. There are plenty of marks on benches where homeless children live and I would think that the marks on benches left by people who are poor, in poverty and without a home are far more important than the so-called arbitrary benchmarks which the Government chooses to take as the indicator of whether or not we have any poor children in this country. In fact, one could say that the rationale behind the whole statement is that if we abolish the word `poverty' we cannot have anyone living in it. </PARA>
<PARA> We come then to the question of who is a child. It is a very interesting question, because if one reads the all-important Burdekin report-the benchmark report, shall we say, that came down as an indictment of the Government's policies in this country-one finds that a child is not a child when it is seven, eight, nine or 10; it is still a child when it is 15 or 16, or perhaps in some people's eyes, a child is still a child at 18 or while it is still, or ought to be, the responsibility of its parents. The report stated that there were a known, recognised, identifiable 20,000 children or young Australians who are homeless but that the figure could be as great as 70,000. </PARA>
<PARA> This report is not ancient; it is an up to date report and it is signed and dated 10 February 1989. What an amazing thing that on 10 February 1989 we still had children in poverty! But at the end of September 1989 the Prime Minister said, `Are we not terrific? We have abolished child poverty six months ahead of schedule in that magic period between February 1989 and September 1989'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Easter bunny came. There had to be a good reason; that is as good a reason as any. Let me go back to what Senator Button had to say earlier today. He was hard to hear because the idiocy of many of the statements he made was drowned out, I suspect by people who were reacting in a most predictable way. But he did say that the causes of poverty were many and that it was a growing problem. Indeed, as early as the late 1970s we were starting to identify the numbers of poor young Australians-they were being recognised as a real and important factor.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course the Prime Minister told us that it was temporary but these figures were revealed in 1980. It was temporary right up until February 1989 but somehow in the last six months we have found the magical solution. As I said earlier, we might find a solution by changing the terminology and somehow getting rid of the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me go back to what Senator Button had to say. He said that we needed education to help overcome this problem. I could not help wondering whether what he really meant was a bit more propaganda. This Government is very good at propaganda; it has a whole department called the National Media Liaison Service-`aNiMaLS'-which is good at propaganda. It spreads a story with great zeal. But on the question of education, perhaps all these homeless young Australians have to be told that they are no longer living in poverty because, clearly, they do not know it. But if we had a good, decent bit of propaganda we could tell them that they were no longer living in poverty. Furthermore, we could tell them that they ought to be grateful to this Government because they are no longer living in poverty. So if they could possibly manage to get themselves to the ballot box on 2 December, or in February or March, or whenever the election is going to be, they could be properly grateful and cast a vote for the great Prime Minister who tells us that he has wiped out their poverty. So education is very important. We had better watch out for the consultant who is employed to write that propaganda or education program and we had better watch out for those lower House Labor Party members who use their $30,000 a year to mail that propaganda to these poor unfortunate children who have no homes. Maybe it is hard to send a letter to them but perhaps we could go round the streets of Melbourne, Sydney and other capital cities and hand them pamphlets that would make them feel better because, quite clearly, the policies of the Government do not make them feel better. </PARA>
<PARA> There was one thing that made me very angry as I read the report of what this wonderful Prime Minister had to say. Having said that he had abolished all child poverty he then admitted that there was a need for a broader assault on the problem of youth homelessness. Who on earth does he imagine the homeless youth are if they are not the children of this nation? He called for cooperation, mind you, between State and local government and welfare organisations to cure the problem of homeless youth. Do honourable senators have the picture? He personally, single-handedly like Merlin the Magician, wiped out child poverty but the problem of homeless youth remains. To cure that problem the Prime Minister needs the help of the States, local government and welfare organisations. He did not need any of that help before to wipe out child poverty six months in advance of schedule because those benchmarks that had been set had nothing to do with people. They had to do with being smart. His exact words yesterday were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> At the outset of the last election campaign, I committed a re-elected Labor government to an ambitious and proud goal: the elimination of child poverty in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that his Government-and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>had eliminated the financial need for any Australian child to live in poverty.</PARA>
<PARA>Does anyone know what that means? It means that if anyone lives in poverty now it is his fault; it is not the Government's fault. The Government has met the benchmarks. Those same poverty stricken, homeless children living on benches and making their mark in parks and on the streets could say, `Thank you, Prime Minister. You have eliminated my financial need to live in poverty. It is clearly my fault. I apologise to you for being an embarrassment to you'. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what Burdekin said in his report which bears the date February 1989. As I said, he readily identified that there were 25,000 young Australians without a home. I do not know about anyone else but if I knew of a child without a home, that child would, in my view, live in poverty, penury and in pretty dire straits. The report revealed a depressing picture of sleeping in the open, ill health, prostitution, drugs and violence. Do not those things constitute poverty? I would have thought so. The report said that there can be up to 70,000 children and young adults living in a vicious circle of poverty and coping with the prejudices that prevent them from getting permanent accommodation and work and placing them at physical and psychological risk. That has all been eliminated in the time between February 1989 and September 1989, has it? How would we measure such a thing? What is the basis for the Prime Minister telling us that these people fundamentally do not exist anymore? Where are the studies? Where is the methodology? Where is the work? The answer is that there is not any. The answer is that the evidence is in reports such as the Burdekin report. This report sets out quite clearly the sort of methodology we have to use to measure these things. Page 351 of the report talks about methods of estimating the number of homeless young people. It sets out three very direct and methodological systems for determining just who those people are and for counting them. </PARA>
<PARA> Where is the statistical base for the Prime Minister's assertion that all poverty for children in this country has gone? As I said, it has not. It is all dependent on clever wording. It is dependent on the clever wording that says that his Government has eliminated the fundamental need for any child to live in poverty because it met its own arbitrarily placed benchmarks. In terms of how children live or survive if they have been forced out of their home because their parents have broken up, because they are bashed or suffering other hardship, and they are forced to live on the streets, there is no program, no solace and no answer from this Prime Minister for those children. But there are from some of those others that he was imploring to help-the State governments. In New South Wales, Minister Chadwick has changed the name of her department from youth and community services to family and community services because she realises that if we are going to eliminate child poverty, it has to begin with families. Parents have to care for their children. Burdekin found that of those children who live on the streets the largest identifiable group is children who have come from broken families. We often hear the catchcry that there are sole parent families, that these are the children of sole parents. I do not know about anyone else, but I find that an absolute mystery. I do not think we have had a sole parent for 2,000 years. As far as I am aware, it takes two parents to bring children into the world, and two parents have responsibility for those children. </PARA>
<PARA> We put in place through this Parliament legislation which put very strong and grievous strains on marriage so that our divorce rate escalated for two decades in a very strong and disappointing way. The fallout has been a growing number of homeless children. In New South Wales Virginia Chadwick has been running some splendid programs and assisting to find accommodation for these homeless children. To her dismay, within the last two or three weeks it came to her attention that an interview had been given by a member of Minister Staples's staff, Mr P. Ormonde, in a magazine called Rolling Stone, in which he got stuck into the work that the State governments are doing, saying that they have to get hold of these children because the States are only providing shelter for them and that they cannot get their hands on them early enough. I will not insult the Senate by reading the language that is contained in this particular article, but if one thinks that Australian children would be well served by being put at the tender mercies of somebody who uses the language that is contained in this particular article, one would have a different idea of care for children than I would. </PARA>
<PARA> The tragedy for children, of course, is that they cannot vote; they cannot voice their opinion. They are being treated as commodities by this Government. They are being treated as political ploys. In an emotional outburst we had the promise that child poverty would be eliminated by 1990, and in an outrageous speech yesterday Mr Hawke claimed that he had done it. I think one of his problems is that he has started to believe his own hand-outs. He has started to believe that, somehow, this country is in decent shape; it is not. Interest rates for home mortgages are sending people backwards. People on talkback radio are ringing up and saying, `We have to live on bread and butter'. Reports are coming out that more than one-third and up to 40 per cent of incomes of households are used to meet mortgage repayments. We are not seeing the abolition of child poverty in Australia; we are seeing the creation of a whole new category of poverty for children in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It could even be called genteel poverty, because children can be added to the list who are living at home with their families, with a roof over their head, but unable to eat a decent meal through the week. These people are not going to cry for hand-outs because, by and large, these are people with pride, who believe that by dint of effort and hard work they can provide for their families. Yet it is government policy that, far from reducing child poverty, is indeed adding to the burden. The children I talk about, the children referred to in the Burdekin report, are children who are without people to care for them. They are suffering the double penalty of living in poverty and living without care and without love. But there are other children who live in poverty. They are children who are much loved and much cared for by people who feel hopeless within the situation that this Government has created. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that when Government senators speak in this debate they will tell the Senate about the fantastic policies they have put in place, meeting their wonderful benchmarks and how everything in the garden is rosy. They will not tell us about the lack of pride; about the times of weeping in a private household over an inability to cope; about the people who fall outside the guidelines of the benchmark, the people who make up the fibre of this country. The Prime Minister's promises all have the hollow ring of the abolition of child poverty six months in advance of target. So do the other policies he has put in place. Australians-and Australian children in particular-deserve a better go. Indeed, they deserve a change of government. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Since our re-election we have, as you understand perhaps better than most-</PARA>
<PARA>this is to the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS)-</PARA>
<PARA>acted with determination to reach that goal. In December 1987, we introduced the family allowance supplement as a first and substantial stage towards our benchmarks. Since then, we have progressively increased family allowances and the family allowance supplement-most recently in the April statement this year. As a result, the benchmarks we set ourselves were attained six months ahead of schedule. </PARA>
<PARA> As well, we have directed new levels of assistance to those who are renting their accommodation on the private market. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind honourable senators that this is the completeness of the Prime Minister's speech. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Housing is always a large component of expenditure-especially for those renting privately who have the added knowledge that with each rent payment, they are not, unlike home buyers, at least acquiring an asset in the form of a family home. So since coming to office we have trebled rent assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of these decisions-</PARA>
<PARA>this is a vital part-</PARA>
<PARA>a single family earning $320 a week, with three children, now receives from the Federal Government $109 a week-by any standards a very substantial boost to the family budget. Because it is free of tax, it is equivalent to a wage rise of $167 a week-better than a 50 per cent pay increase. And because family payments and rent assistance are indexed, the economic security of recipient families cannot be eroded by inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Through the Child Support Agency, we are also ensuring that parents coping alone with the responsibility of bringing up children actually receive child maintenance payment from their former spouse. </PARA>
<PARA> So the totality of the picture is that we have created a system that directs financial resources, in very substantial quantities, to over 500,000 low income families. </PARA>
<PARA>Some recognition of that may put some balance into Senator Bishop's contribution. The Prime Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA> As Bishop Peter Hollingworth said last month, `For the first time in this country's history, we have a system of guaranteed minimum income for children. The Opposition sought to openly acknowledge the merit of such reforms and move towards a bi-partisan stance on welfare policies for children . . .'</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, all we have heard from the Opposition about children in poverty is carping and sniping. As usual, there is no alternative policy coming from the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> They seem content merely to revel in the tragic facts of youth homelessness-each kid on the streets is to them another proof that Hawke has failed in his child poverty pledge. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts are as I have spelled them out. The pledge has been met in terms of the benchmarks in which it was originally framed. </PARA>
<PARA> But I don't want to leave the topic there. </PARA>
<PARA> It is possible to describe poverty in terms of dollars or cents, or lack of them. </PARA>
<PARA> And it is possible to attack it in terms of financial benchmarks, as we have done. </PARA>
<PARA> But the causes and symptoms of poverty are far wider than pure economics. The tragic problem of youth homelessness illustrates this. </PARA>
<PARA> We recently announced a youth social justice strategy-a $100 million package which includes substantial improvements to income support, more secure and longer term accommodation for the homeless, and major education, training and labour market initiatives focusing on the special needs of youth. </PARA>
<PARA>As always, when one looks at the total statement, one sees that the Prime Minister has been impeccably honest. Let Senator Bishop point to one word of that quote that is inaccurate. She cannot, because her position on this matter is very well reflected by the shadow Treasurer, Dr Hewson. The Opposition is at a major disadvantage in this area because Dr Hewson was due to address the ACOSS Congress in the morning session, straight after the Prime Minister, but he did not turn up. Dr Hewson told ACOSS that he could not get to Melbourne because of difficulties with the planes. Great! The reality was that he actually travelled to Melbourne the night before on a plane with the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe). I presume that Dr Hewson assumed that he did not recognise him, but he got to Melbourne the night before with Mr Brian Howe. He was in Melbourne. He lied; he did not care; he did not roll up; and he told ACOSS that he was not there but, in fact, he was in the same city and could very well have attended. </PARA>

Honourable senators can draw whatever interpretation they want from that. It shows me that the Opposition, once again, is showing the same degree of concern for people as it showed in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us have a look at the past. Opposition members come in here today and argue from a position of high moral ground and criticise the Government. Let us have a look at what they did when they were last in government. In seven years of government, the Howard-Fraser regime increased payments for children in low income families once. In the 1982 Budget the payment was increased from $7.50 per week to $10-the only increase for low income families in seven years. In every year of this Government it has been adjusted. The results of the previous Government's policy were quite devastating. There is no recollection of that at all by Senator Bishop-amnesia runs riot again. In 1976, 370,000 children were in low income families and no-one is proud of that number. By 1983 this had increased to 830,000. Under the previous Government the number of children in low income families increased by 50,000 a year and in the last year of its government increased by a massive 150,000. </PARA>
<PARA> In our term of government we have increased pension and benefit rates every year. In 1983, they were $10. In 1989, they have increased to $31 for younger children and $34.10 for older children. In 1990 they will go up to $35.25 for older children. Every year there is an increase, which has a major impact on this policy area, but no recognition is given to this at all. What have we got in response? We have got from the Opposition a policy mix which shows absolutely no concern for the people involved. Someone asked me earlier to go to the Prime Minister's pledge made in 1987, or earlier on. Let us have a look at it. Let us clearly set it out. It was clear and unequivocal. The policy speech said:</PARA>
<PARA>By 1990 no Australian child will be living in poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> To this end, my government will establish a new program of family help-a program designed to lift more than one million Australian children into security and to help the more than half a million Australian families in greatest need, the hardest pushed, the most disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA>What has been said about this comment? The Brotherhood of St Laurence at the time said, `This pledge, the most specific social commitment of the century, has been the subject of an historic package to provide a guaranteed income for poor children'. In 1987, the Prime Minister's pledge was expanded. There he promised:</PARA>
<PARA>During Labor's third term an adequate living standard for children will be achieved by: raising child payments to ensure that the total assistance per child moves from its current level of 11 per cent to at least 15 per cent of the combined married rate of pension; and ensuring that the aggregate payments for older children attain a benchmark of 20 per cent of the combined married rate. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not arbitrary benchmarks, as I said earlier, but it has been analysed and developed comprehensively by the social security review, which is not only nationally, not only domestically in this little area, but internationally respected. In response to that, once again, we do have endorsements that should be placed on the record in order to give a comprehensive and balanced approach to this problem. The Institute of Family Studies described Labor's commitments to these standards of adequacy as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Probably most significant of all, the linking of the rates of payment for FAS to those for the married rate of pension . . . along with the widening of eligibility for low income working families effectively produces a guaranteed minimum income scheme for all children. </PARA>
<PARA>For the first time, children are being seen as important in our community. The Government has delivered in full on the Prime Minister's pledge. Combined family allowance and supplement payments have been increased since 1987. These payments now constitute 15.3 and 20 per cent of married rate pensions respectively. The benchmarks of adequacy have been achieved. A Bill currently before the Parliament provides for adjustment of family allowance supplement (FAS) each year to maintain these standards. The bottom line is that there are over 180,000 low income families on FAS and there are currently over 530,000 families with 1.1 million children benefiting under this Government's policy achievements. Compare that to 50,000 children every year thrown into the category of living in poverty under the previous Government. As the Prime Minister said in that statement from which I quoted earlier, it does not end there. It goes further. It goes into social infrastructure and employment. It goes into health policies, education policies and child care policies. In each area, this Government has made major achievements to the extent that they have been recognised. Bishop Hollingworth, once again from the Brotherhood of St Laurence, on 7 May-this is not for the information of senators on the other side, because they come in here quite blinkered, but for the people who might be listening-said:</PARA>
<PARA>In strict income security terms, it is true that the Prime Ministerial promise `that no child shall live in poverty by 1990' . . . will be achieved. This represents significant progress, and demonstrates that Government can meet some modest social justice objectives, even at a time of economic restraint when they are involved in public sector cutbacks and tax reductions in order to improve this economic efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>This pledge, the most specific social commitment of the century has been the subject of a historic package to provide a guaranteed minimum income for poor children whose parents earn less than about $300 a week. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>We congratulate the Federal Government on its work on child poverty, which represents a historic breakthrough in the national attack on child poverty. </PARA>
<PARA>This is an independent body, most deeply involved in the question. It is not operating from a biased perception or misrepresented motive as the Opposition does. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government has now built a solid foundation of income security for Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA>I could go on but I would like to turn to the Opposition. I have dealt with its record and I now turn to its current promise. It tastes as sweet as sugar and smells of roses, as Senator Bishop does--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is, I suppose, but it has been a long day. Let us look at the reality. Senator Bishop talks about one State Minister. Let me deal with the Minister for Family Services in Queensland. Senator Bishop mentions one area of major priority, and that is sole income families. They are. Fifty per cent of children living in poverty in Australia are living in sole parent families. The Government has done something to help them. The child support scheme has the potential to assist hundreds of thousands of children in this category. It places a very clear and direct responsibility on the non-custodial parent to provide for the child's welfare and income. This scheme has increased the number of sole parent pensioners receiving maintenance by 40 per cent, and it has substantially increased the amount of that maintenance. It has been an historic and vitally important measure to help people in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As of Sunday, the child support scheme, through stage 2, will apply, one would have hoped, to the whole of Australia-but it is not to apply in Queensland, the State where the Minister for Family Services has called upon the Federal Government to abolish the sole parent pension. It is a State Government with a policy steeped in prejudice and ignorance and which has absolutely no recognition of reality. It does not recognise that 80 per cent of sole parents have been in a marriage which has broken down and that only 2.8 per cent of sole parents are teenagers. It is a policy which gives no recognition of where those sole parents come from and the lives the kids in those families are living. </PARA>
<PARA> So the Minister for Family Services in Queensland wants to abolish the sole parent pension. Not only that, but also, because of a crisis in leadership and a crisis in government in Queensland, and a neglect of this area which has been common on that side of Parliament for years, it has not introduced legislation. One reason why it has not done so is that in 22 months there have been five different Ministers for Family Services in Queensland. The Government cannot get its Ministers together to agree to introduce legislation to provide assistance for children, under stage 2 of the scheme, specifically those whose parents have not married. That Minister is saying those people should be taken off the sole parent pension, and given nothing from the non-custodial parent because the Government in Queensland cannot get its act together. It cannot get its appointment secretaries together because its Ministers are changing so often. Agreement is reached between the relevant Ministers, and then the Ministers change. Today Paul Clauson is in, but the Minister with whom he made the last agreement is no longer in the relevant position, so there is no agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Even if the Cabinet had considered the agreement, the Parliament in Queensland does not sit long enough to ensure that legislation could be introduced, let alone passed. So not only will kids in that State who are really in need not benefit from stage 2 of the scheme because of the ineptitude of the Government and the lack of concern on the part of the National Party of Australia in Queensland, but also it is that Government which calls upon the Federal Government to abolish the sole parent pension. This is the sort of attention, concern and respect that the Opposition gives to people in the community about whom it is making hypocritical statements in here this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the position adopted by Opposition spokespeople here. I quote from a statement of the Brotherhood of St Laurence issued on 20 August 1989. It congratulates the Federal Government for its commitment in the previous week's Budget to welfare reform. It says there is a need for a bipartisan policy in Australia, and expresses concern at the fact that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock), in his reply to the Federal Budget, `made only passing reference to social welfare initiatives'. There was no reference to indexation, no commitment to it and no commitment that the Government's social welfare reforms will not be broken. All there was from the Opposition was the statement that it will massively reduce spending in the social welfare area. It cannot keep that promise and, at the same time, promise the world to people outside in this area. The Opposition is a fraud, it has been rejected as a fraud and, on this issue, the promise and commitment of the Prime Minister remains very clear to all of us in its totality. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition has raised today, as a matter of public importance, the following claim:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The action of the Prime Minister in misleading the Australian people by claiming that the Federal Government has eliminated child poverty in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister representing the Minister for Social Security in this chamber, the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus), gave us the benefit of some detail, additional to that which we were able to read in the newspapers this morning, on what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said yesterday at the annual congress of the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS). Unfortunately, I was not able to attend that congress due to the airline strike. I was offered a seat on the Prime Minister's plane but he was not coming back in time for me to attend this meeting of the Senate, so I could not accept it. Nevertheless, I think it is important that we address this question of child poverty. From that point of view, I certainly welcome the Opposition's bringing forward the matter. I will have more to say in a moment about what I consider to be the Opposition's role in all of this. Perhaps I will provide it with a further opportunity to play an even bigger role. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not only yesterday at the ACOSS congress that the Prime Minister promised to end child poverty. The Prime Minister and his colleagues subsequent to both the April statement this year and to the Budget this session said that at least the financial benchmarks had been met in the Government's proposal to eliminate child poverty and in its attempt to meet the Prime Minister's promise made before the last election. That part of his claim has received most media publicity. It is encouraging that the Prime Minister has now recognised the broader implications. Indeed, it is the first time that I have seen them on the record; it is good to have them on the record today in this debate. However, I think we need to look at the situation for children in this country. It is a fact that there are still children living below the poverty line. In sole parent families, if we use the latest poverty line figures and the latest figures that the Government has made available, we will still find that a sole parent with two children is $9.80-a significant amount-below the latest poverty line. A sole parent with one child would be $3.10 above the poverty line, a fairly tenuous non-poverty position, I suggest, and one that could very well mean that the person would be now below the poverty line, as would the family of that person, given the speed at which the cost of living is rising. </PARA>
<PARA> In many families-whether sole parent or otherwise; whether the parent is employed or unemployed-very speedy increases in costs of living, particularly housing costs, are causing quite large groups of families in various categories and at various stages to fall below the poverty line. The Government does not deny this, but it is galling, particularly for people who are working at the coalface, people whose daily work is in welfare agencies and other support agencies in the community dealing with these people, to hear constantly the political message given out that there is no problem or that there need not be any problem when they know very well there is. Certainly it is a matter of record that many welfare agencies and support groups in the community are finding their resources very hard-pressed to cope at this time. As Julian Disney said in the cover story in the Bulletin on 19 September, `the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting more numerous'. The report goes on to add to the reasons why this is happening. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>This is because there is some bottom-of-the-barrel bracket creep as the rising cost of housing creates a new class of working poor. Under these low income earners are the more traditional poor-the sole-parent families, the unemployed, the derelict, the young homeless and the remote community Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA>In this debate let us not forget the Aboriginal poor who, as the cover story in the Bulletin reminds us, often have their problems compounded by cultural isolation and limited access to social services. Many of the problems of isolation also apply to non-Aboriginal families in remote areas. We cannot lose sight of the fact-and we should not lose sight of the fact-that even in financial terms there are families in which children are living in poverty. The major reasons for this still being the case have been outlined in many places. The documentation put forward in the promise the children campaign by the Brotherhood of St Laurence lists three major issues: unemployment, sole parent families and high housing costs. Clearly they are significant factors in creating poverty and in continuing to create poverty in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> We often hear from this Government about the jobs this Government has created. No doubt we will hear more in this debate about the increased numbers of jobs that have been created during the life of the Hawke Government. The Hawke Government needs to recall that under the Fraser Government the highest rate of unemployment was 6.7 per cent. Under this Government the highest rate is 9.8 per cent. It depends upon which particular statistics and which particular year one looks at. A major concern about the employment figures is that many of the new jobs that have been created have been part time or casual which, depending on family structure, can mean an enormous benefit, particularly to sole parent families where the only employment that can be found is part time. Sole parent families remain a major concern. I have already said that most of the children who are living in poverty, children who have not been advantaged significantly by government measures, are in sole parent families. The failure to increase and index the mother's guardian allowance-the only allowance which is exclusive to sole female parents-has been a major flaw in the whole family package which the Government has brought forward during its term of office. High housing costs remain a major concern. I will say something about that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that we recognise that it is no use taking a narrow view of what constitutes poverty in any respect-certainly not in respect of children. It is good to hear that the Prime Minister has put that view forward although it is perhaps on a slightly lower key than his claim of financial support. The Brotherhood of St Laurence, in its promise the children package which was launched by Mrs Hazel Hawke in May, while congratulating the Government as Senator Bolkus has reminded us at length went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The next step is for the Federal Government to reinforce this achievement with comparable progress in housing, employment and community services. Without this progress the income security reforms might be undermined. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the point upon which we need to focus in this question of getting children out of poverty and of building an Australian society in which no child will live in poverty. We heard that statement first from the Prime Minister in 1987. The Brotherhood of St Laurence goes on to say that much more beyond 1990 needs to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government talks much about the social wage. A major feature of the Government's economic policy and action through the life of the Hawke Government has been based on the accord which establishes the social wage which is composed of a number of factors. It is composed not just of the financial pay packet that each worker gets; the social wage includes tax measures, family payments, including the rent assistance to which Senator Bolkus referred, as well as public community payments in health, education and housing. It includes the retirement package and so on. Under the accord the social wage is much more than what is in the pay packet. </PARA>
<PARA> The same applies to what we provide for our children. This was acknowledged by Mrs Hazel Hawke when she launched the promise the children campaign. She said that the campaign would seek promises of action from government, at both State and Federal levels, business and community groups and also individuals. She spoke of the need to build on the improved payments by arguing for better access to employment, housing and community services-a kind of accord; taking a social justice approach to child poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not seem to be hearing this from the Opposition. It does not seem to have this approach. There is no recognition that we need to look at child poverty from a social justice perspective. In fact, when it comes to welfare payments and indeed social payments generally what we hear from the Opposition is all to do with spending cuts. Senator Bolkus has referred to some of those. Of course, the major proponents in the public domain in this area are our Senate colleague, Senator Stone, the shadow Minister for finance, and Dr Hewson who, when challenged constantly, says that under a coalition government government spending in these areas would be better targeted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government responds usually through Mr Howe, the Minister for Social Security, by saying that we have the best targeted social security system in the world. Indeed, Mr Howe appears to be proud of that claim. I am concerned about that. When one looks at the broad issues and who is being targeted in the Government's very stringent social security system one sees it is sole parents; 45-year-old women who used to be on the class B widow's pension which was abolished; women who have not been in paid employment and who have somehow had to adjust their lives to that situation; young people in education and young people struggling to get into the work force; under 18-year-olds who have lost their unemployment benefits; and low income families generally in a range of ways. </PARA>
<PARA> Who then will the Opposition hit with its better targeting? It is very difficult to see who could not and who would not be hit. But if we look at the Opposition's general policies of deregulation and privatisation we see that the hits will clearly fall in the public services such as health, housing, education and even public services such as communications via Telecom Australia, Australia Post and all the rest. They will protest that they are providing better choice in the community but there is no real choice when one is poor. In the end there is only the choice of whether or not to eat. In many poor families, parents are going without so that their children can eat. </PARA>
<PARA> Where is the Opposition's record? Where are the Opposition's policies on social justice and a view of a child poverty accord that looks at the broader issues? Targeting creates poverty traps. I have heard nothing from the Opposition about how it would deal with that. We have seen government measures attempting to deal with that. But I put it to the Government that targeting can go too far and it can often be too difficult. If the Government wants to be miserly and wants to become an economic rationalist and a deregulator, then it will hurt people. Some of those people currently being hurt are the roughly 150,000 children still living in poverty. Australia in now actually spending less of its annual income on social security than when the Hawke Government took power-way below the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development level. We are not a welfare state. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to the Government and the Opposition that this issue should not be a political football. There is a motion before this Senate for a joint select committee of all parties of this Parliament to address the issue of child poverty, to work further on the basis that has been set by the Brotherhood of St Laurence and others in the community, to come up with real solutions and real programs to take us into the 1990s, as Mrs Hawke has suggested we do. The motion that I put forward on behalf of the Australian Democrats should be supported. We need a multipartisan cross-party view on this. It should not be treated as a political football. As Julian Disney said, `The Government has gone seriously off the rails with its economic view of financial deregulation, heavy reliability--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nothing can emphasise the state of panic the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has reached more than yesterday's statement that he had wiped out child poverty in Australia six months ahead of schedule. The Prime Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the outset of the last election campaign, I committed a re-elected Labor government to an ambitious and proud goal: the elimination of child poverty in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Since re-election we have acted with determination to reach that goal-and we reached it ahead of target . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We are told that the Prime Minister then went on to say that the Government had also set basic levels. That was not said in his election speech. We did not hear anything about the basic parameters; it was a simple statement that he would eliminate child poverty by 1990. He has now told us that he has eliminated it ahead of schedule. The Prime Minister is a laughing stock not only among those who know the facts, that is, those working in the areas of poverty, but also among all those families living in poverty-the 360,000 supporting parents, the 239,500 living on pensions, all those single income families earning below $430 a week, the unemployed and the 224,000 breadwinners trying to feed their children. </PARA>
<PARA> The very day the survey was published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which pointed out that Australian householders were being forced to spend $506.87 a week on basic living costs while the average weekly wage was $501.10, the Prime Minister came out with this arrogant statement that he had wiped out child poverty in Australia. How do Government members feel? How ashamed and embarrassed the Ministers must be. I can hear them saying, `Crumbs, what is he on about now? What a galah!'. We had this on top of his arrogant statement that was reported in the paper where he said to an elderly pensioner, `You silly old bugger' just because the pensioner had told him that as Prime Minister he earned more in a week than most people earned in a year. The Prime Minister has become so arrogant. He is so far removed from the man in the street that he does not know what he is talking about. His credibility has been shot to pieces. For the good of Australia generally, he had better pull himself together and his Ministers ought to make sure that he does. </PARA>
<PARA> On Wednesday of last week, I explained to the Ministers that the mishandling of the pilots strike had already resulted in 80 stand-downs of casual workers in just one hotel in Hobart, plus thousands more in the tourist industry and other industries in our State. I pointed out that permanent workers in these hotels have been put on a four-day working week and have taken a cut of one-fifth of their salary. The very next day, in the middle of all these stand-downs, their leader made this incredible comment. Can honourable senators opposite understand the devastation of a supporting parent who has just been thrown out of a job when the Prime Minister says that everything is all right and their children are not in poverty? The survey points out-I think it is important that we look at it because Government members must understand-that five years ago a similar survey showed that Australians spent $361.84 on basic living costs. At that time the average gross household income was $453.60. A family was able to save about $91 a week. The same family today, this survey tells us, spends $506 and the average wage is $501.10. In other words, that family is down the drain $6 a week. This survey also points out that in New South Wales 44.5 per cent of a household's gross income is needed to service housing loans which is just about double the figure which the lending institutions have traditionally used as a benchmark for granting a loan. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer (Mr Keating) tells us that these crippling interest rates are needed because, after all, he made a bit of a mistake last year in estimating the growth in our country's consumption. That is great comfort to the single income families struggling to survive. Did the Prime Minister or his Ministers see the current affairs morning program on television yesterday just hours before the Prime Minister made his stupid statement? The program showed a father and mother explaining how they were trying to survive. The mother said:</PARA>
<PARA>We can't buy fresh fruit any more, that's a luxury in this house. Bread and butter seems to be our basic meal lately because meat is really a luxury. We try very hard to put meat on the table and we try very hard to put vegetables on the table. It just doesn't go that far all the time. So, we eat lots of bread and butter. </PARA>
<PARA>These two people were interviewed by the current affairs program reporter and, believe it or not, Australian Labor Party member Ross Free. The father and mother explained that seven families out of 25 families living in their street had had to move because they could not afford to stay there. Yet the Prime Minister has said, `No child is now living in poverty'. Perhaps Mr Free should talk to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister saying that homeless youth-the number of whom, according to the Burdekin report, is between 40,000 and 80,000-are children not living in poverty? I wish he would spend just one night walking around the streets of Kings Cross or St Kilda to find out the real poverty that those street children are facing. The age of these children is between eight years and 18 years. </PARA>
<PARA> It was just four months ago that a major television program Nobody's Children was shown. That program gave a slight indication of the poverty these children face. Does the Prime Minister claim that in such a short time as the four months lag he has eliminated poverty for those tens of thousands of street children? At that time, just on three months ago, I spoke about this issue in this place. I then asked whether the Prime Minister or his minders had bothered to view that program. At that time I asked, `If the Prime Minister saw that program, does he still maintain that he is on track for that wonderful election promise he made that by 1990 no one would be living in poverty?'. I said that the Prime Minister had abused and used those forgotten children for his own political purposes, giving them promises and expectations that at that time he knew he could never reach. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has now proved beyond any shadow of doubt that these children are the forgotten children. He has been extolling the virtues of his social security policies and I give him full credit for those policies which have improved the incomes of those families most affected by the dreadful fall in living standards that has occurred under this Government over the last five years. The Prime Minister cannot ignore or forget the children at the bottom of the pile. It is not as if the Government is unaware of these children: there have been several reports on the subject. In 1980 the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare was asked to inquire into the problems of homeless youth including the appropriate responsibilities of governments. I was Chairman of that Committee. It reported to the Parliament in August 1982 and the Hawke Government came to power six months later. What has occurred since then? The number has gone up devastatingly-from an estimated 9,000 children on the streets then to between 40,000 and 80,000 this year. The Committee recognised:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . when family support breaks down irretrievably or is non-existent, both government and the community have a clear responsibility to provide the necessary support for the young person until such time as he or she is able to make the final transition to full independent living. </PARA>
<PARA>The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission brought down a report entitled Our Homeless Children that stated:</PARA>
<PARA>It is with deep concern that we present the report of our National Inquiry into Homeless Children and Young People. On behalf of the many thousands of children affected, we respectfully suggest that the Government give urgent consideration to the report and to the recommendations we have made. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet the Prime Minister still has done nothing. We gave the Government a profile of what homeless children were like. We said that they were probably between 15 and 18 years of age, Anglo-Saxon, had experienced conflict within the family, such as parental disputes, were unable to get along with de facto parents, et cetera. We gave a full run-down on children at risk. Yet the Prime Minister has said that they have all disappeared, that no child is now living in poverty. We visited each State and various shelters and took evidence from people working in the area. We met with people, including children. I am sure Senator Giles will remember the 14-year-old girl we met who said, `Mum's not too bad. She slips me $10 every now and then'. She had been forced to leave home because her de facto father had sexually abused her. We heard about a little boy and girl, seven and eight years old, who came home after school and found that the family had deserted them; no-one lived in the house any longer. They spent the night under the school until a teacher became aware of their problem. I remember very well the 15-year-old boy who was covered in tattoos and wearing a singlet. We visited the shelter where he was and over a cup of coffee I asked him, `What's your story, lad?'. He burst into tears and walked out of the room. The chap in charge of the shelter said; `He will toughen up. It is his first night away from home'. </PARA>
<PARA> I am well aware that the Government cannot wave a magic wand. I am well aware that it cannot legislate for good parents. But it has not picked up the basic recommendation of the Burdekin report which was:</PARA>
<PARA>Where children and young people leave or ought to leave home because of serious neglect or abuse, the Commonwealth should meet the obligation to support them, regardless of their age, in conditions where they are protected and can develop as required by the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. </PARA>
<PARA>When I watched the television program Nobody's Children it brought back many memories of our Committee's inquiry. These children are not asking much. When we asked them, over a cup of coffee, how they thought their problems could be overcome they said, `Why don't you give us a block of flats? We could all live together in a block of flats'. When we said to them, `Do you really think that is practical?', a couple of the more sensible ones said, `No, we would only get into trouble. We know that if we did not have some sort of adult supervision we would get up to mischief and we would have the police in'. They do not ask for much. They just want something more stable and secure than the shelters they presently have where they can spend only a couple of weeks at a time before they have to move on. If the Prime Minister does not respond to the recommendations and acknowledge that there are tens of thousands of homeless youth, he does not deserve to be Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to pick up the last point that Senator Walters was making. I remind honourable senators that she was saying that, if the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) or the Government does not pick up the recommendations of the Burdekin report-the report of the National Inquiry into Homeless Children-we are opening ourselves up to strong criticism. I think Senator Walters will be happy to hear-she has been reminded about this before-that we have allocated $100m for the very purpose of implementing the recommendations of the Burdekin report, to put considerably more money into crisis shelter, education, training and income support for that very group of young people about whom she and all other honourable senators are concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While I am on the question of homeless youth I would like to add two or three points to what Senator Walters was saying about the typical homeless young person. My recollections are from having served on the then Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare to which she referred. We were prepared to acknowledge then what Commissioner Burdekin has been acknowledging recently: there is no way of accurately assessing the number of young homeless people. We were able to say that approximately half of them would be away from their homes for only a relatively short time. They and their parents were probably looking for a breathing space in which to overcome whatever dispute had created that crisis. Senator Walters is absolutely right: we must be able to provide temporary shelter for these young people. Another quite substantial group of young people technically have no homes. They have been separated from their natural parents since very early life; they have had a history of institutionalisation; they have had a series of foster parents, et cetera. A great deal can be done to help these young people lead stable lives. In many cases we have been able to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> However, another characteristic is quite widespread among the homeless population-that is, a very strong mistrust of any type of authority. The last thing that these young people want is to be organised into any sort of regulated living. There is a real difficulty in working out how to help that group. Senator Walters will be glad to hear that over the last six years we have reached a state of affairs where we now have 1,390 crisis care accommodation units operating nationally. Many of these have been recently upgraded and many of them have only been established during the course of this Hawke Government. In the last financial year we opened 53 new services. We are assisting 80,000 people annually and, overall, there is a bed capacity of 14,000. Quite clearly, that is not sufficient. The capacity to deal with homeless people, whatever their age and whatever their condition, is not up to what is required, but it is considerably better than it was six years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a fair amount of confusion about what the Prime Minister said several years ago and what he said yesterday. At the risk of being repetitious, I will read exactly what he said yesterday to try to cast a little light on this debate. After all, this is an opportunity to get a few facts onto the record. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> At the outset of the last election campaign, I committed a re-elected Labor Government to an ambitious and proud goal: the elimination of child poverty in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We set ourselves historic benchmarks of support that would be available to low income families in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Since our re-election we have, as you understand perhaps better than most-</PARA>
<PARA>he was talking to the Australian Council of Social Service-</PARA>
<PARA>acted with determination to reach that goal. </PARA>
<PARA> In December 1987, we introduced the family allowance supplement as a first and substantial stage towards our benchmarks. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then, we have progressively increased family allowances and the family allowance supplement-most recently in the April statement this year. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result, the benchmarks we set ourselves were attained six months ahead of schedule. </PARA>
<PARA>I think most people understand now that the benchmarks have been established as a result of a very extensive inquiry by Dr Bettina Cass who suggested to the Government-this was accepted-that we should establish as a goal for each child in low income families an amount of 20 per cent of the married pension rate for children between the ages of 13 and 15 years and 15 per cent for children younger than that. We have reached that goal. Where is the criticism of those benchmarks? Who on the other side of Parliament has been prepared to analyse the benchmarks? If they honestly believe that those benchmarks are inadequate, why do they not say so and tell me what their benchmarks would be, how they would achieve them and why the benchmarks of the Government are not adequate? We do not hear criticism from those agencies that are informed about issues such as this. We certainly do not hear criticism about our benchmarks from the Brotherhood of St Laurence, which has been quoted time after time in this chamber. We do not hear criticisms from the Institute of Family Studies. It comments about the adequacy of our aims and goals as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The centrepiece of the Government's strategy to assist low income families is the family allowance supplement (FAS). When FAS was introduced, in 1987, the Treasurer pledged that the rates of payment would be incomed to specific benchmarks related to the Prime Minister's commitment regarding child poverty. Those benchmarks were that combined weekly payments for children aged 12 and under would be set at 15 per cent of the married rate of pension and those for 13-15 year-olds would be set at 20 per cent of this rate. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the tax package, rates for younger children have been lifted to the benchmark via substantial increases in the rate of family allowance and those for 13-15 year-olds were raised, in addition to family allowance, by $3.10 per week to $34.10. By these means the Government's pledge to meet the benchmarks has been met. The new levels of FAS represent rises in real terms since 1983-84 of 41 per cent for younger children and 203 per cent for older children over the previous family income supplement payments. </PARA>
<PARA>I will give one example. A low income working family with two children aged 13 and eight years and renting privately could have been eligible before the family package for $12.80 a week in family payments. From 1 July this year this has increased to $96, tax free. This is the equivalent of something like $200 if it was a wage increase that was being taxed. This means that a considerable number of low income families in Australia, not only beneficiary families but those on low wages, are receiving cash in hand every month in their bank accounts. It is a considerably greater increase of money which, according to our benchmarks, should have raised these families out of financial embarrassment and inadequacy simply on account of there being dependant children. We have recognised that the dependency of children is the single greatest cause of poverty in Australia. These are the measures that we have taken to overcome that. I, like the Prime Minister, am justifiably proud of our record in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA> We are still waiting for some informed analysis or honest criticism from the Opposition. I, like the Australian Democrats, wish very much that we were able to achieve some sort of bipartisan approach to poverty. I do not, as some of my colleagues in the Opposition seem to, find that a matter for derision and mirth. We find the Democrats still referring to the Henderson poverty line. Apparently they have some difficulty with our new benchmarks. We do not know this for sure because they have not mentioned what those difficulties are. It was not very long ago-it was in 1986-that Senator Powell committed the Democrats to child payments of $22 a week indexed. That policy would lead to child payments today of about $28 a week. Yet Labor's policy has delivered since 1 July this year $33 a week for younger children and $43.10 a week for teenagers, indexed. I do not think the Democrats are able to retain any credibility until they develop a cohesive policy which is something different from saying that the Government has never done enough. </PARA>
<PARA> Having established what we believe to be adequate benchmarks, how are we meant to instruct, force or coerce families into using that money in the way in which some people seem to think it should be used? For example, the payments that we make, as a matter of principle, go to the carer, to the mother, until the child is 16 years of age. Then the choice can be made, if the child is entitled to Austudy, whether the money is to be paid to the 16-year-old or to the carer. In the event of that money being paid to the parents we, as a Government, say, `This at least is part of our responsibility fulfilled'. Are we somehow or other to dragoon the community into handing over that money to their children? What are the principles governing how people are to be influenced or how the Government is to interfere with the way in which that money is to be disbursed where young people are determined to be independent of their parents? We will do what we can to provide housing, advice, education, training and jobs for these young people. We have not been unsuccessful in that respect. But there is a degree to which people must be allowed to make their own decisions. There are many 14- and 15-year-olds who already believe that they are adult enough to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to find ways-and once again I wish this were a bipartisan approach-to help them make the sorts of decisions that would enable them to have a healthy and wholesome lifestyle instead of dissipating their opportunities. It is a very difficult issue, and it is one that we should be working on together rather than having the sort of carping that we seem to be getting from the Democrats and the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> We are still waiting to hear what the Opposition in government would do about these young homeless people who are poverty-stricken and in need of assistance. I quote from a speech made by the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Andrew Peacock, at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Adelaide on 27 June. This is about the most recent statement on this matter, and it is all that we really have to go on. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Our expenditure review process is well advanced and is cracking through options at an impressive pace. Some of our cuts will be politically unattractive-</PARA>
<PARA>he does not specify the cuts; he leaves the matter open to one's imagination-</PARA>
<PARA>but a degree of pain is unavoidable if we are to meet the greater objective of ensuring a more balanced macro-economic mix. </PARA>
<PARA> We have already identified around $1 billion in spending cuts and we are reviewing every area of expenditure to find further savings, whilst promoting greater equity and greater targeting of welfare. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are very ominous words. Greater equity in the Opposition's book is $1 billion off government spending. Those cuts are not designated, but heavy hints are given. Mr Peacock continued:</PARA>
<PARA>I can tell you this: our cuts will be substantial and they will be bold. They will be clearly detailed at a time of our own choosing. </PARA>
<PARA>I have a further word or two to say about sole parent families, a group in the community about which Senator Patterson spoke at some length. Senator Patterson, still depending on the old Henderson poverty line, said that a family on benefits with two children is likely to be $9.80 below the poverty line. Let us not go into the Henderson poverty line and its relevance or otherwise. I just point out that those sole parent families are very much more likely now to be able to gain access to the work force. They are also much more likely to be receiving rental allowance, which was introduced by this Government for those people renting privately, making a big difference to their available income. The sole parent is much more likely to be receiving maintenance from the non-custodial parent, if that sole parent is able to be registered under our Child Support Agency scheme. I am very happy to report that in August of this year 20,000 custodial parents were already receiving through the Child Support Agency a total of $2.1m, which is an average of $105 each. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I guess there were not many children living in poverty who actually saw the heading in the Australian newspaper this morning which said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Child poverty wiped out: PM. </PARA>
<PARA>It is lucky that they did not see it, because they would not have been amused. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) yesterday claimed at a social services conference that the Federal Government had wiped out child poverty and had done so six months ahead of schedule. That absolutely audacious comment is matched only by the original statement that he made in the 1987 election campaign-that by 1990 no Australian child would live in poverty. We know, of course, of the many qualifications since made to that. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday, to the surprise of the nation, the Prime Minister stood up and made this absolutely astonishing assertion. Nobody, I am sure, would have believed it, but it is necessary to debate this sort of behaviour and conduct lest anyone-that is, anyone who is not still living in poverty-be tempted to do so. Wherever there is a family who has trouble making its mortgage repayments, with a breadwinner without a job, there is a family with children who are living in poverty and who will continue to do so while that is the case. Bishop Hollingworth even made the comment that the Prime Minister was over-stretching his claim. </PARA>
<PARA> The basis of the matter that we are discussing today is the fact that we in this country have as a Prime Minister a man who would do such a thing-and do it to the children who are living in poverty in this country. The Minister who spoke for the Government, the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus), and the last speaker who spoke for the Government side, Senator Giles, both went through the details of the steps the Government has taken to increase family allowances and various other benefits. None of us has suggested that those things have not been done. But my goodness, they are needed, are they not?</PARA>
<PARA> Just look at the economic situation in this country. Just think how tragic the situation would be if some of those benefits had not been brought in. Of course, we have not heard about how many people are actually benefiting from them. It is all very well to spray benefits all over the glossy magazines, but if the criteria for qualifying for benefits are so strict we are not helping many people at all. All of us here could spend the rest of the afternoon regaling listeners with stories and anecdotes of people who are suffering financially, who are living in poverty, whose children are living in poverty, who have tried to get help. I have referred people to social security offices, saying, `Isn't there anything you can do for this family?'. The response has been `No, there is not. They do not meet the criteria'. It is all very well to spend millions of dollars promoting elaborate schemes and making announcements about what is available, but if people are not going to qualify it is of little use. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not saying that nothing has been done. I invite Senator Giles, though, to re-check her arithmetic. She referred to an increase amounting to some $90, I think, and then attempted to translate that into the figure it would be if it were a salary increase minus the taxation. I am sure that she was not exaggerating but I have a feeling that she got her figures somewhat wrong when she was doing that. However, we are discussing the fact that there is poverty in this country, and it continues. For the Prime Minister to stand up and say that it has gone will not make it go away. I do not know whether he really meant it in 1987 or whether it was a throw away line, a throw away promise-we know about his throw away promises, they come and go pretty quickly-but he really does have a history of making quite outrageous promises, the reality of which is not met. In 1984 in Hobart he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>These things are going to continue-low inflation, lower than the world average, growth above the world average, interest rates coming down . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister tells us what he wants us to believe and what he hopes will happen, but of course it did not happen. Interest rates were supposed to be coming down again when the Prime Minister was electioneering in Western Australia not so long ago. I am sure all honourable senators remember his assertion then:</PARA>
<PARA> It's obvious that at some stage this year they will fall. </PARA>
<PARA>That was said in January 1989. They have not fallen. Ask anyone who has a mortgage what has been happening to them. The Prime Minister perhaps does not know, although yesterday he did a rather cute deal with the banks, not so that interest rates would fall, but so that they would be prevented from rising. It really has not been of much benefit to anyone. He must have been campaigning again in Tasmania. Earlier in his career as Prime Minister he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We will certainly go for the full three years. </PARA>
<PARA>We have heard that often enough. It looks as though we just might go for the full term this time, but not if the Prime Minister can avoid it. Yesterday's little deal with the banks tends to make one think that December this year is a pretty odds-on favourite for an election. The outrageous claims that I have referred to go on. The Prime Minister makes the outrageous claim that he does not make outrageous claims. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>All politicians like to be the bearers of good news, and I claim no exception for myself on that score. But I have been very careful not to make any claims about which I cannot be absolutely certain . . . I will have no part of needless exaggeration. </PARA>
<PARA>Poor fellow! He has either one problem or another. In the election campaign of 1987 he made the cruellest, most reckless and most outrageous claim and exaggeration that he has ever made. He stated that by 1990 no Australian child would live in poverty. As we all know, he has attempted to modify that statement since that time. Today we heard about benchmarks and all sorts of things. Senator Button's answer to my question will make interesting reading when the Hansard is finally produced. On 1 July 1987 he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>There will be no watering down of the pledge that was made. </PARA>
<PARA>That in itself was another broken undertaking. On The World Today in 1987, in answer to the question, `Will children be lifted above the Henderson poverty line?' he said, `That is right'. That was subsequently qualified. I think the community is rightly quite sceptical about these sorts of claims and the statements that he makes. We recognise that there are difficulties. I do not believe in our sort of society that we would ever live without somebody being in poverty; that is the nature of things. We could all think of the circumstances in which it happens, no matter how much is done. The brazen callousness of making such a promise and attempting to make people believe that that is what can be achieved is what we are talking about. We are letting him know that poverty continues. Julian Disney, the President of the Australian Council of Social Service, said in October last year:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no prospect of the Government achieving its child poverty promise however diluted by redefinition that promise may be, unless it devotes substantially greater resources to the task than has been promised . . . Some apparent increases in assistance will do little if any more than compensate for inflation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Those working with low income families every day know what an enormous problem poverty is and the way that it affects children. The Prime Minister either has an inability to comprehend it, or is out of touch with the reality of life. He has talked about the definition of poverty. The Burdekin report has been referred to and some of the definitions in that relate to the issues that we all know are relevant when we discuss poverty. Chapter 4 of the report refers to the rights of the child. It states that a child should enjoy the benefits of social security, and suggests how that might be done. It also says the child should have the right to adequate nutrition, housing, recreation and medical services as part of the declaration of the rights of the child. It states that those things should be adequate by a standard relevant to the country being discussed. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>There must be some standard against which a sufficient livelihood should be measured. A street dweller in Bombay is alive and manages to exist from day to day . . . Is this to be the standard of a sufficient livelihood in contemporary Australia? Clearly not. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on, but I have not got time to read as much of it as I would like to. We require a standard of living in this country which we know ought to be available to all children, and not a mere subsistence. If the Prime Minister is suggesting that children are merely living above the subsistence level, that is not good enough. The Macquarie Dictionary definition of `poverty' is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>the condition of being poor with respect to money, goods, or means of subsistence . . . deficiency or lack of something specified. </PARA>
<PARA>We have heard about homelessness, single parent families and families where nobody has employment, and it is the children who suffer in those situations. That suffering is not restricted to one child. Mr Burdekin suggests that there are 25,000 homeless children and 150,000 children living in poverty. Nobody can be absolutely precise about a figure, but there is no doubt such suffering exists. If the Prime Minister has any doubts, I can assure him that there are still families living in poverty and doing so here in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> I contacted a number of organisations this morning, as I frequently do, to talk about the existing situation in Canberra. I am not surprised to find that the services of each of those organisations are stretched. The Salvation Army is now seeing more low income families who are above the cut-off for family assistance, who have mortgages and medical expenses and who can no longer survive on what used to be regarded as a reasonable wage. Those organisations express concern that we are producing a generation of children who accept almost Third World living standards with no hope for a better future. The Salvation Army in Canberra saw 620 clients a month last year and is now seeing 870 a month. The St Vincent de Paul Society reports a similar trend. To the end of June, St Vincent de Paul saw 28,552 persons and assisted them with cash and goods. That is in a population of 260,000. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only people on social security who are looking for help and benefits. I can give an example of a man with an income of $35,000, with a dependent wife and four children. The mere mention of $35,000 might sound like a great deal of money but, after paying for mortgage instalments, food and clothing, that is about it. That family is not able to provide any extras. The Prime Minister will say they are not living in poverty because they have a house and they have food and clothing. What standard does he find acceptable in this country? That is the challenge we offer him. At what level does he say a child is living in poverty? I do not believe that his definition of the word is the same as mine. I do not believe his is satisfactory. There are 50 to 60 children in Canberra who are homeless and living out and about on any night one cares to go around this city. They are certainly living in poverty. The Prime Minister has done absolutely nothing to produce evidence to substantiate his claim that there is no child living in poverty and that he is six months ahead of his schedule. That is perhaps the most astonishing thing of all. There is absolutely not a shred of evidence to support the statement that he has made. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's priorities are funny. An enormous amount of money has been spent promoting Priority One, Skillshare and Jobstart. I could go on and on with the resources that have been put into promotion of schemes, but how many of them have turned into jobs for the young people who have not got jobs and who cannot get them? The last Budget provides $2 a week extra for pensioners, from next April. What are the airlines being paid at the present time? It is approximately $10m a week to cover their costs and we are in the seventh week of the strike. The other day $60m was found for Eastman Kodak Co. Over $3m was found for extra stamps because the Labor Party wanted to increase the stamp allowance for members in the House of Representatives so that they could get on with their campaigning. The priorities of this Government are all wrong. I suggest that it does not understand what people are suffering. I certainly challenge the way that it is able to take from taxpayers to spend on just some of the items that I have previously referred to when so many are still living in poverty and will continue to do so. The Prime Minister should be condemned for being so callous as to suggest that he has met that promise. </PARA>

It has been said several times-and established by both Senator Bolkus and Senator Giles-that the headline in the Australian is not true. In case anybody was listening to the last part of the debate and heard Senator Reid repeat the false allegation, I will repeat what the Prime Minister said yesterday. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>At the outset of the last election campaign, I committed a re-elected Labor Government to an ambitious and proud goal: the elimination of child poverty in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We made it clear that our pledge in this matter was to do what it was in our power to do-that is, to create the situation where there was no financial need for a child to live in poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> To meet that goal, we set ourselves, in consultation with the welfare community, historic benchmarks of support that would be available to low income families in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Since our re-election we have acted with determination to reach that goal-and we reached it ahead of target. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what was said. Goals that were set explicitly and simultaneously with that statement on the very same day in the very same document have been achieved exactly in the terms that were set out yesterday. The Australian got it wrong. It is entitled to do that, I guess; it is a free country. But the Opposition should not waste our time and consciously misuse the Senate to perpetuate that error. In effect, the Government is being condemned because all it has achieved is the greatest program of assistance for young Australians and for Australian families with children ever developed. We are giving more effective assistance than has been provided on any previous occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister in 1987 for the first time explicitly outlined targets, chapter and verse. The Opposition, on the other hand, throws around generalisations and makes frightening threats about cuts that might be forthcoming. The Prime Minister outlined the targets, chapter and verse, and gave exact percentages. They have been achieved. We set the benchmarks against which we could be tested and we have achieved them. The benchmark of a pension set at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings was set and has been achieved. The benchmarks for family support for families with children were set and have been achieved. Nobody pretends there is nothing more to be done, but they are substantial achievements. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Giles and Senator Bolkus mentioned the substantial support for this style of approach and for the achievements given by the Institute of Family Studies, from Bishop Hollingworth, and from others. Also for the first time these support payments have been indexed, thus protecting them for the first time against inflation. Those payments were introduced in 1976 and in the period of the previous coalition Government were increased only once in seven years. When taken in conjunction with the increase in Austudy payments for children at school, the increased school retention rates, for which explicit targets have also been set, the homeless youth package, and the child support package, we have a comprehensive program of reform for Australian families with children that will lift and has lifted many families out of poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> The best way to lift families out of poverty is to give people jobs because unemployment is the greatest cause of poverty. The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), sneers at the Government's job creation achievement of 1.5 million jobs. He says anybody could do that if they were prepared to create enough debt, which is a clear example of his priorities and an ominous warning. In his Thatcherite way and in Thatcherite language he is giving a warning to the people of Australia as to what might happen should the fate of a change in government befall them. We should be congratulating the Government on the most substantial package of measures for families with children and we should welcome its courage in setting explicit targets and the discipline to reach them. There are still problems; a lot remains to be done. But the Senate will serve the nation much more constructively by indulging in a calm, sober, rational discussion of the problems and the relative merits of alternative solutions, none of which have appeared today, rather than making a superficial, smart-alec attempt to score cheap points by misrepresenting serious contributions to the national debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take this opportunity to set the record straight on a statement I made in Question Time today which inadvertently misrepresented the position of the Leader of the National Party of Australia, Mr Charles Blunt. In Question Time today I referred to a joint appeal for clemency for a South African man, Mangena Jeffrey Boesman, due to be hanged in South Africa today which was endorsed late yesterday by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) and the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Haines).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the course of my answer I said that I understood that the Leader of the National Party, Mr Blunt, had declined to sign the appeal. I expressed my regret that he had chosen to take that course. I have since been contacted by Mr Blunt and told by him that he had not declined to sign the letter, that he had been out of contact with his office during the relevant period, and that if he had known about the appeal he would have agreed to sign. I, of course, accept Mr Blunt's word and I am happy to correct the record. I apologise to him publicly, as I have privately, for the misrepresentation of his position. That misrepresentation came about as a result of an unfortunate misunderstanding that occurred in the course of a complicated chain of communications between Mr Blunt's office, Mr Peacock's office, the Prime Minister's office and my office in which a message from a staffer that he could not commit Mr Blunt to that statement was eventually retailed to me as a message that `Mr Blunt would not go along' with the statement. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the text of the statement in question to which I am very glad to say Mr Blunt has now attached his support. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>JOINT APPEAL TO THE STATE PRESIDENT OF SOUTH AFRICA</PARA>
<PARA>Mr State President</PARA>
<PARA> We, the undersigned, call on you most urgently, and in the name of human compassion, to grant clemency to Mr Mangena Jeffrey Boesman who is, we understand, sentenced to be executed on Friday 29 September. </PARA>
<PARA> We are strongly and universally opposed to imposition of the death penalty, which is an inhumane and degrading form of punishment in violation of the most fundamental of human rights-the right to life. It is because of this that capital punishment has been abolished Federally and in all Australian States, and that the Australian Government regularly raises its concern over the death penalty with other governments. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, in the case of Mangena Jeffrey Boesman we are deeply concerned that his execution would constitute a particularly severe injustice. </PARA>
<PARA> We note that the case was originally heard by a single judge and leave to appeal was refused. We understand that Mr Boesman and his fellow accused were also severely disadvantaged at the start of their trial in November 1986 by their lack of adequate legal representation, that State witnesses were drawn from among those present in the crowd and that such evidence might well therefore be tainted by fear of themselves being charged. </PARA>
<PARA> You were able to commute the death sentences of two of his co-accused, and we urge you to do the same in the case of Mr Boesman. </PARA>
<PARA> If Mr Boesman is executed, it will be seen by the world as the first political execution authorised by your new Government. It will also be a major blow to the prospects for peace and justice in South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> We have noted that in your inauguration statement you pledged yourself to a quest for peace in South Africa through fairness and justice. We consider that it would signal most clearly to the world that you are determined to pursue this quest if you are able to grant clemency in this case. We call on you most urgently to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the Senate that three weeks ago I tabled a letter which was signed by Alderman Ron Hoenig, who is Mayor of the Botany Council and the unsuccessful Labor candidate for Kingsford-Smith, alleging that an anti-Semitic campaign had been conducted against him in the pre-selection battle for Australian Labor Party endorsement for that seat. It accused Mr Johnno Johnson of the Labor Party of being the author of that anti-Semitic campaign. Mr Hoenig has since apologised to Mr Johnson. He admitted that Mr Johnson was not the author of the campaign which nonetheless did proceed. There was an anti-Semitic campaign. I subsequently have spoken to Mr Johnson. I have apologised to him for retailing Mr Hoenig's false accusation. I now take this opportunity to say that, while there is no doubt that Mr Hoenig did suffer from an anti-Semitic campaign conducted against him when he was the left wing candidate for Labor pre-selection for the seat of Kingsford-Smith, Mr Johnno Johnson had no part of it. Mr Johnson is highly regarded in the Jewish community.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I bring before the Senate the plight of the Queensland pineapple industry which is fighting to protect its market from imports of canned pineapples from very low cost countries. There is no industry more synonymous with Queensland than the Queensland pineapple industry and there is no brand more identifiable with it than the Golden Circle brand. Every household in Australia would have tasted and enjoyed Golden Circle products such as tinned pineapple, fruit salad, beetroot, peas, cordial and the Estral 100 per cent fruit juice tetra pack. Whatever product Golden Circle markets, the housewife-or the householder-can be confident that she is providing her family with the best product that money can buy, prepared under hygienic conditions and under State and Federal government health supervision. The best Queensland grown ingredients guarantee a product that is second to none. The Golden Circle cannery is owned and operated by Queensland fruit and vegetable growers. It is a cooperative providing 1,700 jobs in the cannery at full production. It also provides a market for 1,000 fruit and vegetable growers, 550 of whom are pineapple growers. The Golden Circle cannery in Brisbane is the only canner of pineapple products in Australia and is acknowledged by experts as one of the most efficient fruit and vegetable processors in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is against this background that the Australian pineapple industry faces its biggest challenge-to hold its market share against cheap imports. To hold market share the growers have made every effort to make their production more effective and efficient and their farming methods more cost effective. But there is a limit to which farmers can go in cost cutting before growers start to go out the door backwards. That point has just about been reached. Pineapple growers are now asking what will happen in two or three years time. I make this speech in the Senate because there does not seem to be great understanding of this problem at a government level. I asked a question in the Senate on 31 August seeking help for the industry and was given an answer by Senator Button. He said that he would not support Mr Keith Wright's call for a 10,000-tonne quota and penalty tariffs for anything above that. In a supplementary question I asked Senator Button whether, as an interim measure, he would be prepared to reinstate the 10 per cent Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) tariff on canned pineapples that his Government effectively reduced to 5 per cent. His answer was an unequivocal no. </PARA>
<PARA> On 5 September Senator Button gave the Senate a more detailed answer that clearly indicated that he and his advisers do not have a good understanding of the problem. The nub of Senator Button's answer was that imports are at a level of only 13 per cent and that it is all Golden Circle's fault anyway because it refused to process a generic or home brand for G. J. Coles and Co. Ltd. Senator Button implied that Coles was then forced into importing pineapples from low cost countries and that the reduction of the IAC tariff by his Government from 10 per cent to 5 per cent had not increased imports. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I feel I must now set down the true position of the pineapple industry in Queensland for the Government and Senator Button to understand. Since 1985 Golden Circle has realised that its industry was threatened by imports. It was not prepared to sit idly by and watch its market share erode and its position as Australia's No. 1 supplier go down without a fight. The Golden Circle cannery engaged in a vigorous and expensive advertising campaign promoting its products by offering recipes in family magazines and by expanding export sales, mainly to New Zealand. This campaign has lifted domestic sales of canned pineapple from 108,148 tonnes in 1985 to 123,400 tonnes in 1988-an increase of 15,252 tonnes or, in percentage terms, 14.1 per cent. Golden Circle should be congratulated for achieving this increase in sales figures for its canned pineapple sales. </PARA>
<PARA> It is ironic that by creating a demand for canned pineapples, Golden Circle has in fact lifted the sales of the imported generic brand product marketed by the huge multinational grocery chains, which have not spent a cent on promoting canned pineapple but have piggybacked on Golden Circle's promotional campaigns. While the consumption of tinned pineapple has risen by 15,252 tonnes, or 14.1 per cent, due to Golden Circle's aggressive marketing, imports have risen from 12,637 tonnes in 1985-or 11 per cent of market share-to 26,000 tonnes in 1988. This is an increase of 21 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now put it in simple terms for Mr Kerin, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy; Senator Button, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce; and Senator Cook, the Minister representing Mr Kerin in the Senate, whom I have lobbied on this matter and who have agreed to examine this contribution. Sales of canned pineapples have increased by 14.1 per cent. Imports have increased by 21 per cent. Senator Button had that figure of 13 per cent totally wrong. The Australian market share has decreased by 8 per cent. This figure is rising as rapidly as 2 per cent every two months. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that, no matter how effective an advertising campaign is or how much promotion a company does, there is a limit on the growth of that market. That 14 per cent increase in five years-not in price but in actual pineapples consumed-is extracting as much out of the market as is possible. From 1985 to 1989 imports have continued to grow from 11 per cent to 21 per cent. If this trend continues it will be entirely at the expense of the Australian grown products as there is little or no further growth in the Australian market. I add that, while the industry has been under attack from cheap imports, it has aggressively lifted its export sales from 10,115 tonnes in 1985 to about 18,000 tonnes in 1988. This export market is also under pressure from the pineapple exports of lower cost, from the South East Asian countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Let it be clearly stated that the growers and Golden Circle cannery have not sat on their hands and done nothing over the past five years. They have done everything possible commercially to protect their industry. The costs have been heavy, apart from the expensive advertising campaigns promoting the consumption of canned pineapples. The growers have not had a price rise since 1985-five years without receiving even a 1c increase. In fact the price of No. 2 pool has fallen from $240 per tonne in 1985 to $165 per tonne in 1989, while the No. 1 pool has been static at $240 a tonne for five years. In 1985 a total intake of 105,226 tonnes gave growers a grand total payment of $25,734,240. If the consumer price index applied to this income over the next three years, the income should have been $38,864,648. It is calculated by the industry that income was down to $29,526,345-a decrease in real terms of 11 per cent. The growers know that any increase in price will amount to a further erosion of their market share. They have had to tighten their belts another notch every year for five years. Prices have been held firm on the retailers' shelves for 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA> Another economy the industry has been prepared to make is to process pineapples of only a certain size which have a recovery rate above 20 per cent. The result of that particular decision is that 12,000 tonnes of good pineapples are going to rot in the field because it is more expensive to process them. After all of these economic concessions by the pineapple industry, it is no wonder that I was provoked into calling Senator Button's answer unreasonable. Senator Button's background is legal and he obviously does not understand marketing. I found his response to my question surprising when he said that Golden Circle had rejected a request by G. J. Coles and Co. Ltd to package pineapples under Coles' Farmland label. Senator Button said:</PARA>
<PARA>Golden Circle insisted that it could only market products under its own brand labels. Coles and other supermarket chains subsequently placed orders with overseas suppliers who were prepared to meet their requirements and this has contributed to the increase in imports. </PARA>
<PARA>To say the least, those remarks of Senator Button were insensitive and would offend the growers and the 1,700 workers who produce and process Australia's pineapple crops. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Was he correct?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I will come to that. Home labels or, as they are known, generic brands, are generally considered to be inferior, second-rate products processed with inferior second-quality ingredients. It could be said that home brands are made to a price and not to quality or a recipe. I do not believe that Golden Circle would be prepared to put its name on a product that was not the best available and to sell that product to the Australian people. It would be impossible to manufacture a home or generic brand product in Australia without cutting prices or lowering the quality of the product in the can. Certainly, it would not be a very clever commercial decision for a grower-owned cannery to subsidise a generic brand so that this brand could compete with its own quality product.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that even if Golden Circle offered a generic brand at 20 per cent cheaper, it still could not compete with the cheaper imported products which can be landed at 64c a litre in Australia; so much for Senator Button's explanation that Golden Circle's refusal to provide a generic brand has increased imports. The Government must realise that grocery chains do not want to buy dearer, higher quality local products and market them under their own brand names when they can bring into Australia cheaper products, sell them under their own generic labels, and enjoy huge mark-ups that give the chains maximum profits. That is the bottom line: maximum profits. </PARA>
<PARA> I fully recognise and appreciate that reduction of trade barriers will give greater access to Australian commodities. We are facing a difficult problem that must be addressed if we are to sustain a canned pineapple industry. We must allow our growers a fair chance to survive and to play on an even field. The Government must examine whether an anti-dumping case can be sustained on canned pineapple. The normal criterion upon which to establish anti-dumping is to prove that tinned pineapple is sold in the country of process at a higher price than in the country to which it is exported. In the case of imported canned pineapple from South East Asia this is impossible to prove simply because the country of origin does not allow retail sales of canned pineapple in that country. In fact, the Dole Pineapple Co. of Thailand and the Great Pineapple Co. of Indonesia proudly advise that 100 per cent export of their production is part of the established agreement with the host government. Therefore, it is impossible to establish whether there is a profit component in the imported pineapple at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The anti-dumping authority must also assess what assistance host governments give pineapple processors by way of tax holidays, subsidised loans, subsidised freight, cheap land leases and subsidised fertilisers. All of these represent help that is given by host governments. These cost savings must all be included in the price of a tin of pineapple to establish the true cost of manufacture. If the price is less in the country of import than the true cost of manufacture there is a case for anti-dumping to be sustained. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also evidence to suggest that some Third World countries are using pineapple exports as a means of obtaining hard currency rather than as a genuine business with a profit motivation. I say this because some countries have entered into long term contracts with suppliers, then undercut those prices on the spot market, suggesting that dumping is taking place. I say to the Senate that it is not only the pineapple industry that is under attack from cheap imports but many other food items are also brought into Australia and marketed under generic labels. Many grocery products are brought in and are packed under generic labels for Coles, Woolworths and Franklins. These products are discreetly labelled with the country of origin in type sometimes as small as 1.5 millimetres-slightly bigger than a pin head. Ironically, the housewife is prepared to trust these imported food products because she identifies the home brand with a major retail store and associates the product with the store rather than with the country of origin. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time that the Government and its instrumentalities recognised the problem faced by our rural producers and provided for at least a fair go for our horticultural industries. Australian horticulture is competing with countries that have wage structures as low as $1.50 a day, hygiene standards less than those which are required in Australia, and products grown with fertiliser and insecticides that would not meet Australian health or environmental standards. Let it be a requirement that the country of origin be marked in a prominent position on the can in lettering the same size as those denoting the product for sale. The Industries Assistance Commission has brought down interim recommendations on packaging, and nominating the country of origin in respectable minimum sized writing was not one of those recommendations. Let us hope that the final recommendations to be released in December will pick up this important requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had private discussion with Senator Bolkus on this matter and I believe that he is aware of the problem. The housewife who shops for her family deserves to know what she is buying and under what conditions that product is processed. She can make a value judgment as to whether it is in the best interests of her family to buy a cheaper, inferior product or go for the first grade Australian grown and produced item. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an urgent need to examine the pineapple industry and the full 10 per cent tariff recommended by the IAC, which was magnanimously removed by the Government in July 1986, for developing countries. The pineapple industry does not mind the Government being magnanimous and helping developing countries but not so that the burden is left entirely on the shoulders of the 550 pineapple growers and 1,700 workers. If the Government makes those decisions, let the whole of Australia carry them-not just a tiny industry. </PARA>
<PARA> While it can be recognised that South East Asian countries that grow pineapples are developing, the canning companies that are operating in those countries are hardly developing. They are huge, American-owned and controlled and between the two of them-Dole and Del Monte-they control 43 per cent of the world canned pineapple market. Their mode of operation is to identify a country with cheap labour and subsidised land, bring in their technology and machinery and flood the market. </PARA>
<PARA> The 5 per cent tariff the Government removed from the industry has gone on subsidising an American public company with its shareholders in America and profits repatriated to its United States shareholders. That is certainly not giving the Australian industry a fair go, but no doubt the American shareholders of the Dole and Del Monte canneries would say a big thank you to the Australian Government every time they receive a dividend cheque. </PARA>
<PARA> Tests in the United States of America have shown that some Thailand and South East Asian companies add citric acid to lower the brix-acid ratio. With low levels of citric acid two problems occur-taste and sterility. Most canners in Thailand are adding citric acid to pineapple products, but not all declare it on their labels. This high natural acid : sugar ratio occurs naturally in Queensland grown pineapple and is deficient in the imported product. The overseas cannery must add a chemical to artificially improve the quality of the imported canned fruit. The low levels of natural acid affect the taste of pineapple juice, so much so that in Europe distributors are forced to mix good Golden Circle juice with South East Asian juice to improve the quality of their product. Also, low levels of acid as found in imported canned pineapple can allow pathogens, which are micro-organisms, to survive the cooking process. </PARA>
<PARA> I make this contribution because the Government and the Ministers responsible must understand what is happening to this $183m industry. There is an urgent need to see that Australia's horticultural industries are not competing against dumped products, and to recognise that clearly marked labelling would help maintain the market share of imported pineapple. I have presented this contribution so that the Government can fully understand the crisis facing the pineapple industry. I ask it to give its immediate attention to the problems of the growers and the process workers. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) On 15 June 1989, Senator Michael Baume asked a question about the Imam Hilaly's visa. Clearly, the Senator was asking not about visas-which authorise a carrier to bring a person to Australia-but about the Imam's entry permit.</PARA>
<PARA> On 16 June 1989, Senator Richardson correctly noted that the Imam had applied on 4 May 1989 for a further entry permit and correctly outlined the processes for its consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> Coincidentally, the Imam applied on 15 June 1989 for a return visa, that is a visa which would allow a carrier to bring him to Australia should he leave Australia. The Imam's visa application also entailed a consideration of the type of entry permit which might be accorded to him when, as he wished, he returned to the border after his brief overseas visit for religious purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> This application was only received by the State Director of my Department on 16 June 1989 and this application was of little consequence to the substantive issue of the Imam's application for permanent residence, or indeed, possible consideration of extended temporary residence.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) As noted above, Senator Baume's questions confuse visas with entry permits. An entry permit to Imam Hilaly was due to expire on 30 June 1989 and a further temporary entry permit-to accommodate his overseas visit and return to Australia-expired on 19 August 1989. The provision of re-entry visas and further temporary entry permits to temporary residents is not extraordinary. The policy guiding the Department clearly contemplates such issues-even to temporary residents who have applied for permanent residence.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answers to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) At present there are 20 members of the Australian Police Contingent in Cyprus, drawn from the ranks of the Australian Federal Police (AFP).</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The United Nations Civilian Police (UNCIVPOL) consists of 20 Australian and 15 Swedish Police. The total United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) has 2,000 members. Australian police make up 1 per cent of this total.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) UNCIVPOL is responsible for all reported or detected incidents involving civilians or their property in the United Nations Buffer Zone (UNBZ). It provides an independent and neutral liaison point between the Cypriot Police and the Turkish Cypriot Police Element in matters which cross community boundaries.</PARA>
<PARA> UNCIVPOL is tasked by HQ, UNFICYP to assist the UN Humanitarian Branch by escorting Greek and Turkish civilians across the UNBZ. It also aids in locating, interviewing and providing aid to Turkish or Greek Cypriots living in the opposite community. UNCIVPOL is also tasked to provide police support to other UNFICYP units in emergencies.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Salary and terms and conditions of Australian members of UNCIVPOL are generally the same as for other members of the AFP. Provisions relating to service in Cyprus are included in Determination No. M31 under section 30 of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979. This determination covers such considerations as term of posting, hours of duty, removal expenses, travelling allowance, storage of furniture and effects, insurance, public holidays and uniform issue.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) In the 25 years since the first Australian contingent arrived, there have been three deaths, two due to traffic accidents and one caused by a land mine. Injuries have been traffic injuries, or of a minor domestic nature.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) and (8) The Australian contingent consists of one Commander, 3 Superintendents and 16 Sergeants. Eleven of the contingent are Constables holding the brevet rank of Sergeant. Officers are rotated every twelve months. Sergeants are rotated every six months, with an option of a further six-month tour.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) Members receive a one-week briefing on their duties and responsibilities before departure, and one week of four-wheel drive vehicle training.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) No. At first UNCIVPOL insisted that all members should be armed on duty, but since the first tour in 1964, this is no longer the case.
