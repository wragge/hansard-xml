<TITLE>Interest Rates</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Hawke-Keating Government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many Australians out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament; the humble petition of the undersigned showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That Kingsford-Smith Airport is becoming increasingly congested and existing facilities are inadequate to handle the number of aircraft or their passengers.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government's plans to divert aircraft from Mascot to Bankstown and/or increase landing charges for peak periods will do little to relieve congestion and will place enormous financial and other burdens on commuter airlines and their passengers.</PARA>
<PARA> We therefore call on the Federal Government to take heed of airline and travel industry warnings and-</PARA>
<PARA> 1. give immediate approval for the construction of a third runway at Mascot</PARA>
<PARA> 2. upgrade existing radar and other traffic control facilities to enable Australia's high safety record to be maintained.</PARA>

The amendments to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955 and the Supreme Court Ordinance 1955 of that Territory will restore criminal trial by jury in the courts of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The Bill provides for a court to move the venue of a criminal trial on indictment from Cocos (Keeling) Islands to another State or Territory, when necessary, and for jurors to be summoned at the new venue using the State jury list. The Bill also amends references to Chief Judge in the Norfolk Island Act 1979 by substituting Chief Justice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendments to the Australian Film, Television and Radio School Act 1975 will reduce the size of the Council from 15 to 9. This will ensure more effective governance by the Council and will reduce the cost of council meetings through reduced sitting fees and travel expenses. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the Australian Film Commission, the National Museum of Australia and the Australian Heritage Commission to conduct their meetings by telephone, closed circuit television or other methods of communication. The requirement to have members physically attend is no longer mandatory. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to the investment powers of the Australia Council, Australian Film Commission, Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, Australian National Gallery and National Museum of Australia will free investments from the existing general requirement for these statutory authorities to seek ministerial approval for all financial dealings above a statutory limit. The range of available investments will, however, remain restricted to those specified in the respective enabling legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments relating to the Sea Installations Act 1987 seek to improve administrative efficiency and to specifically provide that a representative of the Norfolk Island Government will be included in discussions concerning the granting of permissions and exemptions under the Act in waters off Norfolk Island. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act 1988 will confer upon the Governor-General the power to make regulations dealing with the means by which an elector may dispose of the matter of having failed to vote at Australian Capital Territory elections. The maximum penalty for failing to vote is presently set by the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act at $50. The introduction of an infringement notice procedure is proposed to enable an elector, instead of being pursued through the courts, to discharge his or her liability for failing to vote by paying a penalty of $20 directly to the Electoral Commissioner. The Bill makes two further minor technical amendments which clarify the intention of the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Parts 3 and 5 of the Bill contain amendments to the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 and the Australian Capital Territory Self-Government (Consequential Provisions) Act 1988.

<PARA> That the Bills be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that most Australians want a Constitution which reflects our aspirations for the future and which will facilitate the good government of Australia into the next century. To this end the Australian Democrats have fought a single-handed battle over the last ten years against the combined opposition of the major political parties to give citizens a greater say in the operation of government and allow them to contribute directly to the laws of the land. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1978, ex-Senator Colin Mason first raised the concept of citizen-initiated referendum as a method of greater public participation. The 10-year political haul culminated in the debate on the four referendum bills in May 1988 when I was able to get the Constitution Alteration (Electors' Initiative) Bill 1987 debated at the same time as the Government's four referendum proposals. However this progress was stifled yet again when on 26 May 1988, a motion from the Opposition to prevent further debate on this bill was supported by the government. Thus this most important concept of popular initiative, and specifically the Constitution Alteration (Electors' Initiative) Bill 1987, was once again shunted aside. I remind the Senate that the combined vote of the Liberal, National and Labour Parties against the Australian Democrats gagged parliamentary debate on this topic. At that time I made it clear that I believed the people of Australia should themselves have the opportunity to accept or reject my proposed alteration of the Constitution which would have enabled them to petition the government for a referendum on a proposed piece of legislation or the alteration of the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> The two bills which I am introducing today are an extension of and an improvement upon the constitution Alteration (Electors' Initiative) Bill 1987. They have taken into account the enormous public response which I have received to my 1987 Bill (and previous versions of this bill). The changes are an acknowledgement of this public comment and an attempt to gain more parliamentary political support so that real progress can be made. </PARA>
<PARA> My two new bills do not include provision for a voters' veto, which together with the constitutional initiative and the legislative initiative constitutes the third element of the popular initiative process. I believe that it is preferable to focus our efforts on the positive aspects of the initiative and referendum process. To this end I have introduced one bill which provides solely for a constitutional initiative and one bill which provides for a legislative initiative. Proponents of the voters' veto proposal have the fall-back option of trying to use the initiative process to have a veto introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> In framing these bills, the Australian Democrats accepted comments from interested groups and the public on my earlier bills and responded to the criticisms made during previous parliamentary debates. We have examined at length the situation in overseas countries where the popular initiative process has worked so well and been widely accepted by the governments and people, most notably in Switzerland and the USA. The most telling indication of the support for the initiative is that it has not been challenged-let alone dismantled or abolished-in countries where it exists. I believe a similar situation would occur if it were introduced in Australia. Most recently there have been some very interesting case studies of how the initiative process works in the USA and Switzerland. </PARA>
<PARA> At the United States General Election held on 6 November 1984 the voters of California were asked to vote on several topics as well as elect the US President, the Congress and the California legislature. The California Ballot Pamphlet contained the ballot titles, short summary of the proposals, the Legislative Analyst's analysis, the pro and con arguments and rebuttals, and the complete text of each proposition. It also contains the legislative vote cast for and against any measure proposed by the Legislature. There are, of course, no such vote record for citizen-sponsored initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> On the 1984 Ballot Pamphlet, Californians were required to vote on (i) Bond Acts, (ii) Legislative Constitutional Amendments, and (iii) Initiative Statutes and Initiative Constitutional Amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> Bond Acts are approved by the State Legislature to finance specific projects and use the proceeds from the sale of general obligation bonds. The Legislative Analyst in the Ballot Pamphlet states that: ``A general obligation bond is backed by the full faith and credit of the state, meaning that, in issuing the bond, the state pledges to use its taxing power, if necessary, to assure that sufficient funds are available to pay the principal and interest on the bond.''</PARA>
<PARA> Legislative Constitutional Amendments are alterations to the Californian State Constitution proposed by the legislature and put to the voters for their approval. Initiative Statutes and Initiative Constitutional Amendments are alterations to the laws and Constitution of California proposed by the required number of electors and put to the voters of California for their approval. </PARA>
<PARA> Amongst other things, Californian electors were asked to vote on Bond Laws to increase funding for: the cleanup of hazardous substances; further purification of Californian drinking water; changes to property taxation; reapportionment of electoral boundaries; and distribution of voting materials in languages other than English. </PARA>
<PARA> On 8 November 1988, Americans in 41 States-in addition to choosing a new President, vice president, and assorted national, state and local officials-voted on about 230 state-wide proposals. These ranged in significance from a measure mandating closure of 2 nuclear power plants in Massachusetts to another authorising a weed-killing program in Alabama. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of these proposals were initiatives-or referenda that originated from the electorate rather than state legislators. This process is allowed in only 22 States. The other proposals originated from the state parliaments. </PARA>
<PARA> The results of the recent referenda in the USA indicate that voters cannot be bought by the weight of advertising for either the ``yes'' or ``no'' campaign. For example the insurance industry spent $75 million backing four contradictory and confusing auto-insurance referenda, but all were defeated. Proposition 19 which proposed a 25 cent tax on cigarettes to fund medical research and education passed despite the tobacco industry's $16 million campaign to defeat it. Maryland voters also rejected an expensive lobbying effort by the National Rifle Association which spent $5 million trying to kill a new state law regulating the manufacture and sale of cheap handguns, and overwhelmingly approved the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of the routine series of federal ballots conducted in Switzerland in 1988, national referenda were conducted on 4 December on:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) a town-country initiative against land speculation;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) an initiative in favour of the 40-hour working week; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) an initiative in favour of the restriction of immigration. </PARA>
<PARA> The subject matter of these ballots, which were initiated by private citizens, is indicative of the importance and variety of issues on which ordinary electors may directly vote. Clearly some controversial issues come to a vote too. My argument is that these processes are what democracy is all about. It is important to note that just because these initiatives were on the 4 December ballot paper did not mean that they were supported by the required majorities. In fact the electors of Switzerland rejected all three proposals by a clear margin of about 2 to 1. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Australian context, I believe that no majority group of any political persuasion would succeed in effecting change without the voting support of the majority. This is due to the built-in safeguards enshrined in my bills which require considerable community support before a question can even proceed to the referendum stage. Moreover, even when this has been accomplished, the majority of the population is still required to approve any proposal at the ballot box before it can take effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable Senators will be interested to know that Canadian politicians also have a long history of seeking consultation with the people on a variety of questions and an appreciation of the importance of greater citizen participation. In fact as recently as January 1988 the citizens of Prince Edward Island were asked whether they favoured a fixed link with the mainland. This was neither a new question nor a fresh issue, but certainly one of transcending importance for the Island's economy, tourism and way of life. And for all the decades of debate-about tunnels, causeways and ferry-boat services-it was the first time ever that the people who lived there were directly asked for their opinion, and the first time they had a chance to directly express it. Premier Joe Ghiz referred the question directly in a plebiscite to the people of Prince Edward Island. </PARA>
<PARA> Plebiscites are more a part of the democratic infrastructure of Canada than most people would believe. There have been 2 plebiscites at the national level on prohibition of liquor on 29 September 1898, and conscription for overseas military service on 27 April 1942. Over 40 plebiscites have been held at the provincial level, starting with liquor prohibition in a Prince Edward Island vote in 1878, down to the present times with the vote on independence in Quebec in May 1980, and the Northwest Territories plebiscite on territorial division in April 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from prohibition issues, province-wide plebiscites have dealt with such questions as women's suffrage, public health insurance, daylight saving time, ownership of power companies and marketing of coarse grains. At the municipal level, several thousand plebiscites and referendums have occurred in this century, on issues ranging from bond issues, building projects, local option prohibition, local franchises, and forms of municipal government. </PARA>
<PARA> Prince Edward Island is one of several provinces with a separate enabling statute for the holding of votes on ``questions''-the Plebiscite Act. The British Columbia Act contains enabling provisions for province-wide plebiscites, which have been resorted to at least 9 times since Confederation. Alberta, New Brunswick and Newfoundland have similar provisions in their election acts, while Quebec, Yukon and Northwest Territories join Prince Edward Island in having separate statutes for holding plebiscites. </PARA>
<PARA> When enabling legislation does not exist, a special statute has to be enacted each time a plebiscite is held. Similarly during the 2 national plebiscites, enabling legislation had to be drawn up. </PARA>
<PARA> Legally there is a distinction between a plebiscite, which is a formalised expression of public opinion through the ballot box, and a referendum, which is the same thing, except its results are a binding verdict of the people which must be reflected in law. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Patrick Boyer MP a member of the Canadian Parliament has stated that plebiscites and referendums are ``vastly underutilized instruments of our system of popular government in this country, and that Canadian democracy will be much healthier and stronger when we permit greater direct participation of citizens in government decision-making.''</PARA>
<PARA> Some critics of popular initiative through plebiscite or referendum argue that the idea of giving citizens the right to decide questions of local, state or national importance reduces the standard or the role of representative democracy. It is interesting, therefore, to note that even in the United Kingdom, in what many considered a major departure from accepted constitutional practice by the mother of most of the world's parliamentary democracies, a plebiscite was held in 1975 on the question of Britain's entry into the European Common Market. This is not the only precedent. On 8 March 1973, in an attempt at a new settlement to the sectarian violence and problems of government in Northern Ireland, a plebiscite was held asking the voters whether they wanted the province to remain part of the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover in September 1981 the then Secretary of State for the Environment, Michael Heseltine, proposed legislation to subject high-spending local authorities to a rates referendum of local voters. However because of the low level of support within the government ranks and their ambiguous and unconvincing advocacy of the bill, the minister was forced to withdraw his proposal even before the second reading. Despite its brief existence the proposed statute raised for public view the question of whether `direct democracy'-the referendum-could exist in a society which considers itself the model of representative democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> Eugene C Lee, Professor of Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley, in an article titled ``Can the British Voter be Trusted? The Local Referendum and Tax Reform'' discussed the implications of this British experience. He suggested that there are three things the referendum can do that no other instrument can. </PARA>
<PARA> ``First, it can give everyone voting an equal say on a specific question; second it can enable people to decide an issue on the basis of what is in the public interest; and thirdly it identifies the interest of the people with the government.''</PARA>
<PARA> All is not well with the current state of representative democracy-for example the exaggerated symbolism of the mandate and the partisan secrecy of many local council majorities. Lee argues that ``the referendum might provide a small corrective to these concerns'' without endangering parliamentary sovereignty. The referendum ``could be a useful addition to British local democracy-a half-way house between uniform central control and unrestricted local council autonomy.''</PARA>
<PARA> The people of Australia are well aware of the overwhelmingly positive aspects of the concept of popular initiative. It remains now for the major political parties to get their collective heads ``out of the sand'' and wake up to this unique opportunity to improve the operation of politics and government in this country. The parliament must offer the people an opportunity to contribute more to the political and governmental processes. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable Senators will recall that the Constitution Alteration (Electors' Initiative) Bill 1987 provided that if 5 percent of enrolled electors petitioned within a 6 month time period for the introduction of (a) a specific piece of legislation or (b) an alteration of the Constitution, then a national referendum had to be held on that question within 12 months. The two bills I am introducing today are based on the 1987 bill-albeit with some substantial differences which will be outlined. </PARA>
<PARA>Constitution Alteration (Electors' Initiative) Bill 1989</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This bill provides for at least 5 percent of electors who voted (formally) at the last federal election to petition for a national referendum on a proposal to alter the Constitution. The 1987 bill specified petitioning by 5 percent of enrolled electors. The provisions of this bill represent a relaxation of the requirements because the number of voters that vote is less than the number actually enrolled. In fact some 9,235,000 people voted formally at the 1987 election for the House of Representatives and therefore the required number of petitioners would be 462,000 people. The time period for the collection of the required signatures is again 6 months. </PARA>
<PARA> This bill does not provide for the introduction of a legislative initiative in the Constitution as my earlier bills did. It relates only to a constitutional initiative which would allow voters to petition for a referendum on a citizen-initiated proposal to alter the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> The Constitution Alteration (Electors' Initiative) Bill 1989 provides for a new Section 129 dealing with ``Alteration of Constitution on electors' initiative'' to be inserted into the Constitution. This bill outlines a major role for the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) in the process. Section 129 provides for the AEC to register persons or groups of persons as proponents of a proposal to alter the Constitution. Such person or persons must be qualified to vote for members of the House of Representatives to become a proponent. </PARA>
<PARA> The registered proponents may present a petition to the AEC ``requesting the Governor-General to cause to be put to the people by way of referendum the proposed law to amend the Constitution endorsed on, or attached to, the petition.'' The bill requires that such a proposed law may achieve a single purpose only. </PARA>
<PARA> The AEC is responsible for the printing of the petition and forms for signature by electors who wish to sign the petition. It is my intention that the number of forms to be printed should be at least sufficient to contain the required number of signatures for a proposal to be successful. </PARA>
<PARA> The bill specifies a period of 6 months for the collection of signatures. There is a 7-day waiting period for the collection period to commence while copies of the petition (in the form of the Constitution Alteration Bill) and signature collection forms are forwarded for signature. The petitions may be signed by ``any elector in a State or Territory who was qualified to vote for the election of a member of the House of Representatives at the general election that last preceded the date so fixed.''</PARA>
<PARA> The bill requires that at least 5 percent of electors who voted at the last general election must sign any petition before the proponent/s ``may present the petition and signatures to the AEC.'' The new Section 129 requires the AEC to verify the validity of petition signatures by undertaking random sampling of them (as is the case in some states of the USA). If after random sampling of the signatures the AEC is satisfied that the petition was signed as required, it shall present the petition to the Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> In turn the Governor-General shall ``at the next general election of the House of Representatives submit the proposed law . . . to the electors in each State and Territory.'' The requirement for the date of the referendum to coincide with the next federal election is different from my earlier bill which specified a referendum within 12 months of the presentation of the signed petition. This alteration will result in a reduced cost of the whole popular initiative procedure and effectively counters claims that is too expensive to conduct. </PARA>
<PARA> The requirements for a constitutional initiative proposal to be successful are the same as apply to constitutional referenda put forward by the government. Section 128 of the Constitution currently specifies that ``if in a majority of the States a majority of the electors voting approve the proposed law, and if a majority of all the electors voting also approve the proposed law, it shall be presented to the Governor-General for the Queen's assent.''</PARA>
<PARA> The bill provides that the AEC may arrange for proponents or opponents of a constitutional initiative to furnish their arguments at their own expense to electors. The amendments to the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 which are introduced as a Schedule to the Legislative Initiative Bill 1989 require that spending by Commonwealth, State, Territory and local governments be equal between the ``yes'' and ``no'' cases. This will ensure that proponents and opponents can distribute their arguments at their own expense, and ensures that public monies are spent equally on arguments for and against any constitutional initiative proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposed Section 129 provides that any time during the signature collection period ``the Attorney-General or any other person qualified to vote for the election of the House of Representatives may make application to the Federal Court of Australia for a declaration that the proposed law is not in the appropriate form or does not seek to change the Constitution in a manner that is practicable or legally effective.'' If the Court makes the declaration accordingly, then the petition has no force of effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The last paragraph of the bill provides for the parliament to make laws with respect to all matters associated with the electors' initiative process. This is done to prevent the Constitution itself becoming enmeshed in the intricate administrative detail of the process. Rather than specifically spelling out the details and seeking to have them included in the Constitution, it is my intention that the parliament make laws with respect to such things as:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the registration of a proponent or proponents to a proposed petition;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the registration of opponents to a petition;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the random counting of signatures to a petition;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the printing of copies of a petition and of forms for signatures to the petition, including the information to be supplied by persons signing the petition;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the costs of, and associated with a petition;</PARA>
<PARA> (f) the circulation of statements for and against a proposed alteration of the Constitution; and</PARA>
<PARA> (g) application to the Federal Court in respect of a proposed law to change the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> This list is not complete, but it does indicate the range of important detail that the parliament will be required to legislate on after this bill has been accepted by the people. I want my intent as the legislator to be quite clear in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Constitution is a document which belongs to the people of Australia-not the parliament or the government or the opposition. Currently section 128 stipulates that before there can be any change to the Constitution, the proposed alteration must be accepted by a majority of voters and a majority of states at a national referendum. It seems eminently sensible, therefore, to allow the people themselves, not just the government, to propose alterations to the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, one would think that if a substantial number of electors petitioned for a constitutional alteration and a referendum was held on this question as my bill would require, the government's obligations would be reduced. Currently only the government can determine if there is a referendum and what proposals of constitutional alteration are to be asked. </PARA>
<PARA> By allowing the people to take this initiative, the government can relieve itself of the burden of up-dating the Constitution (as was planned through the Constitutional commission) and need only concern itself with those questions which it wishes to pursue. The introduction of a constitutional initiative may well have the effect of de-politicising the Constitution-at least in the party political sense. </PARA>
<PARA>Legislative Initiative Bill 1989</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Constitution Alteration (Electors' Initiative) Bill 1987 included provisions that if 5 percent of electors petitioned for the introduction of (a) a specific piece of legislation or (b) a change to the Constitution, then a national referendum had to be held on the matter. The Legislative Initiative Bill 1989 has solely a legislative initiative function. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than seeking to alter the Constitution to put in a legislative initiative (as the 1987 sought to do), this Legislative Initiative Bill is an ordinary bill of parliament. It has been drafted in this way to avoid any possible constitutional problems which might arise under Section 1 of the Constitution which states that:</PARA>
<PARA> ``The legislative power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal Parliament, which shall consist of the Queen, a Senate, and a House of Representatives, and which is herein-after called ``the Parliament'', or ``The Parliament of the Commonwealth''.''</PARA>
<PARA> By putting our legislative initiative proposals in the form of an ordinary bill we should avoid any conflict with this section by not taking the legislative power out of the hands of the federal parliament as Section 1 says. </PARA>
<PARA> The Legislative Initiative Bill 1989 provides that if at least 2.5 percent of electors who voted formally at the last federal election petition for the introduction of a proposed piece of legislation, then a national referendum must be held on the bill. The 2.5 percent figure represents an enormous collection of signatures and widespread support from about 231 000 people. It is not as high as the 5 percent requirement for constitutional initiatives which we believe should be considerably stricter. </PARA>
<PARA> This bill outlines a major role for the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC). Clause 4 of the bill provides that individuals and organisations which seek to be recognised as the proponents of a proposal shall register with the AEC. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 5 states that proponents of a proposed bill may submit a draft petition and copy of the proposed bill to the AEC for printing together with the forms for the collection of signatures. The proponent is required to pay for the printing. Clause 5 (4) specifies that the number of petitions and proposed bills which are printed must be ``adequate to enable signature by electors to a number not less than the prescribed number of electors.'' The copies of the petition and forms for signature shall be numbered for identification. Petition forms shall make provision for the full name, address, signature and electoral roll number of each person who signs to be on them. </PARA>
<PARA> The period for the collection of signatures is specified in clause 6. It is 6 months ``commencing on a date not earlier than 7 days after the date on which the copies of the petition and of the forms for signature are made available to the proponent.'' Thus there is a built-in period of 7 days for the forms to be distributed before the 6 month signature collection period commences. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the provisions of clause 7, people opposed to a proposed bill may make application to the AEC to be registered as its opponents. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 8 outlines the procedure for the signature of petitions. Petitioners are required to provide their full names and addresses. If petitioners do not comply then the signature is disregarded for the purposes of the Act and it is not counted. Clause 8 (3) provides that if a person knowingly provides false or misleading information then a penalty of $1 000 is incurred. </PARA>
<PARA> The method of presentation of petitions to the AEC is specified in clause 9. Petitions must be signed by not less than the prescribed number of eligible electors and presented after the expiration of the 6 month period. Clause 9 (2) requires the proponent to insert electoral roll numbers on the petition forms. Obviously not many, if any, people know their electoral roll number. They will not be required to know it at the time of signing a petition because the proponents can insert this information on their behalf before presentation. This provision strikes some balance between the need for strict requirements ensuring only genuine signatures are collected, and enabling proponents to supply the required information. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 10 of the bill requires the AEC to verify the validity of the signatures by undertaking random sampling of not less than 5% of the total signatures collected (as is the case in some states of the USA). For the purposes of this bill the AEC would currently be required to sample some 11,500 signatures. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission shall (i) check that persons who sign are eligible voters, (ii) seek confirmation from people who signed that it is their signature, and (iii) check that the required number of people have signed the petitions. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 11 details the method of presentation of petitions to the Governor-General. Once the AEC is satisfied that the petitions have been signed by the prescribed number of eligible number of electors, it shall present the petition to the Governor-General. Clause 11 (2) outlines how the total number of valid signatures will be determined. For example, if 0.6 percent of sampled signatures are found to be invalid, then 0.6 percent of the total signatures collected are taken to be invalid. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 12 (1) provides that when a petition has been presented to the Governor-General, the Governor-General shall ``at the next general election of the House of Representatives submit the proposed bill to which the petition relates to the electors in each State and Territory qualified to vote for the election of the House of Representatives.'' My earlier Electors' Initiative Bills specified that a referendum be held within 12 months of the signatures being collected. The requirement in this bill for the date of the referendum to coincide with the next federal election, substantially reduces the cost of the whole popular initiative procedure and counters the exaggerated claims that the referendum process is too expensive. The community should be prepared to defray the costs of institutions and practices that foster greater citizen participation and raise the standard of a democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 12 (2) states that: ``where a prepared bill is submitted to the electors, the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 shall apply subject to the modifications set out in the Schedule to this Act.'' These modifications require that Commonwealth, State, Territory and local government spending on the arguments in favour of, or against, a proposed bill should be equal. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 12 (3) provides that if an Act ``substantially in accordance with the Bill'' is enacted before a referendum is held on a proposed bill, then a referendum shall not be held on the proposed bill. Arguments in favour of or against a legislative initiative may be prepared by proponents and opponents of a proposed bill respectively at their own expense. </PARA>
<PARA> Jurisdiction is conferred on the Federal Court of Australia in the following circumstances by clause 13. Firstly, ``upon application made by the proponent of a proposed bill or by an applicant to be registered as the proponent of a proposed bill, to declare whether the bill is substantially the same as another proposed bill in respect of which there is a proponent or application has been made to be registered as the proponent.'' Secondly, ``upon application made by the Attorney-General or the proponent of a proposed bill, to declare whether a particular Act is substantially in accordance with the proposed bill.''</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 14 provides that ``where a majority of the voters voting at a referendum vote in favour of a proposed bill, a Minister shall, subject to the Constitution, seek leave to introduce the bill into a House of Parliament within 14 sitting days of that House after the declaration of the result of the referendum.'' This is an enforcement provision which requires the government to act on legislative initiatives which have been supported by the people. There are no requirements for special majorities to support a legislative initiative because it is an ordinary bill (not a constitutional change). Therefore I have incorporated this less stringent level of electoral support in the bill as sufficient for a legislative initiative to be put to the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 15 provides that this bill when passed into law should not limit the powers of the parliament (a) ``to pass or reject a bill in accordance with or substantially in accordance with the terms of a proposed bill that has been approved or rejected by the electors at a referendum; or (b) to repeal or amend an Act passed by the Parliament that is in accordance with, a proposed bill that had been approved by the electors at a referendum, being a bill that was passed by the Parliament following the holding of the referendum.'' Thus the Parliament retains the ultimate power to decide the fate of a legislative initiative put forward by the people. If the political parties refuse to pass a proposal supported at referendum, it would be done at their own electoral peril. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this Bill carries a considerable onus for the government to respond positively to legislative initiatives. If a legislative initiative were supported by a majority of voters, there would be enormous political pressure on the government to pass such proposals into law. Failure to to so would be pure political arrogance and could lead to an electoral backlash at later elections. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 16 of the bill refers to the costs incurred in the legislative initiative process. 16 (2) provides that registered proponents are responsible for the costs of preparing arguments in favour of a proposal and the registered opponents should prepare the arguments against any proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 16 (1) specifies that registered proponents are also liable for the costs of postage related to the AEC's sampling of signatures to petitions. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 17 of the bill provides for the Governor-General to make regulations for carrying out this Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to require the parliament to enact successful initiatives, it is possible to use the Constitutional Alteration (Electors Initiative) Bill 1989 to petition for alteration of the Constitution such that a legislative initiative provision be incorporated into the document. That is, if the Constitutional Alteration Bill came into effect, electors could petition for alteration of the Constitution so that a legislative initiative is incorporated. </PARA>
<PARA>Modifications of Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Simultaneous with the Constitution Alteration (Electors' Initiative) Bill 1989 and the Legislative Initiative Bill 1989 I am introducing a Schedule of amendments to the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984. The Schedule of modifications requires Commonwealth, State, Territory and Local government expenditure on constitutional initiative and legislative initiative proposals to be equal between the ``yes'' and ``no'' cases for such proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> The Schedule of amendments proposes the insertion of a new Section 11A into the Principal Act which deals with advertising relating to referendums. Clause 11A (1) provides that any spending in favour of, or against, a proposed bill must be approved by the Electoral Commission. A government wishing to expend a given amount of money, must pay at least the same amount into a fund established for the purpose of promoting the other side of the argument. If the Electoral Commission approves the proposed expenditure, an ``approval certificate'' is given to the applicant. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 11A (7) provides that: ``The Electoral Commission, the Commonwealth, a State, a Territory, a local governing body or an elector may institute proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia for an injunction preventing the broadcasting, publishing or printing of an advertisement relating to a referendum in respect of which an approval certificate is required but has not been issued.'' This should prevent the unauthorised expenditure of public monies on the ``yes'' or ``no'' cases until the AEC has issued an approval certificate. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I have introduced two initiate bills which would enable electors to take a more active role in the political and governmental processes. There is no desire to usurp the legitimate role of elected representatives or the Houses of Parliament. The aim is to give democracy in this country a boost. The initiative and referendum processes are entirely compatible with representative democracy. The proposed modifications to the relevant referendum legislation does not remove the right of governments to promote one side of referendum questions. Instead they will ensure that public monies are distributed equally between the ``yes'' and ``no'' case, and not just used to bolster the preferred side of the argument. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend these bills to the Senate and to the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> That the following matter be referred to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for inquiry and report: The operations of the National Safety Council of Australia (NSCA) (Victorian Division) including:</PARA>

Those issues are vitally important. The question of individual justice is as important as the question of national defence, of course. I think it is very important from either perspective that there be no impediment laid before a fair trial, either so much press coverage of what is said in the hearings of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade that the prosecution could not proceed or something that would impede a proper defence. Given that there is some controversy over in camera evidence at the moment, I wanted to raise this with regard to the Committee hearings and ask that the Committee pay some attention to this particular issue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government wishes to oppose Senator Newman's motion moved on behalf of Senator Chaney. Given what Mr Beazley said in the House of Representatives in the last week and a half, it is already clear that there is absolutely no need for an inquiry of this kind. The suggestions that Mr Friedrich, or indeed any employee of the National Safety Council of Australia (NSCA), had access to security documents of any note at all have already been well and truly refuted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot imagine that the word `cover-up' could be applied to anything relating to this. The point to be made is that the NSCA is not a Commonwealth Government body, not one over which we have had control and not one that we have sought to run. That being the case, I cannot understand what Senator Newman is on about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us take the points in the motion one by one. The first matter to be looked into is the contracts the NSCA held with the Department of Defence. The reality is that the contracts that the NSCA held with the Defence Department were small in nature. The other point is that they always involved a payment for service; they involved the service occurring and a payment being made afterwards. That being the case, one wonders why we would want to investigate those contracts. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter to be looked into is the access of NSCA employees to defence force bases. The reality is that every day hundreds of people enter defence establishments. As an example, 1,800 people a day enter Williamtown. One wonders what sort of security ought to have been applied to NSCA employees in particular and how that might have been done. It would not have been possible or desirable to suggest that employees from that organisation in some way should have a security clearance that all these other people did not have. The only way one could have addressed that problem would have been to apply a security clearance procedure to every one of the thousands of people that entered these defence establishments every day. That sort of procedure would be ridiculous, given that the people about whom we are speaking do not get access to classified areas-areas that are considered to be sacrosanct for ordinary mortals. Can one imagine what sort of time, effort and money would have to go into security clearances and screening for all those people? If one acted on the sorts of claims made by Senator Newman and Mr White in the House of Representatives in recent days, that would stop normal work at defence establishments for the next 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter to be referred to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade is:</PARA>
<PARA>the relationship between the NSCA (Victorian Division) and any other Federal Government Department, authority or organisation insofar as such relationship involves activities undertaken by the NSCA which have a bearing on Australian security, defence and foreign affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>I find this extraordinary. One wonders what that can achieve. The answer is naught. The Opposition's attempts on the NSCA in the last 10 days have been a dramatic failure. I know that Senator Newman is accustomed to failure. The reality is that, in spite of question after question in the House of Representatives, absolutely naught occurred. It was a damp squib of a debate in the House of Representatives because the Opposition had absolutely nothing on which to pursue Mr Beazley. The more the Opposition has been routed on this issue, the more we see it making noises and the more we see the debate go on here. I would be much more prepared, as would the Government, to accept the motion moved by Senator Newman if there had been any evidence presented over the last couple of weeks. </PARA>

<PARA> The Department of Defence and the armed forces have acted responsibly in their dealings with the NSCA. So the Commonwealth was never put at risk financially. There is absolutely no evidence to suggest that there have been any security breaches either. So one wonders why we would bother a committee as busy as the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade with a reference that at best can lead nowhere and at worst is a total waste of time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) has done another of these filibuster jobs on this issue. I did not think he was intending to speak in this debate, but as he has I would like to have the opportunity to draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) has been totally unable to answer a question I asked of him last week in some detail about a document called the National Security Plan. It is clear that there is some difficulty within the Attorney-General's Department to brief the Minister for Justice on that matter. I would have thought that that was a very clear indication of issues that are unresolved that need resolving and will not be resolved by internal inquiries. If Ministers of state are not being properly briefed on what has happened in their departments over the last two or three years in relation to this matter, then clearly the Parliament has to inquire.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have grave concerns on a number of issues which have been raised in the debate. The Government is indicating in some sense that it has concerns by the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has chosen to ask seven or eight departments for inquiries to be held. In the light of the confidential arrangements that seem to have existed between some departments and the officers of the National Safety Council of Australia, we do not believe that interdepartmental or governmental inquiries will result in information being made available to the Australian people as to what has gone on. There is much too great an opportunity for hides to be protected and for bucks to be passed. Consequently, we are committed to the view that the only way we will get at the truth of the allegations that have been made over a wide range of issues is for the Parliament to inquire. I would not have thought it would have been worth Senator Richardson's while to waste the time of the Senate by arguing a case that has already been lost. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The International Arbitration Amendment Bill, which the Opposition supports, will amend the Arbitration (Foreign Awards and Agreements) Act 1974. That Act gives effect to the 1958 Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, otherwise known as the New York Convention, which sets down the rules governing the recognition and enforcement in Australia of international arbitral awards and agreements. This Bill provides a legal framework for conduct of international arbitrations in Australia. It does so by bringing into Australian domestic law the model law developed over a period, I understand, of 10 years and adopted by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law in 1985. That was part of that body's efforts to promote the unification of international trade law. The model law establishes a procedural framework for the conduct of international commercial arbitrations. As I indicated, the Opposition supports the Bill because we believe it will enhance Australia's position as a centre for international commercial arbitration. That work in this country is taking place under the auspices of the Australian Centre for International Commercial Arbitration, located in Melbourne, and the Australian Commercial Disputes Centre, located in Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Arbitration, rather than litigation in the courts, seems to have growing support as a method of settling commercial disputes or differences. It is seen by some, certainly in some circumstances, as quicker, less expensive and often in terms more readily understood by the business people concerned with the particular dispute. In other words, it is in their language rather than in the language of the courts. That does not mean that it is always the best option; nevertheless, it is sometimes regarded by the parties to a dispute as the best way of resolving that dispute and then getting on with their business. Often international commercial disputes are complex and can easily get bogged down in the courts for long periods-even after the resolution of preliminary questions of jurisdiction, applicable laws and so forth. The idea of a model law on international commercial arbitration was to provide one framework of rules which could apply for settling disputes wherever the company might be located or based or wherever it might be carrying on business. The certainty and familiarity that can be achieved through one system of model law has wide appeal to those who might make use of that law. </PARA>
<PARA> I use this opportunity to commend the work of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, which has provided a useful tool in this area-as it has in other areas of international trade. It is another one of those United Nations (UN) bodies which are not high profile yet perform, on a day to day basis, a useful function as the world communities interrelate, in this instance in relation to trade. It reminds us that there are so many similar bodies under the auspices of the United Nations in such fields as aviation, shipping, post, telecommunications and so forth. They perform useful functions. They are not in a high profile area, but those functions are absolutely essential in today's world. </PARA>
<PARA> Occasionally it is worth while moving past the criticism that has occurred in the last few years of the higher profile United Nations bodies, such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, and of the United National International Children's Emergency Fund, which may give us feelings of a warm inner glow when we are helping the world's children, to recognise that there are many dozens of other international bodies that have been set up under the auspices of the United Nations and operate out of the limelight to make the world community a closer community. </PARA>
<PARA> The model law has, I understand, been adopted by Canada, Cyprus, and California, although I understand that in Canada it was adopted with some variations. But at least that indicates that we are at the forefront of the nations that are moving to set up this standard legal procedure for international commercial arbitrations. In commerce, as you would be aware, Madam Acting Deputy President, too often we are seen as insular in outlook-and I regret to say that too often we are insular in outlook. This small step of further integrating Australia within the world's commercial community is therefore to be applauded. In a modest way, it can contribute to improving our awful balance of payment position. Also it will help build expertise in Australia in an area that can also be of benefit to us financially in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986 the Government established a working group to examine the model law. That group recommended adoption. That recommendation was considered by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in 1987. So the pace in relation to this particular amendment to the law has been much quicker than most, and I applaud that. I suspect that the credit is probably due to officials; their efforts in moving this project along so expeditiously should also be noted. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be stressed that the model law does not replace the present domestic law on arbitration. It is interesting to recognise that arbitration is becoming more popular. It is used more often now in other fields of domestic dispute-the word `domestic' can be used widely because I am speaking not only of commercial disputes but also of family disputes, for example. There is a move for greater access to arbitration procedures rather than the strictures of the law. Within our domestic law and within the Australian community we have this movement of making arbitration a more popular alternative to the resolution of disputes from the traditional means in the courts. The adoption of this model law for international commercial disputes supplements the existing Australian law. It supplements it by enabling international arbitrations to be conducted in accordance with that model law. </PARA>
<PARA> The model is set out as a schedule to the Bill. If one looks at that schedule, one will soon appreciate that it is to cover a very wide range of commercial activities. A footnote to schedule 1 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The term ``commercial'' should be given a wide interpretation so as to cover matters arising from all relationships of a commercial nature, whether contractual or not. Relationships of a commercial nature include, but are not limited to, the following transactions: any trade transaction for the supply or exchange of goods or services; distribution agreement; commercial representation or agency; factoring; leasing; construction of works; consulting; engineering; licensing; investment; financing; banking; insurance; exploitation agreement or concession; joint venture and other forms of industrial or business co-operation; carriage of goods or passengers by air, sea, rail or road. </PARA>
<PARA>It will readily be appreciated that the schedule adopting the model law is certainly wide in its scope. It is adopted on what is referred to as an opt out basis. In other words, it becomes the law for the settling of international commercial arbitration in Australia unless the parties choose to opt out. As I understand it, it is adopted in full unless the parties choose to opt out of a particular provision. The parties may agree, as set out in the model law, to arbitrate by separate agreement or they may have a clause in their commercial arrangements that provides for arbitration in Australia in accordance with the model law provisions. So, in effect, the parties to a dispute can get to this procedure by either of those two methods. </PARA>
<PARA> The model law covers the sorts of things that one would expect it to cover. In fact, I think those who drafted it should be commended for its brevity. Nevertheless, it has a capacity to deal with the essential matters. It is interesting to note the specific provision that no court shall intervene in the arbitration procedure. Perhaps there is a lesson in that for other domestic tribunals. For example, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal does not seem to be able to take one step without ending up in the courts, not through any choice of that body itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The arbitration agreement is an agreement by the parties to submit to arbitration in all or certain disputes. So the parties have a choice to contract generally to go to arbitration or to seek to have a particular dispute arbitrated. I think that indicates the flexibility of the arrangement. Again, the parties are free to determine the numbers of arbitrators. Of course, there is a provision as to what will occur in the event of the parties being unable to agree. In most circumstances, one could expect the appointment of three arbitrators, one appointed by each of the parties and a third appointed by the first two arbitrators. Provisions obviously are included to deal with challenges to the appointment of particular arbitrators. These are the sorts of provisions that one would expect to be included. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting also to note that the arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction which, again, avoids recourse to the courts. The parties are free to agree on the procedure to be adopted by the arbitral tribunal in conducting its proceedings. So, again, one notes the flexibility that is incorporated within the scheme. Similarly, the parties are free to agree on the place of arbitration. So we do not have the same strict rules that we have in law as to where a matter might be litigated. </PARA>
<PARA> We find also that what we would refer to in law as the pleadings are to be of an informal nature. The parties shall simply state the facts supporting their claim and the points at issue and the relief or remedy sought. Again one sees stressed the informality of the procedure. Again there is a greater flexibility in the provision that the tribunal may hold oral hearings or it may determine to deal with the matter on the basis of the documents that are put before it or on other materials. So it is easy to understand why, in probably a growing number of circumstances, the international business community is choosing recourse to a much more simple approach which it hopes will be less time consuming and less expensive in resolving its disputes. By adopting this model law, Australia is at the forefront of bringing this approach within our domestic legal situation and we in the Opposition are pleased to see that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill goes one step further and provides for some additional optional provisions-what are referred to as the opt-in provisions. If the parties in fact choose, under proposed new section 22 of the Bill, to bring these additional provisions into play, they will be taken into account by the arbitration tribunal. For example, under proposed new section 24 there is a procedure in relation to the consolidation of arbitral proceedings, one that we would expect to be included. Proposed new section 25 deals with interest on the award, and new section 27 deals with costs. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a couple of minor legal matters that I draw to the attention of the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) and he might make reference to them in his reply in due course. I have just been referring to these opt-in provisions. I respectfully suggest that there does seem to be some confusion in the drafting between new section 22, which in effect sets out the right of the parties to opt for these extra provisions, and, say, new section 25, dealing with interest, which says that it will apply unless the parties to the arbitration otherwise provide; similarly with new section 27 in relation to costs, which are said to apply unless the parties otherwise agree. I do not think it is the end of the world, but there does seem to me to be some inconsistency in the drafting approach in relation to new section 22 when read in conjunction with new sections 25 and 27. The Minister might refer to that when he replies. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, in relation to the use of proposed new section 17 concerning the use of extrinsic materials in interpretation, I find it quaint that the model law, as has been determined by the international community, taking into account our Acts Interpretation Act, can now be interpreted by including an interpretation of it which we find in this Government's explanatory memorandum. I wonder whether that is the right way to approach the explanatory memorandum in this instance. We already find that under proposed new section 17 interpretation can take into account matters that had been put before the United Nations in development of the model law, which I find reasonable. But I do think there is an element of confusion. I do not know whether that possibility was addressed when including within our explanatory memorandum an interpretation of each of the provisions of the model law which is then adopted into our domestic interpretation procedure by virtue of our own Acts Interpretation Act. If the Minister's assistants will brief him during this debate, he might make some reference to that in his reply. </PARA>
<PARA> I do have one concern in relation to new section 29, which we raised in the other place. That section allows for the States or a Territory to adopt mirror legislation. It was our view that there could be some confusion in relation to that when looked at from the eyes of an international commercial enterprise. One of the objectives in this whole process, of course, is to provide certainty and clarity for those who may be considering the use of the Australian procedures and our expertise in resolution of these disputes. I note that the Government has listened to the expressions of concern made by the Opposition in the other place and is now proposing to delete new section 29 and that element of confusion, and I am pleased to see that. It might not be readily accepted by the purists in our federal system that we should limit the provision in this way. Nevertheless, when we are looking at our national capacity to encourage this industry to grow in Australia, if we can have a system that leaves out as many areas of confusion as possible it will be to our benefit in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that there is evidence to suggest that Australia can gain significantly from a revenue point of view in relation to this growing area of international commercial arbitration. Figures that were put to the other place by my colleague Mr Rocher indicated that in the United Kingdom, which is a little further advanced in this area than we are, revenue produced by commercial arbitrations is already exceeding some 300 million pounds per year. Located as we are in a major trading region, and a rapidly growing trading region of the world, it is easy for one to perceive the opportunities that will be present in the years ahead. We are pleased that this model law is therefore being incorporated within our domestic law to enable us to take advantage of those opportunities. It is being incorporated into an environment where we can offer to the international community a record of political stability, of judicial stability and, what is important to the companies that take these opportunities, reasonable privacy. Expertise in this area is now developing in this country, and it is our wish that that expertise further develop. We are pleased that this Bill in some way will facilitate the development of that service. As I said at the outset, we support the Bill. We hope it will encourage the development of a thriving international commercial arbitration service within Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As was noted by the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) in his second reading speech, the International Arbitration Amendment Bill is designed to implement the model law on international commercial arbitration of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law. As Senator Hill has already pointed out, the purpose of the model law is to provide a quick and efficient method of arbitration on disputes arising out of international commercial transactions, instead of the parties to disputes having to resort to lengthy and expensive legal proceedings. Resort to arbitration, I think, is the most cost efficient way for disputes to be settled. We believe this model law, developed now over about a 10-year period, provides an appropriate legal framework for the conduct of international arbitration in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The model law was examined by a government working party in 1986, which recommended the adoption of that model law. That then went to the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, which considered the working party's recommendations in 1987, and the model law now comes before us after extensive scrutiny by relevant bodies. When we look at that procedure I think we can be reasonably happy that most of the problems that may arise in this area have been ironed out. However, I wish later to mention a couple. The existing domestic law in arbitration will be supplemented, not replaced, by the model law and by enabling international arbitration to be conducted in accordance with that model law. By amending the existing Arbitration (Foreign Awards and Agreements) Act, which gives effect to the 1958 convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards, relevant Commonwealth laws relating to international arbitration will now be contained within one instrument rather than many, as has been the case to date. </PARA>
<PARA> The model law regulates the arbitral agreement; the composition of the arbitral tribunals; the conduct of the proceedings before those tribunals; the recommendation of recognition and enforcement of awards; and, of course, recourse against those awards. It also complements the United Nations Commission's arbitration rules, which are increasingly being used in the conduct of international ad hoc arbitrations. Apart from other benefits, the Bill will facilitate the process of establishing Australia as a base for the arbitration of international dispute settlements, particularly those arising within our region. I think this ought to be seen as a developing area. We support the Government's interest in and movement towards coming to grips with the problem. We believe that Australia has distinct political advantages as a stable democracy in the region and also having a stable economic environment. We enjoy the trust and confidence of the small and large nations of the Pacific area. All of those advantages taken together have us well placed with regard to developments in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be mentioned that both Sydney and Melbourne already possess appropriate facilities for conducting international arbitrations. The Australian Centre for International Commercial Arbitration in Melbourne and the Australian Commercial Disputes Centre in Sydney are both well regarded bodies. The passage of this Bill will give added impetus to their endeavours. The very high standards of their facilities and their international acceptance will stand them in good stead and give an enhanced role for Australia in the arbitration of international commercial disputes. Tribute should certainly be paid to the Institute of Arbitrators of Australia whose initiative led to the establishment of the Melbourne centre in 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> Other benefits that will flow from this Bill include the ability of parties to choose the model law to apply the conduct of their arbitration or, if they prefer, a model with additions or amendments, subject to agreement to any such amendments. In the absence of an agreement a model law will apply, and in either case the parties have a sure knowledge of the basis on which their particular arbitration will be conducted. There will no longer be the need for costly preliminary research into State and national laws before the conduct of international arbitration in Australia. The award made will almost always be final, except for a narrow range of circumstances where the courts may intervene. Precision and certainty are particularly important in this area and the adoption of the model law will certainly go a long way towards ensuring that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Business Council of Australia, in raising a number of items with us-it, like everybody else in the business community, is very supportive of the moves the Government is making-expressed concern about proposed section 29. Briefly, I am not sure whether it is now necessary to go into that in great detail because the Government has circulated its own amendment to leave out clause 29. I merely put on record that we believed that the argument that the Business Council of Australia, relying on legal advice, raised with us was a valid one, and we had already drafted an amendment along those lines. We would indicate at this point, however, that the amendment circulated by the Government to delete clause 29 is acceptable, although it is not a method that we would have proposed. But we would be happy to pursue the deletion of that along the lines suggested in the Government's circulated amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point raised by the Business Council of Australia and its legal advisers is with regard to failure of the Bill to provide for foreign lawyers to practise in Australia-that is, for foreign entities to have their own foreign representatives in international commercial arbitrations. Again we believe that this is an impediment and that foreign entities could very well be deterred from making use of the facilities already here in Australia or using Australia as a venue if they are denied the right to select their own representatives. Foreign representation is permitted within the United States; we understand Singapore is moving towards that. I would suggest that, if we are to stay current and give the maximum benefit, then we ought to look at a broadening of the exercise. I would hope that the Opposition and the Government view that particular proposal in that light. It would be silly for us to be pursuing what is an excellent Government proposal and positioning ourselves well in the Pacific area with regard to international arbitration, and still have that impediment. I am not making out that it is of a massive kind but it could still be seen as an impediment and one that ought to be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> So we are proposing to continue with the only amendment that we had previously intended to move. In the committee stage I will be moving to allow foreign lawyers to practise in Australia by moving an amendment which, amongst other things, will seek to allow a party, who may appear in person before an arbitral tribunal, to be represented by himself or herself or by a duly qualified practitioner from any legal jurisdiction of that party's choice, or any other person of that party's choice. We believe that opening it up in that way, given the arbitral arrangement that we are dealing with, would be a reasonable proposition. We feel that it will then completely place us in a very good position in this growing region. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Arbitration is becoming increasingly recognised as an efficient and cost-effective method of settling international disputes. I think it is important for Australia to be party to this model. I commend the Government on its decision to introduce the International Arbitration Amendment Bill 1988 and the changes that the Bill embodies. However, at this point I must indicate some reservations I have with what appears to be a good amendment introduced by Senator Macklin. I believe its introduction could create barriers. For example, we must acknowledge the difficulty of foreign representation. I do not think that actually exists under this Bill. If this is going to be an international Bill it has to acknowledge the freedom of movement of people as well as processes. We should acknowledge the introduction of foreign representation, as it is embodied in this amendment. It could raise the problem of solicitors moving across State boundaries. I think that would inevitably follow as a consequence of accepting this recommendation. I would like the assurance of the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) on this issue when he responds to the second reading debate before we proceed to vote on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The major purpose of the International Arbitration Amendment Bill 1988 is to amend the Arbitration (Foreign Awards and Agreements) Act 1974 to implement the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), which is model law on international commercial arbitration. Model law provides an internationally agreed legal framework for the conduct of international arbitrations. The introduction of model law will not replace the present domestic law on arbitration. Rather, it will supplement the existing system by enabling international arbitrations to be conducted in accordance with the model law. This model law covers all those disputes arising under international commercial transactions and includes those international transactions that may arise from trade relationships, from licensing arrangements, from investments, from joint ventures or from any other international commercial arrangement which could arise or exist. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal in the Bill is that by means of this model law disputes arising under any of those international agreements may be arbitrated instead of the parties being obliged to resort to often lengthy and expensive legal proceedings in the courts. Australia as a whole could benefit from the introduction of this Bill as it provides the opportunity for us here in Australia to become established as a respected centre for international arbitration. To date, model law has only been applied and adopted by Canada, Cyprus, the State of California and is under active consideration by the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and New Zealand. Thus, the successful carriage of this Bill would see Australia as the first nation in the Southern Hemisphere to adopt model law. With the Australian Centre for International Commercial Arbitration in Melbourne and the Australian Commercial Disputes Centre in Sydney, we have already established bodies which could provide appropriate centres for the conducting of international disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past few years arbitration has emerged as an important mechanism for settling disputes without going through the procedures of the law courts, which nowadays tends to be expensive, time consuming and not always completely satisfactory in terms of the relevance of the experience and knowledge of the judges. In fact, arbitration has become the preferable means of dispute settlement compared with the alternative of the litigation processes, which often fail to cater for the needs of modern day commerce. Arbitration generally allows disputes to be resolved with minimum cost and delay and with maximum fairness and finality. Litigation, on the other hand, often involves considerable delays and excessive costs. </PARA>
<PARA> One most significant criticism levelled at litigation is that it is fundamentally adversarial in nature, which is often counterproductive in a business environment. Successful business is largely built on an established set of long term relationships. The conflict that is inherent in the litigation process disrupts this business relationship and tends to force the parties apart. In addition, the legal process involved in existing judicial mechanisms of resolution results in the dispute being resolved in a highly formalised and unpredictably lengthy battle. The outcome of the process has been questioned in that a single judge is rarely an expert in the field and as such bases his decision on the evidence to which he has been privy. This may lead to decisions that are faulty because of an inadequacy of the information or perhaps a misinterpretation of the evidence, its ramifications and meaning.</PARA>
<PARA> A further reason that arbitration is preferred is the degree of knowledge of technical elements of products and services which the arbitrators have. If a case were to be presented before a judge, this information would have to be painstakingly extracted in evidence. Judges have many skills, but they do not usually include an intricate knowledge of technology, technical products or the technicalities of international items of trade in goods or trade in services. A highly skilled and competently selected arbitrator will therefore provide an important level of inherent knowledge to the case which will encourage a more efficient resolution of the situation. Arbitration is frequently favoured by all parties involved because it generally has the advantages of speed, lower costs, secrecy and informality. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also economic benefits to Australia in providing international arbitration services in the form suggested by this amendment Bill. An example of the monetary benefits that could accrue to this country by hosting international arbitrations was provided to the members of other place by the honourable member for Curtin, Mr Allan Rocher. He pointed out that `at least $10m would be earned in Sydney and Melbourne by arbitrators in the conduct of cases involving international commercial disputes'. The incorporation of the UNCITRAL rules within the existing Act will make it imperative for businesses involved in international trade to consider arbitration as an alternative to legal proceedings. That must be a measure for the better. In addition to this, Australia has the framework on which to build a strong reputation in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> One reservation that I hold with respect to this Bill is that we must adopt the UNCITRAL model law for international arbitration-and this is the catch-only if we are absolutely certain and convinced that it is in the best interests of our nation as a whole. That could be a weakness, and I would like the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) to consider that point. It must not simply be so that Australia is, once again, recognised as being a signatory to an international agreement. Just because an agreement is international in its application, it does not necessarily follow that it is intrinsically superior to some other mechanism that our own national government has formulated. In fact Australia should be striving to maintain and improve its reputation as having progressive and enlightened legislation in the area of commercial arbitration. The adoption of the model law as proposed by this Bill could only lead to reinforce and enhance our reputation in this field and promote an increased level of expertise in the area. It is my belief that the successful passage of this Bill will bring substantial benefits to the Australian field of arbitration as well as to the economy. With these comments in mind, I support the Bill. Before supporting the amendment moved by Senator Macklin on behalf of the Australian Democrats, I would like there to be extensive consideration of the matters I have raised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The International Arbitration Amendment Bill deals with matters that are far removed from the concerns and interests of most Australians whom we represent in this chamber. Indeed, it is far removed from most of the concerns and experiences of lawyers in this country. I concede that it is a fairly esoteric subject, but it is a subject which should command the attention of this Parliament, as it has commanded the attention of the Government and of international governments. We are considering today the adoption of an international covenant adopted by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, a body known as UNCITRAL. That body, as its name indicates, is concerned with international trade, and this model law deals with the arbitration of international commercial disputes in that trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill is of very limited application in Australia, but nevertheless it deals with most important matters for Australia. We are a great trading nation and Australians become involved as a result of that trade in disputes of an international character, and ultimately those disputes have to be resolved. Unfortunately, they cannot always be resolved by agreement between the parties and their representatives acting in a conciliatory way and endeavouring to settle them, but may end up in litigation-and there lies the problem. It is difficult enough for people litigating in their own courts, but when they face the international element and the possibility of litigation in the courts of other countries and of dealing with those additional problems, the dispute becomes even more difficult to settle, and certainly very much more expensive. Therefore, it is not surprising that UNCITRAL should have given attention to this important question of seeking to resolve these disputes by arbitration rather than leaving the parties to do so by litigation. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it has always been open to the parties to make their own agreements to settle a dispute by arbitration, as parties have done for many decades in domestic disputes. Something that has been overlooked a good deal in the past is that a large number of disputes, whether they are commercial disputes or disputes about other matters, are settled by private agreements to arbitrate either because a contract includes submission to arbitration if there is a dispute instead of the parties going to the court or because the parties, when faced with a dispute, make their own agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, these methods may not always be available in another country or the laws of another country may not be satisfactory to the parties who want to enter into such an agreement. Therefore, very wisely, UNCITRAL has developed this model law. I think this Government and this Parliament would be wise to adopt that law because there can be impediments in existing law, as there may be in Australia, to the parties making the agreement they want to make. In a federation like Australia, where there could be laws on this subject in every State-and indeed are-it is desirable to have a national law on this subject so that, when parties are contemplating having an international arbitration in Australia, they will be able to readily see what the law here is. If we adopt the model law, the UNCITRAL model law, that will have international recognition and parties in other countries may be more prepared to agree to the arbitration occurring in Australia under a well-recognised law and one where there is certainty that the arbitration will not fall foul of some provision in domestic law. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why I think it is important that the Government has proposed an amendment to the existing Bill which qualified that principle. The original Bill certainly admitted or even may have encouraged State laws covering the same area. Lawyers in another country acting for parties would then have to fossick around in all State laws to find out what the actual law that was going to apply would be rather than simply being able to look at one law, the UNCITRAL model law. </PARA>
<PARA> The adoption of this legislation by the Parliament undoubtedly would facilitate agreements being reached to conduct an international commercial arbitration in Australia. That may well be a greater convenience for Australians who are party to these disputes. It may well be that Australia could develop such a reputation in this area that parties to disputes who are not Australians at all may well be interested in having their disputes settled in Australia. When all is said and done, the City, as it is called in London, apart from being a great commercial centre, became a great centre for resolution of commercial disputes through the arbitrations that have been developed in that City over many decades. Today London is still seen as a major place for the settlement of disputes. Indeed, disputes may be agreed to be settled under the laws of that country because of the reputation it has acquired throughout the commercial world. </PARA>
<PARA> So there is the hope that Australia may be able to develop that type of reputation. In our position in the growing Pacific trade community, a rapidly growing community, we have a good opportunity to be seen to be not only a financial centre for a lot of this trade but also a centre for the settlement of disputes in that trade. I think a lot of the thinking behind this legislation is that Australia will develop in that way. The recently retired Chief Justice of New South Wales, Sir Laurence Street, is a very great proponent of this view. In his retirement he is playing a very active role in the attempted development of Australia in his way. I pay tribute to him for it and I hope that his endeavours will be successful. He has written a very interesting article on this very subject which was published in the most recent bulletin of the Business Council of Australia. He has proposed that the legislation should be amended in two ways, one the way which the Government has adopted, to which I have referred, and the other in the way that Senator Macklin has proposed as an amendment. I will deal with that shortly. I would just like to put on record my admiration for the approach to the subject by such a distinguished Australian jurist. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say in passing that we should also recognise that Australian courts have made a great contribution to the resolution of commercial disputes through the ordinary court system. This is a time when there is a great deal of criticism of the Australian court system and the delays in it, which are thought to be greater than they have been in the past, although I wonder whether that is necessarily so. Certainly there is a need for great improvements in the administration of criminal justice in Australia, a need which has been highlighted in recent months by the resignation of former Mr Justice Roden of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. But in the commercial area Australian supreme courts, and particularly the New South Wales Supreme Court, have been at the very forefront of new procedures to meet the needs of the commercial community, the needs for simpler procedures, quicker procedures, better court management and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA> We should also take pride at a national level that the Federal Court of Australia, which was established only 12 years ago by legislation in his Parliament on the initiative of the Fraser Government, not only because of its jurisdiction but also because of the sound administration and leadership particularly of its present Chief Justice, Sir Nigel Bowen, has become a great innovator of new procedures. The easier and quicker settlement of litigation in that court is one of the reasons why it has attracted so much business and has become such a well regarded court in such a short time. Arbitration is seen by businessmen in many cases as a more satisfactory way of resolving their disputes than through the court system. This may be because of the greater delays in the court system, more technical, old-fashioned procedures and so on, but Australian courts have been meeting that criticism. </PARA>
<PARA> There are probably other reasons as well. Some of them have been mentioned by Senator Watson. Arbitration is a more informal process, it is in private and its procedures probably can be tailored more to the needs of the business community. However, in some cases it can be more expensive because one has to pay the costs of the arbitrators as well as the costs of the lawyers. My clients always raised this objection with me when I suggested that they seek arbitration rather than litigation. That is probably misguided because, in many cases, one can resolve a dispute quicker through the arbitration process than through the court process, thereby saving a great deal on costs, certainly of the lawyers. </PARA>
<PARA> Anyway, these questions are pretty far removed from the sorts of litigants who will be taking advantage of this legislation. Litigants taking advantage of this legislation will be large companies that can well afford not only the costs of the lawyers but also the added costs of the arbitrators. From their point of view they will undoubtedly see, for some of the arguments I have given and perhaps many others, reason for resolving disputes by arbitration rather than litigation. This certainly seems to be more attractive in the international arena. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to mention the initiatives that have taken place in Australia to facilitate these matters. I have already mentioned Sir Laurence Street. In 1985 a body known as the Australian Centre for International Commercial Arbitration was established in Melbourne. As the title indicates, this centre is directly concerned with international commercial arbitration. That body is apparently attracting quite a lot of business. It has been referred to in some detail by my colleague the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Neil Brown, in the other place. I do not propose to repeat what he said. It has been a very interesting and very important development. We hope that it will steadily increase its role. Obviously, it provides very valuable facilities for the conduct and organisation of these arbitrations. </PARA>
<PARA> Mention also should be made of the body in Sydney known as the Australian Commercial Disputes Centre. Assumptions have been made in debate in another place that that body will develop a good deal of business of this character. Certainly it is interested in that type of work, namely international commercial arbitration. But, as appears to be the case in Melbourne, the Sydney body has not been established with that particular purpose in mind. The Sydney body is overwhelmingly concerned with the mediation of domestic commercial disputes. I suppose that is where its major work comes from. But it is also concerned with the mediation of international commercial disputes. Although it is not a subject of this legislation, we should bear in mind that in this whole area of alternative dispute resolution-this is a modern phrase covering this area; it is a buzz phrase in the minds of many people-the establishment of a centre such as the Australian Commercial Disputes Centre in Sydney, which is mainly concerned with settling disputes by mediation without recourse to arbitration, much less litigation, is really the way we ought to be going with the settlement of as many disputes as possible. No doubt disputes in this area of international law are settled by having lawyers acting who are prepared to conciliate and who try to reach a settlement for the party rather than encourage it to litigate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The lawyers will be experts and the mediators may be experts as well. That is another advantage of arbitration over litigation-one can get expert arbitrators as well. During this debate we should bear in mind that litigation or arbitration is not the desirable way of settling disputes; it is mediation between the parties themselves, assisted, no doubt, by experts and particularly lawyers. It is very important to encourage the legal profession and the parties themselves to have mediation at the forefront of their minds rather than to resort to litigation or even arbitration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only other point I wish to mention is, as I have indicated, the proposed amendment of Senator Macklin. This was also suggested by Sir Laurence Street in the article to which I referred. It appears to be a sensible proposal. If we are to have a law that encourages people of other countries to make use of Australian facilities-this debate is all about that-we should also allow them to be represented by their own lawyers in those proceedings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sure. I have not looked at the law but I am not sure that Australian legal practitioners Acts-or whatever they are called in any State-would prevent that. Perhaps the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) can give us some views on that. Hopefully he has had somebody look at it. I think that mostly Australian lawyers would be involved. If people take part in international commercial arbitration in Australia I think they would have their own lawyers from their own countries but would want the views of Australian lawyers. They would probably consult lawyers here in the setting up of such a procedure. Australian lawyers in this field are very familiar with international litigation, international arbitration and international business generally. That is why Australian legal firms have branches in other countries. It has become a new and very much more sophisticated area of legal practice. It may be a somewhat academic question-it is pretty unlikely-but it might be the case that a foreign party to an international arbitration in Australia insists on having his or her own lawyer and no Australian lawyer participating in the exercise. Well, so be it. If we encourage this sort of thing to happen in Australia, then there ought to be a provision somewhere to deal with it. In principle, I am in support of what Senator Macklin has suggested but it may not be necessary from either a legal point of view or a practical point of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is odd that the model law is totally silent on the matter. There is a provision in article 24 of the Bill which talks about oral hearings unless the parties agree to the contrary. There are some general statements as to how they are to be conducted. It is very strange. The Bill does not deal with the point. I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on this subject. Perhaps this matter can be pursued further in the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank those honourable senators who have contributed to the debate on this very important matter of attempting to establish in Australia an international commercial arbitration role. It is an excellent proposition that, at a time when Australia is becoming more conscious of its role in the international commercial community, particularly in the Pacific and in the South East Asian region, we should seize the opportunity given by this legislation not only to enhance, in a sense, our reputation as a nation that has a stability, capacity and expertise that can be offered but also to help our balance of payments. One thing we have to become conscious of in Australia is that we are going to provide wealth to this nation, to be distributed equitably of course, by the provision of services to this fast growing region as much as by the provision of commodities and goods of one sort or another. In so far as we can become a centre for the provision of financial, legal and, in this case, arbitration services of particular attraction to the region, then I think we ought to undertake that with alacrity. I am very pleased that this morning it looks as though the Parliament will give its assent to the particular involvement of Australia, which has a well regarded financial and legal capacity to be of service to the international commercial community, to provide that service in this way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is well known, as Senator Durack was mentioning from time to time in his remarks, that the legal system itself is not well suited to resolving these sorts of disputes. Senator Durack placed the emphasis on the need for mediation rather than the adversarial system which prevails in the resolution of legal disputes before ordinary judicial tribunals. He even went further and said that the ideal is a mediated process. But in so far as we have here a proposal to set up an arbitration process, then I believe that that, as has been indicated, deserves and is obtaining the support of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> The particular code which parties can adopt is the international model which is found in the annexure to the International Arbitration Amendment Bill in schedule 1. As honourable senators will know, without more, the parties will have that particular model law at their disposal for the resolution of the dispute between them. They can, of course, opt in by taking up those matters which are contained in division 3 of the Bill. What this does is to provide an attractive situation for parties involved in a commercial dispute because they know that, without more, the model law will apply. There is tremendous flexibility within division 3 for the application of those various provisions dealing with matters such as the consolidation of proceedings, interest up to making of award, interest on debt under award, costs and so on. They can not only take up those optional provisions as a whole but can also vary the mix of those optional provisions. In that way, they can opt out of the opt-in in division 3 in part. This gives tremendous flexibility and makes it even more attractive to those who might wish to take advantage of this law. </PARA>
<PARA> Several matters have been raised, largely in reliance on-though it would have occurred independently to people, of course-a most interesting article by Sir Laurence Street, which has already been alluded to. Sir Laurence has played a key role in keeping up the momentum on the implementation of this proposal. There is obvious merit in making it clear to parties overseas that they need to look only to one statute in order to find out which law will apply. In Australia, we are familiar with the way that the federal system works, and particularly in this chamber, where we have experience with such remarkable creatures as the Ministerial Council on Companies and Securities and the various ways in which the laws around the Commonwealth are brought into harmony in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> We know how the federal system works and how various devices enable mirror legislation, complementary legislation, virtually identical legislation, to apply Australia-wide, though each of the parliaments plays a role. That is terribly confusing to people overseas, particularly to those who have no familiarity with a federal system. Therefore, as will become clear when I move the amendment, the deletion of proposed section 29 will make it attractive and accessible for overseas parties to come to Australia knowing that they have to pick up only one statute, available from the Commonwealth Printer, and that sets out the situation for them. That is very sensible, and I am pleased that agreement has already been signalled in the second reading debate. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as representation in these arbitral proceedings is concerned, as Senator Durack has said, it is not clear whether the various legal practitioners Acts in the different jurisdictions would preclude a party to one of these international commercial arbitrations from selecting a legal practitioner of his or her choice from outside the Australian jurisdiction, or even from another Australian jurisdiction, as alluded to by Senator Watson-for example, if the proceedings were being conducted in Sydney and someone from Melbourne were selected to come up. The legal practitioners Acts are unclear, although it is thought on the whole that they do not preclude the selection of a lawyer or non-lawyer to be the representative in these particular proceedings, whereas normally, of course, the closed shop provisions of the legal practitioners Acts would exclude a lawyer from another jurisdiction from appearing before a properly constituted judicial tribunal in that particular jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> My personal view is that there is merit in Senator Macklin's proposal. He is echoing in that proposal the article mentioned by Senator Durack in which Sir Laurence Street also puts forward this view. Nevertheless, because the various State Attorneys and the Northern Territory Attorney are concerned that this be looked at more closely in relation to their legal practitioners Acts, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General has this matter on its agenda at the moment. Therefore the Commonwealth would prefer not to support this amendment. As I say, my personal view is that, in trying to attract this business to Australia--</PARA>

<PARA>I listened to the summing up of the second reading debate by the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate). I presume that his position is that, by and large, his personal view accords with this amendment, but that the Attorneys-General want to look at their own laws. I am not at all sure what will occur when they look at their own laws. One of the things they could do if their laws do not allow this type of representation-I think everybody has expressed a view that it is desirable-is to amend them. Alternatively, if their laws are silent on the matter, they could leave them alone. It seems to me that certainty in this area is something that we ought to be signalling. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the model law. When I looked at it I thought of a number of instances, but one which seems to be pertinent to this matter is article 22 relating to languages. It states that parties are free to agree on any language to be used. I am trying to think where this may be used. Certainly, one area in which I think it is likely to be used is in our relationships with countries in our region, especially bearing in mind our growing trade with China. It may very well be that one would need to seek an expert, and that expert may wish to operate in the Chinese language. After all, it is the language of a large number of people on this planet. We should not be such Anglophiles as to think that everybody has to use the English language. What we are about is an international exercise. It would be very odd if we did not want to signal to people that they can use our venues and operate with their own representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the paper by Sir Laurence Street. I think he made a very good point on page 5 of that document, where he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Foreign entities will need to be assured of their right to select their representatives and if this is not permitted they will be deterred from choosing Australian venues. Foreign representation is allowed, for example, in the USA, Hong Kong and British Columbia international commercial arbitrations. The law in Singapore is likely to be changed quickly to permit foreign representation. These are major competitors in the Pacific field and Australia cannot afford to carry this handicap. </PARA>
<PARA>I concur. We are concerned not only with international arbitration but also in a very real sense with a commercial operation. I am not at all sure that we should seek to handicap Australia in what will be a very competitive, growing field. It is one in which we are already operating, and this law aims to give us a clear and precise position. It seems to me to be silly to leave aside this one point. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to make a big deal of it. It is not necessarily a major point, but it is a point that could easily be made certain by the adoption of the amendment which I have moved. It is a clear and precise position that, as it were, the persons engaged in this arbitration may select who they like to represent them at those arbitrations. I would think it very odd if, in seeking to operate in the international field, we sought to circumscribe such people by national law. It would be even odder if they felt themselves circumscribed by State laws. We are engaged in an international exercise. We are attempting to attract-let us be honest about it-international business to that arbitration area. </PARA>

We were provided with advice that we would need to do two things in relation to this legislation. One related to the items raised by Sir Laurence Street. If one looks at the model law, one will see that we have adopted items which use the phraseology of the model law with regard to the operation of documents. We have tended to use the phraseology of the model law rather than that which Sir Laurence Street used, which in part comes from uniform commercial arbitration Acts, but which also seems to reflect the way in which he feels that law should be phrased. Basically, the advice given to us was that this way of going about it would be more in keeping with the model law that is already in place. We felt that that was a persuasive argument for the adoption of this method of phrasing the amendment that is before us. I recommend that we go ahead. It does not seem to me that waiting for the various Attorneys-General to act will actually achieve anything, other than to leave the situation in limbo.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I urge honourable senators to think of the type of constraints that operate on this chamber. It may be very well to say, `We can bring it back for amendment'. I urge honourable senators, if they think that is an easy exercise, to look at the number of Bills already on the Notice Paper. The ability of the Senate actually to reconsider this matter is restricted. I do not think the matter will be seen as such a major item-and I am not trying to make it into a major item-that it will take precedence over so many other Bills which are currently on the Notice Paper. Therefore, I can see that it could be quite some time before we are able to return to this matter. In that time the impetus and the thrust into this area could be lost. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge honourable senators to think of the commercial aspects of this operation. To take it at the flood, as it were, is what we really need to do. We ought to build on this. Obviously, a great deal of international attention will be drawn to the fact that we have passed this law. It provides the opportunities. It subscribes to the model law. We are there. We are in the field. We are now working. We want this to occur in Australia. It will then be seen that as a result of this debate we have decided to leave in limbo this whole business of whether they can bring their own representatives along. I suppose, in a way, even moving this amendment will make the situation worse if we fail to pass it because we now have signalled that we are happy to leave it in limbo. I do not think we should. I do not think it trespasses in any way on the rights of the States in terms of the points raised by Senator Watson. We are not necessarily looking at lawyers; we may be looking at other experts. To take Senator Durack's point about the culture of mediation, we may be looking at experts in the area of bringing that about. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge honourable senators to consider this so that we can wrap up this exercise here and allow the two centres currently operating in Sydney and Melbourne to get on with the business of attracting international mediation to Australia so that we can be put on the map in one move rather than get there in dribs and drabs and possibly lose some of that impetus that is currently available by the passage of this legislation. </PARA>

We are also a little disappointed that the Government, although it has had the article that has been referred to in debate earlier, by Sir Laurence Street which sets out, in his view, the necessity for a provision of this nature, obviously has not directed itself to that question, and that the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) can simply come in here and do no more than to say that he believes the general view is that the State legal practitioners Acts would not inhibit movement across States and appearances in these commercial arbitrations. We would have thought the Minister would be able to tell us that this matter had been researched and that he was able either to indicate that he was in agreement with the argument that Sir Laurence has put or that he opposed it and for what reason. Rather, it seems, from what he has said to us, that he has some sympathy with what Sir Laurence put but that he would like some more time to think about it and to go back to the State Attorneys-General. Regrettably, practice would indicate that that can take months if not years. It seems to us that the impetus and the opportunity would be lost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are supporting the amendment because we think it is consistent with the scheme, and that is that international commercial arbitrations will take place in various countries with representatives brought from other countries. It seems to us that a party from elsewhere should be entitled to bring their own representation as it seems consistent with the whole of this approach-as a party which might have its head office in Adelaide should be entitled to bring its legal practitioner from South Australia to an arbitration that might take place in Sydney. We wonder whether the legal practitioners Acts do inhibit it. If there is any doubt we think that clarity is the better option. As I have said, we will support the amendment. We are comforted in supporting it by the fact that someone of the eminence of Sir Laurence Street believes that it is a necessary provision to be included within this Bill. Therefore, Senator Macklin's amendment will have the support of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Copyright Amendment Bill 1988 and the Circuit Layouts Bill 1988. The Opposition will support both Bills, but we will be moving an important amendment at the second reading stage of the Copyright Amendment Bill. We have a number of amendments to move at the committee stage, which I will touch upon in the course of this speech to give notice and to enable some further consideration and negotiation to take place on those amendments before the committee stage of the Bill is reached. As I understand the position, we are hoping to complete the second reading stage of this Bill today; the committee debate will take place immediately upon our return after the fortnight's break. I think that is a sensible approach because of the complex amendments that will be moved at the committee stage. This will give the Government, the Australian Democrats and ourselves time to negotiate. All parties have indicated a willingness to do that in an effort to clarify the areas in dispute and to see what can be resolved. It will also enable an orderly committee debate to take place. Hopefully, that debate will take up a minimum amount of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Copyright Amendment Bill makes important changes to the Copyright Act 1968 and the law on copyright. In general terms, the changes are: to put a royalty on blank audio tapes used for home recording-part Vc; to protect performers from unauthorised recording or broadcasting of their live performances-part XIa; to enable educational institutions to videotape television programs-part Va; to streamline the existing licences of educational institutions to photocopy educational material and for institutions assisting the handicapped to make talking books and other useful materials-part Vb; to make some changes to the law on the protection of industrial articles covered by clauses 9 and 10, which affect sections 74, 75 and 77 of the existing Act; and to streamline the statutory licence for record manufacture. So it can be seen that this Bill covers a range of matters and that not surprisingly, as is the nature of copyright and other laws which protect intellectual property, it is really quite complex. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to deal briefly with each of those principal matters that are addressed by the Bill. The first matter I want to refer to is the blank tape royalty scheme for home taping. The Bill proposes a royalty to be paid on blank recording tapes, known popularly as cassettes. The Liberal and National parties support this proposal. I remind the Senate that our arts policy provides that we `support . . . the introduction of royalty payments on blank tapes used for sound recording . . .'. I commend our spokesman, Senator Puplick, who is present in the chamber and who will be participating in this debate, for the leadership that he is showing in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Home taping from the radio, records and other tapes is, as we all know, widespread. It is a breach of copyright but it is difficult to prevent. The result is that those whose creative endeavours are put into a work, such as composers, as well as the publishing houses and the recording companies, are having their work reproduced without receiving any compensation. After consultation, this Bill sets out a scheme to accommodate the concerns of both consumers and copyright owners. `Under the scheme, consumers will be able to continue home taping of recordings directly or off air for private and domestic use without infringement of copyright. In return, owners of copyright in the recordings will receive a royalty levied on blank recording tapes. </PARA>
<PARA> The royalty will be payable only on audio tapes with a playing time of more than 30 minutes and will be calculated by reference to the length of playing time. The royalty will be determined by the Copyright Tribunal. As I understand it, the Attorney-General's Department expects the royalties to be between 20c and 50c a tape. But the industry association expects it to be higher, perhaps up to $1 a tape. This is a matter that is obviously yet to be resolved. The royalty will be paid by the first seller of the tape-that is, the importer or manufacturer. Copyright owners will then be paid a share of the royalties if they are members of the single authorised collecting society to which the royalties will be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> Copyright owners who will benefit from the scheme include composers, lyricists and authors as well as the music publishing companies and record producers. I am advised that the recording companies have agreed that a substantial share of the royalty will be passed on to performers under their contracts. This will ordinarily amount to one-third of royalties collected by the society. I suspect that this will be a matter that my colleague, Senator Puplick, will want to develop further in his contribution to this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme does not apply to video taping of television programs and videotapes. Fifteen per cent of the royalty will go to those in the Australian music industry most in need of assistance and part will go to the Australian Contemporary Music Development Co. which was recently established by the Government to foster Australian contemporary music and young up-and-coming Australian musicians. The royalty will be payable on all blank tapes ordinarily used for recording audio materials, including digital audio tapes. </PARA>
<PARA> Institutional users-for example, schools and institutions for the blind-will be able to purchase tapes free from the royalty. Individuals or organisations which buy tapes and which do not intend to use them to record copyright material will be able to obtain a refund of the royalty if they make a statutory declaration that the tape will not be used to record a copyright sound recording. </PARA>
<PARA> The royalty will be collected for the benefit only of owners of Australian audio copyright materials and owners of audio copyright materials in countries which have similar schemes which provide comparable benefits to Australian owners. This will ensure that Australia adheres to the spirit of the relevant international copyright conventions without providing a windfall to foreign owners in countries which have not addressed the problem of home taping. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Opposition supports the proposal for a royalty on blank audio tapes to provide compensation for owners of copyright whose material is presently being illegally copied. However, we have some concerns about aspects of the scheme and about the mechanism set out in the Bill to implement these changes. For this reason, in respect of the Copyright Amendment Bill, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of the motion, add `, but the Senate is of the opinion that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) upon the commencement of part Vc of the Bill, or as soon as thereafter as may be practicable, the Government should refer the following matters to the Copyright Tribunal for inquiry and report:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the extent to which audio tapes purchased in Australia are purchased with the intention of using them to record copyright material and non-copyright material respectively;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) whether the blank tape royalty scheme set out in part Vc of the Bill is the most practical means of implementing a blank tape royalty scheme;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) whether the blank tape royalty scheme set out in part Vc of the Bill is the most effective blank tape royalty scheme for providing compensation to Australian performers whose material is recorded domestically on audio tapes in breach of copyright;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) whether the proposal in proposed subsection 135zzs (3) of the Bill for a statutory declaration entitling the purchaser of a blank audio tape to a refund of the royalty paid on that tape is the most effective means of effecting a refund or waiver of the royalty when the tape is not used for recording copyright material; and</PARA>
<PARA> (v) whether the proposal in proposed subsection 135zzu (3) for the rules of the collecting society to make provision for the distribution of amounts collected by it is adequate to ensure that a reasonable proportion of the amounts collected is passed on or distributed to those whose own work has contributed to the making of the eligible sound recording or eligible work; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) upon receipt of the report of the Copyright Tribunal on these matters, the Government should propose such amendments to the Copyright Act as may be necessary or desirable'. </PARA>
<PARA>Although the amendment makes it plain that we are not opposing the second reading, we believe it also indicates that there is a real need to have a close examination of the mechanics of this scheme, and we believe that this examination should be conducted by the Copyright Tribunal. In the first place, the amendment raises the question of just what proportion of tapes purchased in Australia are purchased with the intention of using them to record copyright material and what proportion are purchased with the intention of using them to record non-copyright material. Secondly, the amendment also expresses our concern that the mechanics of the scheme, as set out in the Bill, may not be the best way of channelling part of the royalty money to the musicians, artists and others who really need it and are entitled to it. The Copyright Tribunal will be able to tell us whether this is the best way of spreading the royalty moneys around. Likewise, there is clearly a case for an inquiry into the curious and cumbersome method of obtaining a rebate or refund of the royalty. The Bill provides that if the purchaser of a tape maintains that he does not intend to use the tape to record copyright material, he must make a statutory declaration to that effect and send it to the collecting society to obtain a refund. This is obviously an extremely cumbersome procedure and the Copyright Tribunal should examine it to see whether it is the most effective means of having the refund made. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there is the wider question of whether the scheme set out in the Bill is the most effective blank tape royalty scheme for providing compensation to Australian performers. As I have indicated, that is also covered by our amendment and the Copyright Tribunal should examine it. All of the matters, as I have said, are covered within this amendment and we therefore put to the Senate that the Copyright Tribunal should examine the questions we have raised. I hope that that amendment will be supported. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have some more detailed amendments in relation to this scheme which we will be putting at the committee stage. One amendment will define the prescribed organisations which will not have to pay the royalty. A second amendment will require the Attorney-General to table the annual report from the collecting society on the operation of the scheme. I will speak further to those amendments in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area covered by the Bill, which I now wish to deal with, is that of performers' protection. At the moment performers such as actors, singers, musicians, puppeteers, dancers and variety artists have little legal control over the illegal recording of their performances. Technological developments have created effective means of unauthorised commercial use of performances, namely, recording, broadcasting and diffusion by cable. The Copyright Law Review Committee has recommended that performers be given protection from this commercial exploitation of their live performances. The Government's solution is to give the performers not copyright protection, which is a property right, but a civil right of action to sue for damages for any unauthorised recording or broadcast of their performance. The new provision will provide performers with greater bargaining power when negotiating contracts. This proposal is again consistent with the coalition parties' arts policy, and we therefore support it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for a series of criminal offences for the illegal recording of performances, punishable by a fine, and for copying recordings or trading in them, punishable by a fine or imprisonment. Whilst I will not use this opportunity to go through each of those offences, it is worth noting at this second reading stage that they are numerous and that the penalties imposed are considerable, with fines up to $250,000 and, in some instances, maximum imprisonment terms of up to five years. I would have thought that would be a dissuasive influence upon someone who wishes improperly to use the creative endeavours of those performers. </PARA>
<PARA> The third matter I wish to deal with at this stage is that of copying. The Bill establishes several statutory licensing schemes to provide a mechanism whereby the interests of copyright owners will be balanced against the interests of educators who need to copy educational material in the most efficient manner possible. The first licence is to be a statutory licence for audio-visual copying by educational institutions. The Bill establishes a statutory licensing scheme which will allow educational institutions and institutions assisting handicapped persons to make copies of television programs in return for payment to the copyright owners. Off air copying of television programs by educational institutions is an infringement of copyright, unless permission is obtained from the copyright owners. To avoid breaching copyright, separate permission is presently required for copying the script, the sound recording, the background music, the film and the broadcast itself. The scheme introduced by the Bill follows recommendations in the 1986 report of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts on audio visual copying by educational institutions. Under the licence proposed by the Bill, educational institutions will be able to make off air copies of television programs for educational purposes. Copyright owners will be able to claim payment for the copying of their material through a single collecting society approved by the Attorney-General. The payment will be as agreed between the parties or, in the absence of agreement, as decided by the Copyright Tribunal. Institutions will be able to elect to pay for the right to copy either by an amount per student or according to actual material copied, based on full record keeping. </PARA>
<PARA> The second scheme is a statutory licence for photocopying by educational institutions. The Bill revises the existing educational photocopying scheme. I think it is widely accepted that the present scheme is cumbersome and costly because of its complex record keeping requirements. The revised scheme is based largely on voluntary agreements already entered into between Copyright Agency Ltd-the authors and publishers collecting society-and a substantial number of educational institutions throughout Australia. Cooperation in this regard has largely been achieved by abandoning the record keeping requirements of the present scheme, under which payments are required for actual copying. Instead, payment is being made on the basis of agreed sampling schemes whereby estimates can be made of the amount of copying and payment made on a per student basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments facilitate these voluntary arrangements and ensure that they can operate effectively under the legislation. The revised photocopying scheme will adopt the flexibility of the television copying scheme. It applies to literary, academic, musical and artistic works. There will be a collecting society representative of copyright owners; schools may elect to pay for copying on a per student basis or, as at present, by full record keeping, with records sent to the collecting society. This will avoid copyright owners having to carry out time consuming and costly record inspections at the thousands of schools spread around the country. This revised scheme will, in practice, be much simpler to comply with and it will substantially improve the means of remunerating copyright owners for the use of their copyright materials. The Bill also includes new provisions which will streamline copying by institutions assisting handicapped readers and intellectually handicapped persons. We support this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> The next area of change is the copyright designs interaction, which is a highly complex matter. The Bill seeks to update-or at least that is the word used in the second reading speech of the Minister for Local Government (Senator Reynolds)-the protection given to artistic works that are either registered as designs under the Designs Act 1906 or used industrially without registration. We have also been told by the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) that for many reasons industrial designs are not appropriate to be protected by the Copyright Act and that there is at present a lot of overlap which is leading to confusion. We accept that that confusion exists. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1973 the Designs Law Review Committee report on the law relating to designs recommended that designs be protected under the Designs Act and not under the Copyright Act. The Bill amends the Copyright Act to this effect. However, we are concerned with the way in which the Bill is drafted. Its result will be that some designs will not be protected either by copyright or by the Designs Act. The result of that will be that Australian entrepreneurs will not invest in research and development resulting in industrial designs if their designs will be able to be pirated with immunity. That is an undesirable result. To prevent that undesirable result from happening we will propose amendments at the committee stage. These are amendments which were moved in the other place. Whilst I do not wish to deal with them in detail now, they would delay the commencement of this part of the Copyright Act until the Designs Act has been amended so that `corresponding designs', as they are called, can be registered under the Designs Act. Again we hope that we will receive support from at least the Australian Democrats in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> The next subject matter to be dealt with under the Bill is that of statutory licences for record manufacture. The Copyright Act presently contains a statutory licence for the manufacture of recordings of musical works. The relevant provisions specify conditions upon which the licence operates and a mechanism for changing the rate of royalty payable to music copyright owners. This mechanism gives the power to the Attorney-General to determine that the current rate is inequitable. There is then an inquiry and report made by the Copyright Tribunal. The Government considers that the preliminary requirement for the Attorney-General to determine the current royalty rate to be inequitable is an undesirable and inappropriate role for government. Accordingly, the Copyright Amendment Bill will introduce a simplified scheme based solely on a Copyright Tribunal determination of the rate in the absence of agreement, which will be consistent with other schemes in the Act-for example, the compulsory licence for broadcasting music. Such a scheme has industry support and will remove unnecessary government involvement in the industry. We also support this change. </PARA>
<PARA> The Circuit Layouts Bill 1988 will protect computer chip layouts from unfair copying. The Australian computer chip industry is small but is important and growing. Australian chips enable bionic ears and heart pacemakers to work, detect messages from space and from the ocean, and convert sunlight to power. Our specialised products have found valuable markets overseas. The Circuit Layouts Bill repeals inappropriate and uncertain Copyright Act and Designs Act protection and provides protection for original chip layouts along the lines of the laws passed recently in the United States, Japan, Scandinavia and the European Community countries. The Bill is consistent with the World Intellectual Property Organisation's draft treaty on the protection of intellectual property in respect of integrated circuits. Enactment of the Circuit Layouts Bill is wanted by the industry and is needed to obtain permanent protection for Australian circuit layouts in the United States and European markets. The Bill creates modified copyright protection. It gives the creator of an original chip layout the exclusive right to copy the layout, to make a chip in accordance with the layout and to make the first commercial exploitation of the layout or a chip made in accordance with it. The rights arise automatically. In our opinion this is a simple low cost form of protection involving no red tape. It is welcomed by the industry and therefore has our support. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, we will be moving a number of amendments in the committee stage. I have already mentioned that we will be moving amendments in relation to the royalty on blank audio tapes to define the described exempt parties, and also to require the lodging of an annual report. We will also be moving amendments to allow media monitoring companies to copy and provide copies of radio and television broadcasts to people or organisations mentioned in or affected by the broadcast and to allow news clipping services a similar right without these being a breach of copyright. We will be moving amendments to restore the pre-existing right of educational institutions to photocopy, without being required to pay royalties, copies of periodical articles, anthologies and works, where they are for external students. We will be moving an amendment to make it an entitlement of performers to insist on their authority being given before there is a use made of a recording of their performance, prospective only and not retrospective. I think the Government has put before us an amendment indicating that it has accepted our representations in this regard. I am pleased to note that it has recognised the deficiency in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> We will move an amendment to allow news or current affairs programs to be rebroadcast for criticism or review without making this a performance and therefore requiring the authority of performers to be given. In other words, we extend it to cover current affairs programs, which we think is important. We will move an amendment to provide that a recording is not authorised and thereby putting the recorder at risk of being sued by the performer if it is made for use in a later soundtrack. I understand that the Government also has some amendments in this regard which we will now consider in detail to see whether they cover the concerns we have expressed. We will move amendments which have been proposed by the Australian Vice-Chancellors and Directors and Principals in Advanced Education to achieve the copying of radio broadcasts and the copying of published audiovisual material upon payment of a fee. It will provide also for fair dealing provisions in relation to audio-visual materials. That is in relation to materials used in that way by educational institutions. It is in addition to external students. </PARA>
<PARA> That covers all our amendments which we intend to move. I give the Senate this preview of our committee stage amendments and hope that the negotiating process which will take place over the next two weeks will be fruitful. We basically support the Bill and the scheme of the Bill and hope that in the end it will come into effect, but with the improvements we have outlined. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The Copyright Amendment Bill 1988 is a major and worthwhile contribution to copyright law reform. The changes that are incorporated in this Bill come after many years of consultations, reviews, inquiries and reports. Essentially, this is the third stage of the Government's initiatives in this area. We dealt with this Government's amendments in 1984 on works for invisible computer memory and in 1986 on the anti-piracy provisions and allowing disabled people greater access to copyright material. The basis of copyright law is to balance the rights of the owners to copyright with the legitimate needs of various groups in the community to use those materials. In particular, the most contentious area relates to educational institutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have to accept that the review and monitoring of copyright law can be nothing other than an ongoing process. It is an area which is particularly fraught with problems. Often the items raised by Senator Hill, in terms of the Opposition's amendments, in almost every case represent competing principles, not just a black and white context, but where principles and rights of various groups and individuals are in competition. </PARA>
<PARA> I was invited by a reporter yesterday to say that the Government had done a bad job with this legislation because there were to be amendments. I rejected that on the basis that I do not believe that that would assist in any rational discussion of this area. It is a difficult area; it is fraught with problems. In terms of the Bill itself, where we may differ from the Government in almost every case it is a matter of giving more weight to one particular principle against one which the Government itself has adopted. Those are matters for judgment, and one hopes that, along with the point raised by Senator Hill, the discussions we shall have on areas that need to be resolved might be conducted in a helpful way. </PARA>
<PARA> Among the major areas, one item that has proved quite contentious is the interaction between the copyright legislation and design protection. Here we are up against one of the areas that I have already mentioned. At the moment the current law seeks to reflect the policy adopted by the Government of distinguishing between different uses of artistic works. For example, where an artistic work, say a drawing, is used as a design for mass production, it is registrable under the Designs Act and is protected under that Act. If the same drawing is used as an illustration in a book, it is then an art work and is protected under the Copyright Act. That drawing may be used both by the designer and in a book, which can give rise to some significant problems. But by and large the copyright system is looking at the artistic works and the Designs Act is looking at designs, even for artistic works such as pottery, which may be turned into a dinner set, or a particular design may be used in relation to a car. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an attempt to make a more fundamental distinction, and that is between the copyright protection for intellectual property and the Designs Act for industrial property. I am not at all sure that that holds up, particularly in regard to some of the industrial areas, but that distinction is also often drawn. Copyright protection is automatic, whereas design protection is not. Copyright protection is generally based on the creator's life span, whereas design protection requires generally a much shorter level-depending on whether the artist is quite old-of protection, usually a maximum in most jurisdictions of around 16 years. What the Designs Act is attempting to do is to give designers a lead start in production and in the field. Generally that is sufficient to protect their work, though not in all cases. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of this Act there is some overlap and it is not the only source. Section 77 is probably the most difficult area and provides that where work used as a design is industrially applied, the artistic work loses copyright protection in relation to use on the type of article to which it has been applied. Hence, to have protection, registration under the Designs Act is absolutely essential. This may not be possible once the industrial application has taken place and the artistic work could be left unprotected. The present system does not seem to be satisfactory to protect adequately the work of artists and of crafts people. </PARA>
<PARA> The scope of section 77 has been long debated, and if honourable senators wish to verify that they only have to look at the vast amount of paperwork which has flowed around since this Bill hit the table. The difficulty is that a large range of artists seem to be quite oblivious to the Designs Act requirements and to the fact that their copyright may have left them, may have been dissolved, since it should be dealt with under the Designs Act, and where no move has been made under that Act for registration. It is worth noting in advance in regard to the proposed amendments that Australia has obligations under international conventions. The International Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property are two to which it is required we give adherence. The Bill before the Senate addresses the question of whether copyright protection should be available for artistic works industrially applied. Artists and crafts people say yes and industry says no. In fact, one commentator put the matter graphically by saying, `T shirts are in and exhaust pipes are out'. I thought that was an interesting way, if not too accurate, of trying to draw that type of distinction. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is looking at the changes in this area of overlap and the amendments allow for a review by the Attorney-General's Department in its discussion paper dealing with copyright protection for artistic works applied industrially, which was issued a couple of years ago. The new scheme will work in the following way. Artistic works that are two-dimensional will have copyright protection available. Conversely, the Bill will abolish copyright protection for industrial designs which, for technical reasons, are presently incapable of registration under the Designs Act. We believe that visual artists and crafts people will now, under these amendments, be able to rely on adequate copyright protection. The problem of losing copyright will no longer apply. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the situation on the industrial side is not quite so happy. There will no longer be any protection under copyright where the design is unregistrable. If it is registrable, that registration will secure protection. A number of sections of industry have reacted adversely to the proposition in this legislation. They say that it will be an obvious disincentive to research and development in Australia. They ask the question, not unnaturally, why any company should spend money on research and development of these products if the design is not registrable under the Designs Act. Competitors could, with impunity, copy those products and not have to spend any money on research and development, and hence would be able to sell in the market-place at a far lower cost, their not having to put an element for research and development into the final selling price. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the objections about loss of protection, there is also a dispute about the actual implications of the changes. I do not want to get involved in that aspect, but the dispute involves the Attorney-General's Department and the Law Council of Australia. I do not wish to wander into an area where the lawyers have been at work. If that dispute continues, obviously its final resolution will take place in the courts. On top of all this is the question whether industrial designs should be protected. The Attorney-General's Department takes the view that protection for commonplace manufactured articles could well hinder innovation in manufacturing. Industry, as I have said, would take the opposite view. </PARA>
<PARA> I have given the Senate a potted version of where we are in this matter. We intend to look at amendments in this area. However, it is a difficult area to consider, particularly when one looks at clauses 9 and 10. We could, for example, look at an amendment to clause 9, and consider other action on clause 10-possibly defeating it and referring it to a committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Is he aware that major banks have now been forced to raise both their prime lending rates and their overdraft rates to 18.75 per cent, representing an increase in the case of prime rates of 5.5 percentage points or 40 per cent over the past 12 months? Does he agree that overdrafts are the lifeblood of small businesses, including farming, and that this sort of escalation is forcing many to the verge of bankruptcy? What impact is the maintenance of this high interest rate regime likely to have on such businesses, which rely on bank overdrafts as a major source of their finance?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not accept the terminology used in Senator Lewis's question, namely, that the banks have been forced to raise their interest rates, but I do accept that, for a variety of reasons, including excess demand in the economy, interest rates are high. Of course, no government has an interest in having interest rates as high as they are. Any government-any sensible government-will seek to have those--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sensible government. Such governments will seek to have interest rates down as soon as possible. I certainly agree that the high overdraft rate has an impact on small businesses but the impact is less, I think, than it might have been in the high interest rate regime a few years ago because of the capacity of the banking sector to make accommodations of one kind or another with businesses that they were not prepared to make in a regulated market and when there were very few major banks here. Apart from saying those things, I just repeat that of course the Government is concerned about high interest rates but we are also concerned about maintaining a steady growth in the economy and other things which are important to a vast majority of the people.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans. Can the Minister confirm that recently a Burmese student leader, Mr Min Ko Naing, has been arrested by the Burmese military government? If so, can the Minister indicate whether the Australian Government has made or will make representations to the Burmese Government for his immediate release? Further, can the Minister inform the Senate of what efforts have been made by the Australian Government to encourage the Burmese Government to establish a timetable for the holding of free and fair elections in Burma, which would lead to the establishment of parliamentary democracy?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1410" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can confirm the arrest by Burmese authorities on 23 March of Min Ko Naing, who is Chairman of the All Burma Students Union known as Bakatha, for alleged violations of the State Law and Order Restoration Council's orders and for planning to create disturbances on 27 March, which is the Burmese Armed Forces Day. Large numbers of other students are also understood to have been arrested around this time in Rangoon and Mandalay. The Australian Embassy in Rangoon has been instructed to make urgent representations seeking their release.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the larger political electoral environment, the Australian Government has been following political developments in Burma closely. We very much welcome the announcement by the Burmese authorities at the time of Senator Schacht's visit to that country of the timetable for holding general elections in April or May of 1990. We were prominent last August and September in calling on the Burmese authorities to accede to the widespread popular desire for democracy and political and economic reform. We are certainly convinced that holding free and fair elections is essential to resolving the crisis facing the country and opening the way for much needed national reconciliation and reconstruction. Clearly, the arrest of important student leaders such as Min Ko Naing and the continuing restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly in Burma can only set back the return to democracy. We nevertheless hope that the continued preparations for general elections will lead to early progress in establishing constitutional legal guarantees for the protection of human rights.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to a claim on page 15 in Time magazine of 20 March 1989 that, in relation to Australian aviation:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . cockpit fire extinguishers for one engine on a big twin-engine jet were known by the airline to be out of action for a month but nothing was done until the fault was discovered by surveyors.</PARA>
<PARA>What could be the consequences of these extinguishers being inoperative? Is the claim in Time correct? If so, what airline was involved and what were the circumstances surrounding the incident?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1411" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to this matter I am advised that wiring problems were discovered in connection with fire extinguisher bottles in some Boeing 757, 767 and 747 aircraft overseas and some 737 aircraft in Australia. The faults discovered in Australian Boeing 737 engine fire bottle wiring have all been rectified. If there had been a fire in one engine of any of these Boeing 737 aircraft, the equipment, I am advised, would still have operated correctly and discharged one bottle into the correct engine. However, in the unlikely event of simultaneous fires in both engines, the effect would have been that one and a half bottles would have discharged into one engine and half a bottle into the other engine. The article in Time magazine to which Senator Colston refers appears to be referring to this problem but it incorrectly calls it a cockpit fire extinguisher for one engine. In fact, the faults were discovered in Australian aircraft by airline engineering staff acting on an authority airworthiness directive and not by authority airworthiness surveyors as is claimed in the article. May I say, finally, that this problem to which I have referred was not associated with the British Midlands crash. The cockpit warning systems in that aircraft have been cleared as a possible contributory factor in the accident. All Australian Boeing 737 cockpit warning systems have been checked and cleared.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1J4">Senator SANDERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations to the article titled `Willis answer at odds with advice' in the Canberra Times of 11 April. I ask: Is it the case that accepted legal opinion, under section 60 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904, maintains that an industrial award may be reviewed at any time if it was not correct in law at the time when it was handed down? If this is the case, can the Minister explain why, in answer to a question from Senator Jenkins last year, the former Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Ralph Willis, MP, replied that it was not the case? Does the Minister accept that Mr Willis's answer was in any way incorrect or misleading?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sanders was kind enough to give me some notice of this question, so I am able to provide a reply. In respect of the first part of the question, section 60 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 provided, in effect, that a Federal award was final and conclusive as well as being incapable of being challenged in a court. It is correct to say, however, that the High Court has held that such a clause does not prevent an application for judicial review where lack of jurisdiction is alleged against the decision-making body. I think it is true to say that that has happened quite a lot in the conciliation and arbitration jurisdiction. Accordingly, the High Court has been able to grant prerogative writs against members of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The Industrial Relations Act 1988 has replaced the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Section 150 of the new Act corresponds with section 60 of the repealed Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to the second part of the question, it is not correct to say that the former Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Willis, denied this proposition in his answer to Question No. 397. That was the proposition that I answered in the first part of this question. Mr Willis, the Minister, was asked whether he would re-open certain award hearings. He replied correctly that he did not have power to re-open award hearings. His answer explained how, under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, the process for the Minister seeking a review of an award as of right operated. Neither the Minister's answer nor the question related to a legal challenge to the validity of the award, which is a matter I dealt with in the first part of the answer, namely, the High Court's role in that respect. The answer to the third part of the question whether Mr Willis's answer was incorrect or misleading is no.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1I4">Senator McKIERNAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Finance as Minister representing the Treasurer and relates to the pay packages of senior executives of public companies in Australia. I ask: Is it a fact that the Government's wages policies are not assisted when senior executives openly award themselves pay increases which are grossly in excess of wage increases authorised through the Australian conciliation and arbitration tribunals for ordinary Australian wage and salary earners? Is the situation any better when senior executives covertly award themselves large wage increases via techniques such as executive share incentive schemes?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1412" SPEAKER="Walsh Sen The Hon P.A." NAMEID="TJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The short answer to both questions is yes. The achievement of a satisfactory wages income is certainly not assisted, indeed is sabotaged, if senior executives either overtly or covertly award themselves salary or payments increases vastly in excess of those which the work force in general is obtaining.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second question relating to covert increases was raised last Monday by Mr Justice Dawson of the High Court at a business lawyers conference in Melbourne. According to a report on covert salary increases in yesterday's Age, Justice Dawson stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Another example of questionable behaviour which went unchecked and unheeded was that of executives of large public companies becoming `enriched to quite an extraordinary extent at what can ultimately only be at the expense of the shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA>Justice Dawson was reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . even if a general meeting approved, this safeguard was illusory as shareholders were unable or unwilling to organise themselves as an effective voice, even if with a majority of votes.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, he was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, if the company concerned is making large profits, shareholders will often fail to perceive that in achieving these results, the executives are doing no more than performing their proper function . . .</PARA>
<PARA>One of the worst offenders at enriching himself at the expense of the shareholders of a company is Mr Elliott of Elders IXL Ltd and President of the Liberal Party of Australia who, of course, has ruthlessly exploited 1c paid executive incentive shares.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the rorts that he pulled was described in some detail by Mr Terry McCrann in the Age of 15 April 1986. The McCrann article concerned the abuse of the total remuneration of executives by way of reverse takeovers. The more recent rort that Mr Elliott has been engaging in concerns the 1c bonus share issue. Having made a one-for-four bonus issue in March 1988. Elders announced a further one-for-five bonus issue on 28 September 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> Opposition senators interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It should not go unnoticed that the purpose of all the heckling and yahooing from the other side is to conceal from the public the knowledge of the lurks that the Federal President of the Liberal Party gets up to and the way in which he diddles both his own shareholders and the taxpayers. The 28 September fiddle was reported by the Australian Financial Review the next day. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It certainly pays to own contributing shares these days-particularly if they are in Elders IXL. Unlike other holders of partly paid shares who have to pay the calls before they get such rewards as bonuses, the lucky contrib holders, some of whom are directors-</PARA>
<PARA>and one of whom is a chief executive-</PARA>
<PARA>took part in the generous one-for-five bonus announced yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA>Put in more simple language, the basis of this rort is that directors award themselves partly paid shares paid to 1c and then, the next year or even the next month, participate in a bonus issue along with all the other shareholders who do not have control of the company who have fully paid up shares. So they get, in a very short period, in return for their `investment of 1c' a multiple of that 1c of several hundred per cent. That is the rort that Mr Elliott pulls and those opposite, by way of their raucous babble, are trying to cover up.</PARA>
<PARA> On 27 September 1988, Mr Elliott held 15 and three-quarter million 1c contributory shares in Elders. In spite of that, he and his mates in the Liberal Party have the nerve to complain that ordinary wage earners want to get some wage increases. In my view, it is high time that the large institutional investors in Australia, principally the superannuation funds, took a closer look at executive share incentive schemes and Mr Justice Dawson's comments about them last Monday.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs.

<PARA> As to the question of the putting down of opinions, basically obtained by the Auditor-General or by the Aboriginal Development Commission, either from private counsel or from the Attorney-General, those are matters which I would have to consider more carefully. Quite clearly, I cannot give an undertaking as the opinions were not provided to me: I am not the client. That would require some consideration.

Is the Minister aware of claims that have been made in the community that the cost of lost agricultural production each year is in the order of $600m? Is he also aware that soil conservation is being seen as the No. 1 environmental threat and that community based groups are being seen as the answer to this problem? Has the Minister seen the article in the Goulburn Post of 7 April 1989? I am sure that he has.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not a matter of just having woken up; it is a matter of trying to get a cooperative basis on which to address a significant national problem. I have been asked whether I realise that lost agricultural production valued at $600m a year is caused by land degradation or soil conservation. I am aware of that, and the Senate may be interested to know that that is the approximate value of our total sugar exports, three times the value of our total fruit exports, and slightly more than the value of our total dairy product exports. So, put in terms of lost production to the economy, it is a significant problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If I can give another example to illustrate graphically the dimensions of the problem, on average about 90 million tonnes of soil are moved by soil erosion every year in this country. That is about enough to fill Sydney Harbour in just over two years-simply by simple water erosion. There are many other examples of the dimension of the problem that can be referred to, but those two graphic examples indicate that the issue of conservation and the environment is a national priority. It is not an issue that necessarily attracts as much public attention as it should. Other issues of conflict over environment or conservation seem to attract that attention. Nonetheless, it is important that we develop a bipartisan and powerful approach to addressing the issue, and the next part of the question was about that.</PARA>
<PARA> As it turns out, I have seen the article by Jock Douglas in the Goulburn Post of 7 April. I agree strongly with the points he makes. Indeed, the points he makes are made by a unique political combination in this country that has never been formed before. That combination is the ministerial task force that serves me, comprising the head of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Philip Toyne, and the head of the National Farmers Federation, Rick Farley. He is overseas at the moment; at his last meeting he was substituted. Both those people, representing quite different poles of the political spectrum, are united in their approach of establishing land care groups around Australia so that the land-holders can generate public support and peer group pressure in their own regions and catchments to work on the problem of land degradation.</PARA>
<PARA> What is the Government doing about it? On 20 April I will participate in a national television hook-up with the Minister for Primary Industries in Queensland, Neville Harper; the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Affairs in New South Wales, the Hon. Ian Armstrong; the Minister for Conservation, Forests and Roads in Victoria, Kay Setches; the Minister of Primary Industry in Tasmania, Nick Evers; the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries in South Australia, Kym Mayes; the Minister for Water Resources in Western Australia, Ernie Bridge; and Daryl Manzie's nominee from the Northern Territory, Matty Urvet. That hook-up will launch the guidelines for the national soil conservation program for this year and announce the details of the community land care support program of that group, and also sign the Australian soil conservation strategy for the nation. This will be a quite emblematic bipartisan endorsement of a strategy to deal with what is, after all, as Senator Aulich said in his question, a major national ecological and environmental issue.</PARA>

The previous agreements have now expired and Nepal is experiencing very considerable difficulties in importing and exporting goods, including essential commodities. We have had reports of demonstrations and unrest in Katmandu.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question of trade and transit agreements is a bilateral one for the two governments directly concerned to address. All I can really say at this stage is that we hope the problem can be quickly and fairly resolved, particularly bearing in mind that Nepal is a landlocked, developing country and, as such, has a very fragile and vulnerable economy. We are taking steps to ensure that Australian travellers intending to go to Nepal are advised of the current situation there. I will continue to monitor the situation.

For example, in 1987, at the invitation of Mr Stone, as he then was I spoke to the H. R. Nicholls Society in Queensland and pointed out a few of the old rorts practised there. During questions afterwards, all sorts of people jumped up to defend themselves against accusations that were not in fact made. Something similar appears to have happened a couple of days ago. My Department seems to have borne the brunt of the decision by the Chairman of the National Gallery to smite the philistines, as he would see it. The Department of Finance has published a factual document and asked some questions arising from that document. That has happened a number of times before. I have never attempted to interfere with what the Department puts in those documents. They do not necessarily suggest a policy direction which I would support, although sometimes they do. I do not intend to stipulate which is which at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The discussion paper in question has been sent to museums and libraries. One was sent to the Director of the National Gallery last Wednesday and I sent a copy to the Chairman on Monday of this week, following a written request by him to make one available. Further copies are available from either the Department or my office. As Mr Whitlam said, it is true that the figures are somewhat out of date because most of the figures were put together when the survey was done in 1986. I understand that Jack Thompson, the actor, is looking for private sector support for the proposed National Museum of Australia. I commend that initiative by Mr Thompson. I hope he can find a number of people who are willing to contribute to that and, if he is willing, I suggest that he might associate himself with other appeals for voluntary donations from the public for these sorts of institutions, instead of their resorting, as they usually do, to the usual lazy practice of trying to touch the Commonwealth Budget.</PARA>

We would need to know what the hydrographics of the region were; we would also need to know what would occur when smoke went out the stack-where it would blow and how often the prevailing winds were blowing, et cetera. Those baseline studies were a requirement then. When I answered Senator Walters's question, Senator Puplick may recall that I referred to a letter sent in December which listed 85 points about which the environmental impact statement had either not addressed issues at all or inadequately addressed them. That was an agreed letter between the Tasmanian Environmental Department and my own Department. In that letter, those baseline studies were again referred to and they were again knocked back.

That was the information we received from CSIRO at that time. A number of divisions within the CSIRO needed to be consulted about that. I think Senator Puplick correctly named one of them.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I addressed the annual Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) conference being held in Hobart and announced that the Government would honour the undertaking given by Senator Gareth Evans in June 1987 to conduct a full-scale review of excise levies on oil producers in this country. I announced that we would bring forward that review, to commence it in September this year, and would aim to conclude it in March 1990, that is, in effect, bringing it forward by about nine months from the original date prophesied in 1987 by Senator Evans. The terms of reference of the review, the timetable in which we propose to conduct the review, what the procedures will be, and what the arrangements will be to consult with petroleum organisations, consumers, State governments and others who have an interest in this matter, will be announced in detail by me next month.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter of secondary taxation is an important question because in my speech yesterday I was keen to make the point to the APEA that this Government considers that the Australian community is entitled to an economic rent, that is, a financial return for leasing off to private companies the right to produce oil-a rare and diminishing commodity-from our continental shelf. That economic rent, which is referred to as secondary taxation, must remain as a component of our package. The Australian community has a right to exploit that resource. I am pleased to see that in today's press comments Keith Orchison, the Executive Director of the APEA, recognises that point in responding to the announcement that I made at the conference yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA> I have also said to the APEA that the general criteria that will apply in conducting this review are the criteria and principles that have been announced from time to time by the Treasurer, setting out what this country requires as a fair and equitable taxation system and an effective taxation system. So it is within that context that the review will be conducted. All issues, as far as we are concerned, are on the table. The scope of the review will be a bit wider than originally envisaged by Senator Evans, because the industry has come up with a number of issues which concern the possibility of wider deductability against their tax payments on both resource rental tax and on excise. We will consider what proposals the industry has for wider deductability.</PARA>
<PARA> I have taken up with the Treasurer, as promised, the question of what tax provisions will apply for the removal of oil platforms. The Senate might know that when producing platforms in Bass Strait finish their productive life, they are required to be removed so that they do not constitute a navigational hazard. There are international conventions to which this Government is party which require them to be removed to a certain depth in the water so that they do not constitute that type of hazard. There is the question of the tax treatment of that type of removal, which the producers have raised with me and which I am pursuing. As I have said to the producers, I will try to deal with all those outstanding matters in this review so that we can wrap up these questions in one fell swoop in March, or about that time, next year.</PARA>

Why is it proposed, despite the clear advice of the report of the FitzGerald Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies and other sound findings, that the language skills factor will not apply to the concessional family category of applicants but only to the independent migrant category? Will the Government reconsider this so that this factor applies to both? If not, will the Minister confirm that this aspect of the system will be in regulatory form disallowable by Parliament? Why is the settlement factor for family migration restricted to one characteristic only, and that is whether the sponsor has had two recent years of continuous employment? Finally, will the Minister explain the location factor that has been announced and how a designated area will be determined from time to time?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1418" SPEAKER="Ray Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="UI4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="IMMIGRATION, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In considering a new points system there was one major feature, and that was having a separate points system for `extended family'-that is, a concessional area-and for `independent'. The application or the non-application of the English language test to the concessional area was based on the fact that we would be regarded as being grossly discriminatory in different regions of the world. It would have clearly been seen, if it were instituted, as favouring certain countries and not others. Maybe that will change in the long term. But there is no doubt that in certain regions of the world English is not a second language and in other parts of the world it is. I think it would have been quite discriminatory to do so. I do not regard it as such in the independent area which is more one of dog eat dog and with the best person emerging. As Senator Teague would know, there are costs associated with that. A higher burden is put on the adult migration education program. Trying to get a balanced immigration program that would not be seen as discriminatory was regarded as a sustainable cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The various criteria need not be put in regulation for a points test but they almost certainly will. Yes, it will be disallowable by Parliament. However, I think it is not essential to have that sort of points test included in regulation. For the moment I tend to think that is the route we should go by because the more objective one makes those criteria the more available it is to the public by regulation and, therefore, any appeal system can flow properly from it. The honourable senator asked why the employment status of sponsors has been put in to the exclusion of something else. I do not know what else the honourable senator is referring to. I do not know what other factors might be taken into account.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know the other settlement criteria that the honourable senator is referring to. In this case, however, one of the great arguments for extended family migration to Australia is that, on arrival, relatives will give sustainable support. It is very hard to argue that they will be in a position to do so if they have been on social security, et cetera.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no question-and I think that Senator Teague would agree-that there is an ethos in a lot of families that if they are working they make sure that the people who come out here get jobs. It is a matter of trying to get that interlinking. The point score is not necessarily the most crucial thing. I do not think 10 points will make or break in most cases. Obviously, the number of points that one scores in the skills area, when one gets up to 75 points, is the important thing. These points will make a slight difference in the case of people who are running neck and neck to the line.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator asked me, thirdly, about the location factor. We have left it to the States to designate areas which they consider to be an appropriate location. The logic in this is that it does not force migrants to go to any particular area of Australia. I think the honourable senator will concede that there is a great likelihood that migrants will go to areas where their sponsors live. There is heaps of evidence in respect of chain migration to that effect. What we are really saying is, having taken all of these points into account, if it is a dead heat, let us make the choice in favour of those people who want to go to an area where there is less infrastructural pressure.</PARA>
<PARA> We have asked the States to designate areas. New South Wales has not designated any, neither has Victoria. Queensland has designated all areas in Queensland other than the Gold Coast, Brisbane, the Sunshine Coast and far western Queensland. South Australia, Northern Territory and Tasmania have designated their whole area for the location factor. I believe that Western Australia has nominated the Pilbara and one other area, I think, in the south-west as designated areas. That is a five-point position. One could virtually say that if there is a draw between someone going to Melbourne and someone going to northern Queensland, northern Queensland would then get the edge.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would hope that the Senate is interested in this matter. It is one which has been greatly exercising a number of countries and, of course, there are questions of real significance for Australian forces involved over there. I want to say that in the light of the developments of the last few days, I am encouraged by what has been occurring, at least in so far as it has brought a halt to the senseless killing in Namibia, although there are some uncertainties in the situation which still remain. Acting on advice that the South West African People's Organisation (SWAPO) would be prepared to move to bases in Angola, members of the Namibian Joint Monitoring Commission (JMC)-that is to say, Angola, Cuba and South Africa-together with observers from the United States of America and the Soviet Union, met at Mount Etjo outside Windhoek on 9 April and, in a statement which is referred to as the Mount Etjo declaration, called on SWAPO insurgents to gather at designated assembly points in Namibia under the supervision of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) and to lay down their arms and be transported to bases in Angola north of the sixteenth parallel between 11 and 21 April.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A response from SWAPO leader Nujoma on the terms of that declaration, in particular the request to withdraw beyond the sixteenth parallel, is still awaited, although there are press reports that SWAPO is expressing, out of its office in Luanda, uncertainties about the alleged ambiguity in some aspects of that declaration which is inhibiting the present response. It is simply not possible to assess whether ceasefire arrangements are effectively in force and holding until SWAPO forces begin gathering at their assembly points. In the meantime, South Africa has decided to continue deployment of its forces. Despite the absence of an agreed ceasefire, UNTAG is continuing with its preparations to deploy forces to establish assembly points in northern Namibia to receive the withdrawing SWAPO guerillas.</PARA>
<PARA> The situation so far as the use of Australian troops is concerned is that UNTAG headquarters has decided now to use elements of the Australian-British contingents to set up the assembly points in question. About 60 Australian UNTAG members are involved. The deployment to Namibia of other contingents of UNTAG is proceeding as scheduled and the main body of the rest of the Australians is expected to leave here between 13 and 16 April.</PARA>
<PARA> I just simply want to make the point finally, as I have so often, that it would be a tragedy for all concerned if fresh difficulties were now to arise to derail Namibia from the track to elections in November and to full independence thereafter.

I do think it is a little inappropriate for Senator MacGibbon to intrude religion into what is a situation that is already complicated enough. The situation, I am currently advised, in relation to the air traffic controllers' problems is as follows: despite an order issued by the Industrial Relations Commission (IRC) on Monday, it is the case that the air traffic controllers (ATCs) continued their overtime bans at Sydney Airport. Yesterday afternoon Commissioner Sheather inserted a stand-down clause in the air traffic controllers' award. This enables ATCs who take industrial action and who cannot be usefully employed as a result of industrial action to be stood down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last night the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) stood down one controller who refused to work overtime to replace an absent colleague. Further stand-downs are likely to occur today should other staff refuse to work in accordance with the IRC's order and the award. If stand-down orders do take effect, as expected, there will be progressive close-downs of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, as have occurred in the past.</PARA>
<PARA> The inconvenience to the travelling public is obviously regretted, but the Government's position is that the action at Sydney Airport had reached the stage where this was occurring in any case.

It is two years and 10 months to the next election when the members are first installed. It will be necessary to look at the system. Quite frankly, whilst I do not wish it on them, I think in the long term there is a case for the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Matters to look into the system in the cool light of day, to see what modifications and improvements can be made.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Bjelke-Petersen asked me a question relating to the provision of oxygen to residents of nursing homes. The Minister for Housing and Aged Care has provided me with an answer to that question. It is a fairly detailed answer and, rather than read it out, it might be sensible for me to seek to incorporate it in Hansard and hand the copy of the answer to the honourable senator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Aged and other persons requiring oxygen may receive the service free of charge in hospitals or their own home.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the Government's nursing home financial arrangements the supply of oxygen to residents for emergency, intermittent or infrequent episodic purposes is provided as part of nursing home care and covered by the approved fee for the nursing home at no extra charge to the resident.</PARA>
<PARA> However, in cases where residents require substantial and sustained use of oxygen, the nursing home may separately charge the residents where:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the approved fee of the nursing home does not include the cost of oxygen for sustained use, and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the oxygen was supplied to a resident admitted after 1 July 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> Where the cost of providing oxygen for sustained use was included in the approved budget for a home determined prior to 1 July 1987, the policy is that these costs would continue to be met by the home for existing residents, from the approved fees determined on 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA> The approved fee for a nursing home is designed to enable homes to provide full nursing home care and accommodation for residents. That is, board and accommodation and the provision of care in accordance with the quality of care standards.</PARA>
<PARA> The approved fee does not cover certain items, such as pharmaceuticals prescribed by a doctor for an individual resident nor personal items requested by the resident.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the intention is to review the arrangements concerning the provision of oxygen to nursing home residents. Such a review will need to be conducted in consultation with nursing home industry representatives to determine the incidence of sustained use by nursing home residents.</PARA>

<PARA>I have deliberately kept the wording of this urgency motion straightforward in the hope of sticking to the substantive subject which is of concern to thousands of Australians and to the international community-that is, the future of Antarctic wilderness. The question that we need to ask is whether this area is to be retained for its beauty, its inspiration, and its scientific and biological values, or is it to be exploited in the great tradition of colonial territories everywhere else around the globe by those nations which are in the best position to conserve its multitude of environmental values. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike most international fora, where Australia holds few trump cards to influence other nations in their environmental and development policies, Australia is one of the seven claimants to Antarctic territory, claiming some 43 per cent of the Antarctic continent. As a claimant nation we are in an enviable position to prevent mineral exploitation and other activities which threaten the fragile Antarctic wilderness. We have witnessed several timely reminders lately of just how dangerous it is to allow commercial imperatives to dictate inappropriate activities in the frigid environments of the Antarctic and Arctic regions. The Antarctic has already been described as the frontier of the global ecological crisis. It is in Antarctica that the first and most dramatic impacts of the ozone hole and the global warming from the greenhouse effect will be, and already have been, felt. Seventy per cent of the earth's fresh water is contained in Antarctica's ice and snow and it is now evident--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, I think it is very important that we consider the water supplies that are part of Antarctica's heritage and which we should be preserving. As well as the 70 per cent of the earth's fresh water, we also know that Antarctica contains an invaluable record of the earth's climatic history and provides precious information on increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide and global pollutants such as DDT. The cold waters currently surrounding the Antarctic continent are responsible for absorbing a major proportion of atmospheric carbon dioxide-a major greenhouse gas, as I am sure the Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, will appreciate. As the greenhouse effect escalates temperatures are expected to rise the fastest in Antarctica because any melting at the edge of the ice shelf will change the reflectivity of the surface exposed to sunlight. The increased ocean area will then absorb more of the sun's rays and magnify the warming trend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Following a collective research effort carried out under the International Council of Scientific Unions in 1957-58, the International Geophysical Year, scientific cooperation was seen as a long term key to the Antarctic political sovereignty dilemma. The resulting 1959 Antarctic Treaty set the continent aside as a research preserve where nations freely exchange scientific results and personnel. The Treaty specifically bans military activities, nuclear explosions and the disposal of radioactive waste in the region. In other words, it is a zone of peace and learning. There is no better example anywhere in the international community of the kind of cooperation that we see existing in Antarctica. It is a case of scientists swapping information in Antarctica and learning to cooperate, particularly in extremely difficult climatic circumstances. It is a case of cooperating together or freezing separately. </PARA>
<PARA> Up to now the Antarctic land mass has been saved from exploitation by its harsh climate and lack of any framework for exploitation to take place. As a result, the area has remained unpolluted enough to act as an official international laboratory providing baseline data and allowing scientists to make discoveries which, among other things, have warned the human race that it is on the verge of causing its own destruction. The history of the Antarctic marine environment is much less inspiring. First the fur seals, then the whales, were driven to the edge of extinction through commercial slaughter. Now fish and the tiny crustaceans, krill-the foundation of the Antarctic food chain-remain under threat from overharvesting, despite the fishing convention established to prevent this from eventuating. In addition to commercial harvesting of Antarctic organisms is the impending loss of phytoplankton from intense solar radiation, unshielded by the ozone layer, and a type of algae thought to play a major role in cloud formation. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonnes of garbage, much of it non-degradable, is currently dumped overboard by ships carrying some 3,000 visitors a year. Meanwhile, the feasibility of a gigantic tourism resort complex is being investigated by Helmet Rhode and Partners for the Vestfold Hills, the most sensitive ice-free area of the Australian Territory. Refuse from more that 50 scientific research stations, all of which lack sanitation treatment facilities, is also despoiling the pristine Antarctic landscape. </PARA>
<PARA> On his return from a visit to Antarctica an American environmental defence fund lawyer, Bruce Manheim, described the waters surrounding the United States McMurdo base as having greater concentrations of cancer-causing polychlorinated biphenyls and heavy metals than virtually all the waterways in the United States. These toxins are now found in the tissues of Antarctic penguins and seals. The French base of Dumont-d' Urville, ostensibly established to study the Emperor penguins and other wildlife, has had the effect of reducing the breeding colony of Emperor penguins from 7,000 in 1982 to less than 3,000 today. Unfortunately, the purpose of the airstrip being built by the French is not to further the penguin studies but to service the activities of geologists, mining engineers and developers in their search for minerals beneath the ice. Incidentally, it is important to note that work on the airstrip began around the time the initial minerals convention was signed in June last year in New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA> Other nations have been only too quick to jump on the band wagon. As soon as they thought the licence to go ahead with mineral exploitation of Antarctica was on the way, they stepped up their activities as well. Britain would be one of those countries which stepped up its Antarctic research efforts last year; the United States is building a new runway; and the Soviet Union and the United States have both already fitted skis to jumbo jets. The situation in Antarctica is changing quite dramatically and quite quickly since this possibility of mining was put on the international agenda following that meeting in New Zealand last June. </PARA>
<PARA> If we want any other warnings of the dangers of commercial mineral activities in frigid environments we need only refer to the massive 950,000 litre oil spill from the Argentinean supply vessel Bahia Paraiso near Palmerston Wildlife Research Base last January, which was followed by the catastrophic oil spill from the Exxon Valdez in Alaska this month. It has been almost impossible for America, even with its scientific expertise, to keep the lid on the position. In fact, the Americans have not been able to do so in any way at all. That has been a demonstration of the possibilities that would be more likely to occur if there were to be mining exploration, and then mining activity, in Antarctica. It would be extremely difficult to keep such accidents under control, and in the harsh and fragile environment of Antarctica there is no foreseeable accident the effect of which could be minimised, even with the most careful planning, because of the hostility of that natural environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Into this situation, which is undisputed by international scientists, politicians, conservationists and the majority of the Australian public, who are crying out for environmental protection for the region, emerges a convention to allow mineral exploitation of the Antarctic wilderness. (Quorum formed) Instead of promoting and formulating a convention to conserve the scientific, peace and wilderness values of Antarctica-what we need is a convention based on the concept of a cooperative Antarctic world park-we are debating the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities, or CRAMRA. Ironically, we have been told by Senator Gareth Evans that CRAMRA is about protecting the fragile environment of Antarctica and ensuring peaceful cooperation, as very little is known about the extent of mineral resources there. It could be argued that the logic of the minerals convention to achieve conservation in Antarctica is consistent with a conservation zone to achieve mining in Kakadu. </PARA>
<PARA> The more realistic reason for interest in Antarctica's practically inaccessible minerals is, or course, to entrench national territorial claims in Antarctica. According to yesterday's Canberra Times our own Minister for the Environment has confirmed that he is `absolutely' against any mining in Antarctica. He is also obviously concerned about development of inappropriate tourism there, as he has referred that issue for examination by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. Yet we are still talking about a minerals convention, instead of a conservation convention. It is difficult to conceive how any mineral activity, with its attendant airstrips, ports, tracks, accidents, oil leaks, waste disposal, housing, noise, air pollution and intrusion into wilderness, could pose `no significant adverse effect' when even scientific research bases are guilty of environmental impacts in Antarctica. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also difficult to see how a convention which is compliant with mineral exploitation in one of the most sensitive environments on earth will successfully achieve conservation objectives, when the existing Agreed Measures for the Protection of Antarctic Flora and Fauna are themselves violated by countries such as France in their bid to construct airstrips through Adelie penguin colonies. Neither has the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources of 1981 prevented the overfishing of certain species because, despite its basis on the concept of sustainable harvesting, the prescribed inspection system has never been implemented. The Australian public can be forgiven for being cynical that yet another convention based on exploitation of Antarctic resources will achieve conservation objectives. If a fishing one is not really working, why should we imagine that a mining convention will do the job? It is not a convention about monitoring mining. It is a go-ahead. The use of undefined terms such as `negligible', `substantial risk' and `significant changes' in reference to mineral exploitation in the proposed CRAMRA are especially dubious when the only feasible areas for mineral exploitation are along the coast, away from the icecap-the only habitat of terrestrial life in Antarctica. There would be a great interference in the small amount, 2 per cent of the land, which is not permanently icebound in respect of the habitat of species which most people in the world believe need to be preserved. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, major flaws in CRAMRA totally undermine any confidence that people concerned for the environment of Antarctica may have had that this convention would prevent further degradation of the continent through regulation of inappropriate activities. These flaws are at least threefold. First, liability is limited as a country or company can escape financial responsibility for accidents or pollution if they occur as a result of war or conflict, sabotage or acts of aggression, and natural disasters `not reasonably foreseen'. That phrase in itself would cut out just about any accident that is likely to occur. What could one foresee in that difficult, complex and hostile environment of Antarctica?</PARA>
<PARA> The second flaw is that the sharing of scientific data, which has been a feature under the Antarctic Treaty, would likely become a thing of the past under CRAMRA. Much of the science conducted could be directed towards mineral activity and the data tied up under confidentiality provisions. Withheld data may contain information of environmental significance to the entire global community. Thirdly, Australia has administered the Australian Antarctic Territory for almost 30 years. In the past few years a high emphasis has been placed on environmental responsibility. If the convention goes ahead Australia will have no control over the territory that it lays claim to. </PARA>
<PARA> On this final point it is interesting to note that the Treasurer, Mr Keating, and the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) are opposed to the signing of CRAMRA, but I suspect for largely the wrong reasons. We would not be able to have control over the mineral resources in our specified area, and we would not be copping any financial rewards if large multinational companies were to be involved and engaged in the mining. They are the only ones who have any possibility of undertaking mining there because of the enormous expenses involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia and the other signatories have until 25 November 1989 to sign or not to sign this agreement. This is a real opportunity for Australia to respond, not only to national concern but to international concern that Antarctica be free of mining. The Government cannot pretend that a convention on mineral resource activities will stop mining occurring in Antarctica. It would be a go-ahead. What we would see in Antarctica would be akin to the grab for Africa in the 1890s-an unprecedented rush for the goodies of Antarctica. It would be a most adversarial framework, instead of what we see happening now, which is a positive example of international cooperation. Antarctica is the last continent relatively undeveloped and unpopulated by indigenous people. There is no controversy over violations of people's rights but plenty of sympathy for the violations of the penguins' rights. Much work has already been done by conservation organisations such as Greenpeace and the Australian Conservation Foundation to develop the concept of an internationally cooperative world park to conserve the wilderness and biological values of Antarctica with a ban on activities incompatible with the conservation objective. </PARA>
<PARA> The creation of an Antarctic world park would be consistent with the spirit of the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, the Antarctic Treaty, the Antarctic Treaty Park proposed informally by Chile and the Antarctic Conservation Convention promoted by Australia at earlier consultative meetings. It is the only way that conservation objectives for the Antarctic wilderness can be met while ensuring that all activities taking place on the last great continent are compatible with wilderness and scientific research. I commend this urgency motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave out all words after `urgency:', insert: `The need for the Australian Government to promote adequate public discussion of all of the issues arising in relation to whether or not Australia should become a signatory to the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities (CRAMRA).'. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason for moving the amendment to the motion which Senator Vallentine has put before the Senate today is twofold: firstly, that the Senate should not be asked to make a decision on the run about a fundamentally important question as to whether or not Australia should become a signatory to an important international convention and, secondly, because the motion of Senator Vallentine confuses two quite separate and distinct issues, namely, the convention itself and the question of the world park. The two issues are separate and are distinct. My amendment will cause the Senate to focus upon the question of the convention and Australia's attitude towards it. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to turn first to the question of the world park and that part of Senator Vallentine's motion which I am seeking to amend. The Opposition is opposed to the concept of turning the Antarctic into a `world park'. We believe that this will effectively destroy the regime established under the Antarctic Treaty, a regime which we believe has served the international community, including perhaps especially Australia, particularly well in the course of some 30 years. I look, for example, at the report entitled The World Park Option for Antarctica-Background For A Fourth UN Debate, which was prepared by Greenpeace and which is dated 17 November 1986. In that document, in explaining its support for the world park concept, Greenpeace states:</PARA>
<PARA>Greenpeace and other members of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition (ASOC) used the term ``World Park'' to mean a status whether designated through new legal structures, existing international conventions or through evolution of the Antarctic Treaty itself, which would ensure that the natural environment of Antarctica is forever protected, free of the destruction wrought by humans on every other continent on earth. </PARA>
<PARA>While that may be an admirable and desirable objective, when one reads the rest of the documentation which is attached to this particular proposal, one can see a number of flaws which arise. Let me just draw attention to one or two of them. For example, Greenpeace in its document states:</PARA>
<PARA>Antarctica should remain a zone of limited scientific activity . . . </PARA>
<PARA>As to what `limited scientific activity' means, the document is quite silent. In the light of some of the comments that Senator Vallentine made it is interesting to look at page 11 of the document:</PARA>
<PARA>Tourism is not inconsistent with wilderness values so long as it is very carefully monitored and controlled. Some areas of special tourist interest should be set aside for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, even within the world park concept there are considerable degrees of confusion about how many scientific activities should take place, what sorts of scientific activities they should be, how much tourism should take place, whether there should be any tourism at all, whether it should be carefully controlled or, indeed, whether areas should be set aside for particular tourist activities. Frankly, from listening to Senator Vallentine's presentation today, one is left none the wiser as to precisely what it is that she and proponents of the world park concept mean by that particular terminology. One thing we can presume that they do mean is some sort of involvement by the United Nations in the operation, control and regulation of activities in the Antarctic. The Opposition parties are opposed to that. Let me spend a few moments talking about the involvement of the United Nations in the Antarctic. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was talking about the question of the United Nations involvement with the Antarctic. I draw attention to the fact that, for example, in 1947, when this matter was first being considered by the then emergent United Nations organisation, certainly the United States through its State Department took a view that the United Nations should be involved in the administration of the Antarctic. Indeed, the State Department marked out a plan for a proposed international administration of Antarctica by the United States-not surprisingly-and seven other claimant nations. The proposal was for an eight-power trusteeship under the control of the United Nations. In 1956 the Prime Minister of New Zealand at the time, Mr Walter Nash, proposed the United Nations trusteeship and the establishment of the Antarctic as a world territory under United Nations control.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, arising from the events of the International Geophysical Year from July 1957 to December 1958 it was decided that it would be better to proceed by way of the establishment of an international treaty. As a result, in 1959 the Antarctic Treaty was developed and was brought into operation. That treaty persisted without very much significant international comment until December 1982 when, at the time of the signing of the Law of the Sea Convention at Montego Bay in Jamaica, the Malaysian delegate, Ghazali Shafie, drew attention to what he claimed should be the next priority for the Third World. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is time now to focus our attention on another area of common interest . . . Antarctica where immense potentialities exist for the benefit of all mankind. </PARA>
<PARA>This matter was subsequently debated internationally. In November 1984 the United Nations Secretary-General himself caused to be published a paper entitled Study on the Question of Antarctica. That United Nations paper analysed the Antarctic Treaty system and demonstrated the benefits of that system. It says in part:</PARA>
<PARA>For nearly two and a half decades, Antarctica and its surrounding maritime areas have been free from militarisation of any kind, including nuclear weapons. No armed conflict has taken place in the area. Peace on the continent has been maintained to a large extent through the agreements embodied in the Antarctic Treaty. The Treaty has provided a frame-work for the parties to the Treaty to carry out peaceful activities related to scientific research, exploitation of marine resources and protection of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA>Elsewhere, the United Nations paper says:</PARA>
<PARA>It would appear that no major danger has so far occurred to the Antarctic eco-system. Human activities in Antarctica remain very limited . . . and are being carried out in accordance with the strict rules and regulations imposed on such activities by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the United Nations, in its own study, demonstrated the extent to which the Antarctic Treaty was the correct method by which we should proceed to bring about the protection of the Antarctic environment. The world park idea is, in my view, completely contrary to the maintenance of that regime. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to one final point on this world park question. If one looks at a very instructive article entitled `Antarctica and the United Nations' by Sanjay Chaturvedi, the Senior Research Fellow at the Department of Political Science at the Punjab University at Chandigarh, which appeared in the India Quarterly at the beginning of 1986, one sees the points that he makes about the politicisation of the situation in the Antarctic. One of the points to which he draws attention is that if the United Nations is to become involved in the administration of the Antarctic and the world park concept in the Antarctic, one of the first things that will be on the agenda of the Third World nations is whether it will be possible to achieve-I quote from his paper-`the expulsion of South Africa' from the Antarctic Treaty system. That will have to be `one of the first steps in this direction'. In other words, changes that will have to be made if the world park concept, under United Nations auspices, is to go ahead will be the immediate politicisation along the lines of international political disputations of a situation which, at the moment, has avoided that. Even during the Falkland Islands dispute, the Antarctic Treaty system managed to keep Britain and Argentina talking and cooperating in the Antarctic while they were physically at war with each other only a few hundred kilometres away from the Antarctic waters. Any steps taken along this world park line will inevitably lead to a politicisation of the regime in the Antarctic, which is undesirable. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the text of the amendment that has been moved, which calls on the Government to promote adequate public discussion of the issues. I do not believe that this has so far been achieved. If one looks at the statement made by Senator Evans on 22 November in a news release, which was tabled in this chamber, when he put down details of the text of the Convention which we are now addressing, one sees that he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's purpose in tabling the Convention is to promote community discussion. </PARA>
<PARA>There has been no real community discussion on this matter. A large number of issues need to be addressed and they have not so far been addressed because the Government has not lived up to its promise to promote community discussion on this matter. Our amendment calls upon the Government to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me indicate the issues upon which we would expect community discussion to be fostered. The first is whether this Convention is entirely consistent with the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty. It is an operation which might become more exclusive, more exploitative and, indeed, majoritarian rather than based upon decisions being made on the principle of unanimity. Is it in fact entirely at one with the Antarctic Treaty itself? Secondly, as a result of the signing of this Treaty, is there some potential for conflict? For the first time, states in the Antarctic, parties to the Treaty, will be required to make judgments about the relative economic and financial benefits which some may gain and others may not; the Treaty parties as a whole might gain and those who are not Treaty parties will not. In other words, there will be the potential for conflict arising on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The third issue to be addressed is: what is the import of the secrecy provisions contained in Article 37, subsections 11 and 12, providing for commercial secrets to be maintained in a regime where previously all information has been made available to all members of the community? The fourth question is: from Australia's point of view, is there any loss of sovereignty by our entering into this particular regime? Will we lose the veto power on activities taking place within our sovereign areas? That matter has to be addressed, especially once an explorer has been granted a permit from the Mineral Resources Commission, which is to be established under the regulatory arrangements provided within the framework of the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities. The next issue is: will there be a loss of revenue to Australia? Will we, as a sovereign nation, derive royalties from mineral activity, exploration and exploitation which may take place within our sovereign territory in that part of the Antarctic? The next issue is subsidised mining. In the Chairman's draft, a document known as MC/17 revision 5, there was originally a subclause (f) in Article 2 requiring the parties to:</PARA>
<PARA>follow orderly mining practices and act in an economically rational manner. </PARA>
<PARA>That requirement, which was seen by Australia as an anti-subsidy clause, was subsequently removed by the time we got to the final draft in June 1988. The question of the exact meaning of that needs to be addressed within the framework of promotion of adequate public discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> The next question that arises is the question to which Senator Vallentine has referred-that of limited liability in terms of damage done to the Antarctic. It relates very much to my next concern, which is the control of oil pollution. We have seen oil pollution from a leaking Argentinean vessel and the sinking of a Peruvian vessel within Antarctic waters. Nobody would be unaware of the disaster that has occurred as a result of the accident involving the Exxon Valdez in Arctic waters. There is no doubt that those major questions need to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> There are questions about the diversion of resources-whether it is appropriate for countries such as Australia to divert resources from scientific and other activities to mining and exploitative activities. There is a large number of matters related to our environmental concerns. They concern the consequences of natural disasters, the impact of additional activity on areas such as the very limited Emperor penguin rookeries, the impact on scarce fresh water resources, bearing in mind the Davis base has already drained Station Tarn Lake to provide regular supplies to a small station. There is the question of the disposal of waste from the Antarctic. Recently when Senator Calvert and I were in Hobart we inspected the waste being brought back from Casey base in the Antarctic. We looked at the cases of waste material being brought back for disposal in Australia. There are questions about infrastructure concerns. There is the question of French activity at Dumont D'Urville and, indeed, the loss of the last vestiges of true wilderness character within the Antarctic environment. All of those are very significant issues. They all need to be addressed as a result of the public discussion which should flow from the promotion of debate about whether we sign this Treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that there are divisions of opinion within the Government on this matter. We know that Senator Richardson and Senator Evans are concerned to sign the Convention. They believe that, in the absence of signing the Convention, the whole Antarctic Treaty system will somehow unravel. They believe in the old principle of half of loaf being better than none. We know that Mr Keating and Senator Cook have a different view on the matter. They are concerned about subsidised mining, royalties and the economic benefit for a limited number of operators within the Antarctic regime. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition, at this stage, has not yet concluded considerations of this matter. There is a paper which I have already indicated in public statements I have submitted to the shadow Cabinet in my capacity as shadow Minister for the environment for shadow Cabinet to address on questions relating to whether Australia should become a signatory to the Antarctic mineral resources convention. My view is that this process can be achieved only if there is an adequate level of public debate, which by this amendment we call on the Government to facilitate. It is not adequate for the Senate to take this matter on the run. It is clearly not satisfactory to move from the Antarctic Treaty to the world park concept, for the reasons that I have outlined. It is for those reasons that I put forward this amendment and seek the support of the Senate in the carriage of that amendment in substitution for the original motion moved by Senator Vallentine. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats have no objection to Senator Puplick's amendment. Quite clearly, there is a need for wide-ranging public discussion. However, we are disappointed that Senator Puplick is closing off the other option and presenting them as two alternatives whereas one would like to see both wide-ranging public discussion and a commitment to the rejection of the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities (CRAMRA). For that reason, although it might sound a bit strange, we will be forced to vote against his amendment and for the original motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Typically, Senator Puplick has attempted to narrow down the range of debate to some very grubby, exploitative and obscene discussion. When one is considering the opening up of the last great essentially untouched continent on earth to exploitation and mineral development-`development' is a horrible term-then one needs to step back and seriously consider where we are as a human species on the face of this planet and what we are doing. It is only in that context that one gets a clearer view of what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA> As a species, the human animal is very young. The evidence, such as it is, indicates that we separated from our last common ancestor about six million years ago. Cosmologists suggest that the earth would be capable of supporting animals of a human sort for about another 500 million years. If we compare our life with that of other animal species, we find that we are indeed a very, very young species. We have probably had on this earth about one per cent of our potential life span. </PARA>
<PARA> Astronomers have been searching the heavens for many centuries, but particularly in the last couple of decades, to see whether there is in our vicinity life at least as technically advanced as life on earth. In the last couple of decades that search has been very intense. So far we have failed to find any other life as technically advanced as our own. While there may be life elsewhere in the universe as advanced as our own, the indications are that it is certainly not in our corner of the universe. If we accept relativity, that means that it is very likely that there is no other habitable place in our corner of the universe to which we could move and occupy. It means that the Earth is both our origin and our destiny and that we had better look after it. </PARA>
<PARA> Compared with the six million years that we have had on this planet as a separate species, we have been involved in intense industrial development for only about 200 years. In that time, we have succeeded in making a very substantial mess of this one corner of the universe which is capable of supporting human life. We have discovered in recent years that there are a number of environmental problems on a global scale-the greenhouse problem. We have substantially changed the composition of the atmosphere and are continuing to move away from its conventional composition, as we now know it has been over the last several hundred thousand years. We have a massive problem with ozone depletion. We have major habitat changes on a global scale. We have loss of species diversity. We have simplification and loss of cultural diversity. We have massive and global deforestation. If, in addition to all these things, in barely 200 years we have brought our resource exploitation to the point where we need to move to the last available continent and exploit that for resources, then we should be thinking that we desperately need to curb the voracious appetite of homo sapiens for these resources. Quite clearly, if we are looking for another 500 million years on this planet, we are running out of space very quickly; we are running out of resources that will support the sorts of lifestyles we are choosing to lead. Indeed, we are dealing with the Earth as if it were a business in liquidation, as if any resource can simply be turned into cash and frittered away in an incredibly short period. I believe that is the background against which we need to set the discussion in relation to possible exploitation of the Antarctic continent. </PARA>
<PARA> We are considering whether Australia should or should not sign CRAMRA. This convention, which is now up for signing, is set in place against the background of the Antarctic Treaty, which has guaranteed, as Senator Vallentine pointed out, international peace, scientific cooperation and nature conservation in the Antarctic since 1957. Under the proposed convention, Australia would be in an extremely strong position. Under CRAMRA, the claimant states, of which Australia is one, have the right of veto. In exercising that right by not ratifying the convention, it would be possible for us to ensure that CRAMRA does not succeed as an international convention. Therefore, we could begin the process of setting in place an alternative convention which would ensure into the indefinite future the protection of the Antarctic in whatever form. I point out here that Senator Puplick has attempted to trivialise the debate by pointing to simply one model of a possible world park. There are many models, and clearly that would be something that Australia could initiate by opening the debate on a far more comprehensive and protective convention. </PARA>
<PARA> The risks to the Antarctic from environmental damage are extremely high. Several other speakers and people in other places have mentioned the recent holing of the Exxon Valdez in Alaska. I point out that the environmental conditions there were not as extreme as one would experience in the Antarctic. Indeed, there is a large population in the vicinity which was able to address that spill. Nonetheless, that has been a complete disaster and, clearly, attempts to do anything about that major oil spill have been totally inadequate. Senator Puplick referred to the Chilean ship in the Antarctic, which I understand still contains some 300 tonnes of oil. Because the ship is now frozen in and will remain frozen in until next summer, there is no ability to go in and clean up that spill. One simply hopes and prays that that ship will not break up before the next Antarctic summer. </PARA>
<PARA> In these major spills there is no clean-up which can reverse the environmental damage that occurs. There is no dollar compensation which can in any sense even begin to address these massive problems of environmental damage. Low temperatures ensure that the speed of degradation of waste products, oil and anything else which gets into that environment is extremely slow. One needs to remember, of course, that one is dealing with a particularly fragile biological environment with extremely short food chains. Some Antarctic whales feed directly on plankton. Essentially, there is a two-step food chain which could be quite seriously disturbed very quickly. These very tight biological associations are very fragile and very easily disturbed. They are basically unstable. </PARA>
<PARA> Most serious and major accidents, particularly in recent years, have resulted from human error. I think that is worth stressing in the context of an attempt to get an agreement which relies on technical fixes, technical solutions, to ensure that those accidents do not occur. One could refer to the accident at Three Mile Island, which clearly did not occur because of a technical fault in the nuclear power station, but because of a failure of training and a misreading of the dials in the power station control room. The accident at Chernobyl arose due to a failure to train staff and also an inability to understand and observe the critical conditions which were developing in that reactor. We were told that the Exxon Valdez accident arose because of the drunkenness of the skipper. There was a major spill of iron chloride monomer in Victoria, which came about through the ineptitude of plumbers who were looking after a large tanker of the material. There was a serious toxic spill in Port Adelaide which again came about through human carelessness. I must stress that we cannot legislate for human perfection. In dealing with an extremely fragile environment it does not matter what conditions one puts into an international agreement. If mining should go ahead, accidents will occur as a result of human frailty and the damage caused by those accidents will simply be irreparable. </PARA>
<PARA> The record of environmental protection in the Antarctic has been poor, despite the existing Antarctic Treaty. One could refer to the International Whaling Commission, which has pointed repeatedly to the progressive run-down in populations of species of whales. As each species has been forced to near extinction-or certainly their numbers have fallen below an economically viable level-despite the protestations of the International Whaling Commission the whaling industry has simply harvested another species. </PARA>
<PARA> The convention concerning fishing depends ultimately on all nations reaching a consensus on what should be done about overfishing. Despite the fact that this convention was signed only in 1977, by 1983 a number of species had been quite seriously depleted. In regard to waste management in the Antarctic, we saw on a Four Corners program that a number of Antarctic bases are simply pushing their waste into the environment, despite international agreements to the contrary. These international agreements have not been well observed and in some cases have led to serious general damage and in other cases to quite serious specific damage. </PARA>
<PARA> Under CRAMRA, Australia would lose its power to veto mining. If that convention comes into force, an application to mine would be considered by a committee. Australia would lose its ability to veto a decision to go ahead with mining, even on its own territory. It may be a somewhat arrogant view, but I hope that our controls would be somewhat better than those that might be imposed by some of our other Antarctic partners. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been claimed that exploitation of the Antarctic may help less developed countries with respect to access to resources. One need only look at the International Law of the Sea Convention and how that was originally set up as a way of helping all countries to gain access to deep sea resources. That was torpedoed, essentially, by President Reagan, who supported the technically advanced and rich companies which were capable of exploiting things like manganese nodules from the seabed. CRAMRA has been strongly supported not by the less developed nations but by the United States, the United Kingdom, France, West Germany and Japan. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, in view of the fact that Parliament would need to pass legislation before the Government would ratify the convention I strongly press the Government not even to bring the legislation forward but simply to refuse to ratify the CRAMRA agreement. If it does bring it forward, I urge the Senate to reject CRAMRA. I believe that Australia should take a lead in rejecting CRAMRA and then immediately bring forward proposals for an international convention on the protection of the Antarctic for the purposes of environmental protection and not for the purposes of mineral exploration and exploitation. I believe that Australia should take a lead in this matter, and has an opportunity to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A vast amount is spoken about the Antarctic by people-like me-who have not been there. What they say always far outweighs what is said by the people with practical, open-minded and first hand experience. The first alternative to be determined in this matter clearly is whether there should be any human contact. Without a doubt, there has to be. The management and purpose of that contact is what has to be considered. For a start, the extreme fragility of the basic Antarctic Treaty cannot be ignored. The Treaty has always been questioned by both participants and non-participants. The Australian Government, until now, has always been able to maintain its own presence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The issue that we are considering at the moment is the meetings on minerals negotiations. I have copies of the press releases for the eighth, ninth and tenth sessions. One should take into account exactly what the meetings have been about. Mr Chris Beeby of New Zealand was the chairman of the meetings. After the eighth session he put out a press release which said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the discussions in Hobart had been marked by the constructive and dynamic spirit that characterised the Antarctic Treaty system and had so successfully fostered international co-operation in the Antarctica for more than twenty-five years. </PARA>
<PARA> ``The purpose of the negotiations'', Mr Beeby said, ``is to strengthen the Antarctic Treaty by ensuring that if mineral activities in Antarctic ever take place they do not threaten either the peace and stability that the Treaty has maintained or the Antarctic environment.''</PARA>
<PARA> He explained that the regime under discussion would cover all phases of mineral resource activities and would provide detailed principles, procedures and mechanisms, including in every phase the requirement that any activity be subject to an environmental impact assessment. </PARA>
<PARA>The ninth session took place in Tokyo, from 27 October to 12 November 1986, the following year. The press release read:</PARA>
<PARA> The reason for this negotiation is therefore to ensure that if mineral activities in the Antarctic ever do take place, they are regulated in an acceptable manner and do not threaten either peace and stability that the Antarctic Treaty has maintained or present unacceptable risks to the Antarctic environment. ``The important point to note about this agreement,'' said Mr. Beeby ``is that it will prohibit mining in Antarctica unless a judgment is made in the future by the institutions to be established that the environment will be adequately protected.''</PARA>
<PARA>After the tenth session-again, Mr Beeby was chairman-the press release, in part, read:</PARA>
<PARA> It is to ensure that if mining activities do ever take place in Antarctica they are carried out in a manner that ensures the continued peace and stability of the continent-as guaranteed by the Antarctic Treaty-and does not present unacceptable risks to the Antarctic environment. </PARA>
<PARA>In this tenth session the chairman raised the question of the liability for damage and the elaboration of procedures for settlement of disputes, but did not reach any conclusion. The reasons for the presentation of the treaty are quite clear. The fact that we have not gone quite far enough along the track is also quite obvious at this stage. I believe that there is a need for a treaty. Whether we have reached that stage remains to be seen. I believe that if we wish to safeguard the future, we need to pursue the treaty and subtreaty basis on which we have been operating. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to consider that the countries that came in as original members-the United Kingdom, Norway, France, New Zealand, Argentina, Australia and Chile-are now being joined by a considerable number of other countries. The other 30-odd which have now joined all wish to have their own say too. Their views and ours on many issues are not the same. The basis on which we completed the original negotiations has been varied somewhat by the interests of other parties over time. </PARA>
<PARA> Our territorial claims are not recognised by many other countries. We hope and expect that the demonstration of our own involvement in the Antarctic will be regarded as evidence of possession and sovereignty, and so on. We have to concede that, whatever happens, man is part of the environment and cannot be separated from it. We have to do everything possible to ensure that man's presence and involvement are in harmony with the environment. We will never stop people going to Antarctica. It covers an area of over 14 million square kilometres-almost twice the size of Australia. By virtue of its unique climatic features, it offers an immediate challenge to the inquisitive nature of man-and rightly so. </PARA>
<PARA> The treaty development of the Antarctic and the subsequent Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) have been steps in the direction of producing by cooperative means agreements to introduce man but to do so more carefully and more thoughtfully than has happened in other places and at other times. As has been said, the first formal discussions on minerals began in 1982, and a considerable amount of thought and discussion has taken place since then. It now becomes necessary for Australia to make a decision by 25 November-six months away-if we are to sign this treaty. I hope that the promoters of the most extreme views on both edges of the spectrum, that is total availability, and total exclusion, will not be considered too seriously. I believe that some careful, in-between, acceptable proposal can be made. The decision is not easy. We know that the Government has been divided and that strong views from both sides have been put. We know what Senator Richardson and Senator Gareth Evans believe and we know what Mr Keating and Senator Cook believe. I do not see it just as a means of taxation, as one of those four gentlemen may, but I do see that there is a sovereignty question which needs to be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> As a Tasmanian and as one who had two extremely useful and interesting years bearing the Opposition's responsibility in the area of science, which included the Antarctic area, I had the opportunity to avail myself of much information and of discussions with many interesting and knowledgeable people. I was pleased to form a good relationship with the Antarctic base at Kingston, south of Hobart, and to meet many of the scientists, practitioners and researchers that were involved. The extremely valuable research that they have carried out to date has been of great value and will continue. I refer not only to the work done on the animals, birds, sea life, the climate, and so on, but also to the research on a wide range of other pursuits such as psychology, food processing, insulation practices, extreme cold engineering, clothing, and so on. This research will spread to other areas worldwide. Clearly, now that the base has become recognised for the quality of its research, we are seeing more and more international scientists and visitors there. The future offers great potential in our servicing of research visits from other countries and of providing them with food, housing, clothes, medical services, transport and engineering, on a basis that offers many advantages over bringing everything half way round the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tasmanian Government is fully behind doing everything possible to encourage items with Antarctic connections and to provide Tasmanian connections. I commend the Tasmanian Government on taking such forthright steps, in difficult times, to change some of its activities into activities that will provide a different future. One of the real successes has been the development of the igloo satellite cabin by Malcolm Wallhead for a quick erection prefabricated shelter. That is just one that comes to mind. The Tasmanian Government assists industries with specific Antarctic applications to get into business in Tasmania so they may add to the resources available to expeditioners generally. Another excellent move has been the establishment of the Institute of Antarctic and Southern Ocean Studies at the University in Hobart. The work done by the Vice-Chancellor, Professor Lazenby, and by Professor David Green, in particular, has produced an excellent balanced program. The aims of the institute are worth stating:</PARA>
<PARA>to foster within the Tasmanian community a better understanding of Antarctica and its marine environment, the resources of the region and their significance to Australia;</PARA>
<PARA>to foster, encourage and support the conduct of research into all aspects of the Antarctic continent and the adjacent islands, seas and oceans;</PARA>
<PARA>in the longer term, to widen the opportunities for teaching within the University in the disciplines relevant to this research;</PARA>
<PARA>to enhance liaison and collaboration with individuals, and other national and international institutes and agencies having an interest in the region, by providing a focus for activity;</PARA>
<PARA>to encourage the development of local industries supportive of national and international endeavour in the region. </PARA>
<PARA>That has proved to be very successful and very satisfactory. The project fits in well with the CCAMLR, the Maritime College, the Antarctic Base and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation maritime divisions. The location and proposal are excellent. The institute is to be a fully multi-disciplinary operation covering science, law, medical aspects and engineering generally, and at post-graduate and under-graduate levels. The whole project is excellent. Then, of course, there is the International Antarctic Centre, which is another tremendous project and is an integral part of the overall picture. The design competition for the entrance to the building was held recently and was won by Philip Cox of Sydney, and the Director, Dr Louise Crossley, has been appointed and has taken up her duties. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people will never be able to visit the Antarctic and the Centre is designed to provide them with information, with history, and experience of what goes with Antarctic conditions. No-one can deny the real fascination that people have for what they normally cannot experience. This project will greatly assist with that. Tasmania is the logical place to be regarded as the Antarctic stepping off place for the world. We have to remember that Amundsen came into Hobart to give the world the news of his reaching the Pole. His modern day equivalent, Dick Smith, left from Tasmania in his Twin Otter for his most recent scientific expedition only a few months ago. It is worth mentioning that Dick Smith supports the whole Tasmanian Antarctic project. Hopefully, the Centre will help to educate people, who would go down as tourists and learn of the general fragility and the need to respect the environment in every way. </PARA>
<PARA> Visits to Antarctica will increase. Adequate protection is what we are talking about. The education of people before they go is very important, whatever their reasons for going. Scientific research will be the main reason for them going. There is still much to find out. Information on early life on earth, on climatic changes and likely climatic changes in the future, is probably all there. We need that information and we need researchers to go and get it. </PARA>
<PARA> We know there are many minerals in Antarctica, but at this stage there is no contemplation of recovering these in an economical manner. This means that our position needs to be determined before someone says that it is economical. Our position in Antarctica is one relating primarily to foreign affairs and strategic issues. I presume that these will need to be given priority in making our decision. From the mineral exploration aspect, however, the matter cannot be left in permanent indecision. While ever the convention remains unsigned and inconclusive, those countries with greater desires to seek mineral exploration will be advancing their views and, at the same time, those who want it to be an out of bounds area will be pursuing their views too. I believe that we cannot leave it that way. Senator Puplick referred to the progress that is being made in tidying up these issues. I hope that we can work towards making a decision soon on the basis of the best information available and that, when we do, the Government and the Opposition will be able to find common ground. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government supports the words used by Senator Puplick in the debate-that is, the need to promote adequate public discussion. It is important to note that by tabling for discussion some five or six months ago the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities and by keeping it on the table for a very long time, the Government has enabled the debate to progress on this issue all around the country. In fact, I think it has received enormous coverage in recent times. I am glad that we handled this matter in this way so that no decision was rushed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The signing of this Convention is not a simple black and white matter. It is true, as Senator Archer and other speakers have said during the debate, that there are different views within the Government. I note that Senator Puplick has stated that the Opposition has yet to come to its conclusion on the issue. There are reasons for having different views and I want to go through some of them in the time that is available to me. </PARA>
<PARA> This minerals convention did not come out of thin air. It was the result of six years of tortuous negotiations involving representatives from 33 countries. I, for one, would not like to be the person who started it all again. It is not an easy matter to come to agreement or consensus on an issue such as this. The final meeting was held in Wellington in June of last year and the text of the convention was tabled in the Senate on 22 November of last year. </PARA>
<PARA> I think one misunderstanding that exists in the minds of some senators and, I might say, some people in the community, ought to be laid to rest. The Convention is not, and cannot be interpreted to be, an encouragement to mining. Rather, it seeks to put in place a series of stringent regulations should mining ever occur. In this respect, I would like to mention the reference in the debate to tourism because I think it has relevance to when mining might occur. I am constantly asked about tourism in the Antarctic, as I am about mining. I am personally opposed to mining taking place in the Antarctic and I will maintain that position. It will be a long, long time before tourism can even be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Antarctic Territory has within its boundaries places which experience some of the world's worst weather. A couple of weeks ago we almost lost somebody at Casey Station. If anyone is wondering why mining or tourism will not take place for some time, it is worth noting the circumstances of a tragedy that almost occurred. The person whom we almost lost set out to walk one kilometre from the old Casey station to the new to bed down for the night. A blizzard set in as he walked out of the door of the old station and he literally could not see his shoes. He wandered off the track past the guide lights. In fact, his safety was in severe jeopardy. He was saved because he literally walked into a huge bulldozer. He was able to climb into the cockpit of that vehicle and survive. I think that incident illustrates just how difficult mining and/or tourism are in the Antarctic. This is certainly the case in so far as the Australian Antarctic Territory is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> My concern in the short term is not so much about mining in the Australian Antarctic Territory; it is for those areas that Argentina and Chile in particular have an interest in. Being further north than the Australian Antarctic Territory, the climate in those areas is not as extreme. Those countries pursue their claims in the Antarctic with considerable passion. One can actually buy in Argentina maps of Argentina which show Antarctica as well. As I said, these countries take these matters very seriously indeed. I am concerned that mining might first begin in these areas. I, for one, want to make sure that, if mining is ever to take place, some regime is established that might at least, to use the phrase that Don Chipp made famous, keep the bastards honest. Senator Archer quoted what was said by Mr Beeby of New Zealand, who had the very difficult task of chairing negotiations. I would like to quote the following statement by Mr Beeby:</PARA>
<PARA>The convention does not incorporate a judgment that mining in Antarctica is acceptable, but instead, gives a high priority to environmental protection. It constitutes a mechanism for assessing possible impact on environment of Antarctic mineral resource activities, determining whether they are acceptable and, if so, regulating them in detail . . . The protection of the Antarctic environment is in fact the overriding theme running right through the text. The safeguards are substantial. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a pretty important statement from Mr Beeby. Under this Convention, mineral resource activities are prohibited unless it is judged, based upon the assessment of adequate information, that they would not cause significant adverse impact on the environment, on living resources or on global or regional weather patterns. We need to be sure that there is the technology to ensure safe operations; that the capacity exists to monitor the environmental and ecosystem parameters; and that the capacity exists to respond effectively to accidents with potential environmental effects. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to say something about Australia actually signing the Convention and what that would actually mean. For the Convention to come into force, the following nations must sign: 16 consultative parties who participated in the final session of the fourth special Antarctic Treaty meeting in Wellington in June 1988; five developing countries; 11 developed countries; and all claimant states such as Argentina, Chile and Australia. To date, 15 countries have signed, and that includes Great Britain in the last couple of days. </PARA>
<PARA> For the Convention to come into force, for all of the conditions that I have just mentioned to be met, the signatures of Australia and France, as claimant states, are required, as are the signatures of either China or India. I might say that indications are that China will sign fairly shortly. So it will boil down to Australia or France signing the treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of environmental safeguards, Australia's objectives throughout these negotiations were to ensure that we focused on the achievement of very stringent environmental safeguards. Article 4 of the Convention sets out the general environmental principles concerning judgments on mineral activities which include the following:</PARA>
<PARA>Decisions about Antarctic mineral resource activities shall be based upon information adequate to enable informed judgments to be made about their possible impacts and no such activities shall take place unless this information is available for decisions relevant to those activities. </PARA>
<PARA> No Antarctic mineral resource activities shall take place unless it is judged, based upon assessment of its possible impacts on the Antarctic environment and on dependent and associated ecosystems, that the activity in question would not cause--</PARA>
<PARA>The article then goes on to list a number of adverse effects, be they water quality, flora, changes in distribution and the abundance or productivity of different species of fauna. Of course, the jeopardy of endangered species is also mentioned. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Coulter" NAMEID="TF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator Coulter</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very similar to the conditions applying in respect of Alaskan oil exploration.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is very true. I will come to some misconceptions about what the convention can do which, obviously, are not very far away from what Senator Coulter is suggesting. But I am not sure that he and I would necessarily agree on the next step of what to do about it. I certainly agree with the honourable senator's interjection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question of liability has created a fair bit of discussion. The Convention applies strict liability on operators for damage to the environment and dependent ecosystems, the established use of the environment arising directly out of damage to the environment, and property-that is life or injury, et cetera-arising directly out of damage to the environment. Australia was successful in minimising the defences to liability contained within the convention. Our negotiators made a particular point of that. The only two defences to operate will be the natural disaster and act of violence defences. I do not think we could have been expected to have done much better than that. The natural disaster defence covers an event constituting in the circumstances of Antarctica a natural disaster of an exceptional character which could not have been reasonably foreseen. It is worth noting, and I think this has been too often missed in the debate, that that is in the context of those words `in the circumstances of Antarctica'. That in itself sets a fairly rigid test when one looks at what might be foreseen. I think it is therefore a very narrow defence. </PARA>
<PARA> To come to the point that I think Senator Coulter was implicitly raising, if one looks at the views on the Convention, two principal positions are being taken by the community on this question. The first is the view that if there were no convention there would be no mining. The second is that the Convention is the only way of ensuring proper regulation and environmental protection. I hasten to add that I do not subscribe to either view. I certainly do not believe that if there is no convention, there will be no mining. That is simply not the case. I believe, as I said, that mining will take place in some of the more northern parts of the Antarctic Territory, and I do not believe that is all that far off. That is why I would like to see something in place. </PARA>
<PARA> In so far as this Convention ensures anything, I would be reluctant to make the claim, as we have seen in the case of the Arctic, that the Convention would do any such thing. I hope a convention, be it this or a renegotiated one, might be able at least to place some pressure on those countries and companies involved in a mining exercise to do so responsibly. I repeat: that is in the context of my view that there should not be mining in Antarctica. When the Government comes to examine this question, and obviously I cannot pre-empt what its decision might be, there are concerns from a range of views that are worth taking into account. That is why I said it is not black and white. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly Senator Cook has argued, I think forcefully, that we have to be concerned about the question of the subsidisation of mining. He is quite right to be concerned about it. In general terms, we sought a provision proscribing substantial types of incentives for the development and disposal of mineral resources which might give some sort of unfair advantage to mining in Antarctica compared with elsewhere in the world. We received support, through negotiations, from Chile and Argentina on that question. Unfortunately, at the end of the day we finished up practically alone on that point. It is worth noting that both Chile and Argentina have signed the Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has been concerned about revenue sharing and the issue of claimant states. There is no doubt that the non-claimant states are not terribly happy with the suggestion that that might take place, and I can understand why. While that is a matter of concern to us, I am not sure what we can do. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick raised a number of concerns which he said needed to be addressed, and I wholeheartedly concur. He raised the question of oil pollution. Obviously that is a critical problem, particularly in cold climates. That is one of the reasons why I am personally opposed to mining in Antarctica, and will remain so, at least until the Cabinet decides otherwise. Then I dare say I might rather hastily change my mind, although I do not believe the Cabinet would even be contemplating that at this point in time. All I hope is that we do promote debate. I hope the debate is rational and I hope it is understood that this is not a clear cut question. There are good arguments for signing the convention and there are good arguments for not signing it. It is a matter of the Government and the community going through the debate and weighing up those considerations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator is welcome to make a contribution to this debate any time he likes and when I sit down I will listen to it. The truth of the matter is that Australia will be able to make no contribution if it is not a signatory of the treaty. The facts of the matter are that, whether or not this treaty succeeds, ultimately it will not influence whether mineral exploration and exploitation take place in Antarctica. The objects of the exercise, the intention, the inexorable reason why nations have come together, negotiated and sought to sign a regime, is to ensure that in the unlikely event that there is mineral exploration of a significant nature or, less likely, exploitation, there will be some sensible control and management of it. Otherwise, those countries less responsible than ourselves, perhaps through economic necessity more more than anything else, and their demand for resources, will proceed-that is, if the exploration itself does not destroy the environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So it ought to be understood from the outset by Senator Vallentine and the Democrats, in their headlong attempt to get a few grubby votes by putting up this bizarre proposition, the desperate leftovers--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Richardson is absolutely right. But my judgment is that, if Senator Richardson thought there were any greenie votes to be got out of not signing this thing, he certainly would not be signing it. I find it a unique curiosity that Senator Richardson and Senator Vallentine have a different view about this issue. Ultimately, bankrupt of policy, bankrupt of ideas and bankrupt of ideals, the Democrats and Senator Vallentine have drawn themselves together in pursuit of whatever irresponsible leftover greenie vote there is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This proposal will do more to damage the Antarctic than anything I can imagine. I can think of nothing more irresponsible than the proposal put forward by Senator Vallentine that we ought not to be even a party to agreements of this nature. To propose the concept of an Antarctic World Park is absolutely absurd. The first thing that would happen if we had a world park is that the present Antarctic Treaty would collapse. It could not function if the Antarctic was a world park. I am glad to see the Democrats have gone across to rescue their soul mate and bring her back to the chamber to defend herself. The truth is that because we have an Antarctic Treaty, because we do not have a world park concept, there is an environmental regime in place and certain disciplines and responsibilities are cast upon the various members of the Treaty and those who have agreed to it. For the benefit of Senator Vallentine I will read out the general principles of the Antarctic mineral resources convention. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>No Antarctic mineral resource activity shall take place if it is judged to cause:</PARA>
<PARA>significant adverse effects on air and water quality;</PARA>
<PARA>significant changes in atmospheric, terrestrial or marine environments;</PARA>
<PARA>further jeopardy to endangered species;</PARA>
<PARA>risk to areas of special biological, scientific, historic, aesthetic or wilderness significance;</PARA>
<PARA>significant adverse effects on global or regional climate and weather patterns. </PARA>
<PARA>No Antarctic mineral resource activity shall take place unless it is judged that:</PARA>
<PARA>technology and procedures are available to provide for safe operations and compliance with the above;</PARA>
<PARA>there is the capacity to monitor key environmental parameters;</PARA>
<PARA>there is the capacity to respond effectively to accidents. </PARA>
<PARA>Area of Application: Includes the continent of all Antarctica, all Antarctic islands, including all ice shelves, south or 60 degrees south latitude and in the sea bed and subsoil of adjacent offshore areas up to the deep sea bed. </PARA>
<PARA>That is saying, in effect, that there shall not possibly be any mining in that area in my lifetime, and I suspect in the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Richardson" NAMEID="4E4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator Richardson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or even in my life.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or even in Senator Richardson's lifetime. That is simply because it will not be possible to fulfil the obligations of the regime with those conditions. Let us remind ourselves of what prospecting is allowed, for those honourable senators steeped in knowledge of exploration. The entry level to mineral resource activity is limited to activities meant to identify areas of mineral resource potential for possible exploration and development. Geological, geochemical and geophysical investigations and field observations, remote sensing and collecting surface sea floor and sub-ice samples are all permissible. Drilling beyond a depth of 25 metres and dredging and exploration other than for small scale samples are not permitted. By any measure it simply allows for very superficial exploration under the most strict regime imaginable and under circumstances that prohibit and proscribe any form of exploration in the Antarctic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If Third World countries are able to go to the Antarctic because they are not signatories to the minerals regime, and they have no obligations or commitments and are not parties to a treaty, there are no parameters or responsibilities cast upon them as to how they will conduct their exploration and what concern they shall have for the environment and the effects of their exploration upon the environment. If Australia does not sign the convention then it cannot seek amendments. Under the proposed treaty no amendments can take place for 10 years-for very good and sensible reasons. Following that decade, with the hindsight of experience, knowledge and better understanding, amendments can be moved. In the event Senator Vallentine would have her way it would be quite impossible for Australia to participate in those discussions, negotiations and agreements and ultimately move amendments which would rectify any part of the agreement which experience has taught ought to be so moved. </PARA>
<PARA> The minerals regime will put in place measures to regulate future mineral activity which the Antarctic Treaty does not. When the Treaty was first signed in 1961, and in its early stages, it was never imagined that exploration or mining was likely to take place. It was almost incomprehensible to those nations that they would ultimately have the capacity to do so. In many respects it still is. That is why it really contains no mention of mineral rights. There are a number of companies in the United States and Japan who I suspect are conducting prospecting and mineral exploration in the area. I suspect some other nations, under the guise of other activities, are probably doing exploration work and seeking to identify what minerals, precious metals and other resources are in the Antarctic. This regime is intended, after six years of endeavour, to lay down some guidelines ahead of activity by mining companies or nations. It is an opportunity for Australia to contribute. But at the end of the day it is fundamental that there be a proper public discussion and an airing of all points of view in respect of the Antarctic. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last few years we have seen-I am sure Senator Richardson will agree-very inadequate government funding of Antarctic research. Frankly, the reason we have become a joke on the international stage of those nations who have an interest in the Antarctic is that we claim sovereign rights over 42 per cent of the Antarctic-an enormous area-and we spend a paltry sum to justify our claim. If we had to justify our claim in the Antarctic based on the amount we spend on it or our representation down there, or by scientific research, we would have to forfeit the claim, hand it back and apologise for our conduct. We now have an opportunity to make a contribution towards the debate. Senator Puplick's motion reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The need for the Australian Government to promote adequate public discussion of all of the issues arising in relation to whether or not Australia should become a signatory to the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities (CRAMRA). </PARA>
<PARA>It is a thoroughly proper and responsible attitude, not a blinkered, obsessed, myopic, subjective attitude driven by political expediency by a group of senators destined for failure and defeat at the next election. They are making a last dying gasp for a breath of fresh air, looking for a constituency which by and large is deserting them because of their irresponsibility and conduct in this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my summary I shall deal with the speakers-probably with the exception of the last, who did not have very much that was worth refuting-in the order in which they spoke. In regard to the speech made by Senator Puplick in putting forward an amendment to my urgency motion, obviously he is trying to avoid voting on the issue of the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities (CRAMRA). The urgency motion was intended to elicit a view from the Government and the Opposition about whether they would be supporting CRAMRA-and that is exactly what Senator Puplick is avoiding. He does not want to have to vote on this because the Opposition has not made up its mind, and it also seems that the Government has not made up its mind. The community certainly has made up its mind, but we are not privileged to hear what the Opposition has decided as it is still confused. I am not confused. I am not confusing the two issues about CRAMRA and a world park. They are mutually exclusive. There is no confusion about the issues in my mind or in my urgency motion. Mining is not compatible with wilderness objectives. Some tourism is possibly compatible and that aspect needs to be looked at in more detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Puplick also mentioned the involvement of the United Nations and one possible plan for the management of a mining-free Antarctica, but it is not a foregone conclusion that it would be under United Nations jurisdiction. That is only one possible plan among many which has been put forward, as Senator Coulter said. We need to look very creatively at what kind of jurisdiction there would be over a world park. It is not necessarily even a popular proposition. A world park would indeed involve a great deal more consultation about the primary objective, which is the conservation of the Antarctic natural environment as far as that is possible, considering what has already happened there in terms of scientific development and the consequent degradation of the environment that has already occurred, mainly due to pollution. (Quorum formed) There is no reason why the international cooperation that we have seen in Antarctica should not continue if the main aim of the scientific community there is to continue with scientific research and to conserve the fragile environment. There is no reason why there should be further politicisation of the area there, which would happen if this mineral Convention were signed. Then there would be a good reason for politics and questions of sovereignty to come to the fore. There would then be a great deal of debate about the rights of various countries and various companies to have adequate access to Antarctica. But if we prevent mining happening, there is no reason why international cooperation should not continue. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend Senator Coulter's statements. He reflected the more sane position-one that is shared by most people in the community-that as far as possible we should not interfere further with the natural state of Antarctica as it is known to us now. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Archer's sentiments, which were very laudable, were to the effect that whatever we do should be in harmony with nature. I could not agree more. Mining cannot be in harmony with nature; it is exploitative. We cannot have it both ways. I agree with Senator Archer that we need a decision soon so that the international community can get on with the business of conservation rather than exploitation in Antarctica. It would be preferable, as Senator Archer said, that this should be a bipartisan policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) reaffirmed his opposition to mining in Antarctica, but right at the end of his comment he said `until Cabinet decides otherwise or may decide otherwise'. I wonder whether he was flagging the intention of Cabinet in that somewhat unguarded remark. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Then I hope that Senator Richardson's opposition to mining is absolute and will not be swayed in any way. I hope that he will be going in to bat for the environment in Antarctica as he has done in other places. We cannot imagine, as Senator Richardson said, that this Convention will in some way monitor mining to ensure that it does not interfere with the environment. It will be a licence to go ahead and mine. We cannot attempt to stop mining by having a mining convention. It is a contradiction in terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There needs to be a lot more discussion about tourism, as Senator Puplick said, and it needs more discussion in the community. I do not care what other countries have already signed the Convention. I think that is irrelevant to the debate. Australia is in a very good position to take a lead in this matter and we have an opportunity to veto CRAMRA. We should take the strong position and not be guided by what other countries have signed so far. In some cases their reasons for doing so are dubious, particularly in respect of Chile and Argentina, which hope to get their share of whatever mining spoils there might be. </PARA>
<PARA> Questions of sovereignty, subsidisation and incentives for the exploitation of mineral resources in Antarctica have been raised. On that score the Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, has some doubts, as does the Treasurer, Mr Keating, as I mentioned earlier. Maybe it is strange for the environment movement to have support from the Treasurer, but it makes a nice change, and we welcome that. </PARA>
<PARA> Still, at the end of this debate, we have not a position from the major parties. We have not a clear position from either the Opposition or the Government about whether they would support the signing of CRAMRA. The Australian Democrats and at least two Independents will vote against this watered down amendment put forward by Senator Puplick-not because we are opposed to further discussion on this issue, which we think is very important, but because we wanted a stronger statement. We wanted to find out the clear positions of the Government and the Opposition on CRAMRA. Obviously they are not prepared to give us this sort of statement. No wonder there is disillusionment in the community with the two major parties, which are so wishy-washy and so similar to each other that it is difficult to distinguish between them. We have not heard very much variation in the views of the Government and Opposition, and that is typical of so many debates in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> There are lots of green votes in this issue and the Government and the Opposition should be aware that the public will not be duped by their doublespeak that a mining convention will prevent mining in Antarctica. It is a contradiction in terms. If the Government decides to sign CRAMRA, it needs to be well aware of the fact that there will be a huge fuss in the Australian community. Today it is being given due notice of that fact. Australia has the power of veto. I hope that the Government will heed the wisdom of the people on the issue of protecting Antarctica, not just for our sakes but for future generations. Collectively we have managed to stuff up the environment of earth's atmosphere and of the five developed continents.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) Report on Food Processing and Beverages Industries is an interim report on Government regulation of packaging and labelling. In recent months the Australian Democrats have been concerned about a move that seems to be under way towards considerable deregulation in the area of packaging and labelling, particularly of food products. Certain elements of this report give us concern in that area. I recall the earlier report of the Business Regulations Review Unit last November when this issue was raised by us and when we expressed the concern that we express here today. The Democrats believe that labels on food should give more information rather than less. </PARA>
<PARA> I point to some of the issues addressed in this report. For instance, we express concern that the Industries Assistance Commission is putting before us the prospect of allowing industry to use misleading terms such as `giant kilogram', `jumbo' and `bonus pack'. We believe that is not in the interest of consumers. The proposal is to remove the code of practice for deceptive packaging as well. While there are some arguments advanced in the report, we believe that the current code covers the requirements of consumers and should not be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> We recognise that industry may find it inconvenient to give full and accurate information to consumers but we do not believe this is any excuse for lowering standards. It is difficult enough for consumers to do battle in the supermarkets, to sift out fact from fiction in the heavy promotional advertising that is so much a part of our daily lives and to ensure, particularly in the supermarket situation, against price rise rip-offs without expecting them also to cope with misleading labelling, misleading packaging and reduced information. </PARA>
<PARA>1444</PARA>
<PARA> SENATE 12 April 1989...Food Processing and Beverage Industries</PARA>
<PARA> One of the other recommendations in this report is the requirement to specify that a product is artificially sweetened by whatever the artificial sweetener is. We believe that that should not occur either. It is of great concern to many consumers that they have full information about the ingredients in products. The IAC claims that currently there is a double requirement because, of course, there is a requirement for the identification of ingredients. It believes that the fact that the artificial sweetener will be included in the list of ingredients is sufficient for the consumer. We say it is not. Because there are grave concerns about some artificial sweeteners, we believe that the consumer's attention should be drawn to the fact that such products are artificially sweetened. </PARA>
<PARA> In general terms, I express concern about the general approach of this report. In the first instance, I am not sure that it really is the role of the IAC to be involved in dealing with these sorts of issues beyond that aspect that we would agree with; that is, that we need a national system of uniformity in requirements for labelling and packaging of consumer products. We certainly agree with that. It is the IAC's role to promote that. But many of the aspects in this report relate to issues that are not genuine costs on industry; they are conventions and, in many cases, conventions that have developed into codes of practice in the interests of consumers and are not genuine costs on industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The claim by industry and by the IAC in this report that to reduce information to the consuming public will save the public money is a claim without any actual backing. Certainly, in the experience of average consumers, there is nothing to suggest that it would reduce the cost to the community. Once again, we want to go on the record as resisting the push towards deregulation in the area of packaging and labelling of foodstuffs in the interests of the Australian consumer. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This is another of those annual reports for the year ended last June being presented to this chamber in April this year. It is more evidence of appallingly bad reporting standards. It is about time the Government smartened itself up. It is not good enough to blame the organisations involved for this late reporting. For example, the financial section of the report is dated 23 November 1988. The Auditor's report is dated 24 November 1988. Surely the Government can get its act in order and present these to the Parliament at a time not contemptuous both of the Parliament and of the people of Australia to whom it is supposed to be reporting. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a little additional problem with this annual report that I would like to deal with. It is a problem not revealed in the printed part of the report on page 76, which deals with financial statements and which simply makes the bald statement that financial statements for the year ended June 1988 have been prepared on an accrual accounting basis and that the statements conform to the guidelines of the form and standard of financial statements et cetera. But, as is always the way in these matters, when one looks to the fine print of the accounts defined at the end of the annual report on page 95 one discovers that, yet again, there is more evidence-this time involving the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission-of simple administrative incompetence in the spending of taxpayers' money. Note 18 to the accounts states:</PARA>
<PARA>MINISTERIAL APPROVAL OF ESTIMATES</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission is required under sub-section 57 (1) of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission Act 1985 to submit estimates of expenditure for approval in a form directed by the Minister. Further, under sub-section 57 (2) of the Act, the Commission is required to expend moneys in accordance with the approval given by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>In accordance with the requirements of sub-section 57 (1) of the Act, Ministerial approval was sought on 26 June and 16 September 1987 for estimates of expenditure for the quarters ending 30 September and 31 December 1987 respectively. Ministerial approval was not obtained until 28 July and 26 October 1987 respectively resulting in first and second quarter expenditures of approximately $1.2 million and $1.5 million in advance of the Minister's approval. </PARA>
<PARA>The simple reality of that is that a Government body has been spending money in an unauthorised way simply because it is the only way for it to operate. Ministers involved have taken so long to get around to acceding to the requests. It may have been unreasonable to give the Minister four days before the commencement of a new quarter, as was the case with one of those applications, but the fact is that this organisation has blatantly broken the Act under which it operates. There is no sanction, no penalty and, even worse, no mention in the printed report of the fact that it has broken the requirements of the Act under which it operates. In the notes to the accounts it says this:</PARA>
<PARA>Procedures subsequently approved by the Minister will facilitate provision of Ministerial approval prior to any expenditure of Commission funds. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it appears that at last they are getting around to smartening up the procedure so that this illegality does not continue. We have seen repeated examples in annual reports of organisations breaking the rules, the laws under which they are operating, and in fact not operating in an effective and proper way in the regulation of taxpayers' funds. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that at last someone in the Government is going to respond to these continual complaints I make about these annual reports, particularly as to their lateness. Until they do, I shall keep up this attack, if you like, on what is clear governmental incompetence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An unauthorised and, indeed, illegal way. Eventually they caught up with the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) and got him belatedly to authorise it. They have now taken precautions against a similar thing happening in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition to this sloppiness, appendix 8 on page 121, dealing with the legislation administered by the Commission, states that the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission Act was proclaimed in December 1985 and that the regulations came into effect on 20 February 1985. I presume that is a misprint for February 1986, but it is certainly a sloppy little error. </PARA>
<PARA> The report was unavailable until it was tabled, and I have only had a chance to glance through it superficially. It looks as though we are running the biggest $17m talkfest Australia has ever had. That is all they seem to have done. I notice a whole series of resignations. The Queensland member of the Commission retired in June last year and, as far as I can tell from this, he has not been replaced. During 1987-88 the following people served but had resigned prior to certain dates: Mr Kevin Power, the nominee of the Commonwealth Minister for Industrial Relations, resigned in August 1987; Mr Ron Reid, the nominee of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, resigned in August 1987; Dr Brian McGuirk, the nominee of the Premier of Western Australia, resigned on 7 December 1987; Mr Jim Brassil, Chairman of the National Commission, resigned on 14 March 1988; Mr Graham Swan, the nominee of the Premier of Queensland, resigned on 18 March 1988. A lot of people seem to have got sick and tired of this talkfest. I notice in the schematic representation on page 5, describing the Department, that the Occupational Medicine Unit position had not been filled as at 30 June 1988. I can only hope it has been filled by now or the place will not be operating effectively at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I join my voice with that of Senator Michael Baume. I deplore the lateness of the report and the sloppy administration, and I wonder about the series of resignations that have taken place in the Commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am interested to note the comments of my colleagues opposite and what might be a priority of emphasis when somebody gets up to speak on a report. The honourable senators seem to have turned to the back of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission to find out just how much money it has spent. I would like to return to the front of the report and find out what it spent it on. The figures listed on page 10-they are now a year behind; as I understand it, those figures have been updated-remind us that over 500 Australians are killed each year as a result of traumatic occupational injuries alone, and the number of deaths from occupational disease each year is thought by many to be considerably higher than 500. In fact, more recent figures provided to me say that the figure is now 550 deaths in work each year, although 20 per cent of those deaths are said to be in journeys to and from work. More than 300,000 Australians suffer work injuries each year. They are the figures of the greatest pertinence in this report and they are the ones that should be in the forefront of the minds of senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another point in that very same paragraph, a point that the Opposition never remembers, is that in 1986 Australians lost 10 times as much time from work as a result of occupational injury and disease as from industrial action. The Opposition would have us understand that days lost at work are due to industrial disputes. It never reminds us that at least 10 times as many days are lost as a result of occupational injury and disease. The preliminary cost of workers compensation claims for 1987-88, calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics from the Australian National Accounts unpublished data, was $4.79 billion. This direct cost alone was 1.6 per cent of the gross national product. Those figures do not include the occupational injury and illness loss; nor do they put any figure on human misery and suffering or the pain, anxiety and chaos caused in families when a worker is lost to the work force and the income from the worker is lost to that family. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting that Senator Sheil says that. That is precisely what we need. If he read the front of this report he would know that until this Government came into office and actually focused on a national view of occupational health and safety those figures could not be stated. The figures that were given to me in 1983, 1984 and 1985 were still citing 300 deaths. They were very wrong and had been underestimated because there were no national statistics, no national data and no national perspective on occupational health and safety. That is what this Commission has been established to try to find out, to try to collate and provide. In fact, if Senator Sheil read the early pages he would have a better idea of just why the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission justifies the expenditure made on it. If Senator Sheil actually wants to worry about $1m out of $17m, then I remind him of the cost that is put on occupational health and safety in this country-now up to $6 billion. I think that $1m here and there, while we cannot ever disregard it, is not really of such pertinence against the cost of accident and injury and disease in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The early chapters explaining the work of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission, of its emphasis of comparison between Australian and overseas data, other countries and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, put Australia very low down and certainly give us no cause for comfort in looking at the occupational health and safety performance in this country. But with the formation of the Commission, with the national perspective, with the changed legislation introduced by most States in this country in the last couple of years, we are now getting a much better handle on the numbers, a much better idea of the costs, and a much better understanding of the steps necessary to prevent illness, disease and accident and promote safe practices. The formation of the national perspective, the Commission and the tripartite nature of the committees involved have led to a considerable improvement in understanding the issue, its significance, size and importance. I would hope to see in the next annual report some considerable movement, particularly in the collection of statistics, and data which are promised in this report for the first time ever to be comprehensive national statistics. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>It is with considerable satisfaction that I commend the equal employment opportunity annual report of the Australian Industry Development Corporation, which provides us with an accessible, brief, concise, well produced means of identifying exactly what has been achieved in the AIDC in relation to its responsibilities under the Equal Employment Opportunity (Commonwealth Authorities) Act, which was proclaimed on 1 July 1987. I believe this report provides a model for how such reports should be produced and, apparently, for how such an exercise should be conducted. </PARA>
<PARA> The report describes the relevant history of the AIDC. It describes how it is a small organisation which needs complex financial and technical skills among its staff. Consequently, 80 per cent of its staff have post-secondary training and 60 per cent have tertiary qualifications. I imagine that that makes it unique among many organisations, but perhaps there are quite a few statutory authorities of similar size in that category. The report states that this requirement for a complex skills base can act as a barrier to entry to and promotion within operator streams for members of designated groups. However, since this organisation has been implementing its equal opportunity policy, of the 180 current staff 17 have been promoted from support positions to professional ranks. I emphasise that this is extremely significant. The individuals employed in support positions might never have had such opportunities to move out of those streams into professional ranks without the strategies that have been adopted and encouraged by this Government. Nine of those promoted officers are women and five of those women have been moved from support departments to business divisions. Once again, it is a very commendable record on the part of the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation has clearly allocated responsibility for the development of the equal employment opportunity policy to the Chief Manager, Human Resource Management. The report takes us through the steps that have been followed and that are required in order to ensure that, initially, employees are informed of the exercise; that wide consultation is held with employees and trade unions; that statistics are provided; and that the whole plan is monitored and evaluated. Most important of all, perhaps, is the fact that, as a result of this process, the Corporation has a plan for the next two years. I repeat: I believe the Corporation should be congratulated for having competently, wholeheartedly and without any fuss set itself the task of implementing equal employment opportunity. I wish it every good fortune. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fifteenth report of the Committee of Privileges dated March 1989 deals with the Committee's findings in relation to evidence presented during Senate Estimates committee hearings in relation to Project Parakeet. On 6 December 1988 the Senate resolved, on the findings of the President, that there were grounds for reference to the Privileges Committee of this motion:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Whether false or misleading evidence was given to a Senate Estimates Committee in relation to the Department of Defence project known as Project Parakeet, and whether a contempt of the Senate was committed in the giving of that evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 10 of the findings of the Committee reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has concluded that there was no intention to give any false or misleading evidence to a Senate Estimates Committee in relation to the Department of Defence project known as Project Parakeet. It follows, therefore, that no contempt of the Senate was committed in the giving of that evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>I accept the findings of the Committee. They fully vindicate my reference of the matter to it-a reference which was not taken without a great deal of thought and deliberation because the charges laid were of the utmost gravity. There are few more serious charges than that of misleading the Parliament, for which severe penalties are exacted. The Committee found:</PARA>
<PARA>There was no intention to give false or misleading information. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee did not find that the Senate had not been misled by the evidence tendered to it. Indeed, it tacitly accepts that the Senate was misled, as a careful reading of the section preceding the Committee's findings, entitled `Conclusion', would lead anyone to see. The operative word, of course, in the findings of the Privileges Committee is `intention'. The Committee could not prove beyond reasonable doubt that the intention to give false or misleading evidence existed. In the circumstances, no other finding was possible. My central concern, however, was not with `intention', but with `false or misleading evidence'. I recommend that honourable senators read the `Conclusion' section of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now deal in a little more detail with the background of this matter. The matter being inquired into by the Senate Estimates Committee was the development and acquisition of part of a communication system for the Defence Force-Project Parakeet. The project has five phases, and the first three have been completed. When the contract was let to the prime contractor, a company called Racal Electronics Pty Ltd, the expectation was that if the performance of the contractor was satisfactory throughout the first three phases, the final two phases would be awarded to the contractor. It goes without saying that the expectation was that the contractor would perform satisfactorily throughout all phases or he would not have been awarded the contract in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> Preceding the Estimates Committee meeting in April 1988, it was known to all of those who took an interest in the matter that there were serious problems with Parakeet. It was known, for example, that the Scandinavian subcontractor responsible for the switch gear, which was crucial to the system, was experiencing major problems in meeting the specifications. It was known that Racal had technical problems and significant management problems. It was known that the decision had been taken to recommend that the automatic follow-on of contracts be voided and the subsequent phases go to open tender. There were articles in the press. I knew of these problems before I attended the Estimates Committee hearing. It may seem strange to public servants that questions should be asked when the answer is known, but it is an old truism of politics that one does not ask a question until one knows the answer. While that statement is obviously not literally true, public servants would be surprised at the number of times that the answer is known to the questioner at a parliamentary committee hearing. </PARA>
<PARA> Project Parakeet was an important and expensive program about which there had been much public discussion. Dr McIntosh, the Chief of Capital Procurement, was the major witness for the Department of Defence. He knew at the time that he was recommending to the Minister that the project be cancelled. It is against this background of knowledge that the evidence given to the Senate Estimates Committee on 11 April by Dr McIntosh must be judged. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the relevant passages from the Senate Estimates Committee Hansard, which are printed in the Committee report. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The passages read as follows-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What will happen about Project Parakeet? Will that be affected by any of these financial decision in this subdivision?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-There are not proposals in the additional estimates that are affected by Project Parakeet. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the contract going ahead?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-At this stage there are no decisions that would affect additional estimates. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not what I asked. Does the major equipment project items of a saving of $157.5m, affect Project Parakeet? Do you mean that it is not included in there? There is no reduction, slippage, rescheduling or whatever we might like to call it?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-No, Senator, not in these additional estimates. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So the news report in the Sunday Telegraph of 27 March that Parakeet was in doubt was not accurate?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-I think that speculation of that kind is premature. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You make me more suspicious than ever by your answers. Do you realise that?</PARA></TALK.START>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is it not true that there are considerable technical problems with Parakeet?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-I think that is an overstatement. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is it not true that one of the major subcontractors is in difficulty?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-I think that, too, is an overstatement. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the project way over budget?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-At this stage, no. At this stage the completion of the most recent phase has occurred and it has not been way over budget. We are now examining proposals for the next phases. We have in front of us a set of proposals from the contractor for the next phases. Data is being considered within the Department for a recommendation to Ministers. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Are those proposals over budget?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-At this stage that is not yet clear. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is it behind schedule?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-Not significantly, no. We are actually considering what this last phase means to us and where we proceed from here. Until we have made a recommendation to Government on what those costs are, it is difficult to say anything else. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to go back to Parakeet and to Dr McIntosh's assertions that things are going well there. Do you categorically deny that there have been problems with the Scandinavian or Danish sub-contractor for the switch gear for that program?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-I am sorry, that is not what I said. I said that we had completed a phase and we were now examining the proposals for the next phase and those proposals will be put to the Minister. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the questions put to you earlier was to the effect as to whether there were any problems with Parakeet and the answer you gave implied that there were no problems with Parakeet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-I said that those assertions that you had made had been exaggerated. I did not say there had been no problems. In a development program of this kind, of course there have been. But at this stage we have proposals in front of us for continuing the project which are being considered. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Dr McIntosh has now answered the question three times. I wonder how many times he is expected to answer it? He has said that there are no significant problems. He has said it a couple of times now. I think that that is probably enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What is the timetable for project Parakeet?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What is the next phase?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-We are going through a development program. We have just completed the third phase. We are looking at completing phase 4 which is a continuation of the development before we enter phase 5, which is the production equipment. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Do you have in mind the equipment being in operation by a particular date? Are you, hopefully, working to a particular timetable?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-Yes, of course. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What sort of date?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Brig. Farry-The mid-1990s. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has that date been set back as a result of technical difficulties?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-At this time, no. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Was it always intended to be in operation in the mid-1990s?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-Yes, and as you would appreciate from that answer, in a development program of this kind where there was no equipment readily available off the shelf that met our requirements, it required us to undertake a staggered-staged, if you like-phase of development. The precise timing is then as vague as the mid-1990s. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has not been any slippage from your point of view in the development program in that you intended to be in operation in the mid-1990s from the beginning of the project and that is still, you believe, the likely date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-That is the date on which we are still planning, yes. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Are reports in the Press that the project is likely to be reopened for tender untrue?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-I am afraid I should not comment on that until propositions of whatever kind for the continuation of the program have been taken by Government. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not quite understand that answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It implies only that the Government has not made a decision on the next phase, I assume.</PARA></TALK.START>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is that what you mean?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-Yes, exactly. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But the Press report which talks about a phase being likely to be reopened for tender suggests that tenders had been sought and perhaps awarded. Was that for a particular phase?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-We have completed phases 1, 2 and 3. At the end of phase 3 the contractor is obliged to put forward proposals for phases 4 and 5 and those proposals are now being considered. When they have been considered recommendations will be put to Government and the Government will make decisions. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Have tenders been sought for phases 4 or 5?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-`Tenders' implies that we sought open tenders. What we sought were contractual commitments from the contractor as to how he would see continuing phases 4 and 5. There was a contractor who completed phase 3 and he has been asked to give us prices for phases 4 and 5. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously, if you have not submitted it to Government contracts have not been entered for either of those two phases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-Phases 4 and 5 we have yet to commit, of course. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So, therefore, reference to having to reopen a tender would appear to be incorrect?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-I am sorry, I have not said that at all. All I have said is that we have sought propositions from the current contractor, and the options that relate to those propositions will be put to government. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us move to Parakeet. What is the timetable on that?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Major-Gen Francis-I expect that there will be overall about a year's delay on Parakeet. We expect to be seeking approval for parts of Parakeet in the next Budget. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Where are we precisely with it from a contractual point of view?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Major-Gen Francis-At this point, the contract for phase 3 is complete and we will be seeking endorsement of phase 4. Exactly in what form we are still debating. We are not absolutely certain of the acquisition strategy that we will use in the near future for approval in next year's Budget. So there is no contract running at this time. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, but will it go to tender?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Major-Gen Francis-Yes, it will, to open tender. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is it not a fact that the Department is completely disenchanted with Racal and has no confidence in it, and that is why it is going to tender?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Major-Gen Francis-It is a fact that we are not continuing with Racal as the sole supplier, which was our original intention. There are a number of reasons for that. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because of the performance of the equipment?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Major-Gen Francis-Partly performance. The principal reason was that the cost it came in with as a tender for the next phase did not relate back to what the company predicted, and the price that it predicted was one of the significant factors upon which it was chosen in the first place. It would not be fair to other possible suppliers to continue with Racal under those circumstances. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What were the other reasons? You said it was the principal reason.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Major-Gen. Francis-We had some management problems with the company. It was in the process of sorting those out and we really had not got to the point of proving the point one way or the other when it put in its estimate of the next phase. At that point, we decided that there was no point in continuing with Racal for the next phase. So the company just continued and completed its work on phase 3. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Committee went into this in some detail last year. We were assured by Dr McIntosh that there were no problems with the performance of the contractor at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-That is not what you were assured. With respect, Mr Chairman, I too have brought my transcript and that was not what you were assured, with respect, Senator. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I put it to you, Dr McIntosh, that you misled the Committee there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-I do not believe so. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You were asked a question by Senator Newman and you said, `At this stage there are no decisions that would affect additional estimates', implying that things were going well. Later on I asked you if it were true that there were considerable technical problems with Parakeet and I later on went on to the switching gear. You told me that was a wild exaggeration. The general tenor of your replies to this Committee was that there were no difficulties which hazarded in anyway the future development of project Parakeet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-With respect, Senator, that is not at all what I said and I do not believe the transcript shows that. What I said was that there were no technical problems, and as you have heard from General Francis--</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is it not a fact that there were problems with the subcontractor with the switch gear?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-I can turn to Major-General Francis for the detail if you wish, but that was not a major concern at this stage, remembering that phase 3 as I outlined to you was paper studies and we were not into the building of technical equipment at that stage. But--</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I put it to you that it was a major concern of the Army. It might not have been of the civilian component, but it was certainly was of the Army.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Major-Gen. Francis-The concern of the Army at the time was that Racal would not guarantee the performance of that particular equipment in certain areas. They were in the process of sorting that out when we decided not to proceed because of the cost issue. I am pretty confident actually it would have been sorted out. It was not that the equipment necessarily would not perform, it was that they were not giving us a guarantee that it would. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The position at the moment is that we are at least a year behind schedule.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> CHAIRMAN-Dr McIntosh, you were in the process of giving an answer there and you were interrupted. Are you finished to your satisfaction?</PARA>
<PARA> Dr McIntosh-I think the issue has been well and truly covered. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a narrow and legalistic sense, Dr McIntosh's answers about the project being on-time and on-budget are correct. The contractor was finishing the third phase within the nominated time and budget. But Dr McIntosh knew that he had taken the decision to recommend to his Minister that the contract be voided-a major step-because the performance of the prime contractor was not good enough. He knew that this was in the papers. He knew that the Senate wanted information to judge how successfully the program was progressing. He knew that the reason for Estimates committees is essentially prospective, not retrospective; in other words, that Estimates committees are looking at expenditure ahead. He knew that the Senate wanted information on the future of this major program. By answering the questions from Senator Newman, from Senator Hill and from me, by sole reference to phase 3, he clearly implied to the Senate that all was well, as a reading of Hansard shows. The implications were clear that the future of the contract was in good standing. That was not a truthful answer. Dr McIntosh stands condemned also by his own written submission to the Privileges Committee. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>At the time of the hearing, phase 3 was concluding and the proposals for phases 4 and 5 were being considered. Discussions were being held with Racal who were being advised that the Department intended recommending to the Minister that they not continue as sole supplier for later phases. </PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, Major-General Francis, the Assistant Chief of General Staff, Materiel, in his submission to the Privileges Committee, after confirming the problems with EB/STK -the subcontractor for the switchgear-went on to say that in discussions with Racal he had found its tender prices for the next phases so high that he could not accept them and he could not recommend that it continue exercising its contractual obligations. I should at this point comment on and commend Major-General Francis for the directness of his answers and the readiness with which they were given. </PARA>
<PARA> The submissions from Dr McIntosh and Major-General Francis to the Privileges Committee quite clearly state that they were aware of major problems ahead for Parakeet at the time of the Estimates hearings. By their own admissions to the Privileges Committee, they confirmed that they knew serious problems were ahead. The Parliament was asked to approve money for this project but was given no inkling of these problems. Dr McIntosh chose to withhold this information from the Parliament. He chose instead to fence with the meaning of words. Indeed, Major-General Francis, in his first submission to the Privileges Committee, said:</PARA>
<PARA>It's my perception that the issue will be decided on opinions on the meaning of the words used by Dr McIntosh in April . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Major-General Francis was clearly uncomfortable with the stratagem used by his superior to conceal the facts from the Committee. Furthermore, in Dr McIntosh's submission we can see ambivalence where he is arguing that, on the one hand, he knew that the price was too high but, on the other hand, he did not know whether he could proceed with the contract, while at the same time he was recommending to his Minister that the contract be cancelled. Nor is it competent for Dr McIntosh to hide behind the construction that to have frankly answered the senators' questions would have pre-empted a ministerial decision. There was no question of that arising. There is always a Minister at the table ready and alert to intercede when questions beyond the legitimate bounds are asked. Senator Durack, in his speech on this report, drew attention to the fact that Dr McIntosh was not only a very senior public servant but a very experienced one in appearing before parliamentary committees. He could have answered clearly the questions that the senators were asking without pre-empting ministerial prerogatives or breaching commercial-in-confidence information. </PARA>
<PARA> The Parliament is not only entitled to be informed, but officials have an obligation to inform. I share Senator Durack's fears when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am rather concerned to read the views of a senior public servant that public servants do not have to volunteer information to a Parliamentary Committee or an Estimates Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>The whole purpose of Estimates Committees is to reveal the workings of government. It is not a game-least of all an adversarial contest over concealment. </PARA>
<PARA> I took no pleasure in referring this matter to the Privileges Committee. It is the first time in 11 years in the Senate that I have felt the need to do so. I am pleased that the Privileges Committee report vindicated my action and essentially found in my favour. I regret that Dr McIntosh's career has been blemished. A neutral Minister in the future will be influenced by this report. It is my earnest hope that witnesses before future parliamentary committees read this report of the Privileges Committee and understand clearly what the Committee is saying. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I can only re-echo the words of the Privileges Committee when it said that if Dr McIntosh had been as forthcoming with the Estimates Committee as he had been with the Privileges Committee, this sorry incident would not have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to continue some remarks I started to make last week on the report of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs. It was tabled in this place late last year. Before I comment on the matters within the report I would like to acknowledge the person who had carriage of this report in large part and that is my one-time South Australian colleague former Senator Ron Elstob. It was a massive task and it is a massive report. It was conducted by Senator Elstob in a very thorough and proper way. In some ways it is a very fine testimony to Senator Elstob's commitment to and on behalf of people who are not so well placed in this society to speak for themselves. Senator Elstob had a way of reducing complex ideas to pretty simple principles.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Hill. Senator Elstob was minded to say quite often that what he thought people should have was a right to education, a right to work, a right to health and health care and, as stated in this report, a right to adequate provision for them in their old age. I do not suppose there can be a better way of providing some kind of testimonial to Senator Elstob now that he is no longer in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would also like to make a statement of appreciation of two consultants who contributed so much to the work of the report, David Ingles and Daryl Dixon. This is a massive document. It covers a huge body of information in both the retirement pension area and the superannuation area. It is a tremendous resource document. It also has been a great challenge to those of us who struggled to get across it as it was being formulated. I am particularly appreciative of the assistance the consultants gave us in the task of trying to finalise that report. I would also like to thank all those other people who contributed and assisted the Senate Committee in producing this report. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not mind reminding the Senate that the reason we have this report was that the Opposition senators and the Australian Democrats were very annoyed at the time of the introduction of the assets test. They wanted a royal commission. They settled for terms of reference to be sent to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. That is why we tackled this mammoth task. I suppose it could be said that it is a very useful report, contributing as it does to the body of information in this very complex, complicated area and, in particular, very expensive area. </PARA>
<PARA> When tabling the report, my colleague Senator Zakharov, who has just joined us in the chamber, said:</PARA>
<PARA>In 1987-88, the cost of providing age and service pensions amounted to $8.9 billion. The estimated cost to the Commonwealth of superannuation tax concessions exceeded $3.5 billion for the same period. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the generally low level of benefits received by most superannuants, together with the fact that only 8 per cent of the population aged 65 years and over receive any income from superannuation, and less than 5 per cent rely on such benefits as their principal or main source of income in retirement, it is not surprising that a large number of those who contributed to the inquiry questioned the effectiveness of the Government's role in providing financial assistance for the occupational superannuation system. </PARA>
<PARA>That highlights in a very brief way some of the vital comparisons that need to be made when we are looking at the challenges facing governments if they want to address the proper financing of income support for people beyond working age, that is, in their retirement and old age. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures in this report give one considerable pause. The costs are huge and, as any demographic study will show, the numbers of people coming into this category of `beyond retirement' will increase over the next 20 to 50 years, and it is a matter of serious consideration for governments. How will that be afforded by our society? This report gives some very interesting and provocative ways of thinking about the mix between superannuation and pensions in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I briefly want to allude to the points that I raised in a dissent from the majority report. First of all, I wanted to disagree with recommendation No. 6 to extend the availability of Commonwealth pensioner fringe benefits to all age and service pensioners. In an ideal world, it would be fine to provide pensioner fringe benefits to everybody in receipt of pension or part pension. But, as I have just said, the cost of the age pension income support, let alone the fringe benefits that go with it, is very high and will only get higher. </PARA>
<PARA> Over recent years the Government has been very effective in targeting its pension and benefits payments to those people most in need. I could not see why we should move away from the practice of continuing to target to those most in need provisions under pensioner benefits services, including the fringe benefits that go with the pensions. While I appreciate that some people at the margin-that is, those people on part pension in receipt of a small extra income-are denied pensioner fringe benefits, I do not believe that a universal adoptive of pensioner fringe benefits is the preferred way to go. I believe that this area is well worthy of further consideration by government so that the more significant pensioner fringe benefits might be made available in an increased or more targeted way. But I could not come down on the side of the universal provision of those benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> I objected to recommendation No. 12 that provided for the payment of the age pension at a standard single rate. Again, my principal concern was the clear cost implications which would have been quite massive. This recommendation tries to tackle the inequities that sometimes exist now. For instance, there is an income difference between two single rate pensioners and pensioners in receipt of the married rate pension-that is, two people in receipt of a single rate pension as against a married couple in receipt of a married rate pension. That does create some discrepancy. In fact, by adopting a single pension rate for everybody we would simply reverse the discrepancy and reverse the inequity. I am not sure that we should actually try to solve problems by creating inequities. Sometimes this happens, but certainly in this case my principal reservation is based again on the enormous cost implications. </PARA>
<PARA> I was also concerned about the provision of fringe benefits to all age and service pensioners because of the implications of costs to the States. A large number of the States provide a variety of extra pensioner fringe benefits which are usually allocated to those pensioners who are entitled to the pensioner fringe benefit card at the Commonwealth level. That makes good sense in terms of coherent administration and planning. But if we were to extend the pensioner fringe benefits concession to all pensioners or part pensioners, the State cost implications would be absolutely massive. Ultimately, the responsibility for meeting these costs would come back onto the Commonwealth Government which is the principal collector of income around this country. Again, it seemed to me that we are not even absolutely clear about what those State benefits are. The benefits vary from State to State and include such things as electricity, transport, rate and rent concessions. I believe we should perhaps again suggest that this is an area for further more comprehensive investigation. Again, we need to target decisions in that area. But again, cost implications were the principal reason that constrained me from supporting those recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to say that I think the report contains a very imaginative proposal. I refer to the two-tier provision of pension-a 20 per cent universal pension for aged people and then a much more targeted extra 10 per cent to those most in need. We did not actually vote on this recommendation, so it is not a question of whether I disagreed with the majority report. But, again, as we move towards targeting, I found that it would be running against the principles that are currently in place to move towards universality. While it could be argued, from a fuller reading of the report, that tax benefits could be given, I did not find the arguments persuasive. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, all of the implications in this report depend on good will and a bipartisan acceptance of the recommendations. But I see very little evidence of the bipartisan support that is necessary to implement such long term proposals as are contained in the report. In fact, I think it is not forthcoming. At this stage it would be foolhardy in the extreme to make recommendations on the basis of that kind of bipartisan support. I recommend the report to anyone with an interest in the provision of income support for aged and retired people. It is a thoroughly comprehensive and quite splendid resource document which is full of excellent up to date data and recommendations. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>In December 1987 the Committee sought and obtained a reference entitled `the central administration of the Australian Government'. This report is the first from the Committee under that reference. The efficiency scrutiny program had been widely publicised as a departure from the traditional approach to public administration and was expected to lead to a major change in public service culture and the general attitudes of public administration. The Committee believed that there would be value in evaluating the early experience of the program in the light of these claims. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the program ended earlier than expected, the Committee saw value in completing its inquiry. There has been little official reporting on the scrutinies to Parliament or the public. This report is, in fact, the first comprehensive public review of the efficiency scrutiny program. The Committee believes that its conclusions will be useful to those responsible for efficiency improvement in the public service, especially if any attempt is made to revive the scrutiny technique. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Committee, I would like to thank Committee staff, witnesses to the inquiry and others who helped the Committee in its deliberations. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the remainder of my tabling statement. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Good work but could do better</PARA>
<PARA>The majority of the Committee concluded that there was considerable merit in the program but found fault with several aspects of its administration. Every teacher or sporting coach knows that the hardest assessment to communicate is `good work but could do better'. The difficulty in striking this balance is reflected in the majority and minority reports which agree on the facts but disagree significantly on their meaning. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority view was that the monetary savings achieved by the program were significant and far outweighed its cost. The scrutiny program will have produced savings to the Commonwealth budget of about $193 by the end of June next year with ongoing savings after that of about $87 million every year. The direct costs of the program itself were in the $1 to $2 million range-a handsome return on a small investment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was sceptical as to the effects of the program on public service culture and attitudes. Many departments and agencies had little or no direct experience of the scrutiny process and this must have reduced its impact on culture and attitudes. Although ministers and departments expressed moderate support for the program in their submissions to the Committee, few have chosen to use the scrutiny technique themselves since the operations of the program were devolved to them in July 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>Centralisation versus devolution</PARA>
<PARA> The most important criticism of the program relates to inadequate central monitoring. There was clearly a tension from the beginning between competing philosophies described by the Department of Finance as `letting the managers manage' and `making the managers manage'. Mr Block and his Efficiency Scrutiny Unit were strong advocates of devolution-`letting the managers manage'. They seem to have applied the concept too enthusiastically to their own operations.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee concluded, while there were and are opportunities for decentralisation in the public sector, the scrutiny program struck the wrong balance between central control and autonomy. There are advantages as well as disadvantages in centralisation, especially in the use of a small central unit in efficiency review. The ESU could usefully have been:</PARA>
<PARA>a source of motivation for critical review of targeted aspects of public service operations;</PARA>
<PARA>a catalyst in that review by providing reviewers with specialist advice and an external mentor;</PARA>
<PARA>a clearing house for ideas so that innovations in one agency could be readily passed on to others;</PARA>
<PARA>a monitor of performance in implementation of reforms, and</PARA>
<PARA>a training ground for an important part of the future top management of the public service. </PARA>
<PARA> The ESU did all of these things, some of them less effectively than it could have. The Committee concluded that the decision to devolve responsibility for scrutinies to departments was a decision not to improve the Unit's performance in these tasks but to stop seeking the benefits of centralisation altogether. We have recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA>a mechanism be developed to allow for central monitoring of efficiency improvement initiatives by Australian Government departments and agencies; and</PARA>
<PARA>in conjunction with this, the formal requirements for departments and agencies to report on their efforts to improve efficiency should be strengthened. </PARA>
<PARA>Accountability to Parliament</PARA>
<PARA>It is disturbing that there was no provision in the program for reporting to Parliament. The reporting system may have been sufficient to inform the Government of the performance of departments and agencies in particular scrutinies. It was certainly not sufficient to allow the Parliament to hold the Government accountable. </PARA>
<PARA> We have recommended that all future efficiency improvement programs should include a provision for annual reporting of results to Parliament. This would be of advantage to the executive as much as to the Parliament. It would force efficiency reviewers to rigorously evaluate their own performance and would allow their claims to be publicly tested. </PARA>
<PARA> The alternative method of accountability-detailed scrutiny after the event by committees like this-is slower, less consistent and, possibly more painful to the Government in the long run. </PARA>
<PARA>Risk management</PARA>
<PARA>A major theme of the scrutiny program was risk management. The Committee found, however, that a only few, albeit important, scrutinies directly sought to improve risk management in the public service. It is also clear that the concept was already widely applied in the public service. </PARA>
<PARA> We noted some concern on the part of the acting Auditor-General that the rhetoric on risk management might have led to some element of substitution of licence for intelligent operation. The current Auditor-General expressed similar concerns at a Committee hearing last week. </PARA>
<PARA> We have recommended that the Department of Finance should report to Parliament by the end of this year on the effectiveness of risk management approaches flowing from the scrutiny program. </PARA>
<PARA>Other criticisms</PARA>
<PARA>There appeared to be a wide-spread perception in the public service that consultation between scrutineers and those working in the areas they examined had been inadequate and that the Department of Finance was excessively zealous in harvesting the savings from scrutinies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee accepted that both these factors were problems and would have been caused difficulties if further cross-departmental scrutinies had been undertaken. We were sympathetic, however, to the Finance argument that quick action needed to maximise the benefits of the program, especially given the scale of the potential savings from the larger scrutinies. </PARA>
<PARA>Success or failure?</PARA>
<PARA> We concluded that the long-term effect of the scrutinies in increasing the concern for efficiency in the general public service was probably beneficial but small. The short-term savings, however, were large enough to justify a revival of the program when the pace of other change permits it. </PARA>
<PARA> The monetary savings achieved by Mr Block were very large in comparison to the costs of his Unit. It is likely that the scrutiny program also had a beneficial effect in increasing the concern for efficiency in the general public service culture. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Public Service has been extensively reviewed and reformed in recent years. Mr Block reached the conclusion that, although improvements are possible, the Australian people have grounds for pride in their public service. He went so far as to describe the Ministry and senior public servants collectively as national treasures. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority of the Committee agrees with the Prime Minister that Mr Block has made a significant contribution to the welfare of the citizens of Australia. We were pleased to agree with Mr Block that those citizens have reason for some pride in the standard of their public service. We emphasise that our criticisms of the scrutiny program and of the public service are intended to build on, not reflect on, the achievements of those involved in public administration at all levels. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the report of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration because it deals with a matter of considerable significance. As Senator Coates rightly said, it is true that there was a great deal of expectation about the achievements that might have derived from such an exercise as efficiency scrutiny. I regard it, however, as somewhat revisionist to suggest that from the outset it was contemplated that there would be a change in public sector culture. Indeed, I think that has been put forward after the event somehow to provide a basis for suggesting that there has been such change. Indeed, as I will demonstrate a little later on, I think that is also a vastly overblown claim.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is fair to say that the genesis of the Efficiency Scrutiny Unit (ESU) was the report of the Rayner unit in United Kingdom which had been operating since 1979 and which, over a seven-year period, had accounted for aggregate savings of #900m and reduced the annual running costs of the Civil Service by about #300m or 2.3 per cent. True to his utterly opportunistic and pragmatic approach to politics, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) seized on the achievements of the Rayner unit and put them forward as the principal justification for the establishment of a similar unit in this country. That unit was quite explicitly based on the Rayner unit. The Prime Minister said, in recognition of that fact:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the present economic climate requires the public sector to review systematically and in a quite fundamental way its management and administrative procedures, having regard to best private sector practice. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is significant that the Prime Minister was prepared to acknowledge that the public sector had a lot to learn from the private sector. Indeed, in his statement to Parliament in late 1986 he was at pains to say that the public sector had to shape up; that if it did not learn from the best techniques of the private sector it would be in big trouble; and that in the past in many ways it had reflected the easygoing, `she'll be right, mate,' management and work style of the lucky Australia of the 1960s and 1970s. There it was-purple rhetoric, pandering to those whom I regard as being substantially in the majority in this country amongst people who think about the issues-the statement that small government was a virtue, something to be striven for, something on which governments were increasingly expected to deliver. The Prime Minister, true to form, saw an opportunity there to capture part of that market and, as a result, headed off down the path of efficiency scrutiny units. I think there was at the time general approbation of that initiative. The tragedy of the matter, I think, is that what was a very good idea ultimately became no more than a cynical political gimmick. It did not last for any length of time and it was in fact closed down within a matter of days after the 1987 Federal election. I think that is a tragic outcome, because so much could have been achieved by a proper handling of the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr David Block, a prominent businessman with extensive private financial sector experience, was appointed to head the unit. In many ways much was expected of Mr Block. I think he was a victim of his own rhetoric and that ultimately he did not perform an adequate public service in this regard. When the Prime Minister did what he did in chopping the unit off at the knees after the 1987 election, Mr Block simply went quietly. He allowed himself to be used. He took the opportunity merely to say that he believed changes had been achieved in public sector culture and he was in no way critical of the fact that all of the principal objectives of the unit had simply been ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, when the Prime Minister announced the establishment of the scrutiny unit, it was to operate for a period of three years, it was to oversee an extensive program of scrutinies of selected areas of public sector administration, and it was to carry that out in a series of phased programs. Mr Block launched the initial program in October 1986 by asking all departmental heads to consult with their Ministers and nominate areas for possible scrutiny. He then proceeded to nominate departmental heads to provide scrutiny topics to the unit in November 1986. He selected the 37 topics that were subsequently designated for examination in the first round of scrutinies. The selection of topics was endorsed by the Expenditure Review Committee. Clearly, Cabinet regarded this as of priority, unless it was as cynical as the Prime Minister and was let in on the secret that this was mere window dressing to carry the Government up to the mid-1987 election. </PARA>
<PARA> The scrutinies began shortly after that, the scrutineers having been chosen in early 1987, mostly from middle management ranks of departments. I think there was within the Public Service a deal of anticipation that some progress could be achieved. The first round scrutinies were conducted over a 90-day period from January to March 1987. As they progressed, Mr Block, and I think through him the Australian public, came to accept that what was happening was a long term program to achieve significant change within the public sector, that principles of efficiency were to be regarded very highly, and that all managers in senior positions in the Public Service were expected to address these issues and to confront the unit in such a way that it would be clear that they were able to achieve significant savings in their own areas of responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> By May 1987, 37 first round scrutinies had been conducted and Mr Block was telling the Australian community that he expected a further 40 to be completed by the end of that calendar year. In fact, as I have indicated, virtually nothing happened between that time and the date of the July 1987 election. Three days after that, the Prime Minister effectively announced the demise of the unit. Of course, in the best traditions of salesmanship and public relations at government level, that was not a concession. There was simply an announcement that the Government had decided to devolve the program of efficiency scrutinies to individual departments and Ministers. The then Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Willis, was designated as the chair of a committee of Ministers with overall responsibility. Mr Block would be retained with his supporting unit, renamed the Administrative Reform Unit. It was then given an expanded charter to advise on broader issues of public sector management. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that from 14 July 1987 the Efficiency Scrutiny Unit was, for all practical purposes, dead and buried, and it remained dormant until it was officially pronounced extinct on 8 July 1988, when even the renamed Administrative Reform Unit was wound up. Mr Hawke then stated, in his usual euphemistic terms, that Mr Block had achieved marvellous results, that he had given his full concurrence to the disbandment of the unit, and that public sector cultures had been changed. To quote the Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Block has managed to promote an environment of reform and questioning of established practices within the Commonwealth administration which will have ongoing benefit for many years. </PARA>
<PARA>Not only is that high blown rhetoric, but I also regard it as verging on the dishonest. Nothing positive can be said about the achievements of Mr Block other than in a very modest manner. Later I will come to some of the limp testimonials provided by leading departments of the Commonwealth to indicate to what extent they regarded the unit as having achieved anything of significance or success in changing their attitudes to public sector culture. The fact is that the unit achieved very little. Worse than that, not simply was there window dressing; it made claims which were later demonstrated to be quite inadequate and its own processes were demonstrated to be quite inefficient and ineffective. </PARA>
<PARA> When we have regard to the political timetable, we are left wondering why the Prime Minister did not see any virtue in endeavouring to deliver the goods in this area. Presumably that will have to remain one of life's great mysteries. One of the most disappointing aspects of the whole exercise was the attempt by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration to ascertain the details of the estimated and actual staff and financial savings. When it was discovered that a question from Senator Archer to the Prime Minister was already on notice, it was thought wise to abide by the results of that question. In fact, it took more than eight months before the Prime Minister condescended to respond to Senator Archer's question. The figures that were ultimately provided were later revised downwards quite substantially and were couched in such terms that it was very difficult to comprehend precisely what was being alleged by way of savings. I think the view ultimately taken by the Committee, which we would endorse, was that those savings were exceedingly modest, probably about $36m a year. </PARA>
<PARA> The actual cost of conducting the unit is not disclosed, and certainly not the amount that was paid to Mr Block by way of consultancy fees. I would not suggest for a moment that they exceeded the alleged $36m of savings. Nonetheless, when we look at what could have been achieved as a percentage of running costs of the Public Service-when it was about 2.3 per cent in the United Kingdom, we find it was less than half of one per cent in Australia-then it is quite clear that nothing of substance was achieved. Not only are we disappointed at the dollar outcome, we are even more disappointed to find that the revised figures were misleading, inaccurate and unreliable. I think this highlights the travesty of claims to efficiency and belies the suggestion that somehow we now have a modern and efficient public sector that is using the latest performance indicators and targets and all the most modern management techniques. The reality is that the savings estimates provided, ultimately in the answer to Senator Archer's questions, were expressed variously in dollar terms over different years. Some of those estimates did not specify any price base at all. The overheads were variously costed at rates ranging from zero to 100 per cent of direct salary costs. Not all the figures allowed for the 25 per cent rebate, which was supposed to be available to departments that actually achieved significant savings. Neither the Efficiency Scrutiny Unit nor its successor reviewed the scrutineer's estimates or monitored implementation in any systematic or purposeful way. That is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> If ever one is entitled to expect that proper accounting techniques and efficiency approaches are going to be adopted, it is when we have a specifically designated efficiency scrutiny unit headed by someone the community regards as an expert in the field, someone with presumably good credentials for delivering. Yet what we find are the sorts of approaches that would make a suburban firm of accountants blush. It is therefore perhaps merely consistent with the very low estimate ultimately provided by the various departments of the work of the Efficiency Scrutiny Unit. Perhaps they go some way to explain why the Prime Minister was persuaded that there were not any more votes left after the election. Maybe that is the answer to the conundrum-that even the Prime Minister was embarrassed at the lack of substantive achievement. It did not stop him going on to make the usual claims about achievements but in reality they were virtually nil. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give some of those testimonials from the Government departments and hope that I do not ever find a collection such as these put forward to justify my achievements, or those of any of us on this side of the chamber. The Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs described the program as having provided `a modest impetus to public service reform'. Defence saw the process as forming `a small part of the way ahead'. Social Security regarded the process as merely a supplement to other activities; Foreign Affairs and Trade assessed the exercise as having been of limited value; and Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories felt that it was still too early for a full evaluation. Perhaps we could say they were damning the program with faint praise. It does not take much to comprehend what was really being said, stripping away the attempt at politeness and the endeavours to use jargon that might have been construed as fairly neutral. The fact is that they were kicking it to death. They were obviously not interested in cooperation. They did not regard themselves as having anything to learn or as having learned anything from the process in the short time that it operated. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the Prime Minister's claims were inadequate in the extreme. To suggest Mr Block's major contribution had been to make Public Service managers think in different ways is totally dishonest. To suggest, as it is now put forward, that somehow there has been a change in public sector culture is again quite wrong. I think the whole poverty of these claims can be seen from the actual achievements; in dollar terms they are very modest and in qualitative terms they are even less impressive. Therefore, I think the real tragedy of the exercise is that there was a lot that could have been achieved if there had been a serious commitment on the part of the Prime Minister, if there had been a genuine appreciation of the need to achieve savings and efficiency within the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> True to the Prime Minister's incomparable ability to wax and wane, to blow with the wind, one only has to look at what he said in a speech last October to the national conference of the Royal Australian Institute of Public Administration. Having praised the ESU when it was first established, having said what a marvellous job Mr Block had done and having based the whole establishment of the unit on the notion that the public sector had much to learn from the private sector, by October 1988 Mr Hawke was talking much more about the public sector being able to teach the private sector. He made virtually no reference to the application of private sector ideas. His attitude was, if anything, the reverse-talking of streamlining measures and setting an example to the private sector by accelerating the drive for greater efficiency in the public sector. In our dissenting report we regard that as a complete capitulation to traditional public service orthodoxy, as setting back the cause of reform, indicating beyond doubt that this Government is not interested in pursuing these matters, and that Mr Block and the ESU had merely a transient and ultimately negligible impact on Public Service attitudes. In fact, they may have set back the cause for genuine public sector reform. </PARA>
<PARA> One can understand the cynicism of the Australian community that has a bill of goods sold to it in this way. If at the outset the Prime Minister had put forward more modest goals and had been honest with the community in the final assessment and the justification for winding the unit up so prematurely, then one might have been able to say that at least some modest progress had been made. In the light of all that obfuscation and the very unimpressive outcome one can only wait until there is a change of government before we can get back to the process of embracing genuine public sector reform. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few remarks supporting my colleague Senator Alston and make a couple of comments regarding the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. I too agree with the thrust of the report. The aims first announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) were laudable. We heard all of this huffing and puffing and we had the appointment of Mr David Block. We were looking at something that I believed was long overdue in this country. After the debacle that has occurred we are faced with a situation where the likelihood of any Public Service reform or scrutiny has virtually gone out the window. It would be a very brave person or government that attempted to do something again in the wake of what has happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that when the Prime Minister first started on this exercise and announced what he saw as the main objectives he was basing it on a scrutiny by Sir Derek Rayner in the United Kingdom that had lasted seven years and had reduced public service running costs by 2.3 per cent. How the powers that be could compare this particular effort with that one is beyond imagination. The upshot of it is that after such a short time we ended up with the dubious savings of 0.5 of one per cent. I suppose if we take into account even the cost of the Committee looking at the efficiency scrutiny program, that would have been quite significant. It seems a shame that something that offered so much gave us so little. If one could believe the aims of the original exercise, it was something that we could look forward to with a great deal of enthusiasm. But here we are less than three years later looking at something that I do not think anybody can be all that proud of. As we have said in our minority report, we have ended up with a short, shallow political exercise. I do not believe that even David Block expected that to happen when he set off on this rather daunting task. As my colleague Senator Alston has said, within three days of the Government returning to office in 1987 the whole thing was virtually scrapped. Even though it was revamped, it was finally put to bed in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> A few people who gave evidence were concerned about the inadequate and superficial consultation that took place. Obviously it was a sloppy exercise from start to finish and it was not thought through in the way that it should have been. As an exercise that was set up to improve standards of management and accounting, as Senator Alston said a moment ago, it did not set much of an example for anybody, particularly as to the tardiness in replying to Senator Archer. I doubt whether anybody would be brave enough to try to attempt a similar exercise. It seems that the public sector will continue on its merry way without too many cost savings. I noticed a while ago the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) standing at the table testing himself out. I thought that we might be getting a sneak preview of what Australia is to expect over the next few months. </PARA>
<PARA> If this exercise is an indication of the way in which this Government performs, I feel that we have not much to look forward to. The position can be summed up by quoting the penultimate paragraph of the minority report of which Senator Durack, Senator Alston and I were the authors:</PARA>
<PARA>It is clear that Mr Block and the ESU had a transient and ultimately negligible impact on public service attitudes and practices save for the considerable time, energy and resources which the public sector was required to devote to what was essentially a public relations program. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I would like to take this opportunity to respond to the debate on the report of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration which has been tabled this evening. It is important that I should answer the comments made by Senator Alston and Senator Calvert and their minority report, and to provide some defence for the majority report. I found it sad to see the minority report from Opposition members of the Committee. I do not think that its language and tone was in the nature of a committee report; it was more like a political speech. It was full of exaggerated rhetoric, a good use of the Thesaurus on Senator Alston's part, since the minority report described the operation as feeble, shallow, shabby and so forth. He spread those words very nicely through the minority report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important to point out that the majority report was not a whitewash of the Efficiency Scrutiny Unit (ESU). It was a fair and reasonable commentary to which the Opposition members of the Committee could have been party. They could then have made the sorts of speeches they have made tonight, without the need for a minority report. If we are to have that sort of purely political minority report on an issue such as this, where there could have been the hope of some consensus, I think there is not much point in referring anything to Senate committees in the hope of achieving that sort of consensus. Much of what was said in the minority report could have been said in debate and not in what purports to be a report dissenting from the majority. When the Opposition members of the Committee made a number of comments about the draft report, modifications were made in an attempt to meet those comments. But those Opposition members went ahead anyway with what I think were excessively destructive comments about the Efficiency Scrutiny Review that were unfair in the strength of this criticisms. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall deal with a few particular matters. I shall not attempt to go over all the ground again, but a few things need to be said to answer and put in perspective the political criticisms which have been made. In regard to timing, the minority report talks of the review having been a shallow political exercise which was little more than a pre-election gimmick. Something announced in September 1986 for an election that might have been expected at the end of 1987 hardly falls within the definition of a pre-election gimmick. It was part of what has to be acknowledged as a continuing program of the Government's reform of the Public Service and its administration generally. It was welcomed at the time and should not have been damned in retrospect as much as it has been this evening by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members make great play of the fact that an announcement was made three days after the July 1987 election in changing the nature of the unit headed by Mr Block. Senator Alston tonight talked of the ESU having been closed down and that it was chopped off at the knees immediately after the 1987 election. But that operation continued for a further year in a different form, the so-called devolved form. I am not saying that I agree with this concept of devolution, but at least the Opposition, which is more supportive of that sort of concept, should acknowledge that that did happen and that the operation continued. It is hardly fair to say that the whole thing was closed down immediately after the 1987 election. The comment was made that the judgment had been made that there were no votes left in this issue after the election. I hardly think that some of these issues of administrative reform are a great central political issue for the public generally anyway. Attempts to make these reforms should be recognised much more as genuine attempts than the Opposition managed to do tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> Another issue raised in the minority report and also in Opposition comments in this debate is that the equivalent British operation saved 2.3 per cent of running costs, whereas the Australian exercise saved only 0.5 per cent. First of all, it very much depends on the definition of civil service running costs. Certainly the reference was to 2.3 per cent in Britain after seven years of the Rayner unit's operation, whereas the 0.5 per cent that was referred to was achieved in something over one year. One should at least be fair and make comparisons over a similar period. In any case, I did some fairly rough calculations on the equivalent amounts of money. Obviously it depends very much on one's definition of what constitutes civil service running costs. Clearly there is a major difference in definition of running costs between the two governments, so it is very simplistic to make that comparison. We reject that simplistic comparison. </PARA>
<PARA> In any case, the numbers are only one thing. There is also the question of the overall impact on attitudes as an indicator of performance. There are other issues around that one could surmise were involved at that point in 1979 when the British unit began for example, and there was more scope for review and for cost cutting compared to the equivalent position that the Australian Government was in at the time. Making these sorts of international comparisons in such a firm way as saying one was 2.3 per cent and the other was 0.5 per cent is pretty unreasonable and does not take into account the different range of other measures which were being undertaken in different countries at the time and at different times. </PARA>
<PARA> I also thought it was a bit unreasonable of the Opposition members to put in the minority report paragraphs 15 and 17 as if they were comments of their own. They used comments that were made by the Committee in the majority report as if that were part of their disagreement. The commentary made by the minority in paragraphs 15 and 17 were contained in the majority report and therefore was not a matter of disagreement. There was also some suggestion by the minority that the Committee report attempted to down play the achievements of Rayner in the United Kingdom and Grace in the United States. The only point of our making those comparisons was that they were more or less equivalent attempts to show that there had been this sort of review tried elsewhere and that there had been similar situations of falling short of the initial promise. I do not think there was any attempt to say that this operation was much better than that in the UK or US equivalents, but merely to say that here were the comparisons and that there was less achieved than might have been in all cases. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am disagreeing with is the suggestion that, because Rayner and Grace were done by conservative governments overseas, they were wonderful and the Australian one was not. I do not think that suggestion ought to be made any more than the opposite suggestion because all three did have trouble with implementation. What those two overseas examples found was that there was a lot more scope for cuts in policy areas than in administration. That is where those overseas studies strayed into the area of policy rather than straight administrative savings. The British auditor found that five of the 32 scrutinies examined over there accounted for more than 70 per cent of the savings. There is a similar parallel with the Block scrutinies here. It is not so much that any of the three was good or bad but that all three indicate that the scope for squeezing savings out of the bureaucracy can be overestimated, especially by those who do not have to do it. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing I should comment on is the size of the savings. I think Senator Alston in his comments tonight said that all that had been achieved was a measly $36m a year. In fact, $36m was the amount we quoted for the first year. It was expected that by the 1989-90 financial year it would go to $87m for a total over the three years of $193m of savings. I think we ought to get the facts right as to what the report says has been saved in this operation. The minority report refers to the savings-whether they want to stick to $87m or use the $36m figure-as modest. I would like to suggest that savings of that order per year-$87m-are not at all modest, and certainly not at all modest compared to the $1m or $2m-an amount of that order-that was the cost of the operation. </PARA>
<PARA> The suggestion is also made that this whole thing of changing the culture was something thought up after the event, that it was parenthetic. Paragraph 30 says that it was a canard perpetrated by the myth makers. But, as is generally agreed, the whole of the Block program was inspired by the Rayner operation in the United Kingdom and there are plenty of records of the fact that that report was about cultural change. It therefore has to be accepted that changing attitudes within departments was, to a large degree but not solely, what Block was all about. I do not think you can claim that because the success was not as great as had been promised therefore it means that the whole thing was a failure. You cannot say that. Nor can you say that there was not reference to cultural change at the time of the formation of the Efficiency Scrutiny Unit. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other comments I could make on the political rhetoric, which saddened me, in the minority report but I will not take any more time now to do that. All I would say in conclusion, while carrying no particular brief for Mr Block, but in order to answer the criticisms made of him and of the unit in the operation by the Opposition, is that David Block is the same person whom the conservative colleagues of the Opposition parties are using in New South Wales in the form of the Greiner Government to do what I understand is something of a similar operation. If members of the Opposition are going to be critical of the operation here, they ought to be similarly critical of the operation in New South Wales. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the second of such information coming from executive departments to the Senate with regard to unproclaimed legislation. If one compares the return that has just been tabled with the previous one, one finds that we have not progressed much in the five months since last November when this exercise was last gone through. Indeed, on a rough calculation that I did in somewhat of a hurry, it seems that there were 61 pieces of legislation, parts or all of which were unproclaimed as of 24 November 1988. There are now 67. In the meantime, some action has taken place. Indeed, twelve items on the previous list have been discharged. Certainly, action has started to occur. We must be thankful for that. Unfortunately, another 18 were added to the list in the meantime. So we went somewhat backwards. </PARA>
<PARA> New admissions to this area of unproclaimed legislation are the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The worst, by far, is the Department of Transport and Communications, which had seven on the old list and has 12 on the new list. Indeed, of the 18 new additions, five came from one department-the Department of Transport and Communications. We have not progressed a great deal. However, I am heartened by the action that the Government has taken in this matter. I refer to the legislation circular No. 1 of this year, which is headed `New Procedures for Unproclaimed Legislation, Macklin Motion, Commencement Provisions and Explanatory Memorandum', which, amongst other things, points out what the Senate debated last year on my motion, what is now in place and some of the comments that various honourable senators made in this matter. Following from that, drafting instruction No. 2 of 1989 was issued from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. It makes very interesting reading. It is a short drafting instruction and it would be well worth while, I think, to incorporate this document in Hansard for the benefit of honourable senators in scrutinising the commencement date of legislation that they are dealing with in this chamber. I seek leave to have that drafting instruction incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>OFFICE OF PARLIAMENTARY COUNSEL</PARA>
<PARA>DRAFTING INSTRUCTION NO. 2 OF 1989</PARA>
<PARA>Commencement of Legislation by Proclamation</PARA>
<PARA> Last year, Senators expressed strong disapproval of the fact that many pieces of legislation had been unproclaimed, in some cases for many years (eg Hansard 24 November 2772ff.). </PARA>
<PARA>2. In response to this criticism, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&amp;C) has instructed that a new policy should be adopted when providing for commencement of Acts by Proclamation. PM&amp;C has issued a Legislation Circular and new paragraphs to be inserted in the Legislation Handbook, copies of which are attached. I have discussed the matter with PM&amp;C, and what follows is my understanding of the new policy. </PARA>
<PARA>3. As a general rule, a restriction should be placed on the time within which an Act should be proclaimed (for simplicity I refer only to an Act, but this includes a provision or provisions of an Act). The commencement clause should fix either a period, or a date, after Royal Assent, (I call the end of this period, or this date, as the case may be, the ``fixed time''). This is to be accompanied by either:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a provision that the Act commences at the fixed time if it has not already commenced by Proclamation; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a provision that the Act shall be taken to be repealed at the fixed time if the Proclamation has not been made by that time. </PARA>
<PARA>4. Preferably, if a period after Royal Assent is chose, it should not be longer than 6 months. If it is longer, Departments should explain the reason for this in the Explanatory Memorandum. On the other hand, if the date option is chosen, PM&amp;C do not wish at this stage to restrict the discretion of the instructing Department to choose the date. </PARA>
<PARA>5. It is to be noted that if the ``repeal'' option is followed, there is no limit on the time from Royal Assent to commencement, as long as the Proclamation is made by the fixed time. </PARA>
<PARA>6. Clauses providing for commencement by Proclamation, but without the restrictions mentioned above, should be used only in unusual circumstances, where the commencement depends on an event whose timing is uncertain (eg enactment of complementary State legislation). </PARA>
<PARA>7. In future therefore, commencement clauses providing for restricted Proclamation dates should be along the following lines, depending which options are chosen. </PARA>
<PARA>1. ``FORCED COMMENCEMENT''</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The exercise that we are dealing with today, hopefully, over time, will become a very small rather than a large affair. I note for example the age of a very large number of the pieces of legislation on the return. The one that has probably the most outstanding pieces-that is, the Public Service and Statutory Authorities Amendment Act 1980-is nine years old. I think we will get three more bits proclaimed on 1 May 1989. Unfortunately, there are still pieces not proclaimed. In fact, in the comments on section 45 (2), the Department that provided the reason says that it has absolutely no idea when these will be proclaimed. That should not be allowed to occur. If this is likely to go on, it will be well worthwhile for the Government simply to bring in a Bill to repeal all of these unproclaimed pieces and to start again. It is extraordinary that we managed to flush out of the relevant department the fact that one particular piece was non-proclaimed due to an oversight. It was nice of the Department to tell us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But there are more important concerns thrown up by some of the explanations. Some of them are quite legitimate. But I do not want my comments to be taken as meaning that all of the delays are necessarily legitimate. For example, the ones in the Australian Capital Territory obviously will be proclaimed when-perhaps I should add `if'-the House of Assembly ever manages to get itself meeting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, gets itself declared and then manages to meet. Upon that day, of course, the relevant sections of those various Acts relating to the Australian Capital Territory will come into operation. That is a perfectly legitimate exercise and I think that everybody can see the reason for doing it in that particular way. However, I am certainly not happy with others. The Aboriginal Land Rights Legislation Amendment Act appeared on the old list as well as this one. It was debated quite extensively in this place. In fact, the reasons that are pointed out here for not proclaiming those pieces of legislation are the matter of contention in the debate, which I find absolutely extraordinary. The Government set about refuting it so that it could get the Bill passed and now presumably believes that it was correct in hindsight. I also have some worries with the crimes legislation. Since the last report, sections 11, 14, 16, 17, 18, 69b, and 70 to 75 have been proclaimed. That is very good. Section 47 is still outstanding. One hopes that the relationship between that and the Proceeds of Crime Act and the Cash Transaction Reports Act will be satisfactorily resolved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason for most of the new items appearing in the return is that regulations have not been drafted. We might be reasonable on this matter because we are dealing with the period from November to the present. For a significant portion of that time, departments were understaffed due to the taking of annual holidays and the statutory holidays that occur in that period. It is a legitimate point that can be raised-but only so far. It is being pressed beyond that limit with regard to a number of matters. One that I draw attention to is the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. If people remember the ones that we used to have, they will know that almost all of those were items either putting in commas or dots or non-controversial and small amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> Since any department had a small bit in those miscellaneous Bills, it is quite extraordinary that we should still have pieces lying around outstanding, particularly as, as I understand it, there is a lot of competition to get into those Bills. Finally, of course, they had to be killed off for the very reason that everybody thought it was a great place to pop something so that the Senate would not look at it. Of course, we have now moved to the new notion of having portfolio Bills. If they managed to get in, I would have thought that there would be a reason for it and that they may wish to proclaim those. I am still very much concerned that we have absolutely no idea when these Bills are likely to be proclaimed. I am not quite sure that one could describe the fact that we have no idea when they will be proclaimed as a reason for their non-proclamation. The Senate actually asked for reasons why they will not be proclaimed. It is not that we do not have any idea why or when they will not be proclaimed. Perhaps in future we may get some more adequate explanation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also worried that the argument that we do not have regulations drafted has become the accepted reason why nothing has been done. Looking at the departments, I notice that there seems to have been an inter-departmental committee meeting on this matter to make sure that they all got their acts together and gave the same excuse. Quite frankly, I do not think that is going to wash. I would now expect the Senate, as I certainly intend to do with some of the Bills currently on the Notice Paper and which we will get to shortly, to seek to amend quite specifically the Bills with regard to their commencement dates, particularly two pieces of legislation which have completely ignored the drafting instruction from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. This was not meant as a frivolous exercise on my part and I am sure it was not on the part of other senators who have taken a long term interest in this matter, particularly Senator Puplick. This is an important exercise. It is one where the Parliament needs to be assured of what is going on. As we have said in a previous debate, it is one which allows certainty, particularly for the legal profession. I for one have absolutely no idea how even judges find out that some of these clauses have not been proclaimed. I can imagine all sorts of extremely odd things going on in courts all over Australia simply out of sheer ignorance with regard to some obscure part of one of these Acts having been forgotten by the relevant clerk and its not managing to be proclaimed. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the new drafting instruction is an excellent one. If followed, it will resolve most of the problems that have occurred to date. As I say, we intend to enforce that drafting instruction, and then at a later date it can be reviewed. If followed, it will certainly overcome almost all the problems we are currently facing in this little list and will not be adding, as this one did, another whole swag from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> It is nice to know that some of the departments have got off the list. It is disappointing that a couple have actually managed to get themselves on. I hope the departments who are the worst offenders in this regard, particularly the Department of Transport and Communications-presumably because the Minister for Transport and Communications is no longer in this place-do not feel that they do not have to worry terribly much. I indicate to the people who have the responsibility in that Department that the Bills coming from the Department will be well and truly scrutinised and that there will be considerable problems with pieces of legislation if they cannot manage to get their act together and follow very simple, straightforward and, I think, excellent drafting instructions from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a couple of very brief comments on this paper on unproclaimed legislation. I do not want to detain the Senate for very long because I know that there is overwhelming public clamour for us to get back to the copyright legislation and, in particular, for us to pass the sections on imposing royalties on blank tapes, for which some people have been waiting for an extraordinary length of time. My first brief comment is that I share Senator Macklin's concerns about a number of these matters which have not been progressed since the last time we had a list. However, I am absolutely intrigued to look under the heading of the Naval Properties Transfer Act, which was passed in 1925, to see that it has not been proclaimed, and we are now told that the Act will be repealed as soon as possible. This is an absolutely extraordinary method of dealing with these things; that is to say, pass an Act, wait 64 years, and then repeal it prior to its proclamation. Whoever is responsible for having dreamed up this particular technique needs to be congratulated. It will undoubtedly set many a precedent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Much the same can be said about the Commonwealth Teaching Service Act, which was passed in 1972 and is now not to be proclaimed because there will be self-government in the Australian Capital Territory in 1989. As to the question of establishing how many Acts have been passed and will not be proclaimed because some part of Australia is about to be hived off and turned into a separate State or given some new judicial status is a matter of real interest. Section 3 of the Koongarra Project Area Act 1981 still remains unproclaimed because, as the Government says, there is no advantage in proclaiming section 3 until the Government decides that mining can in fact proceed at Koongarra. In the light of the review which the Government is currently undertaking of its uranium policy, one waits with great interest to see a quiet midnight proclamation of part of the Koongarra Project Area Act so that the Government can get on with changing the policy, which it is undoubtedly about to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other one I would mention is subsection 14 (2) of the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Act 1985. If one reads carefully what the paper says, it in fact tells one that the reason this has not been proclaimed is that the industry does not like it. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>The area inquiry concept has been strongly opposed by the commercial broadcasting industry, which has sought clarification of the intended relationship between area inquiries and licence renewal inquiries which the ABT is already required to conduct. </PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to say that the concept is now being considered in the context of a review of the powers of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure and a review of the structure of the Broadcasting Act 1942 by the Department. It is fascinating to know that the Department is in the process of reviewing the structure of the Broadcasting Act 1942 which, as I was told by a real expert today, along with the Income Tax Act and the Copyright Act, is about the most incoherent legislation that the Commonwealth has on its books. It does not say that the Department is actually considering any substantive amendments to the Broadcasting Act, simply the structure of the Act, whatever that may mean. We are told that all these reviews are expected to be completed in mid-1989. Whether that is actually a promise or a threat or simply a vain hope, one will wait to see. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been told that a subsection of an important Act, the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Act 1985, has not been proclaimed. The Parliament decided that it wished to enact legislation dealing with the area inquiry concept because it thought, presumably, that it was a good thing at the time. The commercial industry does not like the concept which the Parliament has passed. As a result, the commercial industry has the capacity to lean on the Government to ensure that the section it does not like is not proclaimed. We were told the last time we had one of these reports before us that the reason that one Act had not been proclaimed was that the bureaucracy did not like it. Now we have established the principle that if the industry does not like it and has the capacity to muscle the Government, it also has a veto power. One expects to see in the next one that some piece of industrial legislation has not been proclaimed because the Australian Council of Trade Unions did not like it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not up to those organisations to decide what pieces of legislation will be proclaimed once the Parliament has passed them. It is appalling to read that particular comment in relation to the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Act. Nevertheless, I do congratulate whichever genius in the Attorney-General's Department has decided to repeal the Naval Properties Transfer Act 1925 prior to it actually being proclaimed 64 years later. There is a great deal more that could be said in relation to this particular paper, which repays some degree of study by other honourable senators. Therefore, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I was dealing with this matter before lunch I had got up to clauses 9 and 10 of the Copyright Amendment Bill with regard to the relationship between the artistic and industrial design problems. I indicated at that point that we previously had some intention, in terms of our ongoing discussions, to look at what might be able to be done with those. At the end of the day, we decided not to push ahead in that area, for a number of reasons that I will go into in the committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I foreshadow the following second reading amendment in respect of the Copyright Amendment Bill:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ``, but the Senate is of the opinion that, as a matter of urgency, the Attorney-General's Department should examine and report upon:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the implications for industrial designs of the provisions of the Copyright Amendment Bill 1988;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the desirability of protection for industrial designs and the form such protection should take under either the Designs Act or the Patents Act;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the adequacy and appropriateness of the present design registration system and the need for changes under that system to complement changes made to the copyright law; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the need for, and form of, any transitional provisions in the designs system following changes to copyright law which affect industrial designs''. </PARA>
<PARA>I now turn to another topic-that is, performers' protection. Performers have been granted rights over the recording of live performances, either directly or off-air, and over certain uses of such recordings made without their consent. Before now, with one limited exception, performers have had no rights over recordings to which they have consented. Performances are defined as live performances given in Australia by one or more `qualified persons'-meaning Australian citizens and residents. These include dramatic works, musical works, literary works given by way of reading, recitation or delivery, circus or variety acts, and dances. Reading the news and performing a sporting activity are included among the exemptions. I am not quite sure whether unsporting activity is able to be covered. </PARA>
<PARA> Unauthorised uses give rise to a claim by the performer, who can bring an action in relation to them. The performer's consent is not required to make an exempt recording, although the recording ceases to be exempt if it is used for purposes other than those which are defined. There is also an ephemeral reproduction exemption in favour of broadcasters, whereby a recording or copy may be made if it is solely for the purpose of making a broadcast where the broadcast itself is authorised by the performer. Copies must be destroyed within 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> These provisions reflect very clearly the recommendations of the majority of the Copyright Law Review Committee in its 1987 report and will certainly enable Australia to meet the minimum requirements of the Rome Convention for the protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting organisations. The Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) has stated that it is the Government's intention to take steps towards accession to the Rome Convention in the near future. Various concerns have been raised with regard to this clause, probably the most significant of which is the retrospective effect of the clause. It goes back 20 years. The Government, by way of an amendment that it has circulated, will remove that effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Article 15 (b) of the Rome convention refers to `current events' rather than to the narrow term `news'. The Government argues that the change will create other inconsistencies in the legislation. Its backstop is that it is unnecessary because there is no evidence that `news' would be interpreted narrowly. I doubt very much whether there is an accepted definition that could be interpreted so narrowly, particularly because, in the industry itself, there is a very well-defined context for `news' and an equally well-defined context for `current affairs'. I indicate that we will support the Opposition's amendment in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The ephemeral recordings issue is interesting. I will raise some questions about it during the committee stage. There could be certain problems with regard to exemptions for public events. I hope the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) will be able to respond to my comments at the end of the second reading debate. I refer, for example, to application of authorisation requirements to parades or events which require audience participation-events such as the Gay Mardi Gras or, to use a more mainstream event, Carols by Candlelight. In any event, one can imagine that a very broad range of activities may be covered by this aspect. Many of the performances during, for example, Carols by Candlelight, if not during the other example that I gave, are often by notable artists. I think that this aspect should not be put aside. We should be clear about what is covered and how the broadcasting legislation is expected to deal with it. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the area of educational copying-one which is particularly difficult to deal with. Copying will be permitted provided that the institutions comply with a number of requirements, including payment of equitable remuneration to copyright owners. Alternatives are available as to how this is to be assessed. The provisions largely reflect the recommendations of the former Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts, which were made about three years ago. There has been a significant amount of lobbying on this matter. In particular, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee has raised a number of concerns. It would like to see the provisions extended to cover radio programs-which the Bill permits only by domestic users-and the copying of published audiovisual materials other than off-air. The off-air ones, of course, are catered for. It is also concerned about the need for fair dealing provisions in relation to audiovisual material, copying by libraries for users and for other libraries and copying for preservation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will move a number of amendments in this regard. Having regard to the spirit in which Senator Hill made his comments it may be better not to deliberate on this matter at this point, but I would certainly be interested in having discussions. </PARA>
<PARA> The external students problem is a difficult one. It probably ought to be resolved by the position adopted in the legislation rather than by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee's position. Essentially, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee has raised the problem that external students are disadvantaged by way of distance in terms of getting hold of materials. I, for one, have always fought strong and hard on their behalf. However, they must be compensated for the disadvantage that they suffer. I think that can be accepted. We are interested in who is to compensate them. It does not seem to me to be fair to say that they should be compensated by the author. The author is in the business of trying to earn a living. Our poor writers have a bad enough time as it is, without their having to compensate external students. Many of them have great difficulty in compensating themselves, just in order to feed themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the community has a reponsibility for external students and it ought to exercise that responsibility by way of government funding. In other words, the onus would have to lie with the Government to fund the institutions. The alternative argument, of course, relates to the fair dealings question. When we debate that aspect I wish to see whether it is possible to cover it within the scope of the legislation. There may need to be an amendment to the clause. I will seek to question Senator Hill about whether a `fair dealing' by external students may allow them to appoint a librarian to undertake a copy on their behalf. I think this is another avenue to pursue. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation as it currently stands was the result of some fairly tortuous and protracted negotiations between a number of parties. It is useful that we have got rid of the extremely cumbersome reporting mechanisms that are in the current Act and which will not be contained in the new Act. The external students problem still needs to be addressed. I will be interested to hear how the Government views the problem of disadvantage faced by external students vis-a-vis internal students, and how it intends to deal with that matter before I make a final deliberation on that part of the legislation and the removal of the exemption clause. </PARA>
<PARA> The next aspect to which I refer relates to media monitors. The people who have been monitoring the electronic media have recognised that they have been operating in a no-man's land. No-one is quite certain whether he is permitted to do what he is doing. Then again, no-one is quite certain that he is not permitted to do it, either. It is an area which, one has to admit, is legitimate. I admit its legitimacy, particularly as the clipping services with regard to newspapers are accepted. Citizens have a right to know what has been said about them by way of radio or television broadcasts. If they were not listening to or watching the particular program they still have that right. This could be dealt with in a number of ways. For example, we could require an individual radio or television station to provide any member of the public who comes through the door with the ability to peruse the programs. That would be a massively expensive mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, in terms of the media monitors, a very easy and simple way of handling this problem. Media monitors already cover radio and television stations for clients. We propose to move an amendment in regard to this to enable that particular area to be clearly dealt with in such a way that the media monitors are able to provide to an individual a copy of the particular part of the tape or topic that that person is dealing with. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give a couple of examples to honourable senators who may not be familiar with the services that are currently provided. One example involves a teachers union in Queensland which is seeking to cover an interesting debate over class sizes. That is legitimate. No way in the world could the teachers union cover that. But since teachers invariably are included in the debates-they were the ones who were leading it and trying to get a reduction in class sizes-they feel the need to be able to respond to comments made by Ministers or other people on talk-back programs. They are attempting to engage in a debate in the society. This material has been broadcast to all and sundry. I find it very difficult to understand why a commercial operation cannot exist so that people can pick that up. </PARA>
<PARA> We should not operate on a wait and see mechanism, which I understand is what the Government is suggesting. That seems to me to be a silly exercise now that we are here, because our proposed amendments include a simple mechanism to deal with this matter. It can be reviewed at a later stage, but it should be put on a firm footing now. Some of the opposition to this comes from people who have made statements on radio or television which they do not want to fall into the hands of other people, having libelled or defamed them. That is an area which the two companies that currently operate do not wish to deal with. Very sensibly they do not want to draw on the wrath of the law. They just want to go about a legitimate business exercise, hence they try to stay away from defamation cases. I still believe that if those statements had been made on radio or television, it is the same as if they were printed in the newspaper. One has a legal right to take action if one feels one is defamed. I do not think this right should be obstructed by it being so difficult to get hold of the tape. On a number of occasions I have heard of, the tape has inadvertently been destroyed. I do not think that is a reasonable exercise for public broadcasters. If they are willing to broadcast material, they should be willing to re-broadcast it through that very simple mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the blank tape levy-and I understand all honourable senators managed to get themselves a tape today as a result of some lobbying on this matter-under the present law, home taping of published records and cassettes, either directly or off-air, is an infringement of copyright. That infringement is completely unenforceable. There is no way in the world that anybody in their right mind would try to enforce this law because the cost would be astronomical. Under the new proposals, copyright owners-that is composers, authors, publishers and record companies-will be compensated for this use by the payment of a royalty on blank tapes. This was a lateral thinking way of dealing with the problem. Unfortunately, we are still only dealing with radio cassettes and not other tapes. Considering the penetration of videos in the Australian community, which is the highest in the world-in fact, most homes would not do very much audio cassette taping, but almost every home would be recording television programs-it is interesting why we are going down one avenue and not down the other. Perhaps the Government can explain this. Perhaps we have not got around to admitting the level of penetration of video machines in this community. I would like to know why we are not dealing with that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I also laud the Government for the exemptions it has made, for example, for schools and institutes for the blind, and so on. At long last the people who are drafting these pieces of legislation are taking notice of the interminable debates that we have in this place, that when legislation is drawn up somebody should always look over it to see whether these provisions can apply across the board to all Australians, particularly those Australians who suffer some disadvantage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on several aspects of the Copyright Amendment Bill 1988. As I said during an earlier debate today, this is one of the most complex pieces of legislation on the Commonwealth statute books. For example, page 36 of this Bill contains an amendment to insert a new clause which will glorify in the number of 135zzzb. The extent to which anybody can actually be expected to understand the complexity of legislation when it gets to that level is almost beyond me. There is some degree of confusion admitted by the lack of precision which we have seen in the drafting of this Bill. In the House of Representatives on the night of 24-25 November 1988 the Government, without debate, rammed through further amendments, including an amendment to insert a new section 248g (2) (c), which itself has become the object of considerable representations and on which the Government has started to back down. We propose further amendments which have been circulated today on this piece of legislation. It is an extraordinarily complicated and difficult piece of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Hill has already foreshadowed a large number of amendments which will be moved by the Opposition at the committee stage. I will draw attention to just one other and that will be to clauses 9 and 10 in terms of the interaction between the design and copyright initiatives. The long awaited reforms proposed by various craftspeople will be advanced by the Opposition. We will ensure that an amendment is moved so that questions of industrial design do not end up slipping between the provisions of the two Acts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition supports the general thrust of this legislation. I draw attention to three items which were clearly spelled out in the coalition arts policy, for which I had responsibility. The policy was issued on 17 September 1988. The first is a commitment which the policy gave to supporting the levy on blank tapes. Our policy states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Coalition Parties support a number of recent initiatives taken in this area, including the introduction of royalty payments on blank tapes used for sound recording, and increased penalties for piracy. </PARA>
<PARA>Reference to that will be found in proposed clause 135zzj of the legislation. Secondly, in our policy we indicated that we would move to ensure that Australia became a signatory to the Rome convention. Our policy states:</PARA>
<PARA> Copyright protection will be extended to choreographic works recorded in the form of film. Steps will be taken to accede to the 1961 Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>That will be found to have been picked up in part in proposed new section 248 of the legislation. Finally, we made reference to support for copyright registration and protection of dance works on video. We said in the policy:</PARA>
<PARA> Protection under copyright will be given for works of choreography recorded on film. </PARA>
<PARA>That is dealt with in the schedule of this Bill which amends the definition of the term `dramatic work' in section 10 (1) of the Act. That will be a great boon to choreographers. It will relieve them of the necessity to employ choreologists who are trained to record dance notation in the proper form in this very complicated area. This is something which is sadly lacking in terms of choreo- logical training in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Copyright is an important economic area. For instance, the 1987 report of the Australian Copyright Council entitled Copyright: An Economic Perspective, draws attention to these matters. The Council draws the following conclusions from its study:</PARA>
<PARA>That copyright-based industries in Australia have grown at about twice the rate of the economy over the five years to 1985-86 (an annual rate of 6.1% . . .). The copyright-based industries represented almost $13 billion worth of production in 1985-86, of which over $7 billion, or 3.1% of the gross domestic product, represented value-added in the industries themselves. The industries provided employment for over 200,000 persons, which is 3% of the workforce. </PARA>
<PARA>One could go on at considerable length about the economic value of copyright-based industries in Australia. If one looks at a report entitled Economic Effects of Intellectual Property Right Infringement, produced in February 1988 by the United States International Trade Commission which was reprinted in the Journal of World Trade in 1988, one will find, for example, that losses through piracy and through theft of intellectual property in the United States of America was reported as follows: for the scientific and photographic industry, $5 billion; computers and computer software, $4.1 billion; electronics, $2.3 billion; motor vehicles and parts, $2.2 billion; entertainment, $2.1 billion; pharmaceuticals, $1.9 billion; chemicals, $1.3 billion; and petroleum refining and related products, including plastics, $1.3 billion. They happen to be real dollars, not the sort of Mickey Mouse dollars that this Government is inflicting on us at the moment. Losses in the entertainment industry in the vicinity of $2.1 billion are one of the areas which are picked up later in this report. </PARA>
<PARA> In making an analysis of the issues in this legislation, I want to start by referring to the levy on blank tapes. I am aware that the debate has to be adjourned shortly so that we can hear the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) make a formal apology on the part of the Government for its economic mismanagement. Part of the genesis of the royalty payments on blank tapes question was a speech given by Senator Evans, when he was still Attorney-General, to the Australian Communications Law Association in Sydney on 11 November 1983. On that occasion Senator Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA> While I have not yet made a final decision, I do see considerable attractions in the proposal for a royalty on blank audio tape as a trade-off for removing existing legal restrictions on non-commercial home taping. </PARA>
<PARA>I pay a great tribute to a large number of people who were involved at the time, particularly in the Australian Record Industry Association Ltd, whose then Executive Director, Victoria Rubensohn, was one of the principal proponents of this piece of legislation. She, of course, has gone on to do distinguished work on the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. Undoubtedly, both in her former capacity and in her present capacity, she has great interest in the way in which this matter has developed. In May 1988 the Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Bowen, announced that the Government would proceed along the lines which are now enshrined in the Bill. He indicated in a press release:</PARA>
<PARA>The industry has agreed to set aside 15 per cent of revenue from the new royalty as partial funding for a non-profit Australian contemporary music development company which is being established by the Government to foster Australian music and young Australian musicians. </PARA>
<PARA>I will have something more to say about the Contemporary Music Development Centre, which is located at the Northern Rivers College of Advanced Education in Lismore, New South Wales, and the excellent work that has been undertaken there by Dr Clive Pasco and a number of others. Indeed, I will say something about the expansion of the Australian rock music industry, in terms of the Contemporary Music Development Centre, the Victorian Rock Foundation and the initiatives taken under the heading of export music Australia. It is often not realised what a significant economic contribution to our country is made by the popular recording industry in Australia. I want to deal with that at some length. I also want to deal with a number of other questions. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps I should simply foreshadow that in the remainder of my speech when the debate is resumed I will be dealing with the question of performers' rights and, in particular, the consequences of Australia's accession to the various parts of the Rome convention. I will also be dealing with the question of retrospectivity, the way in which representations from the Australian Record Industry Association, the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations, the Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters, the Advertising Federation of Australia Ltd and various others have impacted upon the Opposition, causing us to bring forward certain amendments which the Government has now picked up to ensure that there is not a retrospective application of these performers' rights in a way which would have been simply an administrative nightmare for the industry to put into place. </PARA>
<PARA> I will be dealing with a number of matters which go to questions of cultural policy and arts policy. It is very often not realised that a great underpinning of arts and cultural policy in Australia depends upon the legal regime which exists in order to secure copyright protection and intellectual property protection for performers. It is often not realised that the entertainment industry is precisely that-an industry. People who work in the industry, whether they work as performers or recording artists or whether they work in the various companies and associations which deal with arts and cultural matters, do in fact have an enormous economic stake in ensuring that the legislation under which they operate provides for security of their economic rights. In very large part, copyright is not just a matter of the protection of intellectual property but very much a matter of the protection of the economic rights of people who are affected. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the areas that I have already identified in relation to blank tape royalties, the provisions of the Rome convention and the protection of dance works on video tape are very welcome. I have indicated the extent to which the Opposition will be moving a number of amendments. Senator Hill has already dealt with those earlier this evening. I simply indicate, therefore, that at the committee stage we will be expecting a quite detailed reply from the Government on a number of matters. During the course of the next two weeks, we expect to undertake some negotiation with the Government to secure its agreement on as many of our amendments as possible. We will be seeking the active cooperation of the Australian Democrats in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an important piece of legislation and I hope that we will be able to sort out the differences which exist in a number of areas, primarily those concerned with the education area and the rights of people who are blind and handicapped. We look forward to progress being made over the course of the next two weeks. Mr President, in order to facilitate the Minister for Finance making a statement this evening, I now seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>Mr President,</PARA>
<PARA> Tonight the Treasurer is delivering in the House of Representatives the Government's Economic Statement for 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my privilege to outline to the Senate the proposals of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight the Australian Labor Party will fulfil the commitment it made in May last year to deliver substantial tax relief in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time the Treasurer said the country would be able to afford these tax cuts only if wage increases over the ensuing year were held in check. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian workforce has kept to its side of that bargain. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight we will keep to ours. </PARA>
<PARA> From 1 July all taxpayers will pay significantly less tax, particularly low and middle income earners. </PARA>
<PARA> This will be achieved while preserving the Budget surplus at this year's record level. </PARA>
<PARA> But tonight's Statement is about much more than just personal income tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> It also includes a wide range of measures to increase substantially assistance to families and pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> There are all measures of great substance, carefully directed by the Government to those who deserve them most. </PARA>
<PARA> But even more than that, this package cements into place the central element of the Government's economic strategy for 1989-90 and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA> It secures the maintenance of sensible wage outcomes in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> We have sought and won agreement from the Australian Council of Trade Unions that the tax cuts will be accepted as part of next year's wages system. </PARA>
<PARA> This means that the tax cuts will take the place of what would otherwise have been very much higher wage cost increases, which would have threatened employment and thrown the economy into recession. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead, the tax cuts will play a central role in lowering inflation, enhancing competitiveness and supporting economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA> They will also underpin a far-reaching modernisation of the existing system of industrial awards, upgrading productivity and the quality of the working lives of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Compare this situation with that of our predecessors. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1982 the then Treasurer-the now Leader of the Opposition-made irresponsible tax cuts which were not part of any sensible arrangement to moderate wage rises. </PARA>
<PARA> To the contrary, they were paid on top of a wage explosion which ushered in Australia's deepest recession since the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA> He rejected the notion of an orderly and agreed basis for wages growth, preferring industrial confrontation to cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA> The dismal result was strikes and wages chaos which destroyed the economy, killing jobs and shutting down businesses all over the country. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight's wage/tax package stands in stark contrast to that mayhem. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the very essence of reason and order. </PARA>
<PARA> Reason, in that the Government and the workforce can work out and cooperate in an arrangement that is vastly superior to the alternative of a wage explosion followed by a recession. </PARA>
<PARA> Order, in that only an orderly arrangement can secure improved living standards while maintaining business investment, growth and progress. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this package could only be delivered by a Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This Labor Government, through its Accord with the Australian workforce, is the only party which can deliver economic growth without crippling strikes, confrontation and unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last six years the Accord has delivered 1.3 million jobs, a phenomenal 20 per cent increase in employment. </PARA>
<PARA> And it did this with a sharp reduction in strikes. </PARA>
<PARA> By contrast, in the last six years of the Fraser Government job growth was a miserable 4 per cent, with three times as many strikes. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, in the last two years in which the present Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, served as Treasurer, unemployment doubled to 700,000. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why, Mr President, Labor not only claims a superior economic strategy and performance-it has proved it. </PARA>
<PARA> If we leave you with one single thought tonight it is this: If a Government cannot run wages in Australia it cannot run the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> We have shown over six years that we can run a successful wages system. </PARA>
<PARA> In complete contrast, the Leader of the Opposition Mr Howard, as Treasurer in 1981 and 1982, comprehensively demonstrated that he could not manage wages policy. </PARA>
<PARA> He failed and his failure cost the nation dearly. </PARA>
<PARA> The tragedy with the Liberals is that in the seven years since, nothing has changed-they are no further advanced. </PARA>
<PARA> If they were in office today, they would have the same wages policy that destroyed the place seven years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>THE MEASURES</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I now turn to the details of the Government's tax and social justice statement, its wage/tax strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> At a total cost of $5.7 billion, it consists of tax cuts costing $4.9 billion and, at $710 million, the largest social security package in our history. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, it provides big personal income tax cuts, significant increases in family allowances and pensioner benefits, increases in the Dependent Spouse and Sole Parent Rebates, and a radical restructuring of the Australian award wage system. </PARA>
<PARA> These combine to deliver a substantial rise in the disposable income of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Families particularly will receive the extra support they deserve, and the least well paid members of the community will benefit from an historic lift in incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> Before detailing the changes, I will illustrate how the measures combine to apply in some representative examples. </PARA>
<PARA> The key here is to understand that a dollar in tax cuts is a dollar in the hand, whereas a dollar of wages is worth considerably less after tax. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, the tax cuts are equivalent to larger wage rises. </PARA>
<PARA> The four examples I will provide are expressed in terms of their equivalent value as wages. </PARA>
<PARA> Take first a low income earner on about $290 a week or $15,000 a year, with a dependent spouse and two children, and qualifying for a $20 supplementary payment adjustment to his or her minimum award rate of pay. </PARA>
<PARA> On 1 July such a taxpayer will get the equivalent of a $24 a week pay rise from the tax cut and family assistance increases. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequent award restructuring and supplementary wage payments will deliver an additional $40 a week, giving a total wage equivalent increase of $64 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> It is as though they received a $64 wage rise. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, in the case of a wage earner on $500 a week or $26,000 a year, with a dependent spouse and two children, the comparable wage increase is $71 a week.</PARA>
<PARA> Such a taxpayer will receive the equivalent of $41 a week from the tax cut and family assistance changes and $30 a week from award restructuring, giving a total wage equivalent increase of $71 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> Third, for a two income family with two children on a combined income of $860 per week or $45,000 a year, the increase is equivalent to a wage rise of $121 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> Such taxpayers will together receive the equivalent of $51 a week from the tax cut and family assistance changes and $70 a week from award restructuring-with one earner qualifying for a supplementary pay adjustment-giving a total combined wage equivalent increase of $121 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> And finally, for a single income earner with no dependants on $500 per week, or $26,000 a year, the total wage equivalent increase would be $56 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a taxpayer will receive the equivalent of $26 a week from the tax cuts and $30 a week from award restructuring, giving a total wage equivalent increase of $56 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, these increases fulfil the Government's commitment to lift real disposable incomes in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> Had they all been paid in wages, such rises would have implied a 12 per cent increase in the national wage bill next financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, however, the actual cost of the overall package will be 6 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This reflects the efficiency of a `paid for' tax cut in providing a non-inflationary wage increase in place of a straight wage rise. </PARA>
<PARA> Putting it more starkly, the workforce will receive increases equivalent to 12 per cent roughly half the cost to employers and to inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> This result could only be delivered by a Labor Government through the processes of the Accord. </PARA>
<PARA>TAX SCALE AND FAMILY ASSISTANCE</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I will not detail the new tax scale and family assistance measures. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already illustrated the real benefit of these tax cuts to wage earners. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax cuts and family allowance increases are large in their own right-ranging from around $15 a week for a single taxpayer on average weekly earnings to $30 a week for a family taxpayer with the same income. </PARA>
<PARA> When this Government came to office in 1983, the lowest tax rate of all was 30 cents in the dollar; after that there was a hefty jump to 46 cents in the dollar; then another steep climb to 60 cents in the dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor's new scale has a bottom rate of only 21 cents in the dollar, middle rates of 29 and 39 cents and, up to a $50,000 threshold, a new 47 cent rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Above income levels of $50,000 the rate will remain at 49 cents in the dollar until 1 January 1990, when it will come down to the new 47 cent rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the enormous progress we have already made in cutting the Liberal's punitive 60 cent rate, it is only fair that people earning more than $50,000 a year wait a little longer this time. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, we have also acted to reduce tax burdens significantly by increasing a range of tax rebates. </PARA>
<PARA> For single income couples with children, the Dependent Spouse Rebate is to be increased from $1,030 to $1,200. </PARA>
<PARA> For single income couples without children it will be increased from $830 to $1,000, while the sole parent rebate will be raised from $780 to $940. </PARA>
<PARA> To assist families we are raising family allowances to $9 a week for each of the first three children, and to $12 a week for the fourth and any additional children, while the family allowance supplement will be lifted by $3.10 a week for children aged between 13 and 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result we will achieve this year the child poverty benchmarks promised by the Prime Minister-well ahead of the 1990 target. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, in an historic step, all these rebates and family allowances will be indexed in future to annual movements in the CPI, to preserve their real value permanently-something which has never been done before. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, two further key points need to be made about this new tax structure. </PARA>
<PARA> The first is that it more than offsets what is known as fiscal drag or bracket creep. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, personal income taxpayers will now be paying less tax than if we had indexed the tax scales for inflation since 1983. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you want figures, Senator Chaney, I suggest you get someone other than the person who prepared your last notional budget before the 1987 election which contained a $1.5 billion error in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point is that because of our past decisions, Commonwealth spending relative to the size of the economy will continue to fall in future years. </PARA>
<PARA> It has already fallen to its lowest level in 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, we have provided real scope for further affordable tax cuts in the years ahead because the public sector will be so much smaller. </PARA>
<PARA>AGE PENSIONS</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I now outline the major reforms the Government is making in assistance to age pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> First, the relationship between the age pension and tax systems is to be made more rational and less confusing. Many pensioners have said to us that it was unfair that they are allowed to earn up to an extra $40 a week without affecting their pension, but must pay tax if they earn more than $10 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has examined this and will remedy it. </PARA>
<PARA> Pensioner tax rebates are to be increased so that age pensioners with earnings within the income test free area of $40 for single pensioner, and $70 for married couples, will pay no tax at all. </PARA>
<PARA> When fully phased in by July 1990, this major reform will mean that 80 per cent of Australia's 1.8 million age and service pensioners will be exempt from tax. </PARA>
<PARA> For single pensioners, as a first step in 1989-90, the rebate will relieve $25 a week of non-pension income from tax, while in 1990-91 the rebate will be increased to a level which exempts $40 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> For married pensioners, the cost of achieving the same objective is smaller and the rebates will be raised in one step in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> The second improvement concerns the timing of pension adjustments. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986 pensioners were asked to share the burden of adjustment to the collapse in Australia's export prices by waiting six weeks for pension adjustments. </PARA>
<PARA> They have done their fair share. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided not only to remove the six week delay, but also to bring forward the indexation of pensions by a further six weeks; a total bring-forward of 12 weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> This bring-forward will be implemented in equal instalments over three indexation adjustments beginning in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, after June this year pensions will be indexed at five monthly intervals until the full 12 week bring-forward is in place in September 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> These new payment arrangements will apply to all pensioners and beneficiaries and will compensate for price rises much more rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, Mr President, the 2 per cent discount imposed in 1986-87 for public service and defence force pensioners will be restored from November 1989. </PARA>

<PARA>WAGES POLICY</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I now describe in more detail how the changes fit into wages policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I can announce tonight that, on the basis of the tax cuts and assistance measures the Government will deliver from 1 July, the Australian Council of Trade Unions has agreed and accepts that average earnings growth in 1989-90 will be held to around 6 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In doing so, the ACTU also has agreed that there will be no claim for a CPI-based across-the-board wage increase in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the new wages system will be determined by Justice Maddern and his colleagues on the Industrial Relations Commission in the current proceedings and the Wage Case scheduled for May. </PARA>
<PARA> We are envisaging the most far-reaching overhaul of industrial awards since Federation, and the Industrial Relations Commission has a vital role to play in establishing the new wage system and presiding over the orderly change to award structures. </PARA>
<PARA> Award restructuring will bring substantial benefits for all parties-for employers, a more flexible, productive and highly trained workforce; and for employees, more interesting, varied and better-paid jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> For very low-paid workers, the Commonwealth will support moderate supplementary payment adjustments, phased over two years, to lift their incomes to a reasonable living wage. </PARA>
<PARA> Only members of unions prepared to implement genuine award restructuring will be eligible for pay rises. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax cuts, by raising take-home pay from 1 July, will establish an environment in which comprehensive award restructuring negotiations can proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> We anticipate that wage increases from this process will be paid progressively in two stages, beginning later in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> This new pay system brings about historic changes, including reforms called for by the business community over many years and now able to be implemented under the Accord. </PARA>
<PARA> It will make Australian industry much more productive, competitive and better placed to overcome our balance of payments problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth will back up the award restructuring process by allocating $12 million to fund its Workplace Reform Program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Employment, Education and Training is announcing tonight new programs to assist training in industry. </PARA>
<PARA>FISCAL POLICY</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, like policy, budget policy will continue to be deployed fully to bear down on Australia's trade deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> Already I have said the 1989-90 Budget will retain a surplus at least equal to this year's forecast of $5.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, we will budget for an unprecedented fourth consecutive year of real declines in spending. </PARA>
<PARA> And we will again ensure the public sector borrowing requirement in Australia is no greater than zero. </PARA>
<PARA> Fiscal policy will therefore be kept as tight as a drum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, observe the derisory cackles from the people who never, in all their years, brought in a Budget surplus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To this end tonight's Statement includes a first instalment of savings measures for incorporation in the August Budget. These savings will more than offset the $71 million overall cost of the new policy measures I have announced to assist families and pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> Savings on direct Commonwealth payments totalling about $360 million will be achieved principally from four areas. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be a further tightening of procedures to avoid social security abuse; the pharmaceutical benefits scheme will be restructured-I stress without affecting pensioners; a new pathology fee schedule will apply; and Defence spending will be maintained but without a real increase. </PARA>
<PARA> Payments to the States will be determined at the Premiers' Conference next month. </PARA>
<PARA> But savings against the forward estimates at least equal to the cuts in direct Commonwealth spending will be realised. </PARA>
<PARA> The States too must contribute to the national economic and wage strategy from which they materially benefit. </PARA>
<PARA>STRUCTURAL REFORMS</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I turn now to on-going reforms in key areas of the economy designed to remove supply bottlenecks and raise efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> The new wages system opens the way for a dramatic lift in the productivity of Australian industry, as does the continuing boom in business investment. </PARA>
<PARA> But further progress in other areas is essential if we are to sustain rising living standards in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Our determination to pursue changes was demonstrated by the structural adjustment measures the Treasurer announced last May. </PARA>
<PARA> It was demonstrated again earlier this week when the Government declared its intention to override restrictive State provisions in order to accelerate the essential deregulation of wheat transport and marketing. </PARA>
<PARA> This followed our decision to press ahead with the development of additional capacity at Sydney Airport. </PARA>

<PARA> The Prime Minister has already announced that Ministers will be outlining additional reform measures during May. </PARA>
<PARA> Important amongst these will be a statement by the Minister for Transport and Communications detailing fundamental changes to the operations of our ports and coastal shipping. </PARA>
<PARA> These are key areas where inefficiencies and bottlenecks have held back our trade effort for decades. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Commonwealth alone cannot do all that is needed. </PARA>
<PARA> Ports and railways are a State responsibility and we will be seeking from them a meaningful commitment to reform in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Government already has implemented many fundamental reforms to the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight the Treasurer is releasing a comprehensive document which outlines how we will crack down on the use of overseas tax havens by Australian companies. </PARA>
<PARA> We have no intention of allowing unscrupulous operators to exploit ordinary taxpayers through sham companies established for the sole purpose of avoiding tax. </PARA>
<PARA>ECONOMIC CONTEXT</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I will conclude with some observations on the economic context of tonight's Statement. </PARA>
<PARA> The single most significant development in our economy in the past 12 months has been the huge surge in business investment. </PARA>
<PARA> This holds out the prospect of major benefits to Australia through increasing our capacity to produce exports and replace imports. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Government has not sought to disguise the fact that this investment phase has also led to substantial tensions in key areas of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> With so much of the new equipment needed by business having to be imported, the balance of payments deficit has not narrowed as we expected. </PARA>
<PARA> And with demand running too strongly inflation has not fallen as we had hoped. </PARA>
<PARA> We have therefore seen interest rates in Australia rise to higher levels than any of us would like. </PARA>
<PARA> However, recent indicators have provided welcome signs that demand is returning to more sustainable rates of growth. </PARA>
<PARA> We are confident that this trend will continue as the past tightening of fiscal and monetary policy takes increasing effect. </PARA>
<PARA> This should be sufficient to slow demand and cut back the recent lift in imports and lower our current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is unequivocally committed to pursuing the strategy necessary to achieve a lasting turnaround in our current account and external debt imbalances. </PARA>
<PARA> As a nation we must never lose sight of the fact that both are unsustainably high. </PARA>
<PARA> For this reason I reaffirm that monetary policy will continue to play its vital balancing role in our overall economic strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> In all of this, tonight's wage/tax package is central. </PARA>
<PARA> It imposes a discipline on the key cost area of wages. </PARA>
<PARA> Without it Australia would simply return to the high cost recessionary days of the early 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> We have acted decisively to prevent that dismal outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> We shall continue to pursue our economic strategy because it is the only strategy-I repeat the only strategy-capable of delivering lower inflation and a lower current account deficit in combination with sustained business activity and higher employment. </PARA>
<PARA> I table papers entitled as follows: Taxation of Foreign Source Income-An Information Paper-April 1989; Improving Australia's Training System; Towards a Fairer Australia-Social Justice Measures-Economic Statement, April 1989; and Award Restructuring-The Task Head. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address a few remarks on an issue on which I have been making adjournment speeches over the last few weeks. This evening I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate a death which occurred in custody in Western Australia in 1983. Peter Allan, who is also known as Peter Allan Jacobs, died on 25 February 1983, aged 26. He was a son of Allan Jacobs, a much respected elder of the Roebourne Aborigines. Peter Allan was imprisoned in Karratha in the north of Western Australia on 21 October 1982. He was sent to Fremantle gaol in mid-November and he was given a routine X-ray which suggested a lung disease. There appears to have been no appropriate diagnosis made at the time and Peter was imprisoned in close contact with others whom he could have infected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In January 1983 Peter Allan was transferred to Canning Vale prison where another X-ray was taken which showed some residual lung thickening. Nonetheless, the prison authorities are reported as having said that he appeared well. On 4 February Peter Allan reported himself ill and he did not improve, but it was not until 12 days later that he was sent to the Fremantle Prison infirmary. During the next three or four days his sickness escalated at an alarming rate, and on 20 February the prison authorities at last noticed his deterioration. Peter Allan was found unconscious on 22 February and an X-ray taken the same day showed the possibility of broncho-pneumonia and tuberculosis. Even then, despite being unconscious all of this time, he was only transferred from the gaol to Fremantle Hospital on 23 February, by which time he was dying. Later the same day he was transferred to the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in Perth. </PARA>
<PARA> From the research which has been carried out by staff in my office on these matters, I would say that despite the fact that Peter was unconscious and completely incapable of making any attempt to escape, he, like other prisoners that I have mentioned, was taken to hospital in chains and was kept chained to the hospital bed while he was dying. I find it hard to understand how the prison doctors responsible, when they have taken the Hippocratic oath, can come to terms with this sort of treatment of dying prisoners. Peter Allan Jacobs died that same day. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to draw to the attention of the Senate some relevant points in this account. Peter Allan Jacobs was already suffering from a severe but almost certainly curable illness when he was admitted to the Fremantle Gaol just some three months earlier. X-rays had indicated a lung disease but nonetheless there was no appropriate diagnosis at that stage and he was imprisoned in close contact with others whom he could have infected. It appears that diagnosis and treatment of prisoners in the Western Australian prison system is inadequate and slipshod. Whatever crime the prisoners have committed they are nonetheless human beings and, as a matter of human rights, are entitled to a level of medical care not inferior to that available to members of the general community. And indeed, I would suggest that since much crime has health related causes, or at least has significant contributory factors, it is in the interests of the general community that prisoners' health be fully investigated and for treatment to be given to reduce the possibility of further offences after their release. With adequate early treatment of his tuberculosis, Peter Allan would have been unlikely to develop the deadly disease tubercular meningitis. This is another case of proper medical aid being given later rather than sooner and we have yet another young man who is dead. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Inquiry into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody comes to examine the circumstances of the death of Peter Allan Jacobs, it is to be hoped that the medical procedures at Fremantle Gaol will be closely scrutinised. This will be of assistance in the examination of the tragic circumstances of all the deaths which are occurring to both Aboriginal people and non-Aboriginal people in custody. </PARA>
<PARA> Likewise, I wish to place on the public record my bewilderment over a medical decision made concerning Malcolm Hatch, about whom I have spoken previously. Malcolm Hatch, as I said before, when he was very ill, had been provisionally diagnosed as having encephalitis. He was picked up from Cessnock Prison in an emergency vehicle which then proceeded to Cessnock Hospital to pick up another patient who was then taken to the Royal North Shore Hospital. It was only then that Malcolm Hatch was taken to the Long Bay Gaol infirmary. Questions need to be asked as to why, if it was an emergency case and an ambulance was required to move Malcolm Hatch, he was not taken directly to the Prince Henry Hospital, the best hospital in Sydney for neurological disorders. Instead, he was taken from one place to another before finally being taken to hospital. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee to Defend Black Rights has drawn my attention to several incidents which occurred in Murray Bridge in South Australia earlier this year. The incidents give me great cause for concern and indicate that the recommendations of the Muirhead Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody are not having the desired effect. In his report, Mr Justice Muirhead stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The material I have considered to date satisfies me that police lock-ups, and to a lesser extent our prisons, are being utilised too freely to cope with persons who can in no way be termed `criminals,' who are, to put it simply, grossly disadvantaged by reasons of fundamental underlying social causes and that in many cases custodial deaths arise from the same causes. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1987, the figure of 91 Aboriginal deaths in custody was twice the average annual number of deaths in custody between 1980 and 1986. The number of Aboriginal deaths by hanging increased from the 1980-86 average of 1.7 per annum to 15 in 1987-a nine-fold increase. The number of deaths reported as being due to natural causes doubled in 1987. In all, 92 Aboriginal people died in custody between 1980 and 1988, compared to 329 non-Aboriginal deaths in the same period. The figure has now climbed to over 100. While Aboriginals constitute only just over one-100th of the total Australian population they are, of course, as we all know, vastly over-represented in the number of people in prison and represent just over one-fifth of the total number of deaths in custody. Interestingly, the majority of Aboriginal deaths, or 60 per cent, occurred in police custody, while 68 per cent of non-Aboriginal deaths occurred in prison custody. Why is this? I believe it is incidents such as those which occurred at Murray Bridge in South Australia earlier this year that have given rise to and continue to give rise to black deaths in custody. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to read into the record some of the accounts of the appalling incidents which have occurred. The people who live in Murray Bridge belong to the Ngarinyeri people. They are a close-knit community and they are making serious attempts to overcome problems in the community. However, the attitude and the behaviour of some of the local police make this impossible. The first account is from Chirpy Campbell and is about an incident that occurred on about 7 February this year. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> 2 Aboriginals were picked up this afternoon. One's name was Tooman Sumner, the other one was Michael Rigney. </PARA>
<PARA> Tooman was in the shop, i.e. the pub, in Murray Bridge and he was dragged out of the shop by police. Sydney Rankin was in the shop. They pushed Tooman to the ground and kicked him twice. </PARA>
<PARA> Les Sumner saw it and took the police officer's number. Johnny (Campbell) was standing on the street and saw what was happening. He rushed up and pushed the police officer to the side and said, `Hey, he's an old man'. </PARA>
<PARA> Tooman and Michael were taken to the police cells and locked up. I phoned there and asked Sgt King could I talk to them. See if they're all right and talk to them. Tooman takes fits and he needs his tablets. The police shouldn't have been put him in the cells. They should have handed over to the Nunga Farm. Tooman didn't have his tablets with him. They were back at the Nunga farm. </PARA>
<PARA> When I rang up and asked if I could talk to them, Sgt King said `out of all the Black people in Murray Bridge, you'd be the last one (I'd let see them). Not only would you sit down and talk to the prisoner, you'd also put in a formal complaint. Tooman was charged with `assault police' (and possibly other minor charges). He hasn't all his senses about him. He's a sick man. The charges should be dropped and the police should be dealt with for bashing Tooman and their treatment of Michael. </PARA>
<PARA>That was incident number one, on about 7 February. The second incident-it was quite a large incident-occurred on 21 February when a number of Aboriginal people were drinking at the pub and all hell broke loose. These are the words of a man called Allan Raja Sing:</PARA>
<PARA> There was about 15 of us all in 1 group, straight across the road from the police station. We'd just finished having a couple of charges there at the side of the pub. </PARA>
<PARA> About 6 police officers come across to where we was. 6 police officers come across the road and went straight for this bloke, Tony Rankin. They said-`Oh, you're under arrest', and they started harassing him . . . </PARA>
<PARA> They was grabbing him around. And about 6 of them jumped on him. </PARA>
<PARA> They handcuffed him and they was dragging him across the street. His trousers were falling down. And, ah, I think a couple of us mob, were trying to pull his trousers up. And, ah, got as far as, right in front of the police station.</PARA>
<PARA> His brother tried to keep on pulling up his trousers, tried to help his brother. And they got him! They put him down on the ground. Tried to stop him and that. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> Both of them were still on the ground and I was just standing there. </PARA>
<PARA> Another copper come up and hit me in the chest with a baton. I just gave him 3 quick hits. </PARA>
<PARA>Just to break the quote: that is obviously not a proper thing to do but it does seem to be, at least, an immediate reaction to being hit in the chest. I continue with the quote:</PARA>
<PARA>And I just walked away and I don't know what happened from there. </PARA>
<PARA> And I was going around the corner. And I met up with these other people. Then everybody started to go their own way. </PARA>
<PARA> And me and this other bloke was walking home. And I think about 3 or 4 (coppers) grabbed him. And about 5 grabbed me. </PARA>
<PARA> They walked me back to the police station and they charged me with grievous bodily harm. </PARA>
<PARA> When they grabbed me was about half an hour after. </PARA>
<PARA> The bloke I was with, they locked him up and let him out a couple of hours after, I think. </PARA>
<PARA> Then they did not let me out till the next morning because I had a 1 day warrant out. So they let me out 9 a.m. the next morning. </PARA>
<PARA>That was one account of that particular incident, the arrest of Tony Rankin. Here is Tiny Rankin talking about the same incident:</PARA>
<PARA>Me and Raja and a couple of boys and my brother Tony (were) sitting at the Bridgeport . . . and then we started walking up towards the social security building in Murray Bridge. Straight across from the police station. </PARA>
<PARA> Then about 7 uniformed cops and 2 detectives from Murray Bridge here-Detective Jenkins and Detective King . . . The detectives was in front of the uniformed cops and they was approaching a group of Aboriginals . . . </PARA>
<PARA> They went up to my brother Tony and said to him that he was under arrest. </PARA>
<PARA> And he said `What am I arrested for' and he gave his name and address. </PARA>
<PARA> And the cops didn't say nothing and Tony walked away. See they gotta charge you with something, otherwise you got a right to walk away. And the cops grabbed him and they threw him to the ground. </PARA>
<PARA>Tony, by the way, is 18 years old. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA> Then they started kicking and punching into him. And then they started dragging him across the road. And this was about 7 o'clock during the afternoon and going towards the night. </PARA>
<PARA> They dragged him towards the police station across the road, from where we was sitting. </PARA>
<PARA> And I said, `What's my brother arrested for?' I said that to Detective Jenkins and he told me to go and get-</PARA>
<PARA>and the word is used. I continue:</PARA>
<PARA>And, ah, his other mate, Detective King . . . started kicking into Tony and dragging him along the ground. They was treating him like a dog, just kicking into him and dragging him by the handcuffs across the road. </PARA>
<PARA> And, ah, my brothers, Raja and Charlie, they said to Det. King, cause he was kicking into Tony, they said: `What's my brother getting arrested for?'</PARA>
<PARA> And as the cops was dragging Tony, I went to 1 of the uniformed cops that was dragging him and I said: `What's my brother arrested for' and I pushed the police aside, and, now, one of the other uniform police hit me across the side of the face with a baton. I got a black eye over it. Everyone can see it red and all that. </PARA>
<PARA> The next minute I know, I got handcuffs shoved on me and I was in the cells. </PARA>
<PARA> They chucked me in and then that same night, when they was going to give me police bail, they laid the charges on me. They were-hindering police, resist arrest and assault police. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday I went to court . . . and it got remanded till April some time. I've got witnesses that said I never assaulted police. Some white people from the shops saw it too. </PARA>
<PARA> The baton knocked me right out. Blackened me out for a minute or so and when I woke up they was dragging me across the road. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was in the cells, Detective King, he said: `You're a dead nigger or boong'. Can't remember if he said nigger or if it was boong. He pointed his finger like a gun at me and then he walked off. </PARA>
<PARA> I just laughed at them for talking shit. They gave me a dirty look and went away. I went to sleep after that and I got police bail at about 10 or 11 o'clock. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the second incident. Then there is this statement of Tony Rankin himself on his own arrest:</PARA>
<PARA>They came across the road, some detectives and uniformed police and they sang out to me, Ah, and I answered my name-Anthony Rankin and looked at them and they said, `Ah, Come with us'. And I said `What for? Am I under arrest?'. And they came straight across and just started to grab me. I put up a fight with them and ah, they grabbed me then, and ah, handcuffed me. </PARA>
<PARA> And while they was handcuffed me ah my pants fell down and that, and I was, ah, naked. And they did my hands behind my back handcuffed, picked me up off the ground and then dragged me along the ground in front of the police station. And then they carried me through the stairs and then they dragged me out the back. And whilst they was dragging me through the back, they was dropping me on my face, 'cause they had my arms up behind my back I couldn't protect my face. They dropped me on my face and that, kicked me down the stairs out the back towards the police, ah, cells and dropped me on my face and that, took me into a padded cell then. </PARA>
<PARA> And one police-Detective Jenkins, he then jumped and put his knee into the back of my neck, and they took the handcuffs off, before kicking me and that, a few times. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that they were threatening him and saying, `You're dead now', and that they had him naked. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>They dragged me straight from across the road and took me into the police station . . . </PARA>
<PARA> My wrists were cut, I had cuts on my wrist, my left wrist was pretty deep and swollen. From the handcuffs. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the incident on 21 February. In another incident that happened exactly one week later, Johnny Campbell was concerned about his brother Wayne's arrest. This is what he says:</PARA>
<PARA>`Detective Jenkins' used to be stationed in Elizabeth (Adelaide area). He used to raid my younger brother's house all the time. When he was living in the Elizabeth area a few years ago. Used to raid his house all the time and do `drug searches'. One night the coppers planted gear in his house, videos, those sort of things. Set him up. Wayne beat most of the charges from this. On 28 February I heard my brother was arrested for no reason. Just after 11 at night I went to Murray Bridge police station. I confronted at least a dozen police officers that was stationed that night. Usually they'd only have about 3 or 4. That was a lot to be stationed that night. </PARA>
<PARA> I walked in there and I said: `Look, why was my brother arrested for?'. They just ignored me. They didn't even answer me. At the time I was really (angry) when I heard that he was arrested for no reason, but I just asked them in an ordinary way. But I was feeling really bad tempered, you might say. When they didn't answer my question, I sort of acted then a little bit more aggressive towards them. You know, when someone ignores you. </PARA>
<PARA> I raised my voice. I was asking why my brother was arrested, could I see him. Well then, they got a front counter sort of thing, and there's a side door where they take you to if you've been arrested. The side entrance at the front of the police station. </PARA>
<PARA> I was grabbed. My arm was placed at the back. I can't recall if the police officer said I was arrested. Then I was taken through, roughly. They rough handled me. They didn't give me any options. They took me to the back of the police cells where I was in a lot of pain on account of my back. </PARA>
<PARA> I walked in there (to the police station) with my crutches. The one that grabbed me sort of grabbed my crutches and threw them aside. I didn't resist. Cause if I had of resisted, I would of been in that much pain from my back. I knew it would hurt, that's why I didn't resist. I was screaming out in agony. The pain sort of got that worse, you know. Irritated my back through the way he arrested me . . . </PARA>
<PARA> I was taken to the back of the police station where the police cells are, and it's a fair distance, say about 20 yards from where I was arrested, to the back of the police cells. And at that time I was in a lot of pain. </PARA>
<PARA> I could of been pushed or I could of fell to the ground on the result of my back pains. Then I was assaulted. The copper that grabbed me was a sergeant. Sergeant King. </PARA>
<PARA> Well, I was kicked in the ribs. I don't know who `cause it happened that quick and there was that many police around me. About half a dozen. They was all around me. They kicked me at least about twice, and I was kicked in the forehead at least once. I was still in pain. I could still feel the pain that was going through my back. I was in that much pain that it was unbearable . . . I was treated like this before by police a lot of times. I'm sort of used to it. </PARA>
<PARA> They kicked me in my righthand side ribs. </PARA>
<PARA> Then they stripped me down to my jocks. They said `Oh, just in case you might hand yourself we're going to strip you down'. I was really (angry) when they said that. I knew they just intimidating me. I just left it. Well, I didn't resist or anything. </PARA>
<PARA> I was laying on the ground. I was dragged to a padded cell. About a couple of metres or something. Then they locked me in there. </PARA>
<PARA> And, ah, half an hour later I was banging on the door and it took them about a half an hour to respond. Ah now, a uniformed officer said, `Ah, what do you want?'. </PARA>
<PARA> I said, `I want to see a doctor, you know. About my back'. And I said-`Look I've got a bad back. I'm in a lot of pain'. And he just slammed the door. He never said nothing. He just slammed the door. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the second incident. The Committee to Defend Black Rights sent an observer for a march that was held on 15 March over black deaths in custody, and a person called Warren Martens made this comment about the march and the extraordinary overreaction by the local police to this particular incident:</PARA>
<PARA>At least 30 police (most of whom were from out of town) were there amongst the crowd. They were laughing at us. They had guns and batons and appeared to be from some special squad, perhaps tactical response police. Some were high up coppers-inspectors or sergeants. They were using two-way radio handsets. There were at least another 50 police in and around the police station. We stopped at the police station and courthouse and saw a big mob of police. You could see them in there through the glass. The station appeared to be locked. A police was taking photos of everyone. We started chanting `Stop Black deaths in custody', `Drop the charges', `Stop the bashings on Blacks'. Then 6 inspectors came out of the station and 2 Aboriginal liaison police came out. Then a whole lot of police came out-a lot of police were laughing at us. </PARA>
<PARA> While I was giving my speech, 2 police officers came from across the road into our rally and took this young Ngarrindjeri man into the police station. We felt it was like a payback for us having a rally. The way they arrested Tony Rankin only weeks before was part of what the Ngarrindjeri were upset about. It seemed the police were trying to say, `You can protest, but we'll keep arresting you. We're in control'. It was direct provocation. </PARA>
<PARA>It is clear that the recommendations of the interim report of the Muirhead Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody have made little impact at Murray Bridge. In particular, I draw attention to the following recommendations:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Governments which have not already done so should legislate to enforce the principle that imprisonment should be utilised only as a sanction of the last resort. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. In jurisdictions where drunkenness has not been decriminalised, Governments should legislate to abolish the offence of public drunkenness. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. Police officers should receive emphasis in training that arrests for minor offences must be avoided when alternative steps are available. </PARA>
<PARA> 11. Where practicable, the Aboriginal Legal Service should be notified in all instances of the detention of any Aboriginal person in custody. Where it is not possible to contact an officer of that Service, such notification should be given to a person designated by the local Aboriginal community to receive such advice. </PARA>
<PARA> 14. Police officers whose duties may require them to perform watch-house duties should undergo basic training in the recognition of symptoms of head injuries, major illnesses, and in first aid and resuscitation techniques. </PARA>
<PARA>They should certainly not be the ones causing them. Other recommendations are:</PARA>
<PARA> 20. An Aboriginal detainee should be assisted to communicate with the Aboriginal Legal Service and should be entitled to private visits by a lawyer or field officer from that Service. </PARA>
<PARA> 22. In consultation with Aboriginal communities and their organisations, cell visitor schemes should be introduced to service police lockups and watch-houses wherever practicable. </PARA>
<PARA> 27. Appropriate screening procedures should be implemented to ensure that potential officers who will have contact with Aboriginal people in their duties are not recruited or retained by police and prison departments whilst holding racist views which cannot be eliminated by training or re-training programs. </PARA>
<PARA> 32. All personnel of police, prison, social welfare or other departments whose work will bring them into contact with Aboriginal people should receive appropriate training or retraining to ensure that they have an understanding and appreciation of Aboriginal history, culture and social behaviour and the abilities to effectively communicate and work with Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Justice Muirhead's recommendations are excellent, and I am sure that those in the final report will be just as useful. However, I think we must go further to prevent Aboriginal deaths in custody, by ameliorating the social conditions which lead Aboriginal people to be overrepresented in gaols throughout the country. I believe we have to take sterner measures against those who perpetrate racism in this country and use the law and their own privileged position to do so illegally. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, I believe that police officers King and Jenkins should be immediately suspended from their duties at Murray Bridge, charged with assault and tried before a court. Officers who replace them should be given full training in, and appreciation of, Aboriginal history, culture and social behaviour as recommended by Mr Justice Muirhead and should show a proven ability to communicate effectively and work with Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> Until such steps are taken, in many places throughout the country we cannot expect to see a decline in the disproportionate number of Aboriginal deaths in custody. It was a great disappointment to me and many Australians that the Government did not effect a land rights treaty in the Bicentenary of European settlement of this country. However, we are able to do something practical immediately as a result of Mr Justice Muirhead's inquiries. Such pockets of police brutality as I have described tonight should be shown to be completely unacceptable to all Australians, and those who are responsible for it should be charged, as an example to others. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise a matter of major concern to a very large section of the Australian business community. Australian stock markets are right now being misled in a major way by totally incorrect, misleading, interim company profit reports that do not reflect the real earnings performance of these companies-many of them major ones, many of them reporting `profits' involving multi-millions of dollars. I use the word `profits' because they are so-called profits. But the disastrous thing is that this is happening solely because this Government has changed, through one of its agencies, the interpretation of the word `profit' in one very serious particular. That serious particular is in the matter of unrealised foreign exchange profits or losses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been only from the beginning of this year that this change has taken place. What is required under these changed accounting standards-details of which are revealed in the Accounting Standards Review Board's annual report for 1987-88, which I will deal with in a minute-is that these new accounting standards require companies to reveal what the unrealised profit or loss has been, on any changes in the value of the foreign exchange borrowings on their books or any foreign exchange loans on their books. In the past, variations in the value of loans have been written off or credited over a period of several years. This was in order to smooth out the impact of such changes in the value of such loans in foreign exchange terms because obviously, when the currency is a free currency with a market place, the value of that currency fluctuates severely. </PARA>
<PARA> This new accounting standard is an absolute farce. There are some major Australian companies that have reported interim profits of multi-millions of dollars. I am aware that in some of those companies a large proportion of the multi-million dollars of interim profits has not in fact been taken; they are simply in the books and, because the Australian dollar has subsequently fallen in the current half of the year, that declared interim profit will be wiped out in the second half of the year. It will be shown to have been a totally phoney profit. Having spoken to some of the companies and accountants involved, they say they are required to report in this way because of the new accounting standards. They are required to take in this bit of paper profit, which they have quite frankly, in some cases, no capacity to take in simply because the loan might be outstanding and might not be coming up during this period at all. The fact is these profits have not been taken; they are simply paper profits and they are required to report that they are `profits'. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely there is a way that these companies could say, `However, a large proportion of our profit is made up of unrealised profits and we cannot be confident that they will be maintained for the rest of the year'. Companies can do that. But there are many companies which prefer not to, for a whole lot of market reasons. There are many companies which quite like to see their profits boosted and their share price boosted as a result by this profit which, as I said, in so many instances will be shown to be a phoney profit. </PARA>
<PARA> One company, Santos Ltd, decided to deal with this matter in a very conservative and, on the face of it, incredibly honourable way. It declared that it certainly had, because it is required to by the Accounting Standards Review Board, a book profit of this order, but then in fact it wrote that profit off into a reserve. This was a reserve for future currency falls. I might say that that is all very well and the company clearly was trying to give a proper indication to its shareholders. But had in fact there been a temporary loss, it would have been required to report a loss and it could not have offset that loss by creating some sort of future reserve for future profits on currency accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that this nonsense has been perpetrated because, according to the Accounting Standards Review Board, it is an international standard. That is sort of right but not quite right. It is true that, if Australian corporations want to borrow, for example, from the United States, they have to re-write their accounts to fit into this interpretation of profit. But in Canada, for example, the former Australian system operates. That is sensible, because, let us face it, Australia and Canada have a business community in which a massive proportion of their borrowings is coming from overseas; unlike in the United States where the net amount would be a tiny fraction of the borrowings that Australian corporations have. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a matter of major principle and I believe the Accounting Standards Review Board is not only to blame for this ludicrous situation, but it must revise its view or else bring in new arrangements which would correct the situation. I believe it should allow companies to go back to the old evening-out system but to oblige them to say in their notes to the accounts, `However, if the international accounting standard were applied the profit would have been $X in this situation'. But the Board has not done that. I think in the past the Accounting Standards Review Board has been a mite too academic and not quite had the sort of hard-nosed practical approach that it should have had. </PARA>
<PARA> I am much cheered up by the change in composition of that Board and I believe it now is at last starting to deal with the things that really matter. Certainly there is a list on page 16 of the latest annual report which deals with priorities in considering accounting standards. There I am glad to see that it is going to examine the separation of realised and unrealised gains in the profit and loss account, requiring in fact a clear distinction rather than this ludicrous situation that the present system has now imposed on the stock markets, with, as I said, this massively phoney number of interim profits. </PARA>
<PARA> The ludicrous thing is that, if a director takes the view that to include that profit would be massively misleading and that, therefore, he should not follow the standard, he can find himself hauled up before the National Companies and Securities Commission. The professional bodies will frown on the matter and he will have great difficulty with his auditors anyway. It does seem to me that something immediate has got to be done. But the Board has also done something, it seems to me, which is absolutely ludicrous about goodwill. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator. I will improve my thespian style. It also has introduced a ludicrous situation about goodwill which, quite frankly, I think is the worst decision it has made. Under the old system a company could write off goodwill, particularly on acquisition, over a period of 20 years or so; it could write it off against the reserves it had built up. That system applies in the United Kingdom, for example, where goodwill can be written off either against the company's reserves or against profit. The system in the United States of America means that it has to be written off over 40 years out of profits. The difference between writing it off out of profits and out of reserves is of major significance to what a company's accounts will look like.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are now finding some ludicrous arrangements being made in terms of takeover in order to doctor the accounts, to make them look good in the face of what seems to me to be a stupid goodwill requirement, which I trust will be fixed up. Why are we regarding the United States system as the world standard when, as I say, in the United Kingdom for example, there is a choice? This has to be fixed up. It seems to me that there is a fair risk that some companies may well be paying dividends out of unearned profits, because of the previous matter I raised about including in profit unrealised profits. I do not think that is a healthy standard. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by making a couple of points about the Accounting Standards Review Board annual report. I have a great concern about this because for some years I was heavily involved in the annual report award, which judged the merit of annual reports by Australian corporations. In fact, I was a former chairman of that. While I welcome the attempt to improve accounting standards that is now being shown by the current membership of the Review Board, I simply say that it is lousy accounting. It is a very poor reporting standard for the annual report for the year to June 1988 to be presented to the Senate in April 1989, 10 months late. I think that is most unfortunate, particularly as the report was completed and sent to the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities by 26 October last year. What have the Government and the Council been doing with this report? Can the custodians of good reporting in Australia please smarten themselves up? I ask the Minister at the table, the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), to use whatever endeavours he can to improve the standards of reporting, at least in terms of time. I commend the Board for getting its accounts in by October, particularly in view of the problems it faced with the most unfortunate death of a director of the Board, Mr Morley, and the difficulties that other members of the staff had in carrying on afterwards. I commend them for it, but I certainly do not commend the Government for bringing in this report so late. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) On 20 December 1984 an Aeronautical Information Circular was issued notifying changes to the airspace in the Sydney Control Zone. The changes became effective on 4 July 1985. This change in airspace was introduced in order to allow for the non-controlled operation of helicopters and float planes over certain areas of Sydney. While local Councils have been and continue to be consulted on issues associated with the Civil Aviation Regulations, they were not consulted in the development of this particular proposal. The then Department of Aviation assessed the environmental aspects of the proposal. The Department's assessment included the change in noise level, pollution, safety and the hours of operation on the routes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The proposal was not required to be referred to the then Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment, as the assessment by the then Department of Aviation concluded that the proposal was not environmentally significant.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Air Navigation (Aircraft Noise) Regulations require that all aircraft made in, or imported into, Australia satisfy the appropriate requirements of the International Civil Aviation Organisation's Annex 16, Volume I, ``Aircraft Noise''. Apart from this requirement there are no specific rules or regulations that restrict aircraft noise emissions over the Sydney metropolitan area.</PARA>
<PARA> Civil Aviation Regulation 157 requires that an aircraft shall not fly over a city, town or populous area at a lower height than 1500 feet, or over any other area at a lower height than 500 feet, except in specified circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> Environmental assessments of noise levels have been undertaken by the Civil Aviation Authority in relation to helicopters and airships. The Authority has indicated that if operated in accordance with their directions the degree of noise from helicopters and airships would not be comparable with the much louder noise levels of jet aircraft and, in general, would not have a significant impact on the environment.</PARA>
<PARA> The noise reduction strategy recently introduced at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport has considerably reduced the use of flight paths to the north, east and west of the airport between 11 pm and 6 am by all aircraft types. After 1 January 1990 the only propeller driven aircraft permitted to use the airport during these curfew hours will be those meeting new international noise certification standards.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Pilots of propeller-driven aircraft may ask permission to fly over Cremorne and Neutral Bay. These requests are normally granted. There are also occasions when Air Traffic Control may direct an aircraft to fly over these areas. During the late night and early morning, care is taken to ensure that aircraft do not unnecessarily overfly Cremorne or Neutral Bay.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Charter operations by the Bond airship were approved in January 1987. The authorisation was issued for the duration of the Air Operators' Certificate, which is still current.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes. The landing area dimensions are surveyed in accordance with the British Civil Aviation Regulation Section Q. The dimensions were assessed by Australian specialists employed by the then Department of Aviation and were deemed suitable.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No. All flights by the airships are restricted to above 1500 feet over populous areas. Special approval has very occasionally been granted to come down to 1000 feet over the Harbour, for example for the start of the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) It is not possible to give a precise figure for expenditure on child survival and primary health care within Australia's overseas aid program because:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) many projects in the health sector have a broad impact on communities and are not targeted at specific age groups</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the definitions of `child survival' and `primary health care' can vary according to whether, for example, water supply projects are included in primary health care</PARA>
<PARA> (c) several substantial items of broader aid programs ultimately benefit child (and general) health activities. This is particularly the case with budget support to Papua New Guinea, emergency food aid, and assistance through non-government organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> Bearing these qualifications in mind, bilateral aid specifically directed to the health sector in 1987/88 formed 1.1 per cent of the total overseas aid budget of $1,019.5 million for that year. In addition, aid contributions to multilateral and international agencies active in the health field accounted for a further 1.0 per cent of the above total (see part 2 for details).</PARA>
<PARA> It is likely that this total of 2.1 per cent significantly understates the ultimate benefit to the health sector from the totality of our overseas aid because of the health benefits of other programs. A study of this issue in 1986 by the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) indicated that, on the basis used by other national aid agencies, about 4 per cent of Australia's bilateral and multilateral aid was spent directly in the health sector. If all forms of aid were analysed to determine their ultimate uses, this figure would be approximately 12 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Total bilateral Official Development Assistance (ODA) expenditure on health in 1987/88 was approximately $11.3 million. In addition, ODA contributions to multilateral and international agencies active in the health sector included $3.1 million to UNICEF; $0.65 million to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities; $6.3 million to the World Health Organisation (of which the Department of Community Services and Health provided $4.8 million); and $0.9 million and $0.62 million to other international health and population programs respectively.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, major portions of Australia's Budgetary Support to Papua New Guinea ($275 million), emergency food aid ($21.2 million) and aid to non-Government organisations ($8.0 million) would have been spent on health oriented programs, although exact figures on the health components are not available.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In September 1987, the Government initiated a long term strategy for improving the visibility, focus and programming of health sector assistance in Australia's overseas aid program. The strategy reaffirms the need to give priority to assistance at the primary level, and recommends a theme of WATCH (Women and Their Children's Health). To provide additional support to the health strategy, the 1988/89 budget included $3.1 million for the first year of a four year package of health initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA> This four year package is estimated to cost approximately $20 million. Therefore, annual funding for health care is expected to increase beyond this year's allocation. The package will be directed towards countries of the South Pacific and South East Asia, as well as international agencies such as UNICEF and WHO. Priority is given to activities which support the WATCH theme, such as immunisation activities which promote improved primary health care systems, as well as integrated community-based primary health care projects.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) AIDAB is currently undertaking a review of the focus on poverty in the aid program. It will attempt to gauge how, and to what extent, aid expenditures directly impact on poverty. The review was announced publicly by the former Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Hayden, at AIDAB's World Development Debate in Canberra on 27 July 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The terms of reference for the review are detailed below. It is expected that the study will be completed in May this year.</PARA>
<PARA>TERMS OF REFERENCE</PARA>
<PARA>Targeting Poverty in the Aid Program</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Background</PARA>
<PARA> 1.1 The objective of the aid program is to promote the economic and social advancement of the peoples of developing countries in response to Australia's humanitarian concerns, as well as Australia's foreign policy and commercial interests. There is a strong commitment to these humanitarian principles not only from the Minister and the Government, but the Australian aid constituency as well. One way in which the aid program attempts to meet these humanitarian concerns is through programs designed to alleviate poverty.</PARA>
<PARA> 1.2 Poverty relief in the aid program was considered at the May meeting of the AIDAB Policy Committee. The Committee decided that an examination of the extent to which the Bureau's current approach helps alleviate poverty in developing countries would be timely. Accordingly the Committee approved a study of poverty alleviation in the aid program.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Objectives</PARA>
<PARA> 2.1 To prepare a paper for the Bureau which</PARA>
<PARA>develops a workable definition of poverty,</PARA>
<PARA>examines how aid programs can contribute to the process of poverty alleviation in developing countries,</PARA>
<PARA>examines the ways and extent to which the Australian aid program contributes to poverty alleviation, and</PARA>
<PARA>suggests ways in which the aid program could increase its poverty focus.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Specific Issues</PARA>
<PARA> 3.1 Poverty issues and aid</PARA>
<PARA> The paper will examine the ways in which aid donors can contribute to poverty alleviation in developing countries. As part of this examination a classification of poverty alleviation activities will be developed. The classification will encompass a range of aid mechanisms aimed at poverty relief, including those that provide, and improve access to, basic necessities to those that provide more permanent solutions.</PARA>
<PARA> The paper will recognize the capacity of aid activities that promote general economic growth to reduce the incidence of poverty. Indeed these activities can be an integral part of an aid recipient's poverty alleviation program. However the main focus will be on aid activities that deliver their benefits to the poor through reasonably direct mechanisms. Thus the paper will examine aid activities that:</PARA>
<PARA> provide immediate relief mainly through transfers: e.g. emergency food aid, disaster relief;</PARA>
<PARA> provide longer terms solutions:</PARA>
<PARA> by raising income gained from home production for consumption or sale: e.g. through land reform, infrastructure development, agricultural extension, agricultural research and other inputs that increase rural productivity;</PARA>
<PARA> by raising income gained from sale of labour through creating, and increasing access to, employment: e.g. cooperatives for craft production, rural labour intensive public works.</PARA>
<PARA> by raising imputed income gained from public services through the provision of, or increasing access to, public services; these services also have important secondary effects on other types of income manifested in areas such as increased crop production and labour income: e.g. primary health care, basis education, water supply, services in poor urban areas.</PARA>
<PARA> The limitations of an aid program in alleviating poverty will also be identified.</PARA>
<PARA> 3.2 Australian aid</PARA>
<PARA>The paper will examine how the current Australian aid program helps alleviate poverty using the classification developed in 3.1. Areas of the program to be reviewed include:</PARA>
<PARA> in country programs</PARA>
<PARA> project aid: a comparison of different sectors</PARA>
<PARA> training</PARA>
<PARA> commodity aid</PARA>
<PARA> the small grants scheme</PARA>
<PARA> DIFF</PARA>
<PARA> in global programs</PARA>
<PARA> Emergencies</PARA>
<PARA> Relief and Refugees</PARA>
<PARA> Voluntary Agencies</PARA>
<PARA> IFIs</PARA>
<PARA> UN organizations</PARA>
<PARA> Academic Research.</PARA>
<PARA> The paper will discuss the relative effectiveness of AIDAB's various types of aid activities in alleviating poverty with particular emphasis on the relationship between the nature of the aid activity, the development environment in a particular country and effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA> The paper will also examine the appropriateness of the balance in the aid program between the different kinds of aid activity which help to alleviate poverty.</PARA>
<PARA> 3.3 Prospects in the Australian aid program</PARA>
<PARA> The paper will identify ways in which the aid program can further contribute to the alleviation of poverty in developing countries. In particular:</PARA>
<PARA> identifying existing activities within the aid program that could be supported further to increase its poverty focus, identifying new aid activities that could increase the poverty focus, and</PARA>
<PARA> outlining the next steps that could be taken in each case such as:</PARA>
<PARA> increasing resources to particular program elements,</PARA>
<PARA> comparative assessment of agencies targeted for greater resource allocation,</PARA>
<PARA> regional initiatives,</PARA>
<PARA> sectoral reviews, and</PARA>
<PARA> packaging of a poverty initiative in the aid program.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. OUTPUT</PARA>
<PARA> 4.1 An initial working paper of 10 to 15 pages in length to be circulated for comment followed by a final paper suitable for publication.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The findings of the review will be made public when it is completed.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) This review of the poverty focus of the aid program is a policy paper. As such it aims to identify, in a broad context, those aid expenditures that directly assist the poor. It will not involve the collection of data on poverty in specific countries and so does not focus on particular indicators of poverty. AIDAB uses the range of social and economic indicators that are available for particular countries for country programming considerations. Such measures are likely to be more relevant to designing activities that may stem from the poverty review.</PARA>

<PARA> The occupations that are open to women are currently under review, with a view to increasing the employment opportunities for women.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible to state the numbers of each occupation that are open in each state. Unit commanders are given maximum flexibility in deciding whether positions will be filled by women, within the guidelines of the trades that are open and a requirement that women do not exceed 10% of the unit's authorised manning level.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There is a ceiling on the number of women that can serve in the Army Reserve at one time. That ceiling is 10% of the authorised manning level, which at present stands at 28 000. This ceiling was introduced to enhance the opportunities for women to serve in the Army Reserve. Army Reserve units are geographically based and Reserve soldiers are necessarily drawn from the local community. To apply the same employment criteria to the Reserve which apply to the Regular Army would have denied many women entry to their local unit because most units have a combat or combat related role. However, to ensure that Reserve units were able to sustain operational capabilities, a numerical limit was applied to women serving in the Reserve. As can be seen from the figures in the table, the ceiling is currently being exceeded. The ceiling will be included in the overall review mentioned above.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Detailed statistics on the number of women per state, who apply to join the Army Reserve or who are rejected because there is no vacancy, are not available, due to practical difficulties in aggregating unit statistics at regional level. However more suitable females enquire about Army Reserve service than can be placed in current unit vacancies. If there are no female vacancies at the time of an enquiry, the applicant is placed on a waiting list. An application is then completed when a vacancy becomes available.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Wednesday 21 December 1988 (Hansard Page 4765), Senator Reid asked me a question without notice concerning the relationship between SkillShare and the community youth support scheme and, in particular, whether organisations seeking funding under SkillShare are required to enter into joint ventures with community youth support schemes in order to qualify for funding. The Minister for Employment and Education Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There was no formal requirement within the SkillShare guidelines for potential sponsors to enter into joint ventures with former CYSS Local Management Committees (LMCs) in order to qualify for funding. However, to maximise effective use of funds, a number of amalgamations between MLCs/sponsors of projects funded under the previous programs were encouraged.</PARA>
