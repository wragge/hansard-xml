We totally reject the concept of ``X'' rated or ``N.V.E.'' rated video-cassettes, which would allow the legal sale and hire of hard-core pornographic videos for viewing in the homes of our nation, which would endanger our children; and</PARA>
<PARA>2. To give whole-hearted support to Senator Walter's Private Member's Bill to implement the recommendations of the Select Committee on Videos; and</PARA>

The Commission of inquiry into possible illegal activities and associated police misconduct conducted by Mr Tony Fitzgerald QC constitutes one of the most prominent and comprehensive enquiries on the subject. The Bills now before the Parliament represent a strong weapon against potential corruption. Unlike the Queensland legislation which was presumably passed, in response to revelations before the Commission, the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Bill covers not only public officials and judges but also parliamentarians. It supplements measures passed by the Parliament during the autumn sittings dealing with corrupt members of the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with comments the Attorney-General made to the House of Representatives when he introduced the Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, these bills will provide for the restraint of property and the recovery of superannuation benefits which have already been paid to a corrupt employee who is convicted and sentenced to more than 12 months imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Bill 1989 provides for the loss, or recovery, of government funded superannuation benefits payable, or paid, to existing or former employees of the Commonwealth or of a Commonwealth Authority who are convicted of a corruption offence and sentenced to imprisonment for life or for more than 12 months. These provisions do not, of course, affect the payment of the employee's own contributions and any interest on those contributions that may have accrued under a superannuation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The bill empowers a court, upon the application of the director of public prosecutions, when sentencing the person for a corruption offence to make a superannuation order. These orders provide that any future payments of government monies in respect of the person must cease and may, where appropriate, specify an amount that is to be recovered from a person who has already received payment of benefits as with the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, the amount specified in the order may be recovered as if it were a debt and, as under that Act, there are sophisticated measures to ensure that payment is not avoided by the use of the corporate veil, unlawful disposal of property or by absconding. </PARA>
<PARA> The bill has a comprehensive regime of restraining orders which enables property of a person who is convicted, charged or about to be charged with a corruption offence, to be frozen until the results of the criminal proceedings and any application for a superannuation order are known. </PARA>
<PARA> As under the Bankruptcy Act 1966, any property that has been disposed of by the person by way of gift can also be there subject of restraining orders. These provisions are designed to combat efforts by the offender to dispose of property by giving it to relatives or associates as soon as detection of the offence appears likely. </PARA>
<PARA> The government has rejected the approach taken by the Queensland Parliament in the Public Officers Superannuation Benefits Recovery Act 1988 whereby the courts are given the option of forfeiting only part of the person's superannuation entitlement where the offence is considered to be minor or where hardship may result from the order. Rather, minor offences are placed outside the scope of the Commonwealth Bill by the condition precedent that a sentence of more than 12 months imprisonment be imposed for the offence. </PARA>
<PARA> This government is firmly of the view that there is no scope for watering down the forfeiture in such cases as superannuation benefits should only be paid from public monies to persons who discharge their duties in a non-corrupt manner. The government views corruption of office as a failure to fulfil a condition of employment which should result in the disentitlement to publicly funded superannuation benefits. While the consequence of conviction for a corruption offence under the bill will be the loss of publicly funded superannuation benefits there may also be other remedies available under other legislation. For example, where a corruption offence involved the payment of a bribe to a public official, an amount equal to the bribe may be recoverable under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> This government is determined to ensure that corruption does not infiltrate the commonwealth or its instrumentalities and this bill will provide a strong financial disincentive to any who may be tempted to engage in corruption now or in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is a companion Bill to the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Bill 1989 and strengthens the provisions of the Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Act 1989 which was passed during the Autumn sittings of Parliament. The Bill contains provisions which facilitate the recovery of Commonwealth funded superannuation benefits already paid to corrupt members of the AFP and enable the Director of Public Prosecutions to obtain restraining orders against property to secure such recovery where it is likely that a person may be convicted of a corruption offence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Scheme is broadly similar to that contained in the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Bill 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures were foreshadowed in the House of Representatives during the debate on the Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 in May this year. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> The proposed amendment to delete reference to the Chief Justice as an ex-officio member of the National Debt Commission has been introduced in deference to the wishes of the Chief Justice of Australia, Sir Anthony Mason. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chief Justice requested the amendment on the grounds that the activities of the Commission have no relationship to the responsibilities of the Chief Justice, and that a Chief Justice is ordinarily unable to contribute any economic expertise to the Commission's deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Debt Commission was established under the National Debt Sinking Fund Act 1923. The Chief Justice's membership was based on British precedence and on the belief that public confidence in the Commission would be enhanced by the presence of an important apolitical figure. </PARA>
<PARA> Neither reason is relevant today, and there is no particular need for the Chief Justice's membership as a legal representative. Legal matters affecting the National Debt Commission and the National Debt Sinking Fund are referred to the Attorney-General's Department which is represented on the Commission by its Secretary. </PARA>

<PARA>COMMONWEALTH BORROWING LEVY AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for certain technical amendments which will ensure that the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy continues to apply to all Commonwealth authorities and their subsidiaries, as was intended by the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Act 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> The levy is imposed on the borrowings of all Commonwealth semi-government authorities and Government-owned companies, other than those engaged in the business of financial intermediation, such as the Commonwealth Bank and the Australian Industry Development Corporation. The levy currently set at a rate of 0.125 per cent per annum, is designed to take account of the benefit these enterprises receive in terms of access to financial markets by virtue of their Commonwealth ownership. By ensuring that the effective cost of borrowings to these enterprises is more directly comparable with that faced by private sector borrowers, the enterprises are encouraged to take full account of the cost to the community of their investment decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments provided for all in the Bill will expand the list of authorities subject to the levy to include the Civil Aviation Authority and Aerospace Technologies of Australia, two recently-created Commonwealth authorities. The Bill also provides for the ACT Electricity and Water Authority to be excluded from paying the levy from 11 May 1989, the day ACT self-government was proclaimed. This will ensure that, under the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Act 1987, ACT authorities will be treated on the same basis as State and Northern Territory semi-government authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for some minor definitional changes which will allow the levy to be applied to any new authorities through their enabling legislation, and to the subsidiaries of Commonwealth authorities. This will minimise the need for further legislative changes of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments will increase revenue raised from the levy in the 1989-90 financial year by an estimated $220,000 to $8,720,000. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill, and commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>COMMONWEALTH BORROWING LEVY COLLECTION AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Amendment Bill 1989 provides that, from the proclamation of ACT Self-government on 11 May 1989, borrowings by the ACT Electricity and Water Authority (ACTEW) cease to be subject to the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to provide that the ACTEW also cease to be liable for payments of the former Commonwealth Guarantee Charge. Under the current legislation, the ACTEW is liable for the charge in respect of outstanding amounts of borrowings undertaken in 1986-87. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will reduce the revenue raised from the Charge in 1989-90 by an estimated $54,000 to $2,446,000. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>The intention of the original motion was to induce us to pass the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill this week so that we would not have to come back for an extra week. As such, it has been a monumental failure. However, we will persist with the motion. Between 15 August this year and yesterday 132 hours and 47 minutes were spent in this chamber; of those, 35 hours 54 minutes were spent in considering Government legislation. We are getting to the stage where the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission legislation is bogging down the program enormously. We are required to come back the extra week to clear it. That is not an editorial on how the debate has been progressing or anything else, but to get to the other 83 pieces of legislation it is necessary to sit the extra week. </PARA>
<PARA> When we come to the end of a session, honourable senators usually say, `Goodness gracious! Look at this blockage in the program. We should sit more often'. However, every time we put up a motion to sit more often, nobody in the chamber is happy. It is the classic difference between the macro-position and the micro-position and it will never change. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore sought leave to amend the fairly draconian notice of motion that I gave notice of, in view of some amicable discussion this morning. There are three essential amendments to the original notice. The first is that under normal circumstances we would finish at 7.30 p.m. on Wednesday night. The second amendment would be to allow a matter of public importance for Thursday. The third amendment is to allow a matter of public importance for Wednesday although if that option is exercised on the Wednesday we would sit two hours later on that day. Those are the essential changes to the original proposal. I think there is some agreement on them around the chamber. I regret that we have to come back. I am not one who believes in adding extra sitting weeks because I think we just absorb the time, but the fact that five weeks into the sitting we are still on the first major piece of legislation means that we need another week. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-If no-one else wishes to speak, I will use my right of reply to say that Senator Harradine is under a mistaken belief if he thinks the Government is not, during this two-week period, committed to getting through the health legislation, which as he knows was amended, and the superannuation legislation, which is basically non-controversial but does involve a start-up date. If it is not passed we cannot restore the 2 per cent in the first pay cheque after the decision is supposed to come into operation. Senator Harradine is a wonderful human being if he thinks we can finish the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill today. He has a vibrant optimism that has washed out of me. If Senator Harradine is right and we can knock this over in day, he and I will be on the plane home on Tuesday, the 17th. We will not stick around and keep people here for three weeks in a row. The only two items of business we want to transact in that extra week, as far as I know, are ATSIC and maybe a ministerial statement on the future of the Auditor- General, et cetera, which we would like to have got in today but we could not quite make it. So if Senator Harradine's optimism is right and we will be able to conclude the debate quickly, we will all go home and return on 23 October.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the Superannuation and Other Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill in the light of the comments by Senator Robert Ray dealing with the additional week we are proposing to sit. Senator Ray cited this piece of legislation as one of the reasons that we have to have extra sitting time; to enable the 2 per cent increase to be paid the Bill has to go through fairly speedily. Let me say right from the outset that the Opposition is supporting this Bill. It is about time that that 2 per cent was restored. Indeed, in the interests of ensuring that the time of the Senate is not wasted, both Senator Newman and I will be speaking for a period considerably less than people tend to do in this chamber to put the message that we support the legislation, that it is about time the 2 per cent was restored, and that the Government deserves criticism for taking it away in the first place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill restores the 2 per cent that was taken away in 1986. At the time the Government used the rationale that, in the interests of everybody being subject to wages restraint, retired public servants under the Commonwealth superannuation scheme and, indeed, veterans would have to suffer a reduction in the annual increase they would normally have expected in accordance with the consumer price index (CPI). In 1986 the CPI was 9.2 per cent but they received a rise of only 7.2 per cent. That was done in a fairly tortuous way. First of all the 9.2 per cent was to be paid. Then it was to be reduced as from 10 October 1986. So those two groups of people suffered a 2 per cent reduction in superannuation payments. The Government said it was always intended that the 2 per cent be restored some time, I think it said, when the economy could afford it. I am pleased to see that it can honour its intent and restore it at this stage. But to say that the economy is in good shape and that is why it is able to so do is really not a credible statement. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is in an all time crisis with its balance of payments, with high inflation and a mismanaged economy. In the port of Sydney a levy of $200 per container is to be levied because of the delays, because of union action and because of the work practices that still exist in that area. Yet the Government is not prepared to tackle that, either. It was mismanagement that caused superannuants to receive the 2 per cent cut in the first place. The same mismanagement is still in place but at least these people will not continue to be made to suffer for the Government's inept handling of the economy. The Opposition welcomes the restoration and supports this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the 1983 election the then shadow Minister for defence, Mr Gordon Scholes, said that there would be no change affecting the defence forces superannuation entitlements. Again, that was not adhered to and those people suffered that cut in 1986. The interference with the integrity of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme has contributed to the erosion of public sector morale, both in the Public Service and in the defence forces. Morale in the Public Service is certainly low. The so-called reforms that the Government introduced have not been successful in increasing morale, or efficiency and accountability in the Public Service. The Government enforced a system on people. Minister Morris said recently that to fix some of those problems he would throw in $10m but he does not know how that $10m is yet to be spent. </PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth superannuants made contributions to the scheme in the belief that there would be a full adjustment of the pension in accordance with the CPI. The peremptory action of the Government in 1986 was in breach of conditions which superannuants believed existed when they made those contributions. The monetary loss that they have suffered during the period 1986 to date will not be restored. They have simply had to suffer that loss but then the standard of living of other Australians has similarly dropped because of the Government's poor management of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> One could be tempted to say-and probably believe-that the restoration of the 2 per cent is being made now because we are going into an election phase, whether the election is to be held on 2 December or whether it is to be held in February. The election has to be held by 12 May. The likelihood is that all the Government's actions-whether it is buying off Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd for $60m, the banks for $200m or the airlines for $100m-are taking place in an attempt to get back into the community's good books. The same can be said for the defence forces and the Public Service with the restoration of the 2 per cent which the Government took away in such an arbitrary fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> The cynicism of this Government and the way it is breaking down in trying to buy sectional interests are apparent at every phase of its administration. It has only been the constant pressure by the Opposition and others who have been affected that has highlighted this issue as one which the Government, if it were not for its election timetable, would not have acceded to at this point. </PARA>
<PARA> I said from the beginning that we support this legislation. I said that it is time that the 2 per cent was restored. I also said that it is important that the Senate and the Australian public understand that the manner in which this is being restored is simply to try to win back a sectional vote from part of the electorate. The incident involving the gentleman in Whyalla in South Australia, who was referred to in such derogatory terms as a `silly old bugger' by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), highlights the attitude which the Government had towards superannuants in 1986. Just as the Prime Minister realised that he had made a grave error and tried to stop the piece of television footage on the Whyalla incident going to air, he is trying to win back the support of people whom he held in contempt in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the responsibility of the Government to provide a sound economy in which Australians can expect to work and to receive benefits in return for the effort that they put in. It is the responsibility of the Government to provide a framework in which the private sector can flourish, in which the public sector is able to perform well and be rewarded and recognised for the good work it does, and to provide a climate in which accountability and efficiency in government are the key words. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, through many actions, has shown that it is cynical, tired and collapsing. As I have said, it is not only trying to buy back this group of people by restoring their rights-their 2 per cent-but it is also trying to buy off other sections such as Kodak, the banks and the airlines. But nothing is being done about the waterfront where the economy is suffering gravely, where there is a grave need for attention, because that is where the union mates still have their clout. The Australian Council of Trade Unions simply will not say that the Government may act in any way to allow those reforms to make our waterfront an efficient part of our export system which, in turn, could assist our economy. The Opposition firmly supports this Bill but, as I have said, it has come too late and it is only part of a `buying back the electors' principle. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the shadow Minister for defence science and personnel, I join my colleague Senator Bishop in welcoming the measure which is before the chamber. However, I share her cynicism at the timing of its presentation to the Parliament. I draw attention to the fact that back in September 1986 I, along with my coalition colleagues and the Australian Democrats, fought tooth and nail against this measure which we found to be quite unconscionable. On 24 September 1986, the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, who was hell bent on getting this measure through the Parliament, referred to what he called `the sort of disgusting performance from the coalition that we saw earlier today'. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats were their usual mixture of irresponsible opportunism, coupled with occasional flights away with the fairies, whereas the Liberals displayed their usual stupidity, opportunism and cowardice. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Minister for Finance said back in September 1986 when he was introducing this measure, about the alarm and concern of the Opposition in this place, the people in the defence forces and former members of the defence forces who were so seriously affected by the measure. It was quite unjust and totally different from the short freeze on pensions with which the Government tried to equate the measure. This unfair, unjust measure has lasted from September 1986 to October 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, on 12 April, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mr Simmons, pointed out in a press release:</PARA>
<PARA>Although the DFRB and DFRDB pensions have been adjusted for the full increase in the CPI in the two years since 1986-</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know where he got that figure of two years from; I make it three-</PARA>
<PARA>the 2 per cent discount reduced the base on which these pensions have been calculated. </PARA>
<PARA>Therein lies the unfairness. Although the Minister does not go on to say that, I do. The reduction in the base of the pension, on which all further increases have been calculated, shows the gross inequity in the measure. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is typical of this Government to treat its own employees and those who serve this country in such an underhanded and irresponsible manner. It is typical of the way in which the conditions of service of our Defence Force personnel have been whittled back in the long hard years since this Government came to power; although the remainder of its time in office is short. We have seen the results of the Government's treatment of Defence Force personnel in the alarming wastage rates, the loss of experienced personnel from our Defence Force. Certainly the Government can recruit more people at great cost and put them back into the forces, but we are reducing the experience level of our forces. Anybody who is concerned about the future security of this country has to be alarmed at what these measures have meant to the ability of this country to defend itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it goes without saying that those people who have actually had their pension base cut have been particularly concerned. In each Budget and mini-Budget since 1986 when the 2 per cent discount was implemented Defence personnel have gone on hoping that the Government and its leader would amend what had been done. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate what we were told in 1986 when this measure was taken. In the extraordinary circumstances of the economy-I am referring to the Minister's second reading speech-all members of the community were required to share the cost of reducing government expenditure. This is meant to be one of those measures. Let me remind the Senate what the Government's spending priorities were at that time. I referred to these measures when I debated the introduction of the 2 per cent cut back in September 1986. The Government was claiming then that this measure would save $4.7m in that year and $6.3m in a full year. Let us remember that it is three years on. Some of the measures which the Government then regarded as priorities included women surfboard riders, who received $11,000 for a research project to provide a more comfortable surfboard for women. Mr Keating was getting $17,000 for not sleeping in his own bed. The union movement was getting a $1m art in working life program and prisoners in gaol were taking out $1.4m in dole moneys. Those who were trying to defend the Americas Cup were being given $30m. Nevertheless, the people who had served this country in the defence forces were having their pension entitlements unilaterally cut out from underneath them without any opportunity to make representations such as the protected trade union movement had through the Australian Council of Trade Unions when there might have been any such attempt to peg them back at all. The pensioners had no opportunity for consensus or consultation, or whatever the in word of the Government was at the time. That is what the spending priorities were in 1986 when this 2 per cent cut was made. In the May mini-Budget last year Defence Force personnel were told:</PARA>
<PARA> When foreign debt as a proportion of GDP is clearly on a falling trend and real wages are on a rising trend the Government will consider the issue. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask you, Mr Acting Deputy President, whether anybody in Australia can tell us that foreign debt as a proportion of gross domestic product is on a falling trend today. Can anybody acknowledge that real wages are on a rising trend today? Yet the Government has considered the issue. Why has the Government considered the issue? As my colleague Senator Bishop set out so well before, the Government has only considered this issue as part of a package of measures leading to a cynical election. It is buying votes like all those other measures which have been coming before the Australian people in recent weeks, including the Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd issue, the environmental movement and the sectional interests that are being bought off. Now they are wanting to try to reduce the concern in the Defence Force and the Defence Force pensioner community. It is a clearly cynical exercise in buying votes. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me remind the Senate what the then Minister for Defence Science and Personnel said in July 1988 about the parameters required for the restoration of the 2 per cent discount on the Defence Forces retirement benefits and the Defence Force retirement and death benefits pensions. She said:</PARA>
<PARA>The current situation is that at the very least there are two criteria that will have to be met before it is economically responsible to restore the pre-October 1986 levels, the base on which indexation increases to Commonwealth superannuation pensions are calculated. </PARA>
<PARA> These criteria are:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that there be a clearly established rising trend in real wages; and that Australia's foreign debt expressed as a proportion of gross domestic product must be on a falling trend. </PARA>
<PARA>Have those criteria been met? No, no, a thousand times no, they have not. Yet we have this measure brought before the Senate. It is a welcome measure because we fought its original introduction in 1986. Suddenly the Government has seen reason. Has it suddenly become more intelligent, caring and understanding of what this measure has done to the Defence Force's heart? No, it is simply facing an election-and everybody in Australia knows it. </PARA>
<PARA> We welcome the opportunity to face the Government at an election. I welcome the opportunity for the defence forces to show just what they think of what the Government has done to them over the years. We know what the Government is really on about. We know that this is an election measure. Nevertheless, we welcome it, because it is long overdue and will rectify something that should never have occurred in the first place. Soldiers are not going to be conned. </PARA>
<PARA> They are also terribly concerned at the moment about the assurances from the present Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mr Simmons, once again in relation to their superannuation entitlements. A review is under way into that superannuation scheme. The Minister has said `Trust us. Current benefits will not be reduced'. How can they possibly trust this Government? Not one thing that it has touched relating to the defence forces has ever improved their lot. It has not kept its promises-and not just to the defence forces. I wonder what Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd is saying today? Does it trust the Government? No, it does not. Nobody trusts this Government's promises any more, least of all the defence forces. It does not matter how we hear the protests rising from the Government benches, it is too late; it has had its chance. Its word is no longer taken as its bond, if it ever was. Certainly there are too many disaffected groups for the Government to buy off any more. The defence forces know the Government for what it is. This cynical measure, this restoration of the 2 per cent, welcome though it is, is yet another example of a desperate government struggling to hold on to power. It is too late, and it will not wash. Nevertheless, the Opposition welcomes the fact that justice is finally being done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Superannuation and Other Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 restores to former Commonwealth Government employees, and particularly to defence personnel, the pensions that would have applied had the 2 per cent discounting that was passed in this place in October 1986 not been implemented. The reason we have to deal with it today is that restoration applies from November 1989 and nobody in this place, least of all the Australian Democrats, would want to hold up the administrative work that needs to be done in order to ensure that these people get their pension increases as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In her comments, Senator Bishop said that it was important that the 2 per cent increase needed to go through speedily. Certainly the Democrats would agree with that. She said that it was about time that the Government restored the economic damage that it did to some very needy people in the community in 1986. We agree with that. She criticised the Government for imposing the 2 per cent cuts on these people back in October 1986 in the first place. It is worth while pointing out to Senator Bishop, who as I recall was not here at the time, that this piece of legislation need not have gone through. The Government does not have the numbers in this place. Periodically, senators from one side or another combine to amend or defeat pieces of legislation. It was our intention in October 1986 that this Government amendment to discount by 2 per cent increases in this area would not go through. We thought that we had the support, certainly in principle, of the Opposition parties. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Peter Baume, speaking in the debate in 1986, quite rightly described the provisions in the Budget as mean and miserable in the areas of social security and veterans' affairs. He pointed out that it was directed at the most needy, the weakest and the most vulnerable in Australian society and condemned the Government for moving in this area. However, he went on to say that because the Bill represented part of the package of Budget measures, the Opposition was not going to oppose the legislation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is with reluctance that we will not oppose some of the matters that are in it for they impact unreasonably upon the poor, the weak and the needy in ways which actually are a betrayal of any Labour government. </PARA>
<PARA>I support Senator Baume's comments. Speaking on behalf of the Opposition in 1986, he claimed that the Opposition could not amend this legislation to prevent the Government from discounting defence service pensions because it was a Budget Bill. Yet last year the Opposition opposed in toto another budgetary measure, namely, the Government's move to tax goldmining companies. That was also a Budget measure but, because it was aimed not at defenceless, needy and weak people in the community but at the very powerful and the wealthy, the Opposition was prepared to put aside the principle that it claimed it adhered to so strongly, saying that it had reluctantly to allow the Government to cut pensions in this area. It appears that it is a matter not so much of whether the legislation comes out of the Budget or the May economic statement but who is likely to be affected by the legislation. That will determine whether the Opposition will pursue that particular principle. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Newman said that the Opposition fought tooth and nail to stop this legislation going through in 1986. I point out to her that the only way we can really fight tooth and nail for something to be stopped is to vote against it, and the Opposition did not do that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government said that it would restore this quite unfair measure when the economy allowed for it. There has been some discussion in this place this morning about whether now is or is not the right time. I certainly would not argue that it is the right time if that meant that the Government would decide to withdraw this restoration move. I find it fairly amazing that the Government could find $2 billion in 1988, with the support of the Opposition, to cut company tax by 20 per cent, from 49c in the dollar to 39c in the dollar, at a time when many of the biggest companies in the country were paying little or no tax. It could find $2 billion to give a gift last year to the major companies and it had to wait another year before it could find the additional $17m that it needed to restore for the year 1989-90 the pension increase that it took away from defence service personnel in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of this Bill will cost the Government a mere-in budgetary terms it is mere-$17m in the remainder of this financial year and something like $28m in a full year, compared with the $2,000m it was prepared to spend in cutting company tax last year. What does that do for the morale of people in the defence forces and those who have retired from the forces? What does it say to them about the Government's priorities with regard to the assistance it gives to different groups in the community? In October 1986 Senator Short, speaking on behalf of the Opposition, made this point:</PARA>
<PARA> What has the Government done to morale in the Services, with the reduction of 2 per cent in October this year in service pensions? At a time when we have record disenchantment amongst people in the Services, in terms of their morale-they are voting with their feet, resigning from the Services in record droves and weakening Australia's defence in the process-what does this Government do? It imposes a burden on the service pensioners which is quite outrageous when one takes into account the other priorities of the Government. What has this Government done to all those thrifty old-timers who have earned the right to a pension, all those people who have saved through their lives to provide a standard of living for themselves in their retirement, perhaps a meagre one but one of some comfort and a lack of deprivation?</PARA>
<PARA>That is all good bleeding heart stuff but Senator Short, too, refused to support the Democrat amendment that would have prevented this legislation from going through. He is, of course, right. Morale was low in 1986. It is still low and it was made lower because of the actions that the Government took and which the Opposition supported. It is worth remembering that defence service personnel do not just get a hand-out from governments when they retire. They contribute to their pension fund and they deserve not to have the benefit that they contribute towards undercut in this way simply because it suits the Government's economic purposes to give more money to the rich than to those who are in real need. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Short went on to say that he hoped that this particular move would mean that the Government was replaced as soon as possible and that the electorate would reject it. He finished off his speech by saying that he had no doubt at all that the thinking Australian public felt exactly the same way as the Opposition did, that is, that it was about time the Labor Government was removed. The Australian public, as we saw in 1987, clearly rejected Senator Short's position. I suspect that the reason for at least part of that rejection was that members of the public were not all as silly as some Opposition members perhaps thought. They noticed that there was a vast difference between the rhetoric that was mouthed in this chamber by Opposition senators weeping buckets of blood over what was happening to pensioners and ex-service personnel and the way they voted; that is, where they put their bodies when a division was called in this place about whether the Government would or would not be able to discount these pensions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not a surprise to anybody, therefore, that quite recently the University of New South Wales was able to bring down a report indicating how distorted the distribution of wealth is in Australia. This sort of move by the Government in keeping ex-service pensioners, age pensioners and other pensioners on very low incomes has been a significant contributing factor to the fact that the top 20 per cent of Australian families receive 43.7 per cent of the gross income of all families and the bottom 20 per cent receive 4.6 per cent. It is hardly surprising that the bottom 20 per cent of the Australian population, into which is clustered a large number of people who are recipients of Government pensions of one sort or another, should receive only 4.6 per cent of the wealth in this country. It is actions of the sort that the Opposition and the Government undertook in 1986 that ensure that so many people on pensions are kept in poverty in their retiring years. </PARA>
<PARA> The report from the University of New South Wales by Dr Saunders points out the great difference between allocating pensions in Australia and in other countries. He pointed out that countries such as the United States of America, for example, which do not have an operative contributory scheme are the worst at paying benefits to their post-retirement citizens. On the other hand, the European countries which have a social security system based on a social insurance principle, where people pay a certain percentage of their income when in work and receive a benefit when not in work, were high on the list of those countries that looked after their elderly, their retirees, their unemployed, pensioner and other such groups. It is about time that this more equalising policy of a contributory superannuation and pension scheme was put into greater effect in Australia. If that happened maybe the shameful sort of behaviour by this Government, with the support of the Opposition-I point out that Senator Harradine was the only other senator in this place who opposed the legislation in the division-in cutting back on benefits to the needy in order for it to build up a Budget sufficiently to be able to give $2 billion to the wealthy would cease. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the Superannuation and Other Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 and the restoration of the amount which was deducted from the entitlement of superannuants. One thing that has been overlooked in this whole debate is that the alleged reason for the Government discounting superannuation by 2 per cent in 1986 was that there should be equity among superannuants and workers. Senator Walsh is recorded on page 811 of the Senate Hansard of 25 September 1986 as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Salaries have already been discounted by 2 per cent as from 1 July; that is salaries presently paid have increased in the previous 12 months or six months by 2 per cent less than the rate of inflation as measured by the consumer price index. Therefore, those who have retired from the Commonwealth Public Service within the last few months or are likely to retire in the future will have a lower pension entitlement because the pension is determined by the salary applicable at the time of their retirement and then adjusted for CPI movements. So, given that the salary they received had increased by less than the CPI, the pension that they would receive later likewise would be lower than it would otherwise have been. Therefore, had the Government not done this, there would have been discrimination in favour of those Commonwealth employees who had already retired compared with those Commonwealth employees who are about to retire. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to ask the Government when the workers will be given equitable treatment. Why have they been in a situation in which their wage rates have been cut over a period of time? They are not making ends meet. Quite clearly this Government has a policy which requires a family to have two incomes to make ends meet. What did we see in the paper this morning? We saw that, in terms of replacement levels, for every 1,000 Australians to die, only 881 were born last year. We are 12 per cent below the long-term replacement level. One of the reasons given for this by an officer of the Institute of Family Studies was economic. People cannot afford to have children. One economic reason is the inability of the Government to grasp the situation of people attempting to live and raise children in this economic climate where wages are being cut. That is admitted by all. Wages have been cut and the Government's taxation system is bleeding to death families with dependent children. </PARA>
<PARA> The taxation system in this country does not even acknowledge that there should be a difference in the taxation mode in respect of an income if that income sustains only one person or ten. I know what I am talking about when I speak about having to sustain a very substantial number of people on one income. I certainly know it from the complaints that I receive from one-income families in the electorate. My concern, as I expressed it in 1986, was that because we have the total wage very often of late the decisions that have been made by industrial tribunals have been made on a percentage basis. Therefore those with higher salaries, when the increase is applied as a percentage of those salaries, get a far greater increase than those at the lower end of the scale. For those on the lower end of the scale a 2 per cent reduction compared with the inflation rate means quite a substantial drop in purchasing power relative to others. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Government must look at this situation. There is no equity. This Government is not about equity. There is absolute discrimination against families with dependent children. There is no horizontal tax equity. That is the area I am talking about. The Government says that it can restore the 2 per cent for superannuants. That is good but the reason the Government says it can restore this is because of the economic climate. Is it because of the economic climate or is it because of the political climate? If it is because of the economic climate, the Government should do it for workers too. It should go to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and stop this nonsense of trying to knock an amount off workers so that their wages do not keep up with inflation. If that is the situation let the Government go next into the Industrial Relations Commission and support an increase which will give the workers of this country an increase so that their wage rates will keep pace with inflation. I believe that I am consistent in saying this, as I pointed it out in September 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge and support the Government in restoring this 2 per cent. I voted against it being taken away in 1986. The Government should acknowledge that it is now in a position of going back on the reason that it gave for the reduction of 2 per cent in the first place. Now it appears that workers are the ones that need to be considered as well as the superannuants. </PARA>

<PARA> (66) ``Page 51, sub-clause 120 (2), definition of ``sufficient number'', line 26, leave out ``25%'', insert ``75%''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment seeks to leave out the figure 25 per cent, which the Government has defined as being a sufficient number, and insert the figure 75 per cent. This amendment raises a number of issues for consideration by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> First of all, the purpose of this clause, which relates to the removal of a regional council, is to allow the Minister-although not require the Minister-to remove a council from office and put in an administrator if he receives a petition from 25 per cent of the eligible voters for a region. The figures I have used related to previous regions, and the officers have brought in more recent maps; so some of the figures I will give, although in an indicative sense they are still correct and useful, may be historically dated. Some of the regions are very small, and I can give examples. </PARA>
<PARA> Cundeelee, which was previously a region on its own but is no longer, had an eligible voting population of which 25 per cent may have been 48 electors. That situation has been fixed by the Government because it allocated Cundeelee to a different region. For the region of Cook, as it was, 25 per cent of the eligible voters would have been 63 electors, which is a tiny number of people to petition. I will come back and develop the reason why this worries the Opposition. On the other hand, the region of Perth would have required 1,285 electors to sign a petition to trigger this mechanism. The Townsville region would have required 1,561 signatories. The Goulburn region, as it then was, would have required only 113 electors. The trigger mechanism of 25 per cent can be grossly unequal in terms of the number of people who may need to sign a petition. This is partly a consequence of the malapportionment of the regions, which is a matter we discussed previously and which I will not reopen. The Sydney region would require over 2,250 electors to sign a petition before this procedure is triggered. I have taken those figures from the September 1988 map and I acknowledge straightaway that there is a more recent map and there are new regions. </PARA>
<PARA> I got these figures from page 1116 and following pages of the transcript of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. I divided those figures to try to give an idea of what the eligible voting population might be. I have made an assessment of the number of children who are not of voting age, and I tried to make an assessment of what would be one-quarter of the potential electors. It would seem that there is a potential, in many regions, for very few people indeed to petition the Minister that he should dismiss a council. What is interesting is that the Minister is not required so to do. The explanatory memorandum makes that quite clear. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is absolutely right. The point I want to make is that the Minister, having received the petition, will then have to satisfy himself that there is just reason to dismiss a regional council. The Minister will have to make the determination himself. All that the trigger mechanism will do will be to require the Minister to look at it; it will still be the Minister's own judgment and decision as to whether a council should be dismissed and an administrator put in. If the Minister thought, for any reason, that a regional council might need to be dismissed, why does he require the petitioning mechanism? Unlike the other petitioning mechanism contained in this Bill, this mechanism does not require the Minister to remove the council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition believes that if there is to be a petitioning mechanism, it should be one that will not be subject to mischief. The Opposition is worried about instability. It is worried about the likelihood of factional domination and influences within regional councils. We know that certain kinship groups may be dominant in any region, and it would be fairly simple, under a proportional voting system, to attract 25 per cent of potential electors. Those of us who have had experience with the National Aboriginal Conference (NAC), some of us closer than others, will know just how difficult and important factionalism can be with Aboriginal elected organisations. The factions actually combined to have candidates elected to executive positions on the NAC, and factions within NAC electorates worked to have people elected on a kinship basis. That is a fact of life. </PARA>
<PARA> While we are discussing this amendment it is necessary to remind honourable senators that it raises, perhaps for the first time, an issue which we will have to talk about later, and that is the question of whether one should have an electoral roll. This is something that Senator Coulter raised and forced me to think about on the Senate Select Committee. How do we make arrangements in light of the question, 25 per cent of what? Clause 4 defines `electorate number' at page 4 of the Bill in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . `electorate number', . . . means the number of potential voters set out, in relation to the region, in the most recent electorate notice that includes such a number in relation to the region;</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister would issue an electorate notice which would identify that in a particular region the number of potential electors was, say, 2,000. Then there might be an election for a regional council in which 300 people might vote. I have chosen the figure of 15 per cent because I can remember history and what the turnouts for the National Aboriginal Conference were. If it is 300, 300 might come together to elect the regional council, but it may then require 500 people to petition for the removal of the regional council. I indicate to my colleagues in the Committee that the question of an electoral roll is one we will have to face sooner or later. I do not think the way in which the Government has proposed to do it is good enough. I was very attracted to Senator Coulter's expressions of concern in the Select Committee about the need for an electoral roll. I think I quote the honourable senator correctly. He was talking about voluntary enrolment but compulsory voting, as occurs in general elections at present. But it is the Opposition's view that we should have a figure higher than 25 per cent. The amendment seeks to insert the figure of 75 per cent. I commend the amendment to clause 120. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government opposes the amendment to clause 120. If I have done my arithmetic correctly, it leads to a rather surprising result. Under the Opposition's proposal, even if 60 or 70 per cent of a regional council's potential voters were upset or even appalled by the distribution of funds, if they were of the view that there has been biased, if not corrupt, suggestions as to how money should be distributed within the various corporations within the regional council's area, because the regional councillors looked after 26 per cent and had them on side they could never get up the petition to dismiss a council, which is the necessary precondition for the Minister's exercise of that power. In other words, if 75 per cent was deemed to constitute a sufficient number, only 26 per cent of the region would need to be kept on side and a petition could not get up even though 60 or 70 per cent of the people might be quite disillusioned and disenchanted and have grave misgivings about the way in which the regional council is operating. That is dangerous and it leads to the very matter which Senator Peter Baume fears-a cultivating of the 26 per cent rather than looking after the greater number of persons within the regional council's jurisdiction. For that reason, it is a somewhat dangerous proposal and the Government opposes the suggestion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Peter Baume is absolutely right when he draws attention to the related difficulties which clause 120 raises. Those difficulties are in relation to who is eligible to vote, how eligibility is to be tested, and from what list of names the Minister will determine whether one has 25, 30, 50, 75 or 100 per cent of the electors. It is certainly an issue that I raised before the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. The Committee made certain recommendations in relation to electoral rolls and procedures. The Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) will know that in the succeeding months I have had a number of meetings with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, on these related questions. In my view, it is unfortunate that the Minister has not seen fit to move some way towards the adoption of some of these suggestions which the Australian Democrats put to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again, the Australian Democrats are in a situation in which, on balance, we have to support the legislation or run the risk of its not succeeding. Having said that, I will just run through the preferred position of the Australian Democrats. It would be that we have a better definition of an Aboriginal person which would make it clearer who was eligible and who was not eligible to vote. As Senator Peter Baume pointed out, we would have a system of voluntary registration for voting, but once one's name was on a list of voters and the eligibility had been tested, those people would be required to vote and the sanction in relation to compulsory voting would be determined by the local Aboriginal people. Under those circumstances, it would be quite easy to determine what constituted a given percentage of the electorate. That is our preferred position and for various reasons the Minister has not seen fit to accept our arguments. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make recommendations in a summing-up speech later in the committee stage in relation to those matters. Coming specifically to the issue of the 25 per cent and 75 per cent arguments, I am minded to accept what the Minister said in relation to the balance between the competing interests of those who may be carrying on some nefarious practice and the interests of the majority of Aboriginal people in a region who may wish to have a regional council withdrawn and replaced by an administrator. The difficulty in this section will arise more in relation to questions of eligibility and a judgment as to who is and who is not eligible and how we determine the percentage, rather than the percentage itself. I lay emphasis on that. </PARA>
<PARA> The protections which are built into this clause arise in two ways. Firstly, as Senator Baume pointed out, a petition does not necessarily trigger the dismissal of a regional council. It is still left with the Minister to determine in the light of the petition-which, presumably, will lay out certain matters-whether there is sufficient reason to dismiss a regional council. As Senator Baume sees it, there is a protection at that level in relation to a small number, 25 per cent, ganging up-25 per cent is likely to be more than the percentage of people who actually elected the regional council in many instances; I accept that-and for frivolous or spurious reasons calling for a regional council to be dismissed. The first protection that is built in is that the Minister has an overview on this, can look at the circumstances and arguments raised and say that they do not provide sufficient reason to dismiss a council. It may be argued that perhaps that gives too much power to the Minister when we are on about self-determination and self-management. However, the alternative of demanding a much higher percentage makes it even more difficult for that process to occur. I am not convinced that, in terms of self-management, increasing the percentage to 75 per cent necessarily helps. </PARA>
<PARA> The other protection which is built in is a matter which I raised the last time we debated this; that is, that this whole area of election procedures, boundaries and so on will be left to the regional councils to review. Unless Senator Baume is saying that this matter which is now before us being left to the regional councils to review against a legislated 25 per cent requirement is too dangerous, it seems to me that it is in line with the principles of self-determination, self-management, to proceed with it, drawing it to the attention of the regional councils and expecting them to make some representations on this matter after the experience of their first term of office. </PARA>

<PARA> (68) Page 53, subclause 125 (11), lines 35 and 36, leave out the subclause, insert the following subclauses:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(11) Subject to subsections (12), (13) and (14), a Regional Council may regulate the conduct of proceedings at its meetings as it thinks fit and, in particular, may conduct its meetings in accordance with Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander tradition and custom. </PARA>

<PARA> ``(13) A Regional Council may:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) adopt the model rules for the conduct of proceedings at its meetings;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) adopt the model rules for the conduct of proceedings at its meetings with such modifications, not inconsistent with this Act, as the Regional Council from time to time determines; or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) formulate its own rules, not inconsistent with this Act, for the conduct of proceedings at its meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> ``(14) Where a Regional Council has not adopted or formulated rules for the conduct of proceedings at its meetings under subsection (13), proceedings at meetings of the Regional Council shall be conducted in accordance with the model rules formulated by the Commission.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The present subclause 125 (11) of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commissioner Bill provides that regional councils should be able to regulate their meeting procedures `as they think fit'. This leaves a dangerous gap in providing for the way in which meetings might be conducted. I am reminded of one organisation which asserted that it ran its meetings with a piece of four-by-two. That might be `as people think fit' but it is really not good enough. inevitable disputes arise, it will be enough. For example, when inevitable disputes arise, it will be enough to show that someone `thought fit' to regulate the procedures in a certain way. That really will not be good enough, neither for anyone's protection nor for the reputation of any of the procedures of the regional councils. Some of the councils, especially smaller councils and councils in remote areas, would benefit from the inclusion in the Bill of some guidance on this matter. What is proposed is not unduly onerous or unduly restrictive; it is merely indicative of the kinds of procedures which might be desirable. </PARA>
<PARA> More importantly, the existence of model rules is helpful. It provides a fall-back reference point for councils whose resources may be limited and it provides a fall-back reference point when disputes arise, as they inevitably will. For that reason, the Opposition has moved amendments Nos 67 and 68, which amend clause 70 and clause 125, both of them being on the same subject. </PARA>

<PARA> (69) Page 54, clause 127, lines 3 to 22, leave out the clause. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, I will not speak unduly at length on this. What is proposed in clause 127 at page 54 of the Bill, which is the subject of this amendment, is really rather an elaborate and bureaucratic concept. It is that delegations may be made from the regional council to certain members of the regional council-in other words, there are capacities to empower certain small groups of people to act with the full authority of the regional council. It is an elaborate and bureaucratic concept for regional councils. Anyway, if councils are not to be incorporated bodies, the formal powers of delegation as set out in clause 127 would seem to be unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The idea of delegation to a smaller group is not consistent with the Aboriginal way of doing things. Aboriginal decision-making, as the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) and Senator Coulter would know, is, in its traditional sense, consensual. In a consensual system, this idea of delegation, giving people authority to act on behalf of the group, may be unnecessary. Further, a capacity for formal delegation would give rise to a situation where a dominant faction could be tempted to seize control of all decision-making by delegating to a smaller group most of the powers and having that smaller group act as a de facto substitute for the regional council. In that way, it could in fact facilitate the concentrating of resources in the hands of a dominant group at the cost of minority or disaffected groups. For those reasons, the Opposition seeks to leave out proposed clause 127 at page 54. I believe that the Government finds that course acceptable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to move amendment No. 70 or amendment No. 70a in its amended form. This relates to the question of malapportionment of zone level. We had quite an extensive debate the last time the Committee sat, which was two days ago, about malapportionment within regional councils. I then expressed my disbelief that a Labor government would introduce a Bill with such gross degrees of malapportionment. I indicated that when we came to this matter affecting clause 128 I would test the Australian Democrats by asking them whether they were going to vote for one vote one value. It has been pointed out to me, however, that the consequences of proceeding down this course may not produce all the outcomes which I desire.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First, I accept the arguments in favour of a separate Torres Strait zone. But by accepting those arguments I am accepting that there is a zone whose population will be smaller; in fact, the region and the zone are the same. I think that Senator Coulter and I would agree that there are reasons for this. My original intention was to seek to create a separate Torres Strait Islander Commission. That at least would have been intellectually consistent, but it would have been an administrative nightmare. So we have not gone down that track. That would have allowed us to address the malapportionment more directly and more consistently. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, in one of the documents which the officers have tabled, it has been pointed out that there is now shown a Queensland far north and communities zone-I think that is correct-which consists of the regions of Aurukun, Cherbourg, Woorabinda, Doomadgee and Yarrabah-Palm Island. That zone is made up of the deeds of grant in trust communities-the so-called DOGIT communities. We are concerned that, if we persist with this amendment and if we, with the force of logic and oratory, were to carry the day, we might create a situation where this zone would have to be altered in some significant way. We acknowledge that the Government has gone down the right track in creating this particular zone. Because there may be unintended consequences if we pursued proposed amendment 70 to clause 128, the Opposition does not intend to proceed with it. We will let the matter pass. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that I will be looking closely at the way in which this Bill operates. We still think it is dreadful legislation, but we will be looking to see the extent of malapportionment existing within regions. We will be looking at Senator Coulter's proposition that the regions themselves may wish to regulate their boundaries. We want to see whether that will make the malapportionment worse. I do not see why it will not, going by past experience. We will want to look at the extent of malapportionment between zones. If that is to be as gross as we think it may be, we will comment appropriately as we come to learn more about the operation of this legislation. </PARA>

I express my view as a matter of democratic principle: I cannot understand why two Aboriginal or Islander people should have votes of different weight just because of the places in which they choose to reside. Having said that, I do not intend to persist with the matter any further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At this stage I raise one more matter, which also relates to the electoral processes. I draw the attention of the Committee now to clause 99. That clause concerns persons entitled to vote at regional council elections. I wish here to raise again the questions of the electoral roll and who is entitled to vote, questions to which Senator Coulter has already made some reference today and to which I have made some reference. The clause raises a whole range of issues: first, what is Aboriginality and how we define it; secondly, the electoral rules; thirdly, the electoral roll; fourthly, the question of compulsory as against voluntary voting; and, fifthly, the question of residence as a qualification for voting. I will address these matters in order. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the question of Aboriginality. Clause 99 (a) entitles an Aboriginal person or a Torres Strait Islander over 18 years of age to vote. Clause 4 defines an Aboriginal person as `a person of the Aboriginal race of Australia' and a Torres Strait Islander as a `descendant of an indigenous inhabitant of the Torres Strait Islands'. These definitions are little more than tautologies. Senator Coulter has drawn attention to this problem, not once but a number of times. He is absolutely correct. The accepted working definition of Aboriginality which is well known to us all is not used in this Bill at all. That working definition, a very useful and practical one, is that persons should be of Aboriginal descent, should identify themselves as Aboriginal and should be accepted as such in the community in which they live. That is the working definition of Aboriginality. We have here a different definition. As I say, it is a tautologous definition. It will give rise to trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Coulter drew attention to this matter in the dissenting report that he wrote for the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. I do not believe the Government has addressed or has responded to the point that has been made. The Government has not addressed or responded to very many of the points which were made. But this is one which will cause the Government some difficulty and trouble. The definition is essentially a very subjective one. It will be very difficult to interpret in a court of law and it may be open to abuse, especially if a dominant faction wants to keep out a minority. I understand that there is some case law which relates to Senator Tate's State of Tasmania. The case involving the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre Inc. and the Tasmanians of Aboriginal Descent Association actually addressed the question of what an Aboriginal person is and how one defines it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills has addressed this matter. In its report the Committee says in relation to clause 99 (a), concerning the entitlement to vote:</PARA>
<PARA>This paragraph lists one of the entitlements to vote in Regional Council elections-`that the person is an Aboriginal person or a Torres Strait Islander'. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no provision for determining when the entitlement is satisfied, and the Minister on page 6 of the Second Reading Speech suggests that a process for determining entitlement to vote has been arrived at and will presumably be included in the Electoral Rules to be made pursuant to clause 109. </PARA>

<PARA>that is, to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. I continue:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has sought clarification of the mechanisms proposed by which a person denied eligibility to vote is able to have the decision reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA> The electoral rules to be made pursuant to clause 110 will provide for voters to certify that they are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander persons. They will also provide for liaison officers who will be engaged to assist in the conduct of the election. Where a person is unable to satisfy the liaison officer that they are in fact Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons their vote will be set aside. </PARA>
<PARA> Voters challenged by the liaison officer will have eight days from the date of the election to satisfy the senior liaison officer for the region of their eligibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, voters who have been unable to satisfy the senior liaison officer will be able to appeal to the Court of Disputed Elections. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister referred the Scrutiny of Bills Committee to clause 137 and schedule 4. That is a very onerous set of provisions to put on an Aboriginal person. Senator Coulter's proposition-one with which I agree-is that eligibility to vote should be determined well ahead of any election. It should not be a matter to be determined on election day when one appears before a liaison officer. Then it is dependent entirely on the goodwill of the liaison officer whether or not a person satisfies him that he is qualified to vote. If a person is challenged the onus for proving that he is qualified to vote rests with him, and he has eight days in which to do it. There will be many problems in relation to this definition of Aboriginality. I was looking to Senator Coulter ahead of this debate to try to do something to resolve this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look then at the question of the electoral rules. We have the Minister's assurance that this matter will be clarified by the rules made under clause 110. Maybe it will; maybe it will not. I would like to see the rules. I think I would have to take that assurance with more than a grain of salt at this stage. This Bill has been before us in one form or another for more than a year and a half. Where are the electoral rules? Is it the intention of the Government to proceed quickly to an election once this legislation becomes law, is given royal assent and proclaimed? We want to see the electoral rules. We should be able to have them here because, until we see them, we cannot make judgments about what the Minister means when he says, `It will all become clear when we see the electoral rules to be made under clause 110'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Tate just said something about Enmore. So the question of the electoral rules remains quite unsatisfactory. We then come to the question of the electoral roll, which is quite important stuff. If the Government cannot get this right the whole process may fall into disrepute. The Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs attempted, in paragraphs 2.122 to 2.133-that is, 12 paragraphs-to deal with related issues of compulsory or voluntary rolls and compulsory or voluntary voting. I will not read the paragraphs, but the report of the Senate Select Committee canvasses the arguments for and against compulsory voting. It says that they are finely balanced and indeed they are. It reminds us that a major cause of the failure of the NAC was the poor turnout of voters at elections. I have already referred this morning to the figure of 15 per cent, which is about what we had. If we want the newly elected bodies to be really representative we have to have a decent turnout. I cannot say whether the poor turnout was due to the electoral procedures or to the perception that the NAC was not politically significant, but there is some concern about whether voting should be compulsory or voluntary. The Select Committee reports that it has considered the question of an electoral roll of all voters. Going further, in paragraph 2.126 it says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However some of the current requirements of the ATSIC Bill itself provide a case for electoral rolls. A number of provisions in the legislation are tied to decisions of a proportion of regional or zonal population. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed they are. I have already referred to the fact that one clause refers to the trigger mechanism whereby 25 per cent of the eligible voters may petition the Minister to consider removing a regional council-that is, 25 per cent of the so-called electorate number. This is not the number of people registered to vote or the number of people who voted; it is the number of potential voters, which is really not good enough. The Bill also provides for the recall of a commissioner-this is no longer just an optional trigger-where the Minister receives a valid petition signed by 75 per cent of the sum of the regional electorate numbers in the zone-again potential electors. </PARA>
<PARA> The definition of an electorate number, a definition used in the Bill, may vary during the term of a regional council or a commissioner. It is determined by a ministerial notice issued under clauses 75 or 89 and it will refer to the number of persons who are entitled to vote at the next election. The number may fortuitously change, very conveniently, to assist in recall procedures. But if the electorate number is determined under clause 96 it would refer to the number of formal votes cast in the previous election. If the electorate number relates to the number of formal votes cast at the previous election this could produce an entirely different result. </PARA>
<PARA> The clause to which I refer was quoted by the Senate Committee, which recommended that the population in each instance should be the population on an electoral roll. This was the recommendation of a Senate select committee with representatives from four parties, chaired by Senator McMullan and including Senator Coulter, Senator Boswell and me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the need for an electoral roll. As my colleague Senator Peter Baume said, it was the unanimous recommendation of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs that such a roll be established. From memory, it was Senator Coulter who led the charge on this issue. I see him nodding his head in agreement. He was adamant that such a roll would have to be established if this Bill were to receive the support of the Australian Democrats. I am not sure what Senator Coulter's position is at the moment but I have always thought that he was a man of his word and would not renege on commitments that he made to the Committee and Aboriginal people. I hope that I will not be disappointed, but unfortunately in this place we are disappointed sometimes because people renege on what they have stated previously in strong terms. I hope that Senator Coulter will not disappoint me today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill, if we are to make it work, will need an iron lung at the best of times. I do not want again to go through the debate as to why ATSIC will not work and how it is culturally inappropriate, but if it is to have any relativity to the needs of the Aboriginal people some roll will have to be established that will give a commitment to democratically elected regional councils and, ultimately, zonal councils. </PARA>
<PARA> If we go through the farce that we had under the National Aboriginal Conference we will have such things happening as when the candidate took the ballot box around in the back seat of his car to solicit votes. As he was also the representative, he took them back to the office and counted them. That is what happened under the previous legislation. All sorts of rorts went on. If Senator Coulter does not want to see those rorts repeated and if he wants this legislation to have any slim chance of working to give Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders a reasonable chance of being represented and of having some electoral process, then he must support his idea. In other words, if this Committee does not vote for a roll then we may as well tear this legislation up as it will just not work. It does not have an ice-cream's chance in hell of working unless there is a roll for people who are interested in joining in the processes that ATSIC is supposed to deliver to them. Unless that happens, I think we have wasted five weeks of the Senate's time and eight or nine months of the time of the Senate Select Committee. I urge Senator Coulter-I know that he is very interested in this-to support his own idea and have a roll established. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Both Senator Peter Baume and Senator Boswell are absolutely correct in pointing out that these are the sections of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Bill which have caused me the greatest amount of concern. They are also correct in saying that unless in some way or other these procedures are clarified, ATSIC runs the risk of not succeeding. As I have already indicated this morning, getting some modification of these sections has been a source of considerable debate between me and the Minister. I have also indicated that I wanted to speak on these matters. This might be an appropriate time to lay down some of those arguments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I reject Senator Boswell's claim that we are going to see ballot boxes carried around in the back seats of cars. The Bill clearly lays down that elections will be conducted under the control of the Australian Electoral Commission. I would think that that is an adequate protection against that sort of abuse of the electoral process. However, Senator Baume raised the issue of the number of people participating in the National Aboriginal Conference (NAC) elections. He did not go quite so far as I would have gone. When the number of people participating in an electoral process fell sufficiently, I believe the majority of Aboriginal people saw the NAC as being somewhat irrelevant and not representative. It was in a sense a self-reinforcing process. To the extent that the NAC was not seen as relevant, fewer people involved themselves in voting and the NAC did become less relevant. It is for that reason that it is extremely important that the largest number of Aboriginal people possible be involved in the election of the initial regional councils. If a large number are involved then they will see ATSIC as relevant and as representing their interests, and the numbers will grow. If, on the other hand, a small number are involved in the election then the majority of Aboriginal people will see ATSIC as not representing their interests, the numbers are likely to fall and ATSIC is likely to go the way of the NAC. The matter of the electoral process is an important crunch point. </PARA>
<PARA> Involved in this matter are the questions of the definition of an Aboriginal person, the electoral process, rolls, and compulsion. I will pick up firstly the definition of an Aboriginal person. On a number of occasions I have gone on the record as saying that the definition in this Bill is tautological; it does not really explain anything at all. When this was pointed out the Minister correctly said that this definition, or words very close to it, had been written into a number of Bills and the interpretation of those words has been given by the courts. The very fact that it has been necessary to go to the courts to find out what those words mean is an indication to me that almost certainly the words in this Bill will be tested and there will be some Aboriginal people disadvantaged by that process. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Baume also pointed out that in interpreting these words, or words very similar to this, the courts, on a number of occasions, have come up with what has been described as the working definition. That working definition really falls into two parts when we look at it: either a person is Aboriginal by reason of establishing descent from a person of the Aboriginal race of Australia-that is a criterion which cannot be satisfied by a number of genuine Aboriginal people because in many instances they were removed from their Aboriginal parents as children and brought up by surrogate white parents-or alternatively the person identifies him or herself as a person of the Aboriginal race of Australia and is identified as such by the community. It is a two-part definition-either people can satisfy the first part, descent from an Aboriginal person, or, secondly, they can identify themselves as persons of the Aboriginal race and be identified as such by the community. </PARA>
<PARA> In meetings with the Minister I sought to have that definition written into the legislation, initially as an alternative but secondly as an additional explanatory definition. The argument that was raised against that definition was that to do so might cause the Bill to fall foul of the Constitution. You will recall, Mr Deputy Chairman, that in 1967 a constitutional change was made which gave the Federal Government certain powers with respect to Aboriginal people. A definition which could be in any way construed as excluding a person who was an Aboriginal would, if that were established, cause the whole Bill to fail on constitutional grounds. I looked very closely at that and it seemed to me that that possibility was extremely remote because two things would have to happen for a case along those lines to succeed. We should remember that on a number of occasions the courts have interpreted the words which are in this Bill and have consistently come up with a working definition. The first plank of disallowance of this legislation on constitutional grounds would be to establish an alternative definition, different from that which the courts have consistently used, and that that definition would have to be ruled to be unconstitutional. Secondly, we would have to establish that there was a person who satisfied this totally new definition. I think that is extremely unlikely. For that reason it seems to me very unlikely that this Bill could fail on constitutional grounds by reason of clarification of the definition of an Aboriginal person. </PARA>
<PARA> I put on the record, to clarify this matter, that I propose that the Minister write the working definition into the regulations when the regulations under this Bill are compiled so that it becomes absolutely clear that the definition as judged to be constitutional remains in the Bill. However, if-and, I believe, when-a genuine Aboriginal person turns up to vote and his Aboriginality is challenged, that working definition will be in the regulations and will allow a person to easily establish that he is an Aboriginal person. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to the second question, which is the matter of the construction of a roll and the point at which a roll is constructed. When I have spoken, principally with the media, on this question of roll, the immediate response has been, `But is it not racist to establish a roll?'. I put on the record the obvious fact that a roll is constructed by the very act of Aboriginal people voting. There will be a list of names of those people who have voted. That will be the roll. It will be constructed after the event. That list of names will contain only names of people who are of the Aboriginal race of Australia. So a roll will be constructed by the process of this legislation. The question arises: when is the roll to be constructed?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Peter Baume is quite right in saying that I would prefer that the roll was constructed well before the election and that when the election is held the processes of determining who is eligible have been got out of the way so that a person merely turns up and votes, as people do in any normal State or Federal election. That would make the whole process of challenge and everything else much easier. </PARA>
<PARA> The method of counting at this election will be by proportional representation-essentially a Senate-type counting process, in which one cannot begin to count for the result of the election until the total number of valid votes is known. Then those votes must be divided by the number of places to be filled plus one to obtain a quota. Then the rest of the count can proceed. Only one vote needs to be outstanding and to be under challenge to prevent that process from proceeding. The way to get around that is to then exclude those votes which have perhaps been properly cast but over which there is a challenge after some interval of time, so that one can then get on with the process of election. That necessarily means that there are people who are genuinely Aboriginal, genuinely on the electoral roll and genuinely members of that region but whose vote will be excluded because the process of challenge is mixed with the process of the election. Certainly, for those reasons, I would prefer the situation in which a roll was constructed before the event, and then that roll became the basis of the election. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point I make in relation to these clauses and these matters in general is that Senator Peter Baume is quite correct in relation to clause 110 and the rules for the election not being written down. On a number of occasions I have sought from the Minister and the Minister's office a copy of those rules. I have been told consistently that the rules have not even been written down. I regard this as quite unsatisfactory. It is a key element in the process. I come back to the point that if a small number of Aboriginal people are involved in the election in the first instance and the majority of Aboriginal people form the impression that ATSIC is not relevant to their needs, then ATSIC runs the risk of failing, because, progressively, fewer and fewer people will see it as relevant and fewer and fewer people will involve themselves in the election process, as happened with the NAC. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the ways of overcoming that will be to go down this alternative road. As I have indicated on several other clauses where I think the logic of the argument has lain with Senator Peter Baume, the Australian Democrats believe, on balance, that to proceed with this legislation is the right course to give to Aboriginal people the opportunity of self-management and self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I make an earnest plea to the Minister to do a number of things: to accept that the working definition should be written into the regulations under ATSIC so that there is absolute clarity in relation to who is eligible and who is not eligible; to give very serious consideration to establishing within the rules for election that there be rolls constructed before the election and that the matters of challenge on Aboriginality be sorted out at that stage; and to give serious consideration to making voting on the basis of those rolls compulsory. I believe that is as far as I can go. I believe that is the correct way to go, and I make the plea that the Minister carry those matters through. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Several matters have been raised in the course of this committee discussion, which has not actually focused on any particular amendment but which, nevertheless, is quite properly taking advantage of the committee stage to look at several matters. As far as the definition of an Aboriginal person is concerned, honourable senators will be aware that it is extremely important that the legislation be constitutionally valid. For that reason, whilst it looks tautologous, one can understand-and I think Senator Coulter himself expressed some misgivings about the way in which these definitions might become subject to legal challenge-that it has been thought best to confine as simply as possible the definitions so that it is beyond challenge as a constitutionally valid category. For that reason, Senator Coulter's proposal for a definition of Aboriginality was not acceptable to the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I will take on board-I know that that is a hackneyed phrase-his point that he would like to see in the regulations under the Act a working definition of `Aboriginal person' which encompasses the sorts of matters that at one stage he thought might be included in the principal Act as a definition of `Aboriginality' or `Aboriginal person'. Quite obviously, that would require consideration by the Attorney-General's Department and advice would need to be sought to ensure that the regulations kept within the Act. Obviously, if Senator Coulter's definition was intra vires the Act and, therefore, intra vires the Constitution, that would be acceptable. If it was thought that it might go outside the Act, it would be ultra vires the statute to start with and, therefore, unconstitutional. That would be dangerous. Obviously, there would have to be a very certain assessment by legal advisers that what Senator Coulter proposes might be done in the regulations could be done in a way which was not ultra vires the Act and at the same time unconstitutional. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the question of the electoral rules themselves, senators are expressing some dismay and concern that they have not got those rules before them. They have not yet been drafted, as I am advised. With the priorities in the drafting areas of government, it is only when the legislation is clearly passed that that may get the absolute priority category that would then be deserved. But the Committee will be aware that when the rules are made they will be disallowable. Clause 110 (8) states:</PARA>
<PARA>Rules made by the Minister under subsection (1) are a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46a of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. </PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly, these rules will come back to the Senate, and no doubt they will be subject to very close scrutiny by Senator Coulter, Senator Peter Baume, Senator Boswell and others. It is at that stage that the way in which the rules are proposed by the Minister can meet with the approval or disapproval of this chamber and, therefore, be allowed to operate or, in fact, be disallowed. It is a very powerful position for this chamber to be in. I say `this chamber'; the House of Representatives shares the power in theory but we know that it is only in this chamber that it would actually be exercised. I think that is a major safeguard which can allay some of the worries and concerns of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> A separate roll-and I have never put this argument; I know that Senator Coulter would never include any racist intent in its com- position, although some could argue that to have such a roll even put together might suggest that this was a different category of Australian citizen-could be used in a malicious way by white supremacist groups or even international organisations which might point at us and say that we have an apartheid-type roll. I have never felt that that was the main argument against the composition of an Aboriginal roll. It seems to me that when we look at the question of Aboriginal people voluntarily placing themselves on such a roll, we realise that it could lead to a lot of pressure from potential regional councillors or persons concerned with the hierarchy and the possibility of gaining office under ATSIC. They could put inordinate pressure on some people to get on the roll; others they would not induce to get on the roll. In fact, they might induce them not to get on the roll. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We need a compulsory roll such as is already in place under the Commonwealth Electoral Act. That brings me to the second point that I worry about. If we have an ATSIC-type education program, which quite clearly we would need as a preliminary to voting taking place, telling people that they could voluntarily bring themselves forward and get themselves on the electoral roll, quite conceivably we could create confusion which would lead to Aboriginal people wondering whether they really needed to get on the Commonwealth roll. I can see that there would be confusion in their minds about whether the compulsory requirement to be on the Commonwealth electoral roll would be something which they would tend to think had been displaced by this very intense campaign that would be waged to let them exercise a choice about going on the voluntary Aboriginal roll. That would be to the detriment of the Commonwealth roll. For that reason I think that would be a disadvantage overall to the work of democracy in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, what impresses me is not the taunt that this might give ground for racist sentiment in Australia; it is more the question of the way in which the voluntary roll might be worked by candidates in a way which advantaged them and in a way which disadvantaged the Commonwealth electoral roll. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister has said he will `take on board' a suggestion. I ask the Committee what that means. In terms of some kind of outcome, it does not mean anything. All Senator Coulter has asked for in relation to the definition of `Aboriginality' is that the definition of `Aboriginality' be included in the regulations to be made under the Act. Taking it on board really means that it will be looked at. It does not mean it will happen. I will come back to that point in a moment. I remind honourable senators of the unanimous recommendation of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs in relation to the question of a roll. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that this population should be, in each instance, the population of people on an electoral roll. While placing one's name on the electoral roll should be voluntary, voting should be compulsory thereafter for those whose names are on the roll. The recall provisions should be exercisable only by those on the electoral roll. </PARA>
<PARA>Those of us who were on the Committee will understand not only that it is internally consistent but that it leads to a resolution of many of the other problems we have identified in this discussion in the last little while. Any other resolution will not work. The next paragraph in the Committee's report states:</PARA>
<PARA>The advantages of constructing these rolls before polling day and of compulsory voting-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the recommendation for compulsory voting-</PARA>
<PARA>are closely related. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's report then sets out seven or eight points. They are:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) voter rolls clarify the recall provisions;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) prior construction removes the possibility of challenge on polling day and speeds the counting of the poll;</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Coulter is quite right. There has to be only one matter before the Court of Disputed Returns and a regional council may not be able to be elected. That is a distinct possibility under the Labor Party proposal. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> (c) compulsory voting removes the possibility of coercion to vote or not to vote;</PARA>
<PARA>I turn the coercion argument right around. There is an advantage in having the kind of roll recommended by the Select Committee. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> (d) compulsory voting makes voting similar in all respects to State and Federal elections. It therefore serves an education function for those not yet familiar with these elections;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) it will ensure that electoral officers will make every attempt to contact voters in remote regions. </PARA>
<PARA> (f) it ensures the greatest degree of representativeness of the outcome; and</PARA>
<PARA> (g) non-compulsory voting will generate friction. A small number of voters may return a Regional Council that is immediately challenged by those who did not vote. If all vote, all are represented in and responsible for the outcome. This will be a particularly difficult area in the intial stages under the proposed legislation as rolls will only be constructed after an election and will only contain the names of those who voted, and not those who were eligible to vote. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not quote further from the report as I do not wish to go on too long. Senator Coulter is absolutely right: There will be an electoral roll. The argument that it is racist to have an electoral roll is nonsense. It does not hold water. The argument was not made by Senator Tate but it has been made by other people. The roll will exist post-hoc. There will be an electoral roll and there will need to be such a roll to establish an electoral number. There needs to be an electoral number to enable the recall provisions to be triggered. So the arguments against the existence of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander electoral roll are nonsense. If the Labor Government is going to proceed down the road of establishing, as it were, a constituent assembly, the existence of an electoral roll follows. If it goes down the road of having recall provisions which are triggered by a percentage of the electoral number, the existence of an electoral roll is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the question of Aboriginality, I remind the Committee that a report by the Auditor-General was tabled in the Senate yesterday. It is the final report on a special audit of the Aboriginal Development Commission and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. On page 29 there is the heading `Definition of Aboriginal'. The Auditor-General makes the point that `benefits available under the Aboriginal Development Commission Act are restricted to Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders'. He then discusses the definition. First of all, in relation to the statutory definition, he says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Act defines Aboriginals to mean members of the Aboriginal race of Australia and descendants of indigenous inhabitants of the Torres Strait Islands. </PARA>
<PARA>At paragraph 3.49 he goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>In practice ADC uses a working definition adopted by successive governments since 1977:</PARA>
<PARA>`Aboriginal means a person of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Island descent who identifies as an Aboriginal or Torres Strait islander and is accepted as such by the community in which he or she lives.'</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor goes on to make the point that legal advice was then sought from the Attorney-General's Department. At paragraph 3.52 the Auditor-General said:</PARA>
<PARA>In a detailed advising the Department said that the working definition was a valid means of determining whether a person belongs to the Aboriginal race within the meaning of the ADC Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Coulter's request that that working definition appear somewhere is entirely proper. I want to say to Senator Coulter, so that there can be no doubt about it, that the Opposition shares his concerns about the question of the definition of Aboriginality. He is correct. We share his concern about the question of the need for an electoral roll in the terms in which that was recommended unanimously by Labor, Liberal, National and Democrat members of the Select Committee. We support his statements about compulsory voting. We say to him: this is a committee stage debate in which our duty to the Senate is to try to examine and improve the clauses of this legislation. If Senator Coulter believes in what he is saying, he should move amendments to give effect to it. We have moved many amendments and have many more to move. If he moves the amendments, we will support him. </PARA>
<PARA> If he did so I do not believe that the Minister would not proceed with the Bill. I cannot believe that amendments introduced by a Committee of the Whole in the Senate in a genuine attempt to overcome some difficulties and failings within the Bill would not be acceptable to the Government. Not only that: these would be recommendations which arise out of unanimous all-party recommendations of a Senate select committee on which Senator Coulter served. Senator Coulter should move the amendments, and we will support him. If he wants people to take him seriously, now is the moment for him to act and ask the Committee to adopt what he believes. We will support him. This is the moment when his various stated intentions can be put to the test. He will have our support. We have deferred to him on this matter because it is common knowledge that these were matters which he introduced and on which he was able to convince us by the force of argument. We stand ready to support his proposals that there be a role in terms provided by the Senate Select Committee, that there be compulsory voting in the terms which Senator Coulter himself has put to us. I would like to support Senator Coulter in his attempt to get an assurance from the Government that the working definition would be included in the regulations to come down under the Act. Having said those things, I indicate to Senator Coulter that he has only to move and he will have the support of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That speech of Senator Peter Baume's could be said to offer a challenge to the integrity of the Australian Democrats. At some time in here everyone has to put up or shut up. Senator Baume has challenged Senator Coulter to back what were initially his ideas. I, Senator Coulter, Senator Baume and a number of others travelled extensively throughout this country visiting many Aboriginal communities and working in the best traditions of a Senate committee. We then came together and discussed what we had found in the communities and the needs of the communities. We prepared our Senate committee report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I support everything that Senator Peter Baume has said. The need for a roll is evident. It is as plain as the nose on your face. Senator Coulter has the numbers, if he joins with the Opposition, to make sure that there will be a roll that will protect the rights of the Aboriginal communities which will have services delivered by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill 1989 today. It is an absolute red herring to say that to establish a roll is to involve oneself in some sort of racist area. That is incorrect. Senator Coulter, as a member of a doctors' organisation to which he pays an annual fee, would not be able to have the benefits and advantages unless he were on a roll. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Baume and Senator Coulter are both doctors and are probably on rolls. Senator Coulter would belong to some sort of social club, whether it is a bowls club or a football club. Being a member of such a social club or institution gives people a right to vote, and that is on the roll. In other words, people do not just come in off the street and vote in any club they might be interested in; there has to be a roll. Senator Coulter makes the point very clearly and very well that if Aboriginal people do not participate in this Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission legislation which sets the ATSIC proposal up in the form of regional councils and zones, the proposal will fade away and become completely irrelevant, as the National Aboriginal Conference (NAC) was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only way to get Aboriginal people to become involved in the ATSIC proposal and take an active interest in it is to ensure that they participate in the elections of the officers. If we do not ensure that, ATSIC will be completely irrelevant to the Aboriginal people. That is why I support-just digressing a bit-compulsory voting in Australia. If people were not to vote every three years they would lose interest in politics. Senator Coulter presents exactly the same case. The decision he makes today will be very important to 230,000 Aboriginals and, as Senator Stone would remind me, every white Australian. Senator Coulter believes in it. He not only believes in it but he argued his case so strongly in the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs that he convinced us that it was important. I say to Senator Coulter, `Please do not let those 230,000 Aboriginals down'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is absolutely essential that we have a roll. The whole electoral process of ATSIC will be able to be manipulated if we do not have a roll. People will be forced to vote and people will be kept away or forced on to rolls. There will be all sorts of subterfuges to stop people voting on the day that the regional councils elect their members. All this will happen if we do not have a roll. For Senator Coulter to put his trust in the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) and say that we will get a roll when the Bill is established and the legislation is down and that we will control that roll by some type of regulation is betraying every Aboriginal person in Australia. Senator Coulter knows it, I know it, and Senator Baume knows it. Senator Harradine would know it. I cannot plead with Senator Coulter in stronger terms. If he wants to give this legislation any prospect of success, I urge him to support his own idea. I know that Senator Peter Baume has already guaranteed that Senator Coulter will have the support of the National Party of Australia and the Liberal Party of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, I pick up several points that the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) made in relation to the electoral roll and racism. This argument was raised frequently when I raised the issue of a roll both during and immediately after the time of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. I simply repeat-the Minister did not seem to pick up the point, but Senator Peter Baume stressed it, and it needs to be stressed, apparently-that by the very creation of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), and the fact that people of Aboriginal race exclusively will vote, the list of those people who have voted will be the roll and it will be established after the event. I am calling for it to be established before the event, to clarify the eligibility for voting, and separate that from the time of the election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another issue which the Minister raised in discussion in relation to racism is that if a roll is established before the event, in the more conventional way, it may become an instrument of harassment of Aboriginal people. He used the example of the outback of New South Wales. I pointed out to him, and it seems to me to be a perfectly valid protection against that eventuality, that the role would be kept by the Australian Electoral Commission and may be available only to people who can establish a bona fide reason for getting access to it. One might require people who wanted access to the roll to sign a statutory declaration setting out why they wanted it. In that case, the roll would not fall into the hands of those who might use it as a way of harassing people who have put their names on it and, therefore, are identified and defined as Aboriginal people. However, I think the possibility is extremely remote. I would have thought that, in most communities, those who are so minded to harass Aboriginal people would know who the Aboriginal people were anyway. It really should not be a problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister also raised the question of pressure on people to put their names on the roll. Of course, if pressure is going to be exerted, the same pressure will be exerted to get people to vote or not to vote. One does not alter the operation of pressure by having or not having a roll. I would argue that, on the contrary, the establishment of the roll and the separation of the voting procedure from that would, if anything, reduce that pressure. Bearing in mind that those whose names are on the roll will have to vote compulsorily, and that once one's name was on the roll it would remain on the roll, there should be a progressive increase in the number of people on the roll, a progressive increase in the participation rate in the election process. The process would, therefore, become more democratic and would reduce the possibility of pressure being exerted at the time of election. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Minister raised the issue of confusion between the election processes for State and Federal parliaments and the election processes for ATSIC if both the placing of the name on the roll and participation in the election were compulsory. I think the difference, and it has to be borne in mind, is that there are Aboriginal people in the community-that is, people who could establish their Aboriginality by reason of the working definitions which we have already mentioned-who would choose not to participate in the ATSIC process. They may be people who could easily establish Aboriginality by descent-they may be one-sixteenth Aboriginal, and the rest of their racial heritage European-who have totally integrated into the white community and do not wish to participate. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, one cannot link the definition of Aboriginality with the compulsory placing on the ATSIC roll of the names of all those people who would satisfy that definition. The placing of the name on the roll must be voluntary but, having chosen to put one's name on the roll, the rest of the process becomes consistent with other elections; in other words, compulsory voting. Clause 110 (6) states:</PARA>
<PARA>the Minister shall have regard to the desirability of providing for Regional Council elections to be conducted in a manner similar to the manner in which elections for the Parliament are conducted . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The distance one can go is determined by the matters I have just raised. There are Aboriginal people by definition who would not want to participate in the ATSIC process and, therefore, the placing of the name on the roll should not be compulsory. That is the difference. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn specifically to the pleas which Senator Peter Baume and Senator Boswell have made. The rules for the conduct of elections appear under clause 110. We have not yet seen those rules. For months I have been seeking a copy of the rules from the Minister so that we can see these XYZ rules. I nearly used an unparliamentary term. The Minister has consistently said that the rules have not yet even been drafted. We need to see the rules for the conduct of elections because they will contain the clauses dealing with the construction of rolls, whether the placing of names on rolls is voluntary or compulsory and whether participation in the election itself becomes compulsory. That will be the time at which we will be seeking to accept or reject those rules. That is why I am making a plea to the Minister now. Although this debate arose out of our consideration of clause 99 when Senator Peter Baume first raised it about an hour ago, we have got on to it now and this is an appropriate time to deal with it. </PARA>
<PARA> No clause of the Bill before us can be amended to achieve what we have been debating. It is the rules which would be made under clause 110 which need to be addressed. It is a great pity that we have not seen those rules. That is why I am making a plea to the Minister to take back to Minister Hand the strong representations of the Senate in this matter, supported by the Australian Democrats and the Opposition, that, in the making of those rules or regulations, consideration be given to the inclusion of the working definition of `Aboriginal' and to the construction and use of rolls in the election. When those rules come before this chamber we will look at them very closely in the light of the comments that have been made. As the Minister himself has pointed out, those rules will be a disallowable instrument. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the legal position on the matter of definition is that if there is a conflict between a regulation and what is said in the relevant Act, to the extent that what is said in the regulations is inconsistent with the Act, it is simply invalid. I do not see any great danger in putting the working definition into regulations. I do not understand how the Minister can argue that one can put something in the regulations which could be inconsistent. I repeat the plea that there be clarification in those regulations, that we see the rules for the conduct of elections and that very serious consideration be given to the matters we have raised in the debate this morning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Peter Baume misrepresented what I said earlier in reply to Senator Coulter in relation to Senator Coulter's request concerning the working definition of an Aboriginal person which he advocates. I have undertaken that we will seek advice and that if the working definition would be intra vires of the Act and, therefore, constitutional I cannot see any difficulty with including it in the regulations. But surely Senator Coulter is not suggesting that if the advice we received was that the working definition would fall outside the Act, would be ultra vires the Act, and would therefore be unconstitutional, we should go ahead and put it in, knowing it would be knocked out at some stage in a legal challenge. That would be ludicrous. I have given the undertaking that advice will be sought as to whether those preferred words of Senator Coulter as to the meaning of `Aboriginal person' can be safely placed within the regulations. By safely, I mean within both the Act and the Constitution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have already indicated that the electoral rules will be a disallowable instrument and that the Senate will therefore have ultimate control over the coming into force of whatever the Minister might think would be appropriate rules. I think Senator Coulter said in passing that it might contain such matters as whether voting at regional councils is compulsory or voluntary. Clause 106 quite clearly says that it is not to be compulsory. In that situation, we could not have rules making voting compulsory, so that has already been determined. </PARA>
<PARA> Page 43 of the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs shows that even the Committee was not absolutely sure of the way in which its recommendations as to electoral rolls and so on might work out. It indicated that there should be a review of the questions of rolls and compulsory voting after the first two successive elections and recommendations for any change should then be made. As I understand it, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) has indicated his acceptance of that recommendation in the sense that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and the regional councils will be requested to review those sorts of matters. One would expect them to make such recommendations as are appropriate, given their experience with the system as it works in relation to rolls and voting. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only emphasise that the major concerns of the Senate will be able to be met when we come to review the electoral rules as they are made and brought to this chamber for scrutiny. It is only in this chamber that they will receive scrutiny. If Senator Baume, Senator Boswell and Senator Coulter find them unsatisfactory, they will be able to disallow them and that will be the fate of the whole electoral process provided for under the legislation. That is the ultimate power and I have no doubt that the honourable senators are very conscious of it. </PARA>

<PARA>I ask the Minister: Why has the Government, at the apparent instigation of the Prime Minister himself, made a mockery of that undertaking in its decision last night to reduce the size of the conservation zone by 98 per cent and to defer, probably indefinitely, the development of Coronation Hill? What possible confidence can the community generally and investors in particular have in a Government and a Prime Minister who are prepared so blatantly to dishonour their written word? How does the Minister's plea for consistency-that is Senator Button's plea for consistency-square with this decision to change the rules after more than $10m has been spent on the basis of a previous Government commitment in proving the deposit and apparently satisfying the Government's environmental requirements? Does the Minister believe that a country such as Australia with current account and debt problems can afford to turn its back on an estimated $7 billion of resources, which is the likely result of last night's decision in this matter?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal first with the last part of the question, which relates to the current account deficit and an alleged $7 billion worth of resources in this area. As I understand it, that is an estimate by the Bureau of Mineral Resources. It has not been subject to any check or anything at this stage. The resources in the region are not finally known. The letter from the Prime Minister to Mr Loton in 1987 was written in response to a telex, I think, from Mr Loton, seeking advice on meetings which had been taking place in relation to the conservation zone. At that time the Prime Minister said, as Senator Chaney pointed out, that `there has been no change on Government policy on the conservation zone project or in relation to Coronation Hill'. At the time that was certainly correct. The procedures which Mr Loton was concerned about were being followed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The letter from the Prime Minister sets out a number of matters which had to be taken into account before any final decision was made on this matter. He referred to the Aboriginal problem. As I recall he referred to the question of prospectivity. A number of other issues were dealt with in that letter, in the context of which the statement that there would be no change in Government policy at that time has to be read. In so far as the question of consistency in Government decision making is concerned, I must say that I do not recall saying anything like BHP was on a promise. I think that is dealing lightly with what I said. I certainly said that I saw virtues in consistency in Government policy, and I do.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There it goes. Listen to Senator Boswell saying, `None of your damned business; leave it to us; she'll be all right'. The difficulty with that is that when one looks at the record of that Government that Senator Boswell has supported in Queensland one sees that it has never been all right, and it gets worse all the time, which is why it will get thrown out on its ear in a couple of months. I am aware of course, as I hope are all honourable senators, of the very considerable conservation values of Cape York, not just in terms of our national heritage but in terms of Aboriginal heritage as well. There can be no doubt that this is a particularly significant area. The concern that I and other members of the Government have felt for that area is well and truly demonstrated. In fact, in 1987 and again in 1988 the Government rejected proposals for sand mining at Shelburne Bay, an area on the register of the National Estate. So that was demonstrated in a practical way.</PARA></TALK.START>

There is no way that we will permit a project of that kind to go ahead without that sort of rigorous examination. As I have mentioned, the spaceport is just one of a whole number of proposals that the Queensland Government has in mind.

The great difficulty we face in Queensland is that he and his mates have looked after the living standards of their mates very well indeed. The Queensland Government is now selling off waterfront land for peanuts all the way up Cape York-and peanuts in Queensland have been a big problem for a long time! Senator Boswell has been among the kings of them. Right up that coastline there is a whole host of National Party of Australia cronies who can buy thousands of hectares. And what do we find? Land can be purchased at $1.50 a hectare. Land on Cape York is pretty cheap if one is a mate of some of Senator Boswell's friends in Queensland. But the system in Queensland stinks so much that no-one in Australia, and especially no-one in Queensland, is prepared to cop it. For that reason, the controversy that reigns over Cape York will not disappear; it will stay there as long as the Queensland National Party continues to run riot over the rights of ordinary people.</PARA></TALK.START>

The reality is that Australian prospects for a whole range of minerals, including the platinum group, exist in a great number of regions. The Pine Creek geosyncline, the main reason that people are showing great interest in areas in Kakadu, is 80 per cent outside the regions considered by the Cabinet.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If there is some avoidance of the principle of proper environmental consideration in tourist development it certainly has not been on the part of the Commonwealth and it will not be. There are any number of examples of the Commonwealth demonstrating its concern in these matters. Every time there has been a Foreign Investment Review Board proposal put to us, environmental tests have been very strictly applied to tourism ventures. I would have thought that in areas like the Great Barrier Reef we have shown that a sustainable tourist industry is possible while we can afford protection to the environment. Furthermore, as a result of the decision of the Tourist Ministers Council there was a decision that we ought to examine some draft environmental guidelines for the tourism industry. The Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has prepared those guidelines. I am not sure whether they have gone, or are about to go, out to the industry and to peak conservation groups for comment. In a whole range of ways I think the Government has demonstrated its concern. What is more, there is an appointment to the Australian Tourist Commission of someone whose prime concern is the environment and that is Penny Figgis who no doubt more than holds her own in Australian tourism discussions.</PARA></TALK.START>

The number of meetings he attended, until the term of his appointment expired in June 1989, totalled six out of the 16 meetings held in that time. When unable to attend, Mr Williams conveyed his comments as he thought appropriate. As an appointed member Mr Williams was paid an annual allowance, currently set at $8,600 per annum.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security. I draw his attention to an answer given by the Director of the Institute of Family Studies, Dr Edgar, to Estimates Committee F last night. I asked Dr Edgar whether any research was available to prove that child poverty had been eliminated. Dr Edgar assured me that there was no such evidence and that the Government's recent tax package had improved the lot of only half of those children living in poverty. As this is in direct conflict with the Prime Minister's recent statement that he has eliminated child poverty six months ahead of schedule, can the Minister tell me what research the Prime Minister was relying on when he made the statement?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset the point needs to be made that it is quite apparent that we have a process in the Senate where late at night at an Estimates committee a particular senator has a revelation of new information that she or he might think is something quite stunning and startling and will bring down the Government and the Western economy. In reality, in the light of day, when we assess that information, we discover that it is not the startling information which, in this instance, Senator Walters might have seen it to have been. The other practice we also seem to have is that we are presented with somewhat selective and inadequate recitation of information that has been dragged out the night before. Senator Walters would probably do the Senate much more justice were she a bit more comprehensive in her recitation of what Dr Edgar said last night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have not seen the full transcript of that Estimates Committee hearing but I have seen parts of it. It occurred to me that someone in Dr Edgar's position would have been a bit more comprehensive in his acknowledgment of what the Government has done in this particular area and that he also would have been a bit more analytical and accurate in his use of the Henderson poverty line as an indicator for poverty.</PARA>
<PARA> We all acknowledge in this place-Senator Chaney has been one of those who have acknowledged it-that the Henderson poverty line is an inappropriate benchmark for the assessment of poverty in Australia. It is not a radical thing to say. It has been acknowledged for quite some time. Poverty lines in themselves as measures of poverty are always both arbitrary and imprecise. The Henderson poverty line-the one that Dr Edgar referred to and the one most widely known in Australia-has never been endorsed by any government, neither this one nor the previous one.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have to be cautious. Sometimes Senator Chaney is a bit more convincing than he thinks, at other times much less convincing. Last night at Estimates Committee F, Dr Edgar also referred to one part of the Government's programs in this area-not a comprehensive assessment of what the Government has done or what those measures have done in terms of child poverty. To that extent we have to look not only at the family allowance but also at a whole range of tax measures and structural support. We have to look at education support and the fact that, over the last five or six years, there has been a massive increase in the number of children staying on at school. We have to look at support by way of child-care places. We have to look at support by way of Medicare and that sort of service being available to all Australian families, with much more benefit to poorer families. We have to look at public housing and the fact that so many people have been able to benefit from public housing programs. We have to look at rent assistance for low income families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said, leaving that aside, we have to look at one basic thing that has happened under this Government: over a million jobs have been created during our term of office. I could go on and refer to structural accommodation assistance programs and so on, but the reality is that all these avenues of support for family income have to be taken into account. We must not take into account only financial measures; we also have to take into account measures such as JET and Newstart, which are really giving people in the greatest areas of need, and particularly sole parents, a chance, through a coordinated government response, for a new start. I believe that those sorts of factors were not adequately taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me go back to the basic point: this Government made a commitment in terms of child poverty. This Government has fulfilled a commitment to achieve benchmarks in this area which we think are more appropriate. Not only this Government but also independent commentators in the field think this is the way to go in terms of alleviating child poverty. We have achieved those benchmarks. We have also indexed them to ensure that they are not transitory; that they will stay in place. So Senator Walters should not come in here arguing about the Government's performance in this area.</PARA>
<PARA> I could go on and mention our performance as opposed to the performance of the previous Government. One statistic has to be noted for the record. This Government is not a government that, in every year of its term of office, has ensured that 50,000 more children have moved into categories of poverty. This Government is not a government that, in its last year of office, ensured that over 50,000 children were placed in that position. This Government cares and has poured a lot of money and resources into this area. We have approached the area comprehensively and I am sure that Dr Edgar's professional reputation would benefit if he took this into account.</PARA>

If so, can the Minister give a time frame for approval or otherwise of clozapine?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;About five minutes before I came into the chamber my attention was drawn to the campaign seeking urgent evaluation and approval for the drug clozapine for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia, based on the claim that it was a breakthrough drug. Since the campaign may give an impression that clozapine is a brand new discovery, it is relevant to note that the first clinical trials were initiated overseas in the 1960s. The drug created interest at the time because it appeared to have fewer of the unpleasant side effects commonly associated with other drugs used to treat schizophrenia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, in the six months following marketing of the drug in Finland in 1975, 13 patients developed a serious toxicity affecting the bone marrow and eight of them died. The problem was occurring also in other countries and, by April 1976, 45 cases had been reported, with 23 deaths. As a result, clinical use was either ceased or restricted and the manufacturer withdrew outstanding marketing applications worldwide. However, marketing of the drug continued in a number of countries where it was already available. There was no application to market the drug in Australia at the time, but two clinical trials using doses that were low and less than effective were completed here by 1975 without any serious complications.</PARA>
<PARA> Despite this worrying history I understand that Sandoz Australia Pty Ltd now intends to lodge an application to market the drug in Australia. It is to do this in the belief that accumulated clinical experience has shown clozapine to be effective in some patients who are poorly responsive to other drugs, and that death due to bone marrow damage can be avoided by rigorous surveillance of the white cells in the blood so that the drug can be stopped within several days of the damage occurring. I am aware that the application is supported by respected Australian medical practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA> In view of the potentially fatal toxicity of the drug, the evaluation process will need to be most thorough. I hope that members of the Schizophrenia Fellowship of South Queensland will perceive that their interests will be served best if the evaluation process is allowed to run its normal course and is not forced or otherwise interfered with as a consequence of its campaign or by the recent approval of clozapine in the United States. I also hope that members of parliament to whom that organisation may write will have the same perception.</PARA>
<PARA> The time frame that Senator Colston asked me about for approval or otherwise will commence once an acceptable application is received. On the basis of recent figures, the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee will review the evaluations in less than 15 months. Of course, the likely outcome of the Committee's review cannot be predicted. As only 40 per cent of the marketing applications reviewed last year were recommended for approval, there can be no expectation that approval for clozapine is inevitable.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. The last two I took down, questions 5 and 6, are different in character from the first four. The first four relate to the vessel the El Cordero, which is seeking entry to the Suez Canal to trade in the Mediterranean. The last two relate to the issue of the live sheep export trade with Saudi Arabia. As to the last two questions-I have answered questions on these matters in this chamber before-the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, wrote to the Minister for Water and Agriculture in Saudi Arabia last month. That letter set out a series of propositions which are aimed at opening up an avenue of negotiations to settle all of the issues associated with the live sheep export trade between Australia and Saudi Arabia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Chaney keeps interrupting, it might take 10 minutes. With respect to the first four questions, I say that the Australian Embassy in Cairo last night had discussions with the Egyptian Government on the question of access for the El Cordero to the Suez Canal. The purpose of the Australian Government's intervention was to sort out at a diplomatic level questions of access for this vessel between Egypt and Australia. We note that ultimately those questions relate to the commercial interests of the owners of the vessel and the sheep on board that vessel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of Australia's intervention and our initiative, Egypt has now indicated that the vessel can transit the Suez Canal subject to two conditions. The first is that no waste materials are to be put over the side, and the second is that the owners of the vessel are to provide a signed statement saying which important country has agreed to receive the sheep. On the basis of that, we are awaiting the response from the shippers to the Egyptian Government's position. The Australian Government has no difficulty with those two conditions that are being sought to be imposed. I understand that on this calendar day, Cairo time, there is expected to be a meeting between the shipper and the Egyptian Government to resolve the matter.</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the welfare of the sheep, 50 tonnes of feedstock was taken aboard the El Cordero this week. It has a desalinisation plant on board. I am advised that the condition of the sheep is good and that the fodder availability is ample to meet their needs. If necessary more fodder will be taken on board. The question of the attitude of Australia to selling the sheep in Europe is a commercial matter. That is a matter between the owners and the potential buyers. It is not a matter in which we can directly become involved. Our consideration is related to animal welfare and that the conditions of the sheep are properly taken care of.

The advice of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to the Government was that, after consultation with various scientific bureaus that one needs to have regard to in making an assessment of the risk of the importation of transmissible gastroenteritis in this case, our best scientific advice from government sources was that the risk factor stood at one in 3.3 million. It is true that we received another risk assessment of one in 15,000 by the Veterinary Association. The advice of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service is that the risk factor evaluation by the Veterinary Association is not supported on its scientific evidence. However, if it were true, then it is an acceptable risk for this type of import. While not conceding it, nonetheless, if that were the risk factor it would be an acceptable risk.

Can you explain why the Minister has announced this scheme in association with the Speaker of the House of Representatives only, and not also in association with the President of the Senate? Can you explain why, when the Parliament spends close to $1m per annum to staff and to run a bipartisan Parliamentary Education Office, this educational scholarship scheme will be administered by the Sergeant-at-Arms in the House of Representatives and not in the Parliamentary Education Office? Is it true that the Speaker and the Minister wish this scheme to be run in such a way that members of the House of Representatives and, significantly, not senators, will actually be provided with cheques to pay the subsidy personally and directly to schools and students?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the media release. The Minister wrote to both Presiding Officers offering to subsidise travel to parliament for parliamentary education purposes by students from remote area schools. He asked us to designate a single parliamentary authority to pay the subsidy and coordinate the scheme. His stated aim was to ensure that as far as possible all school groups have an opportunity to participate in a Parliamentary Education Office program, tailored as necessary to the time constraints of each group. I received a submission from the Parliamentary Education Office that it was the obvious office to pay the subsidy and administer the scheme with a view to offering these students the opportunity to take part in a parliamentary education program. The Speaker was unable to agree that the Parliamentary Education Office should be the office administering this scheme and paying the subsidy. He preferred that the Sergeant-at-Arms administer the scheme. I do not agree.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am of the view that the Parliamentary Education Office, as the specifically mandated office in the Parliament for parliamentary education purposes, should be administering the scheme. The Speaker and the Minister have therefore decided that initially the Sergeant-at-Arms should administer the scheme. I do not believe that the members are directly going to receive the cheque to pay the subsidy. I am still checking that fact. The Minister has made it clear that the scheme will be extended to the Senate as soon as agreement on the administrative arrangements can be reached. I will continue to examine the matter and report again to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA>Parliament House, Canberra, ACT, 2600</PARA>
<PARA>5 October 1989</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Colleague</PARA>
<PARA> I am today announcing, with the Speaker, details of a program to encourage groups of high school students to visit the national Parliament and participate in its programs and those of other national institutions in Canberra. The objective is to increase student knowledge of national political institutions and processes.</PARA>
<PARA> A key element is a travel subsidy for groups from the remoter areas of the country who in the past have been inhibited from visiting Canberra by the travel costs involved. For example, over five sitting days earlier this year 52 school groups visited Parliament House, but only two were not from NSW, Victoria or the ACT. In the first half of 1989 only 14 school groups in total visited from the other States and the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> The attached press release gives details of the program. I hope Caucus members will encourage school groups from within their States and electorates to avail themselves of this opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA> Initially, the program will be administered through the Office of the Sergeant-at-Arms and groups should be put in touch with that Office.</PARA>
<PARA> The Sergeant-at-Arms can arrange for those groups who have arranged their visits through a Member also to receive their subsidy cheques through that Member. It is intended to extend this facility to Senators as soon as agreement can be reached.</PARA>

<PARA> Thousands of high school students from many parts of Australia will be encouraged to learn about the National Parliament and the political process following the introduction of the special Citizenship Visit Program to assist groups of students in outlying areas with the cost of travelling to the National Capital.</PARA>
<PARA> John Dawkins, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, has introduced a program which will provide between $50 and $200 per student for high school pupils who have to travel more than 1,000 km from their schools to visit the national Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> The Citizenship Visit Program will form part of an extensive education program coordinated by the Parliament which will take in the Electoral Education Centre, the National Library, the National Science and Technology Centre and the High Court of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Dawkins announced the Citizenship Visit Program (CVP) with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Leo McLeay.</PARA>
<PARA> He said the CVP will encourage students to visit the national capital and provide some assistance for students who may have otherwise found the costs of travel a disincentive to take part in a school excursion to the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> ``As the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training emphasised in its report on `Education for Active Citizenship', it is important,'' said Mr Dawkins, ``that all young Australians have a solid understanding of how our government and democracy works. First hand experience is one of the best ways to achieve this understanding.</PARA>
<PARA> ``This new program will mean that distance and the cost of travelling that distance will not be such an obstacle for many students to visit Canberra and see the nation's Parliament and participate in the many activities on offer.</PARA>
<PARA> The Citizenship Visit Program will be piloted as a Project of National Significance and will be available to high school groups on school excursions travelling 1,000 kilometres or more to visit Parliament House.</PARA>
<PARA> Regardless of the type of transport, groups which have to travel between 1,000-1,999 road kilometres will receive a $50 subsidy per student, $100 for 2,000-3,000 km and $200 if the distance travelled is more than $3,000 km.</PARA>
<PARA> Students from Tasmania, however, will be eligible for the $100 subsidy irrespective of distance because of the need for them to pay more for the sea or air crossing of Bass Strait.</PARA>
<PARA> The Citizenship Visit Program will be administered by the office of the Sergeant-At-Arms who will account for the number of students on the school excursion and then make the payments.</PARA>
<PARA> Distances from Canberra will be calculated by road using the most favourable but not necessarily the shortest travel routes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that late last year the Federated Municipal and Council Employees Union of Australia notified a dispute with local councils in Victoria and Tasmania which sponsor family day care schemes. The eventual aim of this dispute was to negotiate an award for carers. The Department of Community Services and Health appeared in the hearing of this case to outline the Commonwealth's position that carers were considered to be self-employed. It was also made clear that should costs increase as a result of a change of employment status the Commonwealth could make no commitment to pick these up with increased funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 26 September 1989 the Commission handed down a decision which found that carers in local council sponsored family day care schemes in Victoria and Tasmania are the employees of these councils. The MEU is now expected to seek negotiations with councils for an award for carers. Consistent with Commonwealth statements throughout the hearing of the MEU's case, I can give no undertaking that the Government can or will increase funding to family day care to pick up the increased costs of any award that might eventuate. However, I can assure Senator Calvert that the Department and the Government will be closely monitoring the situation and will be encouraging all parties involved in constructing any award negotiation to give due consideration to the necessary economic constraints and the needs of parents.</PARA>

Firstly, has the community accepted this offer; and, if so, have social security benefits been discontinued in accordance with the offer? Secondly, what guarantee of permanent residency have members of the community been given?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to whether the community has accepted an offer, the matter is still being discussed by its solicitors and my Department. Every indication was that members were going to accept that offer. This particular case has a fairly long history, and every member of parliament would have received correspondence not only on the immigration aspects of it but also on the other aspects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a very complex case. It is one that led us to the decision to make it a temporary entry permit for two years. If I may explain the rationale of that, two criteria had to be looked at. Firstly, what was the intention of members of the Orionia community when they came to Australia? I concluded that it was not their intention to stay here. That puts them in a quite different position to other people who apply for change of status in this country. It was probably actions by the Israeli Government and the Australian Government that detained them in the country. At the same time, as Minister, I also have to look at their settlement prospects. In looking at those, I granted them temporary entry permits with the right to work. If I had said, `Yes, you can have permanent residence', and they had all ended up on welfare the next day, I would have been open to very major criticisms. They were given two years in which to prove their capabilities in this country. Short of criminality-and I have no expectation of that-I imagine there will be a grant of permanent residence in two years time. That would be the only thing that would influence me or a future Minister to refuse permanent status in this country. But I cannot give a conclusive answer, because I have not seen any final correspondence on this. The indications are that the Orionia community will accept the offer.</PARA>
<PARA> I also put this one other point on the record. If they do struggle in the first few months, I hope that all those thousands of people who wrote to me and the rest of the members of parliament in support of them will get in behind them and help them in that community in Albany.</PARA>

The Bushmead rifle range, to which Senator Chaney specifically refers, is an area of about 230 hectares in the Helena Valley. It is about 15 kilometres south-east of Perth. It has been identified by the Minister as an area for land release program. My understanding is that the Australian Property Group, which of course is under the control of Minister West, has had some archaeological and environmental studies done by consultants. I checked on this matter and to my knowledge my Department has not yet received copies of those. Mr West's Department has informed mine that it is about to present to us a notice of intention under the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. That would enable me, upon examination of those studies that have been done, to say that no further environmental work was necessary or that it could involve a program effectiveness review or an environmental impact statement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will certainly promise to circulate the honourable senator's question in the seat of Kingston. That will be my first task. There are a variety of studies but there are no complete studies on the economics of migration and its benefits or detriment to the economy. There have been a variety of studies. The Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) studied the matter four or five years ago. I know the study to which the honourable senator refers. Equally one could argue that immigration is our third biggest import. The average immigrant family is bringing in $70,000. Sure, tourism brings in more money than immigration, and so does wool. Nothing else does. In terms of tourism, we spend as much going overseas as we take coming in-or even more. So there is a net gain to this country. The actual folding money that people bring to this country is something like $3.7 billion. There are all sorts of ways of studying this matter. I do not think I can give the honourable senator a definitive answer but that is absolutely the main reason I set up the Bureau of Immigration Research and appointed Professor John Nieuwenhuysen. He is actively recruiting staff and actively getting projects under way to answer those precise questions. We open his office formally on 15 November. One of the problems of people examining the economics of immigration is that they nearly all start off with a preconceived ideological position. I could quote the CEDA document in contrast to the study the honourable senator has outlined. Both have started from a different point. We need objective research in this. The honourable senator should not automatically assume that immigration is to the economic detriment of this country. The facts that in two years the skill levels of immigrants have gone up by 25 per cent and that they are filling various niche shortages in our economy were not taken into account in the study that the honourable senator has referred to.</PARA></TALK.START>

The CAA cannot and does not watch every pilot, monitor every flight or undertake or supervise all aircraft maintenance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Instead, the CAA employs examiners of airmen to develop safety standards, undertake surveillance and monitor adherence to safety standards, and take any necessary action in the event of non-compliance. The incidence of non-compliance in the airline industry is very low, as we can see from Australia's enviable safety record.</PARA>
<PARA> Although two examiners of airmen have resigned in recent weeks essential industry surveillance is being given priority at present and sufficient staff are available nationally for this purpose. The implications of these staff losses are being assessed on a national basis as the CAA takes the opportunity to adjust its operations, consistent with changes occurring in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA> A national advertising campaign was held in July/August and over 50 pilots responded. In view of the recent unsettled circumstances it is planned to undertake a further campaign in the near future, geared to the revised requirements. The CAA is also at present re-training some existing staff to meet immediate needs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Patterson yesterday asked me a question about a joint letter from the Telecom Australia Customer Services Manager for the Canberra-Queanbeyan district and the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, Ros Kelly. I said that I would provide an answer as soon as possible. I can confirm that the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support has participated in a Telecom public awareness campaign designed to inform telephone subscribers in the Canberra-Queanbeyan district, the 062 area code, that their telephone numbers are shortly to have an extra digit, namely, a `2'. I should point out that the 062 area encompasses much more than the electorate of Canberra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mrs Kelly launched the Telecom public awareness campaign in Parliament House on 21 August in the presence of a number of members and senators. She did this at the request of the local manager of Telecom as Telecom is anxious to achieve as high a profile as possible for its public awareness campaign in order to ensure that its customers in the 062 district are fully informed of the change to their phone numbers. It is important that the message is received clearly by all subscribers and in good time so as to avoid problems with the printing of business stationery, et cetera. Telecom wants to minimise any disruption to business and households caused by the need to change phone numbers, and this can be achieved by an effective public awareness campaign.</PARA>
<PARA> The jointly signed letter to all residents in the 062 area, as opposed to including a message in telephone bills, was used because it is not possible easily to isolate 062 bills from all others. Telephone bills are produced centrally by Telecom.</PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that Telecom expects the public awareness campaign to be most effective due to the high public profile-and not just in the Canberra region-of Mrs Kelly. The Minister has made herself available to all government business enterprises in her portfolio to launch new service offerings, to open new premises and to generally publicise the good work they are doing. This is a most appropriate activity for a Minister. Mrs Kelly is to be commended for her energy and commitment. In this particular case, Mrs Kelly's involvement will greatly assist in a smooth transition to the new telephone numbers.</PARA>

<PARA>As indicated yesterday, there have been some discussions as to the most appropriate action that the Senate should take in regard to air safety.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So that the record is entirely straight, what the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) has said is absolutely and entirely correct. I remind the Senate that a proposal has been made by the Opposition, of which notice has been given, for a select committee to be established to consider the narrow but I think important question of airline safety standards. Yesterday notice was given by the Australian Democrats of a proposal to establish a select committee to make a broader inquiry into the industrial dispute relating to the pilots. At the conference this morning which involved the Minister at the table and the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) it was agreed that we should reconvene Estimates Committee B, which would have another chance to examine the Civil Aviation Authority and deal with the matters which have been raised about airline safety.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is a sensible and, very importantly, a prompt course we can follow. It is certainly the wish of the Opposition to ensure that, to the extent that Parliament is involved in this dispute, it is involved simply to try to ensure that, if there are any difficulties, they are removed as quickly as possible. By saying this I do not wish to prejudge the matter, but it is common ground that there have been some matters raised, both outside the Government and within the Civil Aviation Authority, which we think should be very carefully and promptly examined so that we can all be satisfied that safety matters are receiving appropriate attention. </PARA>
<PARA> In turn, I thank the Government for its cooperation and indicate that I do not intend-as I originally proposed and as Senator Ray had indicated I would be able to do-to seek the suspension of Standing Orders to bring on my motion. I think this is sensible preliminary action to take. One would hope that, at the end of the exercise, these matters are totally satisfactory. I should also acknowledge the preparedness of members of Senate Estimates Committee B to interrupt their programs to enable the Estimates Committee to reconvene next Wednesday. It must be extremely inconvenient for the individuals involved, and I thank them for that, but I think the public interest does require it and I am glad that they obviously agreed with that view. </PARA>

<PARA> ``(4) In considering whether to exercise the powers of the Corporation under subsection (1), the Corporation Board shall have regard to the effect of the proposed exercise of power on the employment and training of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This group of amendments is the first group that deals with the Development Corporation, which I believe we now call the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation (ATSICDC). The Committee will know that during the various incarnations of this legislation the Development Corporation has had two different names, but we are now calling it the ATSICDC. </PARA>
<PARA> These three amendments are related. They relate to what should be the proper function of the Development Corporation. It is necessary to look at the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) because this Development Corporation will replace the Aboriginal Development Commission as a vehicle for Aboriginal economic development. The original concept of the Aboriginal Development Commission was that it would work to develop and enhance Aboriginal self-management within certain economic areas and it would do so by sticking to certain economic functions. The Department of Aboriginal Affairs, on the other hand, was to deal with certain social functions. So on the one hand there was enterprise and business development and on the other hand we had welfare functions which included matters such as housing and the provision of essential services. </PARA>
<PARA> During the genesis of ATSIC there were consultations within the portfolio and included in those was the ADC's own consideration of the Government's proposal. In March 1988 the ADC actually published what it called an alternative strategy for Aboriginal self-management in which it put down the views of the Aboriginal commissioners about the way in which ATSIC should be developed. The commissioners quite clearly saw the need for a distinction between economic development and social development and they proposed a structure in which those two functions were quite clearly separated. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind Senator Coulter that when he and I were on the Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs he particularly was aware of the need for this distinction between economic and social functions. It was this alternative strategy which was produced by the then commissioners of the ADC that partly annoyed the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) and set the stage for their subsequent dismissal, their subsequent sacking. That strategy observed of ATSIC and of the Aboriginal Economic Development Corporation (AEDC), as it was then called, in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> Social welfare and economic development projects will be integrated and lumped together in the same organisation, thus creating a situation where the dissimilar objectives of each are likely to become confused at all levels. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the view of the former commissioners of the Aboriginal Development Commission. How right those sacked commissioners were! They also stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Economic development programs will only be partially separated between the AEDC and ATSIC. This will fragment resources. Also it will not allow the responsible integration of the program to the long term goals of financial self-sufficiency and self-management. </PARA>
<PARA>The commissioners then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>We believe that the different objectives are best pursued by different agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, the independent consultants KPMG-Peat Marwick Hungerfords in their analysis of the management issues expected to arise under ATSIC also warned about what they called a confusion of objectives. They said:</PARA>
<PARA>The likely outcome is that social welfare objectives will come to dominate the activities of ATSIC to the detriment of economic self-sufficiency objectives and the overall achievement of program goals. </PARA>
<PARA>Those words fit in entirely with the thoughts of some of us who served on the Select Committee. The Government has had plenty of warning, but it has pushed ahead with ATSIC in the form in which it is now presented to us. The 1988 Bill had the AEDC tucked away in one corner, as it were, with limited functions and not really very much money. It was to be dominated by the elected commissioners of ATSIC. That provision alone carries a virtual guarantee that political and not commercial considerations would predominate. That was one of our worries about the Bill as it was then presented. </PARA>
<PARA> These matters were carefully considered by the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. I refer honourable senators to recommendation 2 and to paragraphs 2.33 to 2.36. The Opposition has therefore had to determine what it wants to do. We have not proposed the transfer of the land function to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Development Corporation. We could have done so; it would have been logical. However, we have picked up the intention of the Senate Select Committee proposal. We were impressed by the Senate Select Committee argument. Senator Coulter was a party to that report, as were Senator Boswell, Senator McMullan, Senator Devlin and I. I will quote from Senator Coulter's press statement of 12 April 1988. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was 12 April 1988, so it was a year and a half ago. The honourable senator then saw clearly what the problem was. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>An important recommendation which we are keen to see adopted by the Government but which it has rejected is that a greater proportion of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) activities should be the responsibility of the Aboriginal Economic Development Corporation (AEDC). </PARA>
<PARA>That is the body we are now discussing under a different name. Senator Coulter's press statement continued:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . a greater proportion of the Aboriginal Development Commission activities should be the responsibility of the Aboriginal Economic Development Corporation than is envisaged in the Bill. We believe it is important to separate as much as possible the economic development and social welfare functions of Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Coulter was right in what he said in April 1988. It is desirable that those functions be separated. This is not our legislation. We do not think it is good legislation, but the Committee's duty is to try to improve it. Accordingly, we have moved the three amendments. I will take honourable senators quickly through them. The first occurs at page 12 where we wish to leave out clause 17. These fit in together. The second amendment is to clause 18. It is a consequential amendment, merely changing certain numbering consequential upon clause 17 being removed. </PARA>
<PARA> The third of the amendments is at page 61. It proposes to insert a new clause 149a after clause 149. We seek to outline certain things the Corporation may do. I will take the Committee through those quickly. Under our proposal the Corporation may, for the purpose of enabling or assisting Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders to engage in business enterprises, make loans. We go through to whom those loans might be made. The Corporation may also subscribe for, or otherwise acquire, shares or stock and make grants of money on such terms and conditions as are determined by the Board. Our proposal also allows for the Corporation to make payments in respect of the investigation or supervision of, or the provision of accounting services, management services and the like for such enterprises. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . The loans the Corporation may make under subsection (1) include, but are not limited to, loans for the purpose of the acquisition from the Corporation of shares or stock in the capital of a company. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . The Corporation shall not exercise its powers under subsection (1) in relation to a business enterprise unless it is satisfied that the enterprise is likely to become, or continue to be, commercially successful. </PARA>
<PARA>That is to say that we wish the ATSIC Development Corporation to concentrate its mind on increasing the economic independence of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the continued economic viability of business enterprises with which they are connected. There is one other small subclause. We are concerned here with the proper division between the welfare functions which are properly those of ATSIC and the economic development functions. We are not merely following our own wishes and desires. We are responding to a press release made by Senator Coulter and to recommendations made by the Senate Select Committee. This is a proper, necessary and reasonable group of amendments. It will help to separate in the Bill what needs to be separated. It will not prevent these activities being carried out; it will merely outline the activities which belong to ATSIC; and those that belong to the Development Corporation. We believe they will enhance the operation of both bodies. The amendments are reasonably drawn and we commend them to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Basically, Senator Peter Baume might be confusing economic development with commercial development. The Opposition has virtually transferred, holus bolus, clause 17 and tried to make it something which the Commercial Development Corporation could undertake. While dealing with economic development, it is prepared to do so on concessional terms. It has in mind the fact that in order to enable Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders to engage in business enterprises, we may have to make loans which are of a concessional kind. That is quite different from the type of charter given in clause 145 to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation. Clause 145 (1) reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In performing its functions the Corporation shall act in accordance with sound business principles. </PARA>
<PARA>That is really the distinction: the Corporation is to act in accordance with commercial principles; ATSIC is permitted by clause 17 to act in accordance with non-commercial principles, it could be said, though the overall aim will be to enable Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders to make some entry into the business, commercial and trading life of their communities and, indeed, the nation. The sound business principles to which the Corporation is to have regard are an important distinction from those matters which ATSIC might have regard to under clause 17. That is why the clear distinction is constantly reinforced. The Corporation will have a much harder commercial edge to its operations than was the case with the Aboriginal Development Commission and the concessional or even welfare oriented economic assistance given to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities will not be its concern. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for the Corporation is generally recognised. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander businesses need a commercial partner with which to operate. It will establish links with all the existing financial institutions of the country and provide that sort of guarantee and security to those institutions as they involve themselves with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander projects. Access to commercial sources of finance for those projects is extremely important. The clear mandate of the Corporation, undiluted in the way in which the Opposition seeks it to be, will be important in securing that important profile as a hard commercial operation of the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation, as honourable senators will know, will be required to prepare a corporate plan. That will make it even clearer that the Corporation has to operate in a commercial manner. That is quite different from the intention of clause 17 and the way in which it is structured. On that ground, the clear distinction that is sought to be achieved in this legislation ought to be achieved so that there is no confusion such as we discovered from time to time. Senator Tambling would remember from evidence given during Senate Estimates committee hearings that when the ADC made grants of money for economic development, one was quite often left with the feeling they were more welfare oriented than commercially oriented. I think that confusion would be repeated if clause 17 were to be transferred from the ATSIC jurisdiction and included within the Corporation's jurisdiction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This whole area has caused a great deal of heartsearching on the part of the Australian Democrats. I recall the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure inquiry into the mixing of welfare and economic development functions. If I recall correctly, that Committee reported in about 1983-84. That inquiry, which was into the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC), recommended a clear necessity to separate the economic development functions from the social welfare functions. Under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) these functions are to some extent being re-mixed. As Senator Peter Baume pointed out, this caused the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs some concern and continues to cause me some concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have debated this matter at some length with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand), and the remarks of Senator Tate a moment ago reflected very much the attitude of the Minister. I still have some difficulty with that attitude because if the requirements for the attainment of financial assistance through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation (ATSICDC) will be as restricted as the Bill now defines them, one must ask: Why do these Aboriginal people not simply go to a bank or one of the normal finance institutions to obtain a loan? The answer that the Minister gave me when I discussed this matter with him was that some people with perfectly good commercial proposals will not get loans from banks simply because they are Aboriginal. If that were the case, the anti-discrimination legislation could deal with that. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a need for and a desirability in accepting some definition of economic viability and the purposes and direction of loans which is less than the very tough criteria that banks and normal commercial enterprises might apply. Indeed, subclause 17 (3) of the Bill states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission shall not exercise its powers . . . in relation to a business enterprise unless it is satisfied that the enterprise is likely to become, or continue to be, commercially successful. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill covering the interim stages of the Aboriginal Economic Development Corporation contained essentially the same words, and they would be more appropriate words to apply. I point out to the Government that the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) is a body which provides financial assistance for those proposals which would not normally attract finance but which, it is judged, eventually will become economically viable. So there is a criterion which is less fully financially stringent which this Bill attempts to apply to proposals coming from Aboriginal people to ATSICDC. It is worth while remarking that since 1979 the body I have just referred to, the AIDC, has become a very economically profitable body, to the extent that recently the Government sold 3 per cent of it to private interests. There seems to be no danger that in setting up these lesser criteria the ATSICDC would necessarily fail as a financial institution. As I indicated this morning, having debated this matter with the Minister on a number of occasions and having got absolutely nowhere, one must make a judgment as to whether this Bill in its present form is sufficiently satisfactory to support. </PARA>

I do not think I am saying anything that the Opposition would disagree with-that is, in these types of amendments and in the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee the Minister saw the success of an alternative proposal put by the ADC. He was simply not prepared to countenance that a group that he had disparaged, and indeed eventually had sacked, should have any success at all with an alternative proposal. It seems to me that that is the hidden agenda behind this. I believe there is merit in broadening the terms of operation of the ATSICDC to encompass all those economic development functions which, by definition, were either likely to become or continue to be commercially successful. I believe that is the hidden agenda behind the Minister's intransigence. On balance, I must say that it is better to see the Bill in its present form adopted than to proceed with amendments which may doom the Bill. I say that very reluctantly because, as Senator Peter Baume quite rightly points out, these are important considerations. I think that the Minister is being intransigent and foolish in this matter. He is not providing the best structure. It is an adequate structure, but not the best structure that could be provided.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite correct that we are merely attempting to move one clause from one part of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill to another. We are attempting to move clause 17, where it relates to ATSIC, to a new clause 149a which relates to the Development Commission. I will now respond to what Senator Coulter said. Our duty in this Committee is quite clear: it is to pursue the merit of the matter, to examine the clauses of the Bill and to produce the best Bill possible. Senator Coulter has not in any way cast doubt upon the fact that the merit of the matter lies with moving the clause from point A to point B.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will not go over those arguments again. If the Senate operated by trying to read the mind of a Minister, we would never amend anything in this place; we would not pursue anything. I do not believe for one minute that moving clause 17 out and putting it in the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill as clause 149a would make the Minister refuse to see his beloved child ATSIC come to fruition. It would merely mean that he would be the sire of a better product. If the honourable senator is saying to the Committee, `I think you are right. I think there is merit in the argument.

<PARA> I know what people say about the Australian Democrats. I do my best not to believe it. But it is moments like this which drive me to despair. This is an argument based on the merit of the matter. In the last five minutes Senator Coulter has told us where the merit lies: it lies with the Opposition amendment. I suggest that if the amendment is agreed to, the Minister will accept it-not very happily. I make the point that this Parliament controls Ministers; Ministers are not here to control the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the old story about the Executive and the Parliament. We have to determine who is in charge. If I accept what Senator Coulter says, we might as well not have had the Glorious Revolution 300 years ago because we would be merely acknowledging again the superior authority of the Crown and the Executive. It will not do. If the amendment has merit, Senator Coulter should vote for it. Senator Boswell is correct: if it then transpired-and it will not-that the Minister sent the Bill back and said, `I will not accept it without amendment' I would listen to Senator Coulter's argument.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the package of amendments moved by Senator Peter Baume. I am attracted to his initial statements on this area which drew attention to the alternative strategy in an Aboriginal self-management paper that was prepared on behalf of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) and presented to the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. Very strong attention was drawn to the need-and, I gather, at that particular time this also attracted Senator Coulter's support-for the concepts that were put out in that particular paper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would also like to remind the Committee that we have had the advantage on several occasions this year of considering the very important reports of the Auditor-General into the activities of the ADC. Amongst a number of reports that were commissioned by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Government into the Aboriginal affairs portfolio was the Special Audit Report of the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General tabled his first report-a very significant and comprehensive report-on 9 March. That report raised many issues in respect of the way in which things should happen. It raised a number of fears that we have looked at as to the development corporation aspects of ATSIC. We must be mindful that the same problems will not arise again. </PARA>
<PARA> I also remind the Committee that yesterday the Auditor-General tabled a further report which was a follow-up to the report of 9 March. In the report tabled yesterday the Auditor-General draws our attention to a number of very significant points. For example, in the summary the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the ADC has not carried out all necessary follow-up action or improved procedures on all recent projects. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Committee that that comment has been made since the report of 9 March. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> They are further examples of poor administration of ADC's enterprise finance projects of the kind detailed in the Special Audit Report. There was no positive indication from ADC that it intended to improve its administration and to pay more attention to the requirements of the ADC Act. </PARA>
<PARA>In his introductory remarks on page 2 of the same report, the Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA> 1.6 As indicated in the report some matters raised in the audit have not been adequately addressed by ADC or were still awaiting a response by ADC. AAO considered that, in the light of the time given to the ADC for reply, further delay in reporting was unwarranted. </PARA>
<PARA> 1.7 Most of the matters raised in this report concern ADC. Like the Special Audit Report, this report indicates that, in its program to finance Aboriginal enterprises, ADC must have proper regard to the requirements in the ADC Act, particularly the requirements that finance is to be provided only for the purpose of enabling Aboriginals to engage in business enterprise and that ADC must satisfy itself that particular Aboriginals are capable of engaging in the enterprise. Compliance with the latter requirement helps to protect public money from being spent on unsuccessful enterprises and helps to avoid the disappointment that arises from such enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> 1.8 The report also indicates a need for ADC to clarify its objectives with each project that it finances and to improve administrative procedures for ensuring that funds are applied only for approved purposes. Programs for economic development are not to be confused with social welfare programs. </PARA>
<PARA>I think this bears out very much the fears and the concerns that Senator Peter Baume has drawn to our attention and highlights the attention that we have to give to this package of amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> As we are dealing with enterprise loans and grants for the purposes of Aboriginal people, we must also be mindful of the other groups in the community that make grants available for Aboriginal enterprise. Whilst the development corporation component of ATSIC will be very important, Aboriginal people will be able to obtain grants for their own purposes by various other means. One of those sources of funds, particularly for Aboriginals in the Northern Territory, is the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account into which is paid mining royalties from the very significant mining revenues of the Northern Territory. Almost $145m has been collected and disbursed in the last 10 years. Honourable senators may have heard me refer in this place in the last few days to the July 1989 report of Greg Crough from the Economic and Social Policy Research Unit of the University of Sydney. The comments in that report are very concerning because, whilst significant amounts of money have been passed through that trust account for loans, grants and enterprise, a formula also provides for the administration of land councils. The Minister has used his discretion on a number of occasions--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Temporary Chairman, I take a point of order. I really fail to see how, when we are discussing the way in which the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation might have its charter further extended to enable it to make concessional loans to business enterprises, the question of the trust funds making moneys available for land councils is relevant. I think I know what Senator Tambling wants to do. If he wants to do it he should do it and allow us to get on with the relevant discussion on these clauses; otherwise we will spend a considerable amount of time on something which, by any standard, is irrelevant to the clause.</PARA></TALK.START>

I understand the concerns of honourable senators about it; I understand that it is to be the subject of extended discussion at the Estimates Committee. I have given Senator Tambling a guarantee that I will have the ministerial delegate available for those discussions-at great inconvenience, as I have to try to get him down from the Northern Territory. I really think that it is an abuse of this Committee's time, when we are looking at these clauses, to have an extended description of the malaise or the difficulties that are besetting the ABTA. I ask you to confine the debate to the relevant discussion of the extension of the charter of the Development Corporation, as sought by Senator Baume's amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition has moved a set of amendments which, if passed, will guarantee that the enterprise loans and grants function is transferred to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation. The Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs made this recommendation in its report and it was backed by Senator Coulter in the press release referred to by Senator Peter Baume. If these amendments are not carried, when ATSIC receives applications for money for whatever, it will come down to a competition between welfare and development. When we come down to the bottom line I am afraid that welfare will always win. The coalition believes that we should give these people a fishing line rather than a fish. A fishing line would help them to put fish on the dinner plate every night whereas a fish would be a welfare grant. That is our concern. We want Aboriginals to develop their own businesses and enterprises. We want Aboriginals to take pride in what they are doing rather than develop a welfare mentality, looking for sit-down money, hand-outs and dole money. I know that Senator Peter Baume will support me when I say that we believe we must encourage businesses, development, art and so on. This will not happen unless these amendments are carried. If two proposals are put to ATSIC, one for development and one for welfare, my experience is that the welfare proposal will get the green light.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand Senator Baume's frustration; he is a very level-headed, even-tempered man but I noted a tone of desperation creeping into his voice. Senator Baume knows what I am saying is true, Senator Coulter knows it and, if Senator Tate were not riding under ministerial instructions, he would be prepared to admit it. We went through the stages of having a committee, travelling right round Australia, finding out what is needed in ATSIC, and trying to amend a Bill to get the best benefits for Aboriginal people. Now Senator Coulter comes in here and says, `I know that everything you say is right. We should do it, but I am not game to say so because the Minister might knock back the Bill'. I put it to Senator Coulter that he is not fulfilling the role that he was elected to fulfil. His role, in holding the balance of power, is to `keep the bastards honest', as one of his former leaders once said. But he is not keeping anyone honest, least of all himself. He cannot be true even to himself. If he believes that something is right, is in the best interests of Aboriginal people and is the way in which Aboriginal people will be able to control their own businesses and get away from this welfare mentality, for goodness sake, why will he not acknowledge that and place his vote where his mouth is? He is like the preacher who gets up before the congregation every Sunday and says, `Do what I tell you but don't do what I am doing'. Senator Coulter is not setting any example at all. His attitude is very wishy-washy and I cannot understand it. He is the one who put out the press release; he is the one who called for these amendments; and he is the one who went into the Senate Select Committee and demanded these things. I congratulate him for understanding the need for this measure, but I condemn him for his lack of courage to stand up for what he believes in. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a shocking indictment of the Australian Democrats. It is not as though Senator Coulter does not have the intellect to understand what is needed; he understands what is needed but he does not have the courage of his convictions. I do not know what Senator Coulter thinks Mr Hand will do to him; I do not know what power Mr Hand has over Senator Coulter-there is none that I have seen. The Senate Select Committee spent months going around all these places and it was a complete fiasco. Senator Coulter comes back here and says, `I really know that you are right but I do not have the courage to stand up and put my point of view. I go to water like a wet sponge'. Surely the people who cast their votes for the Democrats would expect that at least you would stand up for what you believe is right. What is the point of you coming here--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have lived with this legislation, as several other senators in this place have, since December 1987. I have served on the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. I have visited a number of Aboriginal communities. As Senator Boswell and Senator Peter Baume have both said, I have stated my position. I have not tried to hide it. I could equally as well, if I chose to be devious, mount an argument for the Government's position on this. I have chosen not to do that. My aim is to get the best that is obtainable for Aboriginal people out of a package which includes certain clauses that we are now debating. I am not reading the Minister's mind in this matter, nor has the Minister any hold over me or made any threats against me. I have had hours and hours of discussions with the Minister. I see that two of the Minister's advisers are in the chamber. They know that I have had many hours of discussion with the Minister on this subject. I know how far the Minister can be pushed on this matter without the possibility of damaging this legislation. I am in a very difficult position. I acknowledge that I would like to see certain changes in this legislation but I am not prepared to see this legislation fail by reason of pushing those changes too hard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In stating the position I am expressing the hope that the Minister and the Government will find it necessary to modify this legislation as it goes forward. At this stage I am not prepared to doom this legislation on the grounds of putting into place amendments which I believe the Government would find totally unacceptable. Senator Baume has made the point that the legislation could come back. I ask him to reflect on the fact that we are facing an election some time within the next six to nine months. We have a very heavy legislative program. This legislation has already been held up for a very long period. That is a consideration which must weigh with responsible senators who, on balance, believe that this legislation is in the best interests of Aboriginal people. That is the judgment that I have made. That is the judgment that I have clearly stated on a number of occasions in the course of this debate. In the light of that I do not see it as being at all inconsistent on one particular clause to state a position and then say that I am not prepared to go to the point of actually voting on an amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of the separation of welfare and economic development functions is an important issue. I would like to see those functions further separated. I believe there was substantial evidence before the House of Representatives committee of inquiry into the Aboriginal Development Commission to support that position. However, I do not believe at this stage-in light of many hours of discussion with the Minister-that that position can be pushed through at this stage. I do not think that that is in any sense dishonest. I am being completely open with my philosophical position and stating precisely why I am taking the course of action that I intend to take. I do not believe that that is in any way letting down the Australian Democrats or anybody else. I am attempting to get the very best for Aboriginal people in the light of the package which is before us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate Senator Coulter's difficulty. I understand his position. I hope that I have understood it correctly to mean that he would vote for this group of amendments if he thought it would not doom the package. His concern is that it may doom the package. He thinks it may doom the package-let me see whether I understood it correctly-because the Bills may not come back to this place as other parliamentary business would prevent that happening, or that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) would then say that this amendment is so unacceptable that, given the choice between having his ATSIC package with the desirable amendment, to which Senator Coulter is committed in an intellectual sense, and doing without the legislation, the Minister would say he would do without the legislation. I must say that I have been trying to roll that argument around my head. I simply cannot believe it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are going to test the Australian Democrats on this group of amendments. We have also spoken to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel this morning. We are going to test the Australian Democrats on the other matter about which they have spoken long and publicly; that is, the matter we discussed this morning concerning electoral rolls. I would listen to the argument that the honourable senator has just put to the Committee concerning electoral rolls, but on this other matter I just wonder. If the Bill went back to the House of Representatives with this amendment I believe the Minister would accept the Bill as amended for one of two reasons: either he would accept it because this amendment, like many other amendments which have been included at the end of the day, is acceptable-I remind the Committee that the three Bills have had 98 or 99 amendments agreed to in this place-or--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine is quite right. Suppose the Minister was then told by his colleagues that it is not going to get another run around, that there is no parliamentary time. The Minister would then be faced with two options: one is to say that he will not accept this amendment which moves clause 17 across from ATSIC to the Development Commission; the other is to say that he will accept it and that he is not happy about it. I say to Senator Coulter that I think his argument to the Committee that he would doom the legislation by voting for the amendment simply does not hold up. If this amendment went in the legislation would proceed. You, Mr Temporary Chairman, and Senator Coulter know that the Opposition is opposed to the legislation. We remain opposed to it. That is no secret either. But I cannot believe that the amendments, if accepted, would doom the legislation. I have tested them against the very proposition Senator Coulter has put. Mr Hand would know very quickly whether it was going to have a chance to come back here for another look as the procedures allow or if the pressure of parliamentary business would prevent that happening.</PARA></TALK.START>

If that were the choice facing Minister Hand he would accept the legislation.

<PARA> (2) Page 69 and 70, clause 183, line 20 (page 69) to line 8 (page 70), leave out the clause. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Page 70, clause 184, lines 14 and 15, leave out ``; and (b) provision for income tax''. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) Page 70, clause 187, lines 31 to 35, leave out the clause, insert the following clause:</PARA>
<PARA>Exemption from taxation</PARA>
<PARA> ``187. The Corporation is not subject to taxation under any law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition in particular will recall that the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) was an instrument of its creation, that a capital account was created clearly in recognition of prior occupation and dispossession by Aboriginal people and that that capital account was not subject to taxation for that very good reason. It was not income; it was a compensatory sum paid to the ADC. Under this legislation, that capital account is to be taken over by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation (ATSICDC). It certainly seems to the Australian Democrats, and indeed the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs recommended it, that the practice of not paying tax on that capital account should continue. It is therefore appropriate that amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4 have been moved by the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 183, on pages 69 and 70 of the Bill, sets up the whole mechanism for the payment of dividend to the Commonwealth. Clause 817, on page 70 of the Bill, deals with the liability to taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> We are suggesting there that an alternative clause be written in to the effect that the Corporation will not be subject to taxation under any law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory. In discussing this matter also with the Minister, he quite correctly pointed out that it would be possible to achieve the same objective as the requirement not to pay taxation by simply putting less money into the capital account. We see that that logically follows. However, it is certainly far more honest for the Government to put less money into the capital account than it is to put more money into it and then claw some back by way of taxation. For that reason, while the end result might be the same, it is far more honest and open for that capital account to be seen for what it is-a compensation account. Therefore, it should not be subject to taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand the Minister's position on this point, he is personally favourable to the suggestion but has had some difficulty with the more hard-nosed people in his own Party such as Senator Walsh and the Treasurer (Mr Keating). Nonetheless, I have the feeling that as the end financial result of these amendments may be no different from what is in the present Bill, it would certainly be a great deal more honest. I commend these amendments to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government rejects these amendments on the basis that in establishing the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation (ATSICDC)-and I think it has been reinforced by the last vote-it intends that this Corporation act as a commercial business enterprise, that it should operate according to sound business principles and that it be governed by the usual rules that apply to such business enterprises. The policy guidelines for Commonwealth statutory authorities and government business enterprises issued in October 1987 make it clear that when an enterprise, consistent with its statutory obligations, is able to generate a financial surplus after meeting all costs and interest charges, appropriate dividends will be paid to the Commonwealth unless the enterprise can demonstrate that there are compelling reasons for its retaining the whole of that surplus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We know that under the Bill itself there is a holiday from the payment of dividends until 1993-94, which allows it to get under way and to reinvest such surpluses as it is able to generate in making further provision for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander business enterprises. However, as a matter of ensuring that the ATSICDC is treated in the same way as other Commonwealth creations in the business commercial area, it is important that it pay taxes and dividends as those other organisations do. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter said something about compensation, that the capital fund could be regarded as compensation and, therefore, taxation should not be paid on the way in which it is successfully utilised in the community where it provides loans to business enterprises in a businesslike and commercial way. If I have a car accident and am compensated, and if I receive $100,000 and use that $100,000 to generate income, of course I pay tax on that income. I do not quite see how the fact that the capital fund could in a sense be regarded as compensation necessarily leads to the argument that taxation should not be paid in respect of the successful operation of the enterprise using that capital fund, whatever the motive was in making the capital fund available initially. The Government cannot accept these amendments. I believe that the fully commercial operation of the Corporation having been strengthened in the last vote only adds force to the Government's rejection of the proposed amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government forgets history. The Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) Act is where we have to go to find out what the purposes of the Parliament were. Section 3 of the ADC Act, which relates to the purpose of the ADC, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . to further the economic and social development of people of the Aboriginal race of Australia and people who are descendants of indigenous inhabitants of the Torres Strait Islands and, in particular, (as a recognition of past dispossession and dispersal of such people) to establish a Capital Account with the object of promoting their development, self-management and self-sufficiency. </PARA>
<PARA>The ADC capital fund is not in any way equivalent to the funds which may be available to a commercial organisation. It is absolutely wrong for the Government to try to so present it. If the Government wishes to present the ATSICDC as just another commercial organisation, it follows that the Government is moving away from the commitment that was made in the ADC Act that the capital fund was being established to take account, by way of compensation, for past dispossession and dispersal. That is precisely the point that Senator Coulter is making. The ADC capital fund is not like the funds of any other commercial organisations. The history of its development makes that point. Many Aboriginal people put it to the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs that to make a dividend payable or to make the fund taxable is in effect taking back from the Aboriginal people what was given in recognition of past dispersal and dispossession. Those comments appear in the report of the Senate Select Committee at paragraphs 3.74 to 3.78. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say that had the Australian Democrats not moved these amendments we had amendments ready in precisely the same form to move. As we believe that these amendments are necessary, we will, of course, support them. The requirement on ATSICDC to pay a dividend presumably applies to its after-tax earnings. The earnings on the capital of $60m-if that is what its capital is by 1992, and that is what is promised-would be about $9m or, if we allow for a bit of administration, $8m, and tax, at 39 per cent, would leave about $5.5m. Out of that a dividend has to be found, so not much would be left for investment in the objective of Aboriginal self-sufficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter made clear his concerns about this matter in a letter he sent recently to Aboriginal communities. He made it clear that he understands the purposes behind the original creation of the ADC capital fund. The Opposition agrees with him. The Labor Government has given no money at all to the capital fund since it took office-not a penny. The last time any contribution was made, I think, was by my successor in the portfolio, Mr Wilson, in 1982-83. The Government now says that it is offering $40m to the capital fund. It is interesting to note what the Government says. I remind the Committee that the capital fund now stands at $20m. The document, Foundations for the Future, states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Act will provide that the AEDC's capital base shall be $60 million, of which $40 million (including the $20 million in assets of the ADC's Capital Fund) would be paid on commencement, with the remainder in equal instalments in 1989-90 and 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA>The same sort of thing was said by the Minister in the second reading speech. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation's capital base will comprise the $20m which has been allocated to the Capital Fund of the ADC since its establishment plus an extra $40m to be allocated over this and the next three years. As a consequence, the Corporation will have a very significant capital base. </PARA>
<PARA>I have looked at the estimates for the current financial year, 1989-90. There is no money-not a penny-for the capital fund. We are told that $40m will be provided over five years but there is none this year-not a penny. Not only that, but the Government is now asking us to make that money taxable and subject to dividend. No way! The Government is putting no money in this year. It is not a question of putting less money in; it cannot put in less than nothing. </PARA>

The Aboriginal Development Commission capital fund is a special fund for reasons which were made clear when the ADC was established. The fund is not subject to tax or dividend. It is bad enough that ATSIC has been created and that it will subsume the ADC and that the ADC capital fund is to be subsumed. But we will not be party to the Aboriginal people being cheated in this way and we will support the amendments moved by the Australian Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) drew an analogy between the position of Aboriginal people and someone involved in a motor vehicle accident being compensated and then earning money on the compensation. If the Aboriginal people had been fully compensated for their dispossession, they may have been paid many trillions of dollars. The correct analogy would be with Senator Tate's being compensated to the tune of $500,000 but getting $10,000 as a down payment and then being asked to pay tax on that $10,000 while he waited for the remainder. That would be quite unconscionable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not convinced, as Senator Baume has said, that necessarily the Aboriginal people will get more because of these amendments. However, I make the claim that it will be far more honest if the Government pays money into the capital account. I reflect on what Senator Baume said. I forgot to mention earlier that the Government has not put money into this capital account at all since 1983. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I am glad to be able to support the Australian Democrats' amendment. It seems to me totally dishonest for a government not to have subscribed any money to the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) fund since it has come to office and then to have the audacity to demand tax on the fund. I do not see how the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) can defend that position. If I could offer him a little advice, I would say that when he is put in an embarrassing position he should sit there, say nothing and get on to the next point. It is very hard to defend the indefensible even for a former law dean of the University of Tasmania. That stretches anyone's ability, even that of the most brilliant lawyer-and I include Senator Tate in that category. To try to push that line is just not on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is passing strange-and I want to put this on record-that when the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) cannot roll Cabinet or get his own way in Cabinet he sends the Australian Democrats out to rat on his own Cabinet mates. He says to the Democrats, `Look, I agree with you fully. I support you. You go out and plunge the knife right between the shoulder blades of my Cabinet colleagues'. On the other hand, Minister Hand will not give the green light to anything that Senator Coulter wants to do; there seems to be a veto on the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> I am finding it very strange to understand this debate. Senator Coulter says that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has given him his blessing, albeit under the table, not to support the Government line. I am sure that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) would be terribly disappointed in Mr Hand for taking that attitude. Under the Westminster system of Cabinet government, solidarity demands that all Ministers are united. There seems to be some element of this missing in the Hawke Ministry. </PARA>
<PARA> I say again that if it is good enough for Senator Coulter to do what Mr Hand wants when he wants to do it and when he supports it, I hope that when we come to the Senate amendments and Senator Coulter has a position that differs from that of the Minister and the Government, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will have the integrity to support the Democrats' position. </PARA>

<PARA> (76) Page 59, clause 143, lines 20 to 24, leave out the clause, insert the following clause:</PARA>
<PARA>Purposes of Corporation</PARA>
<PARA> ``143. The Corporation is established:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to assist and enhance Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander self-management and economic self-sufficiency; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to advance the commercial and economic interests of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders by accumulating and using a substantial capital asset for the benefit of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.''.</PARA>
<PARA> (77) Page 59, clause 144, before paragraph (a) insert the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(aa) to promote and encourage Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander self-management and economic self-sufficiency;''. </PARA>
<PARA>These amendments go to the purposes of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation. Amendment No. 76 seeks to insert a clause in place of clause 143 which appears at page 59. Clause 143 as it appears concerns the purposes of the Corporation. The clause which we seek to put in its place says:</PARA>
<PARA>143. The Corporation is established:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to assist and enhance Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander self-management and economic self-sufficiency; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to advance the commercial and economic interests of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders by accumulating and using a substantial capital asset for the benefit of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. </PARA>
<PARA>The purposes clause, of course, interprets all the others. Thus it is important to make clear that self-management and self-sufficiency for Aboriginal people are an important purpose of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill 1989. That is what this amendment seeks to do. It is important to ensure that there is a clear distinction known and understood between self-management and self-determination. I refer members of the Committee who might be unaware of that distinction to an excellent piece of writing by Senator Chaney in the last year or so. He is a great champion of Aboriginal people and has been for most of his life. He points out correctly that the word `self-determination' has a particular meaning at international law and that it is important to draw the distinction between self-management and self-determination. We are not developing a two-nation concept here. We are trying to be constructive rather than divisive. We think that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation should address the very serious task of pursuing Aboriginal self-management. The amendment which we have moved seeks to make that clear. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 77 seeks to insert paragraph (aa) before subclause (a) in clause 44 to say that one of the functions of the Corporation is to promote and encourage Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander self-management and economic self-sufficiency. Under the amendment proposed to clause 143, self-management would become a purpose of the Commercial Development Corporation. Its importance is such that its promotion and encouragement, besides being a purpose, should also be a function of the Corporation. In a sense, it is consequential upon the other amendment. We have had an indication from the Minister that the Government might find these two amendments acceptable. Therefore, I will not speak further on them. </PARA>

<PARA> ``(5) The Minister shall cause a copy of any notice given under subsection (3) to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after it is given.''. </PARA>
<PARA>These amendments go to consideration of the corporate plan by the Minister and related matters. Amendment No. 78 seeks to amend clause 147, at page 60, to leave out subclause (2) and insert a new subclause as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The corporation shall give a copy of the corporate plan to the Minister and may also give to the Minister a copy of any written comments by the Commission about the corporate plan. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition believes that the line of authority for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation should go directly from the Minister to the Corporation and not through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). We are seeking in this group of amendments to ensure that that is the case. Amendment No. 79 is also an amendment to clause 147 on page 60, at line 26, to leave out the words, `after consulting with the Commission'. It would then read:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister may, by notice in writing to the Corporation Board, request the Corporation Board . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That merely means that the Minister can have a direct working relationship with the Commercial Development Corporation. We think that is more appropriate. We do not think it should be completely subservient to ATSIC for reasons which we set out during the second reading debate and in various other amendments. The third amendment, No. 80, also amends clause 147. It seeks to add two more subclauses at the end of the clause. Subclause (4) reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister shall cause a copy of the corporate plan to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after receipt by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>Subclause (5) reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister shall cause a copy of any notice given under subsection (3)-</PARA>
<PARA>which provides for the giving of notices-</PARA>
<PARA>to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after it is given. </PARA>
<PARA>We think that ATSIC has enough to do without wanting to interfere in the activities of the Development Corporation. We also think that the commissioners of ATSIC are likely to be elected for reasons which would not include the possession of business or financial skills; it would be more of a political election. Their qualifications would be in local political and community life. Therefore, it is unlikely that they would be ideally qualified to pass judgment on the activities of the Development Corporation. We think that provision for tabling the corporate plan and notices to be given by the Minister should ensure that some oversight is exercised by Parliament as to whether there is or is not undue ministerial interference. If these matters were laid before the Parliament it would at least provide some stimulus for any member of parliament, who thought there was undue interference by the Minister, to take action if he wished to do so. I believe that those three amendments are acceptable to the Government and, accordingly, I will not debate them at any great length. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment seeks to amend clause 148 of the Bill, which appears at page 60, by leaving out that clause and inserting a new clause. Clause 148 as it appears in the Bill is very brief and deals with the powers of the Minister. We seek to replace it with more detailed instructions which might cover the giving of directions by the Minister. Subclause (1) of our amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation shall perform its functions and exercise its powers in accordance with such general directions as are given to it by the Minister in writing. </PARA>
<PARA>We have clearly drawn upon our experience with the Aboriginal Development Commission and other relevant experience in drawing up this amendment. In subclause (2) we suggest that subclause (1) should not empower the Minister to give directions relating to the content of any advice or information that may be given by the Corporation to a Minister, department or authority of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Those members of the Committee who are familiar with the Aboriginal Development Commission model will know that that is very similar to the limitation on the direction-giving power of the Minister contained in the ADC Act. We suggest that a copy of any direction given by the Minister under subclause (1) should be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after that direction is given, and a copy of any such direction laid before the Parliament shall not disclose any secret, sacred or sensitive matter. We have already discussed that in another place. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent experience with both Western Australia Inc. and the Victorian Economic Development Corporation shows the need for close ministerial supervision of and ministerial political accountability for publicly funded venture capital operations. If we have learned nothing else over the last year, we should have learnt that. Those Ministers were in trouble because they simply were not taking an interest in what these organisations were doing. We think the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation (ATSICDC) should not be at large in the marketplace without some capacity to receive general directions from the Minister, as was provided under section 11 of the Aboriginal Development Commission Act itself. </PARA>
<PARA> In drawing up this amendment we have drawn upon section 11 of the ADC Act. We have drawn up amendment No. 81 in terms of section 11 of the ADC Act and proposed it for the ATSICDC. It will not provide for any detailed ministerial supervision of the activities of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation. It will provide only for general directions. It will provide that, if the Minister gives such directions, they must be laid before the Parliament. It provides the protections against the disclosure of secret and sensitive information in the same way as those protections are provided in other sections of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> It could be alleged that such a power could interfere with Aboriginal self-determination or self-management. In reality, that would not be the case because the Corporation is supposed to be dealing on a strict business basis anyway. I do not see why general instructions could interfere with that. The Corporation Board is intended not to be wholly Aboriginal and we think it will be strengthened by some people with particular commercial expertise. It is not proposed that the Minister could make any particular directions; that is, the Minister could not interfere with any particular matter in the same way as the Minister cannot make particular directions under section 11 of the Aboriginal Development Commission Act. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a perfectly simple proposal. The powers proposed for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation are very wide powers. They resemble those of Western Australia Inc. and of the Victorian Economic Development Corporation, to which I have referred. The Corporation, for example, would be at large to invest-with the Treasurer's global but not specific approval-or to make guarantees to any person. That is a very wide power. The Western Australia, and Victorian governments got into trouble because of similar powers applying to similar structures. As the amendment to clause 147 has been accepted, the Minister will be able to direct the Corporation in a general way about the manner in which it exercises its powers under clause 148. So we think there are very good reasons to adopt and accept this proposal to amend clause 148. As I say, we have drawn these words directly from section 11 of the Aboriginal Development Commission Act. They are merely a lift from what has worked successfully for all Aboriginal bodies since 1980. We believe that they belong properly with ATSICDC. I commend the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, Senator Peter Baume, in saying that he was drawing on the experience of the Aboriginal Development Commission, indicated why this is a consequential amendment on the previous attempt by the Opposition to transfer clause 17 from the jurisdiction of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation. I really think that it is a consequential amendment. The sort of power that the honourable senator is speaking about to give ministerial directions might be more appropriate if we had a programmed sort of approach, but in relation to this purely commercial operation, as it now is-and confirmed by the Committee-of the Development Corporation, the idea of the Minister giving even general ministerial directions is not appropriate and is not regarded by the Government as being appropriate in relation to these creations operating in the commercial sphere.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The analogy with Western Australia Inc. is not very apt. On the one hand, Western Australia Inc. did not put an annual report into the Western Australian Parliament. Had it done so, as is proposed for the Development Corporation, certainly the Western Australian Parliament would have had an opportunity to carry out its own assessment of the activities of the so-called Western Australia Inc. If we look at the way in which the Corporation generally works, we can see that the corporate plan will be important. The statute provides for the Minister and the Corporation's Board to work together to come up with a corporate plan that is satisfactory. It is in that area that the sort of setting of the goals and the management techniques to achieve the goals of the Corporation in accordance with the general desire of the Minister to fulfil the requirements of the statute will be found. It is in the area of the development of the corporate plan, rather than in allowing for the ministerial guidelines, that the general concern underlying Senator Peter Baume's amendment can be accommodated. But in relation to this commercial organisation, I do not think the amendment can be accepted and the Government does not accept it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The Senate has been aware of my concern for the Queensland pineapple industry. Last Friday I delivered a speech in the Senate outlining the many problems the pineapple industry faces, under attack as it is from cheap imports flooding our market. I told Senator Bolkus privately of my concerns. Senator Bolkus is the Minister for Consumer Affairs, so I asked him whether he would answer some queries, which he has agreed to do. I am very pleased that I will be able to get some answers from Senator Bolkus on behalf of the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my contribution last Friday I stated that the imports were taking up to 21 per cent of the market. They do so for a number of reasons. The packaging that is required for imports needs to have some attention directed to it. The packaging and labelling guidelines that are currently followed by the large retailers who market the cheap imported products as their own home or generic brands cause some concern. A huge volume of imported foodstuffs, including canned pineapples, is being brought into Australia and marketed by the major retailers under their generic brands, such as Home Brand and the Farmland label. In the case of canned pineapple, the only Australian product is canned by Golden Circle in Queensland. Every other can of pineapple sold on the supermarket shelves in Australia is imported. The imported products are cleverly labelled to ensure that the consumer has to search to find the vital details of the country of origin on the label. </PARA>
<PARA> On 24 February this year, the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) released the food and beverages industries interim report on government regulation on packaging and labelling. Some of the recommendations outlined in the report proposed radical changes to the way in which the food that we buy on the supermarket shelves is packaged and labelled. Recommendations 3 and 11, for example, propose that the minimum size for label expressions be at least 1.5 millimetres high. That lettering is just larger than a pinhead. Australian consumers should not have to put on their glasses and squint just to ascertain the country of origin of a food product. Recommendation 10 states that the English language requirement in the food standards code be abolished. I think Senator Bolkus told me privately that the Government would not accept that recommendation. He might be in a position to make a statement on that in the Senate. The IAC already expects the Australian consumer to have very good vision and if the proposal to remove the English language requirement is adopted, the consumer will have to be multilingual as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the recommendations by the IAC have yet to be accepted by the Government and that is the reason for my contribution this afternoon. The IAC intends to present a final report later this year. Classification of the country of origin declaration on packaging and labelling has been left until this final report. I now ask the Minister for Consumer Affairs, Senator Bolkus, to ensure that any further steps to review packaging and labelling legislation that may be outlined in the final IAC report take into full consideration the needs of the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister to provide a guarantee that the consumer is not deceived by a false belief that he or she is purchasing Australian products when he or she is really buying an imported product that is packaged as a generic brand. The Minister can do this in two ways. First, he can ensure that the country of origin of a product is displayed clearly and legibly in a prominent position on the front of the can, together with notes on its contents. The country of origin is currently placed discreetly on the back of the can. Secondly, he can ensure that the print-size recommendation of 1.5 millimetres is reviewed so that all print on cans and packages is able to be read clearly. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also been in contact with the Minister's office about my concerns that citric acid is added to imported pineapple products by the overseas processors to improve the taste and quality of the product. It is against Australian health regulations to add this acid without declaring it on the label. However, tests in the United States of America have shown that much of the imported pineapple stock has been boosted in this manner, without the consumer being aware of the additive. I have passed this information on to Senator Bolkus's office for his perusal. </PARA>
<PARA> The processors of these products face a catch 22 situation. If they do not boost the citric acid levels, they face the risk of pathogens surviving the cooking process as well as an unacceptably flat taste. If they do use the additional citric acid without the correct labelling, they are unfairly marketing their pineapples against the natural Australian product. The Minister has indicated that he will take note of my concerns. I now ask that he investigate the addition of this acid into the cheap imported pineapple products sold to Australian consumers as generic brands and give his firm commitment to oversee the changes to the labelling and packaging legislation so that it is in the best interests of the consumer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Boswell for raising this matter and also for the notice he gave me in respect to it. He has raised a real live situation in which government policies can affect people and their consumption habits, and can also affect industry within Australia. He raised a number of issues. I will go to the labelling ones first. The issues he has raised have been very much of priority concern to me over the last few months. One of the earliest things I did in this portfolio was to ensure that there was within Australia a uniform regime to ensure adequate country of origin labelling. Before we worked with the Trade Practices Commission to ensure that we had a standard law across the country in this area, there were a whole host of different requirements throughout the country. This made it difficult not only for manufacturers, producers and so on, but also for the people in Australia to understand what the law was on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Now, basically, we are saying-it is a clear principle of the law-that if a product is made overseas it has to be labelled as such, and that labelling has to be accurate; it cannot mislead. For instance, we had a situation in which peanuts were imported into Australia. Because they were salted here and the last part of the process occurred in Australia they could be labelled `product of Australia'. We are now saying that a very essential part of the process has to be carried out in Australia before any product imported into Australia can be marked as being made in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Boswell said, the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) recommended a number of approaches in this area, one of which was this requirement that there be standard 1.5 millimetre high labelling. The Government has decided-and the IAC recommended-that this measure be standard across the board for all products. The Government recognises that there is probably a need for a standard requirement as to the height but it also recognises that in exceptional circumstances there needs to be a major deviation from that. The questions of frozen chickens and poisons are two that come to mind very readily. People need to have larger labelling. But we have not endorsed the recommendation of the standard 1.5 millimetre high labelling. Together with the State Ministers for consumer affairs, with whom I met in Hobart in July, we adopted an approach which said, `Let's have a look at a standard size'. But we all felt that 1.5 millimetres was too small and we are looking at a higher figure. To that extent, Senator Boswell's needs are being accommodated. We have to work this through with State governments and thankfully, on this issue, State governments have been cooperative with us. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, the Government felt that the IAC, when making recommendations about the use of English language, was recommending something that we should not adopt, and which we have not adopted. The only problem is that we really cannot dictate where the labelling should go-whether it should be on the front, back or whatever-especially on round cans. We will insist on the requirement that consumers have adequate, clear and legible information of what is in their food. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the second part of Senator Boswell's question-that is, imported pineapples and the addition of citric acid. Basically, the standard that the Government is pursuing here is that if something is added to a product, that should be stated on the label. The problem with imported pineapples is that while citric acid is probably the major acid of pineapples-I think Australian pineapples have a content of about 0.8 per cent of citric acid together with a content of 0.2 per cent of malic acid-the acid occurs naturally in the pineapples. I am informed that the pineapples imported from overseas have citric acid levels as low as 0.3 per cent. As Senator Boswell said, that affects palatability. There may also be a question about the survival of pathogens in products of this particular acid content. So far the problem has been one of detecting. The acid occurs naturally in the pineapple. If we claim that acid has been added to it it would be very hard to prove. An article that Senator Boswell referred to in the Senate related to a detection method in the United States which actually focuses on the added acid and can identify the fact that acid has been added. If that is the case, then under the law that this Government has endorsed that would be legal and we could take action. </PARA>
<PARA> The question then is how we can prove that. I have embarked upon two courses of action to ensure that not only Australian consumers get a clear idea of what they are eating but also Australian industry be protected to the extent that every player in the field has to conform with the same laws. As Senator Boswell rightly said to me at one stage: if they are doing this overseas there is no way we can check on what they are doing and what they are putting into the product; so we in Australia have to take measures. </PARA>
<PARA> I have asked the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs to investigate this matter. It will be contacting the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories and the National Food Processors Association in the United States of America to obtain more data on the naturally occurring citric acid levels of fresh pineapples from various Far Eastern countries. I will also be commissioning the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories to conduct tests on the canned pineapples imported from Far East countries to determine citric acid levels in the processed products. This will enable us to determine whether a significant amount has been added to the pineapples on top of the naturally occurring acid. Following the advice that I get from the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories and the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs I will be able to determine whether there has been a breach of the domestic laws of Australia. If a breach is established I will take appropriate action to ensure that in future imported pineapples comply with Australian labelling regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I mention that the Government quite recently announced a comprehensive program to ensure that food products imported into Australia do conform with the requirements of safety and wholesomeness in Australia. To that extent, I, together with my colleagues Senator Cook, Mr Kerin and Dr Blewett, announced that we would be testing high risk food. We would also have other regimes for medium and low risk food to ensure that the Australian food law standards apply to food coming into Australia at the point of import. As I said, Senator Boswell has raised an important issue. It is one that really tests how the law operates. The measures that the Government will introduce and pursue I am sure will be to the benefit of Australian consumers. </PARA>
