<TITLE>Home Ownership</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate in Parliament assembled require the Hawke-Keating government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australians home-seekers out of the housing market-and many Australians out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families.</PARA>

<TITLE>Tasmania: Television Transmission</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The decision to change to the UHF transmission in 1993 should not be made compulsory in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. That VHF airwaves in Tasmania are not overcrowded, unlike Mainland Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. That Tasmanian television stations presently transmit in VHF which is properly suited to Tasmania's mountainous terrain.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. That the UHF band relies on ``the line of sight'' and is unsatisfactory for transmission to many parts of the state.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. That compulsory UHF will mean financial outlays for many, and could result in some being denied a signal.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners request that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, reject the proposal which would force Tasmanians to convert to UHF transmission.</PARA>

<TITLE>Pornography</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That we the undersigned, having great concern that Canberra is now the ``Porn Capital'' of Australia and because of the spread of moral pollution in our nation, call upon the Federal Government to introduce immediate legislation in support of existing State Legislation:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) To provide strict controls over the importation, production, sale, hire or mailing of video-cassettes particularly in the A.C.T., with the open sale and/or hire of only G, PG, and M-rated video cassettes; and the total prohibition of the sale or hire of R rated video-cassettes, so that R rated films can only be viewed in an adult theatre by persons over 18 years. We totally reject the concept of ``X'' rated or ``N.V.E.'' rated video-cassettes, which would allow the legal sale and hire of hard-core pornographic videos for viewing in the homes of our nation, which would endanger our children; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) To give whole-hearted support to Senator Walters's Private Member's Bill to implement the recommendations of the Select Committee on Videos; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) To dramatically improve the Federal Attorney-General's Guidelines for Classification of Video tapes/discs, which restrict the importation, production, sale or hire, screening in private homes and especially mailing by Australia Post, so as to include the total prohibition of any pornographic, obscene or blasphemous video cassette, or film which exploits or degrades women as sex objects, or which contain child pornography, bestiality, sodomy, group sex or violent sex acts with women, such as rape and pack rape, sadism and torture, etc., or which promotes homosexuality or lesbianism;</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honourable House will protect our society, especially women and children from moral pollution and its harmful effects</PARA>

<PARA> The members of the Australia Armed Forces who served in the Vietnam War from 1962 to 1973 did so with distinction, valour and professionalism, upholding the traditions of the Armed Forces.</PARA>
<PARA> After World War 2 and the Korean War the Australian Government approved an End of War List of Gallantry Medals for individual acts of bravery that were not rewarded during wartime.</PARA>
<PARA> The Whitlam Government refused to approve such an End of War List at the end of the Vietnam War.</PARA>

<PARA> The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate that the Government is about to introduce into the Senate, legislation changing health insurance. These changes will increase the cost of health insurance to members of employee based funds and will do nothing to help the elderly, as is being claimed. Big public funds will increase their surpluses by taking money from more efficient funds. People will be forced back onto Medicare, which will not help to maintain private health insurance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the motion which has been moved by Senator Zakharov. The original motion was not, I think, as good as it could have been, in part because of the form in which it was negotiated. There was a very quick discussion with the Australian Democrats who were not keen to have quite the full detail that was originally proposed by the Opposition with respect to the examination of this matter by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. The important thing about the motion which has been moved by Senator Zakharov is that it makes it quite clear that the concerns of a very important constituency out in the community-namely, the concerns of the disabled community-will be able to be examined by the Committee. The real crux of the problem is that, whilst there is wide agreement about the principles of the Disability Services Act, there is considerable concern in some sections of the disabled community and among those who work for the disabled that the principles are being applied without very much sensitivity to the practical implications for both service providers and those receiving services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Zakharov has taken a close interest in this matter and sought, very sensibly, to have the motion worded in a way which gives the Committee proper scope. I believe that there is a genuine problem which needs to be addressed not just by the Committee but by the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett). If Minister Blewett were to spend some time with service deliverers and clients, he would find that there are very mixed views. There are people who see the Disability Services Act as providing a much better set of options for disabled people. He would also find that there are people who are deeply concerned about the actual administration of that in his Department. Having had the responsibility of administering this area during 1980 to 1983, I do not believe it is possible for the Minister to comprehend properly the issues with which he has to deal unless he spends more time with the constituency. I do not believe that one's advisers can give any Minister a full and proper understanding of this area. My main purpose for intervening in the debate is to say publicly what I put privately both to departmental officials and in discussions I have had with the Minister. I believe that providing access by people who have concerns about this program to the Minister-not just to the Committee, which will now be possible, because of this motion-would be a great step forward. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the International Year of the Disabled we have had an opportunity to improve greatly the lot of disabled people. With the introduction of the disability services legislation, this Government has endeavoured to advance the situation. I am sure advances are occurring. Some people in Western Australia have taken the trouble to show me what they see as the positive advantages of the new approach. Therefore, I am not condemnatory of it. But there is a communication gap. I appeal to the Minister to segregate some of his time and spend some of it with this constituency, particularly with those who are concerned that the application of principles is not being done in a proper and effective manner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;(9.43)-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have my second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is designed to allow those with a conscientious objection to paying military taxes to allocate that proportion of their tax which goes on the military to be paid into a peace tax trust fund. The Oxford Dictionary defines conscience as that faculty or principle which pronounces on the moral quality of one's actions or motives, approving the right and condemning the wrong. A conscientious objector is someone who refuses to participate in an act because of a sincerely held religious or moral conviction that to do so would be wrong, even to the point that the objector may decide that the best course of action is to break the law. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there are four different types of conscientious objection. There are those people who object to war of any kind. There are those who object to the violence of militarism and believe that allocating tax money to the military makes one as responsible for the deaths of innocent people as those who drop the bomb or pull the trigger. It is also worth remembering at this point that in modern warfare, 90 per cent of those who get killed in war are civilians. Then there are those who believe that the cost of the military is at the expense of the poor. They object to spending money on the arms race and on the military while people starve and remain oppressed. Finally, there are those who believe that they have an obligation under international law, in particular the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, that includes the right to exercise conscience. </PARA>
<PARA> The idea of a Bill like this is not new. Similar Bills have been drawn up in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. It is part of a global concern by people who feel that we should be channelling our tax moneys into improving non-military security rather than by strengthening the bloated budgets of the military around the world. Just to give an overview of the current situation, the world's armed forces in 1987 totalled 26,620,000 people. The global arms race has absorbed over $US15 trillion of the world's wealth since 1960. In 1987 it was estimated that world military expenditures in constant dollars were about 2.5 times the level of 1960. Over these same years, 81 major wars have been fought and 12,555,000 children, women and men were killed in them. More wars have been fought in the 1980s than in any previous decade in history though this is mercifully tailing off as we near the end of the decade. According to the 1989 SIPRI Year Book, only 28 wars were being fought in 1988, a drop of six from 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> As a comparison, immunisation for all children not now protected against six deadly diseases would cost $US300m a year or less than the cost of three hours of current world military expenditure. There are more than five times as many soldiers in the world than physicians. The world spent over $US800 billion on the military in 1986, compared to $US46 billion on foreign economic aid. Over $US30,000 was spent on each soldier in the world in 1986 compared to $US430 on education for each school-age child. World military spending costs almost as much as the combined incomes of the poorest half of the world's population. It has lead to higher taxes, deficit spending, inflation and unemployment as well as a massive misuse of the world's resources. We know the fruits of war. They are hate, death, rape, pillage, lies, propaganda, fear and oppression. Though wars are coming to an end in Afghanistan, the Persian Gulf, Cambodia, Namibia, Angola, and the Western Sahara, they are still taking place in the Lebanon, the Philippines, Eritrea, Mozambique, Burma and the Sudan. There are now about 12 million refugees in the world. President Eisenhower expressed the situation very well over thirty years ago when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired, signifies in a final sense a theft from those who are hungry and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone, it is spending the sweat of its labours, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. This is not a way of life in a true sense. Under the cloud of war, it is humanity hanging on a cross of iron. </PARA>
<PARA>The Religious Society of Friends or Quakers has helped me uphold my conviction that war is evil. Their Historic Peace Testimony dates back to 1661. I would like to quote a short passage:</PARA>
<PARA> We utterly deny all outward wars and strife, and fighting with outward weapons, for any end, or under any pretence whatever. The Spirit of Christ, which leads us unto all truth, will never move us to fight and war against any man with outward weapons, neither for the kingdom of Christ, nor for the kingdom of this world. </PARA>
<PARA>Conscientious objectors are witnessing to a truth that war is evil and no law can make right our participation in war or in preparations for war. The right to freedom of conscience is recognised in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant of Human and Political Rights which Australia ratified in 1984. The Australian Government and Parliament now has an obligation to change Australian law so that the rights recognised in the Covenant become part of Australian law. Passing this Bill would be a first step. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to remind honourable senators of the work done by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. It met in 1984 to consider amendments to the National Service Act and made some very sound recommendations on dealing with conscientious objectors. They recommended extending the definition of conscientious objection and commented that Australia as a democracy is well able to accommodate the proposed extension of conscientious belief. Of course Australian law has long recognised the principle of conscientious objection to military service, for example, the 1951 National Service Act. I can see no moral difference between serving in the military or contributing to the military through personal income tax. It is therefore clear that if conscientious objection to military service is recognised by the law, the equally important right not to contribute to military salaries or military equipment should also be recognised. </PARA>
<PARA> At almost 10 per cent of the Budget in Australia or close to $22m a day, the contribution of individual taxpayers is not insignificant. Conscientious objectors to paying military taxes agree with the principle that everyone should pay the full share of their tax. They willingly contribute their full share to the maintenance of our society. However they cannot pay that share of their taxes that would be used by the military because they believe militarism is destroying the world. They cannot reconcile support for the military with their vision of a just and peaceful world. They are saying through this Bill, let us pay our full share of taxes in a way that will build security in our region. Let the Government look to non-violent ways of building peace. We want our taxes used more constructively. </PARA>
<PARA> To date there have only been a few individuals in Australia willing to refuse to pay that proportion of their income tax allocated to the military. It is not easy for most of us to break the law and so we continue to pay. John Woolman, an American Quaker who was an early opponent of slavery, put it this way when confronted with the problem in 1755:</PARA>
<PARA> To refuse to pay a tax is exceedingly disagreeable but to do a thing contrary to my conscience appears yet more dreadful. </PARA>
<PARA>Many Australians agree with the anti-war sentiments I have expressed. They have a natural revulsion to war but see it as a necessary evil. They speak of deterrence and are convinced that Australia's sovereignty and security depend on her armed forces and the ANZUS alliance. They would argue that we sometimes have to do things that are wrong and that the ends do justify the means. While I do not agree with those arguments I will not attempt to persuade you to support this Bill on the grounds that modern warfare is immoral or that many forms of warfare are illegal under international law. The question I wish the Senate to consider is whether the right of the individual in a democratic society should include the right to conscientious objection. </PARA>
<PARA> I realise that many Australians will say that if one makes an exception for military expenditure on grounds of conscience, then one will have to make exceptions for other forms of conscientious objection, perhaps in the area of education or health. I believe that if a group of Australians are sincere in their conscientious objection and can convince Parliament of the rightness of their case, then such an exception should be made. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill recognises that the main function of the military is to safeguard Australia's security and independence. The Bill sets out to ensure that the amount of tax that would have been directed to the military is used in non-violent, non-military ways to enhance Australia's independence and security. The Peace Tax Trust will therefore have as its overriding aim to use moneys diverted from the Defence Budget to enhance Australia's independence and security by non-violent and non-military means. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the 1988-89 Budget Statements, Australia will spend this financial year some $7,658.2m directly on defence and an additional $4,238.7m on related expenditure, mainly in social security assistance for veterans. Australia spends $7.81m directly on peace; for example, the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade working on peace, disarmament and arms control issues, and contributions to various international agencies. A further $1,113.7m is allocated for overseas aid. If we include all the overseas aid and thereby increase the amount spent on peace to the highest possible figure and reduce the amount spent on the military by not including expenditure on war veterans, we find that Australia's expenditure on Defence is still almost eight times that spent on Peace. </PARA>
<PARA> I trust this Bill will therefore redress an imbalance that now exists in our priorities, and help to bring about a better Australia and a better world. The right to freedom of religion and conscience are essential to the dignity and integrity of the individual which form the basis for democratic government. Nothing could be more damaging to those principles than to force the individual to act in a way that is contrary to their conscience or religious and moral values. I commend this Bill to the Senate and hope that the issues addressed will be fully debated. As it is an issue outside of party politics I and members of the Peace Tax Campaign ask that this Bill be considered on its merits and that members be free to vote on it according to their conscience. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> I present to the Senate a Bill to amend the Child Care Act 1972. My amendment deals with the public provision of child care through a national child care program. High quality child-care is not a second-class alternative to parental care but a valuable supplement offering positive contributions to child development. Children in late twentieth century industrialised countries lack the broader based child-rearing units of the pre-industrial communities. They tend to be dependent on either one or two adults for their primary care. </PARA>
<PARA> The experience of group care, with appropriate developmental input from skilled carers, has been shown to be of benefit to children. The benefits are most obvious for those whose background resources are limited, but all children benefit from stable quality care. It is therefore important that children in their most vulnerable years, when they have the highest learning curve, have access to quality care. It is unreasonable to expect single parents to bear the responsibilities which cross-cultural and historical evidence show were previously borne by a wider group. All parents need access to quality care because it enhances their capacity to satisfy the varied needs of children. It also allows parents to choose the most appropriate mix of paid work, domestic caring and leisure. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister drew attention to child poverty in Australia with his promise to eliminate child poverty by 1990. The proposed increases in payments for children shows that this Government is prepared to attack the intractable problem of child poverty, but child poverty requires more than direct payments of money. Sole parents on a pension and their children are rapidly becoming Australia's `underclass' trapped in poverty with its attendant social and health problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Affordable and accessible child-care is prerequisite of work force participation by sole parents, yet nothing in the Treasurer's April statement removed barriers to the employment of sole parents caught in the poverty trap. If parents can't escape the poverty trap, how can their children? A commitment to a minimum level of child care will be recognised as a commitment to the elimination of child poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> The proportion of children being reared in single parent households is growing. There is an increasing dependence by sole parents on pensions and benefits as women withdraw from the labour market for child rearing. Where women were working before single parenthood, they tend to retain their jobs if they can move back to them soon after the birth of a child. Adequate child care can thus reduce the costs to the community of single parenthood. Many families, especially young families with mortgages, find it essential to have two incomes to maintain a standard of living above the poverty line. These families cannot afford to lose one income for the years until a child enters school. The birth rate among such couples will decline rapidly unless adequate child care is available. </PARA>
<PARA>Social Justice and Equity</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Some members of the Government feel that there is no justification for the public funding of a broad child-care program and consider that the only role of government should be to subsidise fees for the very poor. But child-care should be provided from the public purse for reasons of social justice and equity. The commercial sector does provide some centre-based care, but there is no evidence that this is being provided in response to the real pattern of demand. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation in New South Wales shows that commercial centre developments are set out in areas where child care is already established. Where it might be expected that there would be a ready market for more costly care, such as in high income areas, there are few commercial centres. It is clear that commercial centres alone will not provide for the child care needs of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's program was restructured in 1983, when the planning model replaced the submission model. This has resulted in services being offered in areas of high need rather than in areas where articulate people were able to prepare persuasive submissions. The current guidelines ensure access for those who need child care for work-related reasons. Furthermore, the contribution of the second income earner to the family positively benefits the community by reducing both poverty and dependence on sole parent pensions in cases of marital breakdown. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's commitment to equal opportunity and economic independence for women can be judged by the extent to which it is prepared to provide child-care services. On a broader scale, the provision of day care services should properly be seen as part of a compact between the community and parents to share the responsibility of child rearing. </PARA>
<PARA>Economic Benefits</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The financial value of child-care services should be measured by their contribution to the capacity of families to remain economically independent. The access of the labour market to the skills of those women, and the few men, who take the primary responsibility for children's care should also be taken into account. Many advantages flow from the provision of child-care which enables the primary care giver to enter the work force. They include the following. </PARA>
<PARA> 1. Families benefit; Many families have been able to avoid poverty, maintain housing mortgages, buy a house (in spite of the inflated housing market), move from Social Security payments into paid employment and improve living standards because of the provision of child-care which allows women to respond to the increased demand for female labour. </PARA>
<PARA> Of women with children in the age group which requires day care, 43% are in the labour force. The increase of 16% in the past two years, mainly in part-time workers, will obviously continue and require a growth in child care services to meet the demand. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Household disposable income is up; The return of women with small children to the work force has allowed the Government to make much of the fact that household disposable income is up, even though wages have fallen in real terms. Thus the provision of child-care for these women has effectively softened the economic impact of the Government's wages policy. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. There is a cost benefit to the Government; A recent study by ANU economists shows that the present children's services program could net more than $100m to the Commonwealth budget when the costs are offset against the gains in tax, Medicare levy and savings in Social Security payments. The Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, has stated that this figure is a distortion of data provided in the paper. His dismissal of claims that major net fiscal benefits will accrue to the Commonwealth budget does not detract from the fact that subsidised child-care has enabled many women to enter or re-enter the paid work force. </PARA>
<PARA> Their work force participation clearly does bring a cost benefit to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. The labour market benefits; Shortages in traditional female employment areas, such as nursing, are being reduced by skilled women returning to or remaining in the work force because of the provision of child-care. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. Taxpayers benefit; the falling birth rate and the ageing of the Australian population make it important to have maximum labour force participation by women of child-bearing age in order to reduce the fiscal burden on the individual taxpayer. By 2025 the over 65s will constitute 16 per cent of the population-they presently make up 10.5 per cent-and the under 15s will constitute only 19 per cent of the population. That represents a 50 per cent growth in the over 65 age group and a drop of 22 per cent in the under 15s. This will result in an increased demand for services and retirement income from the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of these demographic changes, the absence of an adequate child-care system will have two negative consequences. The first is that the burden on the working population of supporting the over 65s will be higher if there is limited work force participation by younger women. The second is that the Australian birth rate will continue to fall below replacement level unless young women are encouraged to have children by the provision of child-care which allows them to retain their place in the work force. There is considerable evidence that women are already delaying child bearing or having fewer or no children because of economic pressures. </PARA>
<PARA>Existing Government Policy</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government must be commended on its approach to work-related children's care services and, in particular, its achievement in doubling the number of day care places during its period in office. The current provision is meeting at least 50 per cent of present need for those below school age. The latest ABS figures on child care show that between 1984 and 1987 there was a 60 per cent increase in the use of centre-based child care services. This included a 34 per cent increase in those using care primarily for work-related reasons. But those efforts have been conducted in an environment which does not seen to adequately acknowledge the importance of child-care. Child-care should be a priority in the development of social and economic policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The most common types of child-care are:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Long day care, or extended hours care, is centre-based care for pre-school children for eight or more hours a day;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Full day care is centre-based care for pre-school children for between six and seven and a half hours a day (this is frequently described as pre-school or kindergarten);</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Out of school hours places are those centre-based places provided for the care of children of primary school age, which will vary according to the school entry age determined by each state and/or territory;</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Occasional care is centre-based short-term care for pre-school children for between one and twenty-four hours a day, but with an `in principle' limit of 12 hours a month;</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Family day care is agency supervised care for up to four children aged between under one year and twelve years, in an approved carer's home. This provides a mix of out of school hours care and day care, depending on the age of the children. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's current children's services program has the following components:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) capital subsidies in conjunction (where appropriate) with other providers of capital, such as the States and local government, for construction of centres;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) an operational grant which allows for a level of quality control and limits the maximum fee to a reasonable level, taking into account the generally lower wage levels of women workers. The average $15 per week offered to all children in funded day care centres is, in fact, less than the $20 subsidy offered through the dependent spouse rebate;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) a planning system which ensures that new centres are sited where they are most needed. A set of access guidelines ensures that certain groups such as sole parents receive priority;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) services for out of school care and vacation care which are also important to working parents;</PARA>
<PARA> (v) funding for occasional care services which recognises that women out of the work force also need access to some form of childcare. </PARA>
<PARA> These components comprise a national program which recognises the needs of both the children and the women who are usually primarily responsible for their care. The provision of publicly funded day care under this program has made day care services available in areas of need, for the more costly younger age group of children, and for hours which reflect the needs of parents for child care. While the proportion of those paying fees over $45 has risen by 60 per cent, they are still less than a fifth of those using day care services. In other words, the bulk of users are subsidised and low-income users. This suggests that the program is effectively targeted, as far as it goes. </PARA>
<PARA>Deficiencies in the Government's Program</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In the first two years of this Government there was substantial growth in the program. This was most noticeable because it was in stark contrast to the rate of expansion during Senator Chaney's time as Minister for Social Security. From 1983-1985, of the new places funded there were 11,000 in centre-based day care, 12,000 in family day care, and almost 5,000 in out of school hours care. In 1985 the government announced triennium funding for 20,000 new places. At the end of the 1985-88 triennium the Department of Community Services and Health reported that about 35,500 places had been approved in the previous three years. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears that additional funding was provided for the 15,500 places over and above those announced by the Government at the beginning of the triennium. This is not the case. Some of the new places were allocations from the year prior to the triennium and 15,000 were out-of-school hours care, which costs about one-fifth of centre-based day care. In the three-year period 1985-88, only about 10,000 centre-based long day care places were provided. This was 1,000 less than the 11,000 centre-based long day care places approved in the previous two-year period. Some of the intended centre-based long day care places were traded for the lower subsidy and family day care places, which have no capital costs. As a result of these trade offs, only about 6,000 more places were provided for the three years to 1988 than were approved in the previous two years. Moreover, the totals for the triennium should be calculated over a four-year period, not three. The last triennium was supposed to be completed by June 1988, but the period was extended until December 1988 and there has been no new money in this year's budget for children's services.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has announced another triennium, starting in the 1989-90 financial year, and promised a further 30,000 places. However, the proportion of centre-based long day care places has been further reduced, and there will only be 4,000 of these. The same number of places is planned for family day care; the balance will consist mainly of out of school hours care. </PARA>
<PARA> The centre-based day care figures show the decline in real expansion. The rate of new centre-based day care places approved has been reduced from an annual rate of 5,500 places in the first two years, 1983-1985, to 2,500 in the next four years, 1985-1989, and will be down to about 1,333 per annum in the next triennium. At this rate, there will be nil expansion within a few years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's own National Agenda for Women document acknowledges the importance of child-care for women and appears to be committed to adequate quality care, but this has not resulted in a program that will answer the growing demand for quality child care in our rapidly changing society. Thirteen years after the passing of the original Act by a coalition Government in 1972, the present Government changed the Act by dropping the level of operational subsidy and detaching the subsidy from the employment of qualified staff. </PARA>
<PARA> Several Government Ministers regard child-care provision as an optional expenditure and spirited representations were needed to persuade them to approve even the meagre increases of the last triennium. A forward plan should be developed in the framework of an Act which commits resources to the expansion of the program over a defined period. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Bill to amend the Children's Services Act seeks to remove the children's services program from the political margins. It proposes a child-care program that meet 80 per cent of the present need for child-care services by the year 2001. This program would provide services for children under school age, including appropriate mixes of centre based and family day care, as well as services for older children. </PARA>
<PARA> The draft Bill therefore proposes that a total of 220,000 long day care places be the target for the year 2001. This would be achieved by the provision of public funds for a further 80,000 long days care places. This assumes that there are 80,000 places in the public sector already established, and that the existing 23,000 commercial places would double over the next decade. It establishes a long term target of providing day care places at the rate of about 7,000-8,000 per annum, only slightly above the 5,500 actually approved in the first two years of this Government's tenure. </PARA>
<PARA> To achieve this the Bill would require, at most, a doubling of the recurrent costs of the present program-that is, in 1989 dollars, about $500m in 2001. If most of the places were to be centre based, that is, about 200 centres per year or about 8,000 places, capital costs might add another $500m or about $50m each year. This assumes land will be made available as it is presently. This is a very modest sum in comparison to the total budget and would represent about 6 per cent of the departmental budget or less than 1 per cent of Government outlays. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition it is important that there should be no changes to the present Commonwealth program that involve the incorporation of any of the following:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Vouchers to replace any of the existing funding, including the operational subsidy. The introduction of vouchers would undermine the present program's major role in ensuring access to care in low-income areas and for low-income people. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Any form of tax rebate which would advantage higher income earners at the expense of direct funding for the program. </PARA>
<PARA>The provision of children's services should be regarded as highly as access to health care and education. It is essential to the prevention and alleviation of poverty. An adequate child-care program will restore to women the reasonable expectation that they can choose to raise children without suffering economic hardship. It will also make available to the community the work skills of child-bearing women. Budget outlays will be recovered in increased revenues. I commend this Bill to the Senate as a measure which is both pragmatic and equitable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, Mr Chairman. My remarks will be very pertinent to clause 9. We found ourselves in this situation when we last met on 1 June when the Opposition was of a mind-it is still of a mind-to ensure that any form of superannuation saving was exempt from the investment tax of 15 per cent. We were concerned that this is an anti-savings tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point is that the whole thing has become far too complicated. When we finally look into the manner of the drafting and the way the Bills have been handled by the Government, whereby the Bill we will deal with next, the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 1989, is not only supplemental to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 but amends clauses within it, we have a situation where we are dealing with a proposed Act where what we will pass into law will remain law for something like two minutes. When Bill Hayden comes to give assent to the Bills, I hope he signs them in the right order. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government initially put the proposition that our amendments to achieve the excising of the 15 per cent investment tax were technically flawed. I flag at this stage that we will be moving a further amendment to clause 18 of the No. 2 Bill to include pooled superannuation trusts (PSTs), and I point out that that part of the amendment that we will move to cover life offices and registered organisations is in fact dealt with not in Bill No. 2 but in the superannuation Bill. I foreshadow that I will be moving amendments to the superannuation Bill as well. I also foreshadow that I will be moving an intent clause. I think it is important to have that on the record so that anybody who can read simple English can understand what the Opposition wishes to achieve. The terms of the intent clause simply say:</PARA>
<PARA> It is the intention of the Parliament in passing this Act and the Income Tax Laws Amendment Act (No. 2) 1989 with the inclusion of the amendments moved by the Opposition in committee of the whole that the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 be interpreted so that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the investment income of complying superannuation funds and complying ADFs, other than income which is special income as defined in Section 273, be exempt from tax; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the standard component of the taxable income of PSTs be exempt from tax; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the part of the investment income of life assurance companies and registered organisations that is referable to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) superannuation policies held by complying superannuation funds or complying ADF's; or</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) roll-over annuities;</PARA>
<PARA> be exempt from tax.''. </PARA>
<PARA>That was always our clear intention, which the Government clearly knew and which the Australian Democrats understood. The Democrats chose to support our amendments, which we passed on 1 June, which excised the tax from superannuation funds and approved deposit funds (ADFs). The amendment I will move today to clause 18 will excise the tax from PSTs and the foreshadowed amendments to the superannuation Bill will include life offices and registered organisations. The Democrats have chosen to single out 100,000 people from the 3.5 million or 3.6 million superannuants in this country and say, `You are the only ones who are going to benefit from the excising of this tax'. The amendments which stand to clause 9 and which give that benefit already to superannuation funds and ADFs, and our proposed further amendments, would have had a very simple effect and would have resulted in a simple administration for various insurance companies and managers of various superannuation funds. Now we have an entire mishmash. We have an administrative nightmare and we have seen a cynical exercise by the Democrats to choose 100,000 people whose investments are in approved deposit funds and whose investment will be at least 90 per cent in fixed interest investment, and people who are in roll-over funds as administered by life offices will be disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> There seem to be two reasons for the Democrats taking this extraordinary attitude. They seem to say, `Well, there are only 5,000-odd people in the complying roll-over funds and really they don't matter a whole heap'. The fact of the matter is that roll-over funds or deferred annuities differ from approved deposit funds only in that at the end of the period, that is at age 65, they give an option to the superannuant to take out an annuity, to take out a pension-like payment, instead of a lump sum. The ADFs offer the lump sum. I would have thought it was very much in line with Government policy-it is certainly in line with our policy and I would have hoped it was in line with Democrat policy-to encourage people at the end of their period of being in one of these funds, that is when they turn 65, to take the amount that is due to them in the form of an annuity or pension so that there is more self-sufficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> But no, the Democrats have said it is all too hard. The Government says, `Oh, I think it will require all sorts of amendments perhaps to the Life Insurance Act and other pieces of legislation. So it is all too hard'. What we have in the end is legislation which is in the category of near enough is good enough. It is a good old Australian adage and it is well and truly followed by this Government. Near enough is good enough: that is the end result of government by press release. A press release was given on 25 May 1988, then the No. 2 Bill and other pieces of legislation were introduced on 30 November 1988, the last sitting day in the House of Representatives last year. Why was that introduced? It was because the Democrats on 8 November 1988 had put in a requirement, which is now an order of the Senate, which says, `Unless the Government gets legislation into the Parliament within six months then the commencement date of it will be the date it is introduced into the Parliament'. The Democrats have one or two riders. They say, `Well, you can circulate a draft Bill and, if that is out in six months, okay, you can have your retrospective date. But if the draft is not out in six months it will be the date of the publishing of the draft. But of course the Senate can change its mind if it likes'. We not only supported it; we attempted to do it ourselves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It worries me that I have to conclude that the Democrats have done something well. But, as usual, it was our initiative, one which the Democrats chose not to support when we tried to introduce it. As Senator Messner commented-Senator Haines may care to read the Hansard-we chose to support the Democrats because we thought it was in the interests of good government. The Government in its very cynical way got the No. 2 Bill and some supporting legislation into the House of Representatives on the last day of sitting in 1988. But guess what? It did not deal with all the matters that needed to be dealt with. It dealt only with ADFs, complying superannuation funds and PSTs. It did not deal with life offices and it did not deal with registered organisations, which of course include trade unions, friendly societies and employer organisations. The cynical exercise that the Government embarked upon meant that, instead of wanting to amend-the first Bill that it introduced as it properly ought-the No. 2 Bill, which was known as the No. 6 Bill in November of last year-and instead of seeking to amend provisions in that Bill that it subsequently decided was defective, it chose to use the vehicle of the superannuation Bill to repeal that Bill and to introduce new measures in its place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me give honourable senators an example. Section 275 of the Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 2) requires that, in order for the liability for the contributions tax to be passed over to a PST or other body, the actual cash money of the contribution must be paid over to the PST or the other body. Clause 49 of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill repeals that section. In its place it puts another section which says that to transfer the liability for the contributions tax one no longer has to pay over the cash money and that one may use that contribution for something else. The only thing that is required is that there be a sufficient investment in either the PST or another form of trust in order to meet that taxation liability. That sort of exercise is repeated in this Bill and is the nature and complexity of its drafting. </PARA>
<PARA> The bottom line is that the Democrats have said that the only reason they are going to bed or doing a deal with the Government on this occasion is that they thought that the coalition would cave in. That is nonsense. Never at any stage has the coalition said that it would in any way recoil from persevering and pressing in the hardest and most effective endeavour to get the whole of the 15 per cent investment tax excised. We have said at every moment that we will not touch any of the rest of the package. We have told the Democrats that what we will propose will only cost somewhere between $20m and $120m. I have asked the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) in this chamber on a previous occasion whether he would give us the break-up of the costing of those four component taxes. He declined to do so. In his usual way he fell back on to vitriol and abuse, which is what we have all come to expect from him in this place. Never was an answer given. At no time did the Opposition draw back from the position it firmly stated. David Connolly put his attitude on the record as early as July 1988, soon after the economic statement of 25 May. </PARA>
<PARA> The subterfuge and campaign of obfuscation conducted by the Government in this debate ought to make it ashamed. But of course it will not. Never at risk was the basic $1.3 billion which would flow to the Government from the rest of the package. We only ever sought to excise the entire 15 per cent investment tax and we had the support of the Democrats in doing that. But for reasons that they will apparently explain during the rest of the debate they have chosen the Government as their wedded partner. They have chosen to go back on their support for the 3.5 million superannuants and instead single out 100,000 people who will receive a benefit from the amendment that will subsequently be put. With the support of the Democrats, who have done a deal with the Government, it will probably result as the way the law will be carried. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has also chosen to leave out in the cold another 5,000 people who apparently do not matter because there are only a few of them and drafting of the legislation is a bit hard. We have a package which is near enough, good enough. That is clearly the attitude of the Government and the Democrats but not of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It might be worth while setting some of the record straight following Senator Bishop's speech. We all know that the Government announced this proposal on 25 May 1988. As far as the Senate and a lot of other people were concerned this legislation by press release was the final straw, particularly when well into the second half of last year nobody had seen any concrete signs of what this proposal was all about. However, there had been enough information leaked about the contents of the legislation for the Australian Democrats to approach the Government with its concerns as early as July of last year. Our concerns were primarily that the 15 per cent earnings tax which was able to be reduced by any fund which involved itself in the share market was not going to be of any benefit to approved deposit funds (ADFs) and other fixed interest funds. The Government brushed aside those concerns, presumably because it ultimately believed that it would have the support of the Opposition. We continued that pressure on the Government hoping it would give us some sort of amendment that would assist people who had opted for safety by rolling over their lump sum following early retirement into things such as ADFs and got nowhere. Earlier this year we again approached the Government. Finally when this legislation was introduced we had no other option but to produce the amendments ourselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Like the Opposition we do not have access to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel (OPC). Sometimes that is an inhibiting factor; sometimes it is not. Usually we find that the clerks of the Senate can produce amendments that are in every way as good as those drafted by the OPC. In this case the amendments that were produced for us quarantined a number of funds which offered the security of fixed interest benefits to investors. That amendment was not supported either by the Government or the Opposition when it was moved what seems like an aeon ago but was probably only two weeks ago. As a consequence, we did what we had told the Government from the beginning we would do=mthat is, support the Opposition's amendment to remove the 15 per cent earnings tax altogether. We have been telling the Government from day one that that was not our preferred option. There are benefits to the earnings tax. Opposition members carry on about its being a tax on savings, but we do not hear any concerns from them, when they are given the opportunity to amend the tax laws, to remove some of that tax on the savings that people put into bank and building society accounts. The Opposition talks about equal playing fields, but we do not have an equal playing field in any area of the tax Act, including areas such as who can get a tax deduction for buying a home and who cannot. To hear the Opposition talk about level playing fields and equality in tax matters is just a trifle odd, considering its normal behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> In any event, there is no doubt that the earnings tax will produce some benefits. In the 1987 election campaign I urged the Government to introduce some incentives that would act to encourage the big life and superannuation funds in Australia to invest their money onshore instead of offshore, to stop depriving Australian business and the Australian economy of billions of dollars of investment potential. Two years down the track it produced the earnings tax, which will encourage the big life and superannuation funds to invest in Australia because if they invest in Australian companies which pay tax, they will be able to get the benefit of dividend imputation. In doing so they will reduce that 15 per cent earnings tax to zero. The other benefit is what it could well do to Consolidated Revenue by encouraging some of the biggest Australian companies, which currently do not pay tax, to start looking at their tax avoidance measures. There is no reason why major investors, such as the AMP Society or National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd or anybody who buys large parcels of shares, would want to invest in an Australian company that is paying no tax if they want to get the benefit of imputation to reduce their earnings tax from 15 per cent to zero or thereabouts. So there are considerable benefits to accrue to the economy, to Australian companies and to the Australian people as a consequence of the earnings tax. That is why the Democrats regarded as a last resort their support for the amendment moved by Senator Bishop on behalf of the Opposition to remove that particular tax element from the six-Bill package that we have before us. It was not our preferred option. Our preferred option was to protect that group of people who are going to be the only people in this country faced with the penalty of a 15 per cent earnings tax-that is, the people who had invested their money, rolled over their lump sums on early retirement into fixed interest funds which by their very nature are not able to get the benefit of imputation because they do not have any exposure to the share market. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is worthwhile at this point to dispel some of the beliefs that abound in the community about what sorts of schemes superannuation funds have on offer. There seems to be a fair amount of confusion about what is and is not a fixed interest fund and to what extent any fund that is a fixed interest fund is so. If we go out into the community and ask people about capital guaranteed funds or deferred annuities (DAs), the majority of them will tell us that those are fixed interest funds. But they are not necessarily so. Quite a substantial number of capital guaranteed funds have a significant exposure to the share market. They are certainly protected in the event of another October 1987-type crash from too much in the way of shock waves, but only because the funds themselves have set aside a reserve to absorb that problem. I do not think that even the big life and superannuation funds have the right to print money, and if there is a big enough problem, of the sort we saw in October 1987, we could well find that those so-called capital guaranteed funds are not terribly guaranteed at all as far as the capital component is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> DAs are not all fixed interest, and therein lies the major problem with excising those people from the effects of this legislation. Senator Bishop said, `Senator Haines gets up here and says that there are only 5,000 people and they are not worth worrying about'. That is not true. I think they are very much worth worrying about, but the difficulty is, as the funds themselves admit, that there is no way they can be included in this legislation because they are not a legally identifiable separate entity from those DAs which have an exposure to the share or property markets. That is a problem within the funds. </PARA>
<PARA> We have spoken to the funds and said to their legal people, `If you can come up with an amendment that will get those fixed interests DAs separated from your share or property exposed DAs, give it to us and we will run with it'. But they cannot. No matter what this chamber would like to do, it cannot legislate for something which is not a legal entity.That is why, in the long run, we have had to come down in support of virtually only ADFs with a 90 per cent fixed interest component, which is what was in our original amendment. DAs were not covered in the original amendment put forward by the Democrats because they could not be, and they still cannot be. That is a matter of regret to me, as it is to Senator Bishop, but it does not alter the fact that the problem lies with the structure within the funds and not with anything this chamber wants to do. It is a matter of capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> The figure of 5,000 is one which I believe is reliable. The large funds inform us that there are only about 5,000 people in Australia who have actually invested in interest earning DAs. Whatever the rest of the people out there think about their DAs, they are not interested in earning DAs solely, they have a significant exposure to the share market and in that regard they will get some protection-because of course they will benefit, as other funds will, from any capacity to use imputation to reduce that 15 per cent tax. </PARA>
<PARA> When we introduced our original amendment, which excised from the effects of the legislation those funds with a fixed interest component of 90 per cent or more, we were disappointed that we did not get the support of the Opposition. The funds then came to us and said, `We have some problems with your amendment. By isolating the funds, by quarantining them', which is what our amendment did, `you could, inadvertently, cause some behavioural changes within investors'. The big life funds were concerned that if our amendment had gone through, with the best intentions in the world it would have caused people to leave the other funds to go into ADFs. That is a concern I took on board. Certainly it was not my intention to cause a flood of people changing their superannuation behaviour patterns. My concern was simply to prevent a retrospective imposition being put upon those people who, prior to 25 May 1988, had gone into ADFs knowing they were the most secure funds that they could invest in because they were fixed interest and were not subject to speculation. </PARA>
<PARA> For that reason, we said to the funds and to the Government, `Come up with an amendment that will excise the members. If you can do that-fine'. It was far too complicated for us. As I said, we do not have access to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. Indeed, that is what this Government has now done. It has produced an amendment that will allow people aged 55 and over who were already in ADFs on 25 May 1988 and who had retired for any reason at all not to be affected by the 15 per cent earnings tax. It also extends that benefit to people aged 50 and over whose retirement was involuntary. Furthermore, recognising that after 25 May 1988 some people may have changed their behaviour in the industry in such a way as to move out of ADFs and into something else, this amendment also allows people who withdrew as members of ADFs to go into another fund to move back into an ADF. It is to the advantage of the industry because it will not cause a leap out of other funds by people who want to go into ADFs. It has maintained whatever stability can be maintained in what is essentially a fairly unstable industry to the extent that people move around because they look for the best deal that they can get.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that we will ever get a level playing field or equality in the tax area-certainly not in the superannuation area. After all, only half the people who can take advantage of superannuation do. There are many people, the majority of whom are women, who never really get the advantage of a superannuation system because they are never in a position to be able to go into one. So it is not much use talking about level playing fields. We have to make sure that people are not retrospectively disadvantaged in any way when they have opted for safety. Obviously, the funds have the choice of going into such things as redeemable preference shares, which will, as I understand it, maintain their fixed interest definition but give them some benefits from imputation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The manner in which this package of taxation legislation is being presented to the Senate today gives no credit to the Government because the timing of the amendments, the so-called duplication of issues, further adds to a confusion of a very complex set of amendments and legislation. I will therefore restrict my main comments to changes to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 1989 rather than to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 currently before the Senate. We have just heard an apology from the Australian Democrats for the fact that some people will get benefits; others will be denied. It is no fault of the particular person that he or she will be denied a benefit under what Senator Haines has been trying to achieve. Many people have come through what are known as the old section 23f funds. Their money in a life insurance environment has often found its way into a pooled superannuation trust.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Why should those people be discriminated against compared with people who, basically, have gone into bank-type approved deposit funds (ADFs)? I think it is poor when we legislate in the tax area for a group within a group. We are not talking about a whole class of people such as fishermen; we are virtually saying, `We are selecting groups within a defined category'. If we are to legislate in this manner to give a benefit to a sector within a sector and, at the same time, take away rights from the general body of people, we need to go into this a little more thoroughly and we need to make more extensive amendments to the body of the Bill than has been done. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, all we have really seen is a superficial change to let the Australian Democrats off the hook in relation to their original intention. What we are seeing now is a far cry from what was originally espoused by the Democrats. The Government has so narrowed the legislation that the cost to it will be a lot less. This mechanism will enable the Government to get its legislation through with the support of the Australian Democrats. So we have an unholy alliance, a cave-in, on what is tantamount to a most unsatisfactory situation. People who have joined funds in all good faith and who have moved in a particular direction on sound advice at the time will find that they will be discriminated against. There will be a need for different unit prices for continuing fund members. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is an apology for leaving some people out and for bringing some people in, simply because there are `definitional problems'. I do not think the body of people out there will be satisfied with this ad hoc, mishmash piece of legislation which will cause a great deal of difficulty for fund operators. A number of these people have invested $1m, $2m or perhaps even more millions of dollars in sophisticated computer hardware to comply with the requirements contained in the May economic statement. They are now finding that a lot of that hardware will be redundant and they will have to add to it in a major way. This will cause great confusion for the funds. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, no fund in Australia is prepared to tell those people who are retiring where to go because of the confusion in the industry arising from this complex set of laws. We are really adding further to this complexity for fund managers and, as I have mentioned, it is a complexity that the industry can well do without. </PARA>
<PARA> This part of the legislation is almost unworkable and is causing people to move out of superannuation funds as an investment option. I think this is unfortunate, particularly at a time when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is talking about introducing tax breaks for savings under the Income Tax Assessment Act. If the Government were concerned about this, it would at the very least agree to the Opposition's amendment to ensure that the investment income of superannuation funds across the board and not of a group within a group will be exempt from tax. That is the only fair way to go. I thought that parliament was about creating an environment of fairness and equity for everybody. This legislation discriminates quite unfairly against certain types of people. If we start doing this, it will be a sad day for the reputation of this chamber and people's respect for this institution. We are the people who are supposed to get it right. </PARA>
<PARA> Inevitably, there will be court challenges in respect of the amendments that will be introduced by the Government. Surely in debating the issue we can get it right when we are being told by silks, QCs, or whatever one likes to call them, that this is deficient legislation. In the urge to get something on the legislative books at any cost we are putting on the books something that is inadequate, something that discriminates, something that is deficient. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's call for the exemption of investment income regarding the three principal types of funds-superannuation funds, ADFs and pooled superannuation trusts-will not be the great revenue loss that the Government presupposes. I call on Senator Walsh to give us the figures for each of the four components; the tax of 15 per cent paid in respect of the employer's contribution-I submit to Senator Walsh that that must be about $1 billion-the capital gains tax, the 16.25 per cent tax on eligible termination payments and the tax on investment income. The rough figures range from perhaps $20m to $95m. I call on the Government-it is the Government's duty-to produce a financial impact statement. Where is the revenue to be earned? We know that the overall figure it will get out of this proposal will be $1.4 billion. There is a responsibility on the Government to show us what the components of this legislation are so that we know the full financial impact of what we are going to impose on people and on the funds. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been told that overall there will be about a 17 per cent loss to the contributors because all the costs that will arise from this legislation will have to be passed on in one way or another. That will be reflected in a lower rate of return to the individual members, whether they be in superannuation funds, ADFs or pooled trusts. The big problem is that one cannot discriminate. The costs of a benefit to one particular category will have to be borne by every member of the fund because one cannot discriminate. Is it not unfair that somebody in a fund pays for a benefit that will move elsewhere? I believe that the first of the foreshadowed changes will be completely unworkable. I reserve my further comments to clause 18. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clause 9 is the crux of this legislation, which is yet another example of this Government's rapacious demand for revenue. It implements a measure the Government announced with regard to superannuation more than a year ago in its May 1988 economic statement. This clause will both increase the tax take of the Government and bring forward revenue for the Government, at the expense of future retirees, through additional taxes on superannuation. The Government claims that this legislation, in particular this key clause, will improve the efficiency of the dividend imputation system and reduce tax avoidance opportunities. The Government further claims that it will increase the spread of superannuation without an unsustainable Budget cost. It is really a thinly disguised attack on the superannuation entitlements of millions of Australians who are already significantly overtaxed. In other words, Government revenue will remain unacceptably high as a result of this measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of Australia's basic requirements is the need to perform better. That involves comparing the performance of Australia as a nation with our world competitors which are constantly fine tuning their performances. If we are to become a performance oriented society we need a major shift in attitude. It is individuals who achieve superior performance; governments, industries and unions do not. Instead of taxing an individual's savings-which for a country in our circumstances, are far too low and which, in many circumstances, are non-productive-Australians ought to be encouraged to save more of their incomes for investment in productive activities. Instead, we find, through clause 9 of this legislation, that the Government is reducing the incentive for people to be involved in a very important form of saving, namely, superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is claimed by the Government that the 15 per cent tax to be imposed on the income from investments of superannuation funds will be offset against dividend imputation credits on domestic equity investments made by the funds. But that will be only partially the case. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh), to the great detriment of their credibility, have both argued that no recipient of superannuation payments will receive lower payouts because of the new tax structure. The Treasurer in particular has stressed this. When this was announced last year I undertook detailed calculations and presented them to the Senate in the debate at that time, which completely shot that claim to pieces. The simple fact is that superannuation funds currently have about 15 per cent of their total investment in equities offering franked dividends. To have sufficient tax credit to completely offset this new 15 per cent tax on their earnings, they would have to lift the level of equities in fully franked dividends to about 60 per cent. That is because dividends in companies give a much lower yield than do other sources of income such as interest or rent. It would be most imprudent for most funds to have such a high percentage of their total investment in such equities. In the first instance, therefore, prudential management of contributors' funds would prevent the tax being fully offset by dividend imputation. </PARA>
<PARA> When I did these calculations, the money invested in superannuation funds totalled about $50 billion. About $10 billion of that was in equities, about $7 billion being in franked dividend equities. Given the need, as I said, to raise that percentage of equities in their total equity investment to about 60 per cent, under this clause superannuation funds would have to lift their total investment to nearly $30 billion, an increase of about $23 billion. Again, given that not all Australian equities provide fully franked dividends, in reality that would require an increase of between $25 billion and $30 billion in overall equity investment by the funds. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be remembered that this increase in investment has to be achieved in the total Australian commercial and industrial equities market of about $110 billion. It is that commercial and industrial equities market which provides regular dividends, but not even all of those are fully franked dividends. Furthermore, that $110 billion consists of many equities which would definitely not be prudent superannuation investment, leaving aside the imprudence of a 60 per cent investment in equities anyway. There are simply not enough shares available to allow funds to acquire an extra $25 billion to $30 billion in equities, nor would appropriate shares be capable of being issued to meet that demand. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, particularly the Minister for Finance, is guilty of believing in the fallacy of composition. It may be possible for one or two funds to meet that requirement of fully franked dividend equities to completely offset the 15 per cent tax, but the fact that one or two funds are capable of achieving that does not mean that all funds are capable of achieving it, in particular because, as I said, there are insufficient equities to go around. If funds tried to achieve that 60 per cent investment in equities there would be an increase in share prices, because of an increased demand for equities, and that would be an unsustainable rise in terms of dividend returns. We would find that, as a result of the price of the shares going up, the yield on those equities would decrease, thereby decreasing the tax credits and, of course, pushing those funds further away from the goal of having sufficient tax credits to offset the tax. It is not possible, despite the Government's claims, for funds to invest in sufficient equities completely to offset the new 15 per cent tax by dividend imputation. That is the flaw in this clause in terms of the Government's claims. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also concerns in regard to this clause in regard to its legal principles. It may well be that this legislation will be thrown out by the courts, because it contravenes certain basic legal principles to which I shall draw attention. Beneficiaries under a superannuation deed may obtain accrued rights. Those accrued rights are legally enforceable and it would take a very clear expression of legislative intent to alter those rights. That clear expression is not present in this legislation. Some trust deeds may provide the power to make retrospective variations to trust deeds, in which case any such accrued rights are subject to that overriding right of the trustees, but that would not be evident in all cases. In the absence of such power in the trust deed accrued rights could not be validly altered by the trustee. A direction by legislation to a trustee to alter accrued rights would not by itself be sufficient to alter those rights. The retrospective alteration of accrued rights can usually be justified only by the trustee acting bona fide. It is certainly not clear that a trustee directed by legislation retrospectively to alter accrued rights would be acting bona fide. It would depend on a number of circumstances which are difficult to predict, given the uncertainty of the detail of the legislation. So, the legislation falls short not only of the Government's claims with regard to the capacity of superannuation funds to avoid the 15 per cent tax through dividend imputation, but also of basic compliance with legal principles. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer tries to argue that this legislation will act as a catalyst to promote investment in Australian rather than overseas securities, but even allowing for that fact it will still not be possible for funds to achieve sufficient investment in Australian equities to offset the 15 per cent tax. The Government's claim that end beneficiaries will not be 1c worse off as a result of this legislation is clearly false. The hypocrisy of the Australian Democrats in supporting this Government amendment is writ large for all to see. We have seen Senator Haines running around the electorate of Kingston, which she will seek to represent after the next election-I think that is a false hope on her part; the most recent poll in Kingston shows her support running at about 13 per cent-castigating the Government, and quite properly so, for its high interest rate regime and its effect on home buyers in Kingston. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument about high interest rates is the effect they have on people's pockets. They affect the amount of money left in people's pockets after they have paid tax and interest rates which are in effect fixed charges which they cannot avoid. This, of course, governs the amount of money left in their pockets for other cost of living expenses. But this legislation will rip more money out of the pockets of individuals. If people are to retain the end benefit to which they are entitled from their superannuation when they retire, they will be required to increase their contribution to superannuation funds to maintain that same end benefit which they expected when they entered superannuation. That will have exactly the same effect as increasing interest rates are having-ripping more money out of people's pockets, money which they cannot at this time afford. For Senator Haines to support the Government's legislation at a time when she is running around criticising the Government because of the amount of money it is ripping out of people's pockets because of increasing interest rates is sheer hypocrisy and certainly will be noted by the Kingston electors. </PARA>
<PARA> This clause should be opposed. The decision of the Opposition to excise the 15 per cent tax on income earned by superannuation funds is the correct way to go. I urge the Committee to support the Opposition's amendments to ensure that those who have entered superannuation funds in good faith to establish a level of benefit required for an adequate income in their retirement without being dependent on government are not penalised. </PARA>

<PARA>That clause gives a head of power to the Commonwealth Government to override or interfere with State or Territory superannuation funds.

I know from my information that there are 26,500 public servants in Western Australia, approximately 200,000 in Victoria, and 75,000 in Queensland. As the legislation stands, those public servants will have their reasonable benefits severely affected. It was announced in information circular No. 6, issued by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner in April 1988-I have a copy of page 4 in front of me-that pending the Government making a decision on the reasonable benefit limits, the provision of taxation ruling IT-2201 would continue to apply. That ruling prescribes the current levels of reasonable benefits: limited, for the first $35,000, to seven times the average rate of income; from $35,000 to $65,000, to five times; and over $65,000, to three times.

Given that the review commenced in May 1988-12 months ago-at the time of the May economic statement, I ask the Minister whether that review has come up with any results. If the results have been agreed to, I ask the Minister to give an assurance not only to those who will receive benefits from Public Service superannuation but also to the many others who will receive them from the Services. Will those reasonable benefit limits be confined to what is set down in information circular No. 6, or does the Government intend to alter that? We are dealing with legislation which gives the Commonwealth the power to interfere with State and Territory superannuation funds and which sets reasonable benefit limits. Despite my continued questioning, no one from the Government has come up with what the reasonable benefit limits are. Public servants make a decision to take a lesser amount of money in the work force to get security. On the open market many of those people would be able to receive more money, but they choose not to do that.

The Government should be open and honest with us today by saying, `That is not the case, we will review our reasonable benefit limits; we will keep it at 8.4 times the salary level'-as is the case in Queensland and Victoria-`or eight times the salary level'-as is the case in Western Australia. The Government's latest information bulletin restricts benefits to seven times the salary level for amounts up to $35,000, five times for amounts between $35,000 and $65,000, and three times for amounts over $65,000. A massive sum of money will be involved. I want to know the Government's intentions. The Committee deserves an answer on reasonable benefit limits. </PARA>

To my knowledge they have not been reissued. What is the position regarding those people who have retired in the interim? I understand there are people waiting to see whether they are entitled to an extra amount from the superannuation fund according to the trust deed. They are being denied access to that because of this intransigent situation that has arisen as a result of the difficulty that the Insurance Commissioner is having in determining reasonable benefits.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to Senator Watson's question, the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner (ISC) has not yet reported. Therefore, I really cannot give any definitive answer to the questions he posed about what transitional arrangements there might be and so on. We have not got the ISC report, let alone any Government endorsement of it. In relation to Senator Boswell, he is wrong in inferring that proposed section 270 in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) in some way applies the reasonable benefits limit to State superannuation schemes. Section 270 does ensure that part 9 of the Income Tax Assessment Act can tax public sector funds. However, it is for the very reason that the provisions of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act, including the reasonable benefits standards, are not to apply to public sector funds until 1 July next year. For that reason, subclause 14 (4) was included in this Bill. The subclause deems formerly exempt public sector funds to be complying funds for the period up to the end of June next year. The position is as stated by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in May of last year, which is that previously exempt public sector schemes will not be subject to a reasonable benefits limit until 1 July 1990. Reasonable benefits limits are not the subject of the Bills now being debated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has for a long time-possibly forever, I am not sure-been a reasonable benefit limits policy applied to private sector funds.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have really got to take issue with what the Minister for Finance has just said. It indicates that he has not adequately read all the amendments that have been put forward by the Opposition. Senator Bishop has moved a necessary amendment to exclude the income of the pooled superannuation trusts (PSTs) under the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2). But if one looks very clearly, one will see that there is a further set of amendments that also pick it up in the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill. So we will pick up the issue that the Minister is referring to in the next superannuation Bill as well. The situation has been adequately covered. It was necessary, in order to follow these Bills through in a logical sequence, to have done it in this particular manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I come back to my earlier comment that the confusion surrounding this Bill stems from the manner in which the Government has presented a very complex set of proposals to this Senate. It was necessary to put that amendment that Senator Bishop has moved in this Bill. Perhaps a similar amendment of wider scope will be moved and debated in the superannuation Bill itself. So I support the amendment that has just been moved. It extends the exemption to the investment income of PSTs, which cover registered organisations. There is a wide group of people and superannuation funds and trusts within those funds.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the proposal that has been put forward by the Opposition in regard to pooled superannuation trusts (PSTs). It is important for the Committee to remember-we all know but sometimes we may forget-that superannuation is a very major issue for many hundreds and thousands of workers and superannuants. Most people I have spoken to over the last three years, particularly over the last 18 months, have been utterly confused on this whole question of superannuation. They have had to rely on the advice that has been given to them by experts in the field. Those experts have very often been invited by the unions and management to address intending retirees. This has been the case in respect of not only persons reaching the retiring age but also persons who, in many industries, are faced with early retirement. Those workers have had no option but to accept the advice of the experts. In accepting the advice of the experts, they have then taken the various options that have been made available to them. In that way, their own money and the money that has been put in by the employer is then managed in a certain way. Now we find that the rules have been changed-they have been changed three or four times in the last two or three years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of things have been said in this chamber both today and, more particularly, on the previous occasion that we debated this Bill. I listened very carefully to the matters that were raised. A number of constituents have written to me in respect of their superannuation concerns. One concern is that the Government's measure will not assist workers who have taken advice and invested moneys which are capable of being affected by the share market. For example, if a worker with $60,000 invested $20,000 in each of three funds and if the first two funds made a loss and the second one made a profit, the Government would tax the fund that made a profit but would not make an allowance for the money that had been lost in the other two funds. This is a disincentive to workers to go along the deferred annuities route. Workers faced with that proposition could be excused for thinking, `Well, we will take as much as we can in lump sum, buy everything possible and see whether we can go on the age pension'. That is no good either for the economy in the existing circumstances or, ultimately, for the Government's whole attitude to this superannuation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not kid ourselves. The whole business of the push to get people into superannuation, the 3 per cent that has been awarded and so on, is a recognition of the unpalatable fact that in, say, 40 years time people who retire will find themselves faced with a circumstance where they may not have access to the age pension. Given the current birth rate in Australia, the current population of Australia and the trends that have been notified to us in this chamber through reports from the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and others, there will not be a sufficient number of people in the work force to pay the tax that will be needed to sustain the level of benefits. Because of the Government's failure to adopt other more important policies, we are faced with the position that superannuation is being virtually forced upon the work force. Workers' options are being limited time and again. </PARA>
<PARA> A statement was made by the Treasurer, as I understand it, 12 months or so ago, that no superannuant stood to be disadvantaged by the measures that the Government sought to introduce. While a number of superannuants and potential superannuants have been identified as being disadvantaged by these measures, there have been others, including the group that I mentioned a moment ago, for whom there also appears to be no recourse. I am advised that because of the complexity of the legislation it would be almost impossible to draft an amendment which would cover the situation that I described previously. That is a sad reflection on the procedures which we have to follow, given the complexity of the Bill that is before us. </PARA>
<PARA> I indicate my support for the amendment to clause 9. I agree with what Senator Watson said. Although other matters will be picked up in the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 1989, which will be dealt with next by the Committee, it seems to me that it is necessary to amend this Bill at this time. If this is not done, I assume that we will be faced, when we come to the superannuation Bill, with a statement by the Government that we should have amended the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2). What Senator Bishop has proposed in respect of PSTs deserves support, and I will be supporting the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Harradine and Senator Watson for their interventions and stress the point I made in my opening remarks-that the Government deliberately chose to present two Bills to cover the field of superannuation. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, which we are presently debating, was introduced last November as the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 1988 in an attempt to comply with the order of the Senate requiring legislation to be introduced within six months. The reason that one part of the superannuation industry is covered in a separate Bill is that the Government deliberately chose to do it that way. Accordingly, I have moved an amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 in relation to pooled superannuation trusts because they are first mentioned in that Bill. But, because I am well acquainted now with the modus operandi of the Minister for red herrings, otherwise known as the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, I will move that clause 64a be inserted in the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 1989 so that even the most humble member of this Parliament-and, indeed, interested observers-will be able to understand the intent of the Opposition and, should the amendment be passed, the intent of this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has chosen to amend its amendment to this legislation. This morning Senator Walsh claimed that the amendment to the amendment was but an addition, yet this so-called addition effectively alters the intent of the original amendment circulated yesterday. Surprise, surprise!-there is not a single copy in this chamber of the original explanatory memorandum which accompanied the original amendment. But guess what? I just happen to have a copy, left over from the limited supply that was available yesterday, which clearly shows-and we will be dealing with this show in the next Bill-that the intent of the Government's original amendment was not to put a compulsory requirement on trustees to distribute the benefits to eligible depositors but to leave that to the discretion of the fund managers. </PARA>
<PARA> Guess what the so-called addition, which in my view is clearly an amendment, does this morning? It puts such a compulsion on the trustee managers. One can quibble if one likes about terminology in this chamber. One can say that I wish to be pernickety and I should not be pernickety. But the bottom line is this: the Minister has chosen to introduce legislation into this place on the basis that near enough is good enough. So far as the Opposition is concerned, that simply will not do. It will not do that only 100,000 folk out of 3.5 million superannuants are being singled out for single advantage. The Government is saying to the 5,000 people in deferred annuities, `Too bad about you, it is all too hard and anyway there are only 5,000 of you'. What sort of legislation are we entertaining in this place? What sort of principle do we adhere to?</PARA>
<PARA> It is important if we are to have equity, if we are to have a superannuation scheme which encourages savings and which encourages people to be more self-reliant, that we have one set of rules for everybody. That is what our amendments do and that is not what the Government's amendments do and that is certainly not what the Democrats are achieving by doing a deal with the Government on this issue. The Democrats stand condemned. Indeed, the 3.5 million superannuants who will not get a benefit by the amendments and will not be given a fair go because the Democrats and the Government have got together will remember and will have a long memory when it comes to the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to support my colleague Senator Watson's comments about the importance of having the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) here. I understand Senator Tate's point about the reasons for Senator Walsh's absence. But I take some exception to the statement by Senator Tate that Senator Bishop's very important and detailed summation was a matter of rhetoric. I ask Senator Tate whether that, therefore, means that the Government does not believe that the singling out of 100,000 superannuants at the cost, if you like, to 3.6 million others amounts to discrimination. Is that what Senator Tate is suggesting? That was the very point that Senator Bishop was making-a point which Senator Tate seems to regard as rhetoric. I would like a specific answer to that question.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Walsh for returning to the chamber and I also thank him for his response to the question on reasonable benefits which was raised by Senator Boswell and me. The Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) felt that it did not have a great deal of relevance to the package of Bills before us. I wish to remind him that last night we were told that the many and varied ways of taxing superannuation-for example, eligible termination payments, which we will have a look at later on-amounted to 32 in number.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Haines said, `I can do better'. There are now 64 methods of taxing eligible termination payments. There are a lot of indirect effects that feed into this particular legislation. One concerns reasonable benefits. To give a linkage to this I wish to come back to the problems that the lack of direction that has come from the Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC) has caused superannuation funds. This lack of direction has led to the problem that superannuation funds must ask the contributors. If they do not ask the right questions they will be taxed at a penal rate or at a rate different from that which might otherwise apply. Therefore there is a responsibility on the ISC to come out very quickly with its standards, and not only on reasonable benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will now return to this issue of reasonable benefits which is causing so much difficulty and, in some cases, some hardship. May I have an assurance from the Minister that he will contact the ISC to direct it to hurry up and to provide, at the earliest opportunity, a set of standards or guidelines to apply not only to reasonable benefits but also to the wider issues of standards that will be required under this legislation and that should have been ready now? I also make the further request that the Minister not only make this request of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission but also make the request of the Commissioner of Taxation because he also has to issue standards and guidelines under this legislation. He has had over six months in which to present them. He has failed to present them. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation is adding to the confusion and the difficulty. Let me, therefore, request that the Minister contact both these officers of government. They are under his direction and control. I know he will say that they are commissioners and, therefore, they should be at arm's length. But if that is the point it is about time we started bringing some of these people back if they are being dilatory and not getting on with the job that they are set up to do. I am not referring necessarily to the Commissioner of Taxation but to the ISC. We warned the Minister when he set up the Insurance and Superannuation Commission that there were going to be problems. He is dragging the chain. Who is paying the cost? It is the millions of people out there who are superannuants or who come under that wider category of friendly society members-the whole gamut. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to explain to the Minister the seriousness of the problem. This scale of benefits was formerly contained in various taxation rulings and was revised by the ISC in circular No. 7 issued the day after the April economic statement, which I referred to earlier. A number of problems were identified with the original statement. A revised statement was subsequently issued. That statement itself contained a number of difficulties and anomalies. The ISC has advised that it is undertaking a further revision of the whole area of the scale of benefits. That further revision has been under way since July 1988. There has been no official release of the results. That is not good enough. That is why I am asking the Minister to direct these people to act and to act quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, the trustees have been asked to administer the reasonable benefits standards in accordance with a reasonable benefits scales in which the ISC has admitted it has definite problems. The proposed scale provides that only specified portions of benefits paid from untaxed and unfunded arrangements are taken into account. It also provides a different treatment for golden handshakes, depending on the relationship between the employee and the employer and the section under which the deduction of the payment was claimed. These rules increase greatly the number of questions that fund administrators ask of the current or prospective members, particularly when it is borne in mind that many members have difficulty providing the correct answer. For example, neither the Australian Taxation Office nor the taxpayer, the employer, will be able to ask the member the section of the Act under which the golden handshake paid to the associated employee has been claimed or allowed. That will give the Minister and his advisers some idea of the difficulty that they place people in at present, not only current members but also prospective members. </PARA>
<PARA> Fund managers are having trouble advising their clients or prospective clients what to do. The people in the community should contact their local Labor member of Parliament, if they have one, or ring up and find out who he is to put pressure on him. Only by the action of people in contacting their local members will these issues be raised and corrected. It appears that what is said in this place is not adequately responded to. With this lack of response I call on members of the public who have been affected to contact their local members of parliament and raise these issues. If they want action on housing interest rates they should contact them on that as well and then we might get some action. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge that. I must say that it varies from Minister to Minister and from department to department. Some departments and Ministers are very courteous and prompt in their replies. Such is not the case in respect of queries relating to superannuation. I have a case in point from an individual constituent who, on 5 February 1988, wrote to me about the problems of superannuation and the rules that have been changed of which he was not aware. The circumstances of his case are disconcerting indeed. This constituent wrote to me on 5 February. I wrote to the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on 8 February 1988. Ultimately, I received a reply from the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Peter Morris) on 11 August 1988, some six months later. That letter misinterpreted the matter that was raised by the constituent. It said that the constituent had stated that the Government had amended the law to prevent lump sum superannuation retirement payments from being rolled over into deferred annuities. That is not what the constituent said at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to go into this too much but I raise it so that a reply may come forward. I sent that response to the constituent who replied in detail to me, indicating that what the Minister had stated in his 11 August letter was not correct. He asked for certain detailed information about his superannuation entitlements which he, as a constituent, was entitled to receive. He has spent many years in public service for the people of Tasmania. On 31 October I wrote to the Minister Assisting the Treasurer asking him to respond in detail to the quite specific questions that were raised by the constituent in respect of superannuation. There has been no substantial response to that letter to the Minister Assisting the Treasurer which I wrote on 31 October 1988. It is now June, mid-1989. There has been a series of acknowledgments to my repeated requests for an answer. But that is just not good enough. I feel like it but I am not going to delay the Committee on this matter. I think it is important. I ask the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) whether the Department could answer the letters that I have written on behalf of that constituent who asked questions about superannuation which that constituent is entitled to do. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise this matter because Senator Watson said that members of the public should write to their members of parliament. I certainly hope that they do that. In so doing we want some guarantees from the Government that it will treat these requests for information promptly and provide that information. This is not a secret society. Some of these questions are very difficult. I find that it is now virtually impossible to get an amendment which will place into this legislation an objective which would probably be desired by most members of this chamber. I repeat that that is in relation to enabling superannuants to offset losses incurred where funds are running at a loss and which are open to the vagaries of the share market and against that particular fund which may be making a profit and from which that superannuant is receiving some income which will be taxed. I think everybody in this chamber would see the justice of that, particularly concerning workers. The case I mentioned is that of a worker in a major industry in Tasmania. He was a representative of the union. He was closely associated with getting people to advise on superannuation. He received certain advice and the proposed legislation was so complex that he had to take the advice he was given. He did so and now he finds that three or four of the investments are losing while one is not. He will have to pay taxation on the full sum that he is receiving from the one that is not making a loss while not being able to offset the losses from the ones that are making a loss. I appeal to the Government, to the Minister and to my colleagues in this chamber to ensure that prompt answers are given by the Government to reasonable questions which are addressed to it through elected representatives in the parliament. </PARA>

I do not want to have to ask this question in relation to all similar notices, but I put the Government on notice, using this as a test case, to save my asking the question again: Are people and funds going to be denied the sorts of deductions that are allowable under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 simply because the notices have not been given because the ISC and the Commissioner of Taxation have been remiss in not putting forward their regulations and in not putting out the notices to enable people to get the deductions to which they are legitimately entitled, provided that they put in their notices in this year? By the time this Bill gets royal assent there will be precious little time left. What administrative arrangements are there? Does it require an amendment to the Act? If it does, I will call on the Government to prepare another amendment to enable the deductions that people are rightfully entitled to under this Bill to be claimed, because the effluxion of time might deny them that opportunity.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The Minister may say that this is a short term problem; that the major problem relates to this year. But that is because he has made the legislation retrospective to 1 July. Sure, it will not be a problem in perhaps two years time if it is going to take two years to get out the regulations. But I assure the Minister that it is an immediate problem, a pertinent issue, at the present time, because we are running out of time. We must have a better mechanism or we will have to ask these bodies to send a notice of entitlement to every person concerned, under proposed new section 276. Unless they are told of this, they will overlook it and will be denied a deduction to which they will be entitled. How are we going to overcome it?-just by a request for an amended assessment, putting the onus back on the individual or the fund to have that amended assessment. What is the mechanism?</PARA>

When that promise was first made, did it relate only to the carry-forward benefit of people who were already in the scheme? I understand there is a provision that enables a person who is worse off to claim it back through the taxation mechanism. What is the mechanism? Should that mechanism to enable a person who is worse off as a result of that commitment by the Treasurer not be in this Bill? Where is that facility in the legislation before us to enable a person who is worse off somehow to claim back, we understand, through the Income Tax Assessment Act? As I see it, there is no provision or mechanism to enable a person who is worse off to be able to claim that. How does a person achieve that situation? It is quite unfair. The onus should be on the Government but the Government puts the onus on the person who is worse off as a result of these changes-it has to be as a result of his or her direct action.

<PARA> The Government has therefore decided to bring superannuation funds within the full ambit of the imputation system, giving them access to dividend tax credits. </PARA>
<PARA> To achieve this a tax of 15 per cent will apply to fund earnings. But this 15 per cent tax can be neutralised or offset by the receipt of dividend tax credits. </PARA>

If there were no tax on the income of superannuation funds the Treasurer would have been right most of the time and we would not have needed special provisions.

As I have said, I am not aware of the Treasurer having made such a promise. I do not need to quote again from the May statement as it is clear in that statement that the 15 per cent tax is a tax on fund earnings. The Treasurer's statement applies to the 15 per cent tax on fund earnings. Even though it has been asserted here ad nauseam, I am not aware of the Treasurer having made any promises that, because of the tax provision on fund earnings, no individual would be worse off.

I have said that I am not aware of the Treasurer making such a statement. I read out the relevant part of the text of the May statement to the honourable senator and I do not think there is anything more to be said about it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While we are waiting for Senator Walsh to confer with his advisers, I might put two other things on the record. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), if my recollection serves me correctly, got into the act, too. He described this wonderful piece of invention as the magic pudding. Perhaps it ought to be called the poison pudding. What he is asserting, as Senator Watson has so adequately pointed out, is wrong. Irrespective of the fact that the Treasurer estimated that the measure would allow the Government to bring forward nearly $1 billion of its own tax money now lying in superannuation funds without diminishing any personal end benefit by 1c-as we all know in politics perceptions become the essence of what is promised-the perception was, and it has never been successfully denied by the Government, that no superannuant, those ordinary Australians out there who are supposed to be planning for their future, would be worse off; the Treasurer was somehow giving them an assurance that they would not be worse off. It was misleading and a subterfuge to allow that perception to remain. As I said, it is not a magic pudding; it is a poison pudding. We are supposed to think that the Government's assurances are supposed to make it all right. The fact that the anti-detriment clause confers on the Commissioner of Taxation yet another discretion somehow is supposed to make people feel safe, comforted and assured that their investment will not be lessened.</PARA></TALK.START>

The anti-detriment provision applies to those who would, in the absence of the anti-detriment provisions, have been worse off had their been no change, that is, had the tax been levied on the end benefit instead of partially on the end benefit and partially on the contribution, as is provided for under this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Minister has attempted to portray the anti-detriment clause as something which is simple and easy to exercise, I think it is useful to have on the record industry's attitude to how it may operate. The understanding of industry is that the anti-detriment clause is unworkable; it would require the reviewing of the entire tax profile of individual superannuants over 30 to 40 years. With approximately 150,000 retirees with superannuation leaving the work force each year, the application of this clause would cause chaos in the tax system.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think we will find that many people will not be able to answer these questions. Five or 10 years ago, superannuation funds involved fairly simple sorts of documents. With changes in the ownership of companies, the transfer of funds, et cetera, many of the original questions will be difficult. Individuals put a lot of faith in the trustees. I think we will find that the funds will be taxed at a higher rate than possibly is intended under this legislation simply because we will require a sophistication not required in previous years. The funds and the individual members of those funds will be worse off simply because they will not be in a position to answer the detailed questions required. These sorts of questions were not required to be answered perhaps five, 10 or 15 years ago-or even earlier-when these people entered the funds. They will be worse off if they are taxed at a higher rate. Does the Minister recognise that there is a problem?</PARA></TALK.START>

It was obviously in the Treasurer's interest to allow people's fears to be assuaged, to be comforted that their hard earned investment was not at risk, that it was not going to be eroded. The letter that was sent to Senator Harradine backs up that point. It talks about tax treatment. It says that generally nobody will be worse off.

<PARA> (5) Page 35, clause 23, proposed paragraph 116gd (3) (a), lines 33 and 34, leave out the proposed paragraph. </PARA>
<PARA>These amendments deal with that part of the superannuation industry which is not covered in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 with which we have already dealt. They deal specifically with life officers and registered organisations. This morning we have already been through the reasons why the Government has chosen to deal with legislation in this manner, dealing with part of the industry in one Bill and another part of the industry in another. I have moved these amendments in order that all classes of superannuation funds will have the benefit of the excise of the 15 per cent investment tax. As we have already experienced the red herrings that are cast across the trail of our amendments, I foreshadow that later I will move an amendment to clause 64, which is a statement of intent, so that nobody can be in any doubt that the intention of the Opposition is to ensure that all superannuants benefit from the excising of the 15 per cent investment tax-not just some and not just those who are preferred by the deal between the Government and the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> On a quick recap, the situation is this: the Democrats voted with us on 1 June to excise the tax on superannuation funds and approved deposit funds. This morning I moved an amendment which would excise the tax on pooled superannuation trusts. I have now moved a series of amendments to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill which would excise the tax from life offices dealing with superannuation policies held by complying superannuation funds, complying approved deposit funds (ADFs) or roll-over annuities. That would ensure that all of the 3.5 million superannuants would be beneficiaries of the amendments. Senator Walsh has already indicated that he will be seeking to remove the amendments that were passed by the Senate on 1 June, and put back the original wording in the Bills as they were first printed-that is, to take away the benefit that the Senate has already bestowed. That will mean, if the rest of his plan is complied with, that only 100,000 people in superannuation funds will benefit from the tax being excised. It is just too difficult to include the 5,000 people who are in roll-over annuities or deferred annuities, so they will have to be left out in the cold. It does not matter that they entered their superannuation fund in good faith; it does not matter that the only difference between an ADF and a roll-over fund is basically that, at the end of the day, the roll-over fund offers the superannuant the option of taking a pension-type payment instead of a lump sum. I would have thought that option would certainly have been in accordance with Government policy and in accordance with the Democrats' wishes. It is certainly in accordance with the coalition's wishes to attempt to achieve more self-reliance for people in a population which is steadily ageing. We should be delighted that the people of Australia are healthy and live longer. Yet most of them are to be discriminated against by the deal done between the Government and the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, we are moving these amendments to this Bill, dealing with this particular part of the industry, because that is the manner in which the Government has chosen to introduce the legislation. As I also said earlier, the nature of the drafting of the Bills is such that the original Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) is, in effect, amended by the Bill that we are now debating. I gave the example of how clause 49 repeals section 275 of the principal Act and substitutes a new provision. It deals with the very meaty issue that we were dealing with a little while ago of the contributions tax. How interesting it is that the original intent of the Bill, under the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) provision, was that the actual amount of the contribution had to be paid over to the body that was accepting the liability before that liability could be transferred. But, in the amending legislation-the Superannuation Bill-that clause is repealed and no longer does the actual contribution of the cash have to be transferred to the other body for the liability to be transferred. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two aspects about which the Opposition is most concerned. Firstly, there is an absolute need, which is echoed in every publication by people who write about the economy, to increase the amount of savings that are accruing in this country. That means we have to attract into superannuation funds groups of people which have never been attracted to superannuation before. Such people have to be given a level playing field. People who are to be attracted to superannuation funds must be told, `Look, don't take your hard earned, after tax money and spend it on something that will give you instant enjoyment or gratification; put that money into a superannuation fund and take the benefit at the end of the day'. Would a prospective superannuation client who saw the history of this Government's treatment of superannuation, its greedy tax grab, by using superannuation as a milch cow to add to its coffers, and the 20 changes to superannuation that this Government has introduced since it came to office, think it was a reasonably safe and predictable investment? Would they not be better advised to buy an antique clock or two, which might appreciate in value and be more stable than a superannuation investment?</PARA>
<PARA> One of the other arguments which Senator Walsh has used in the course of the debate is that the 15 per cent investment tax is, somehow, an instrument of government investment policy. He says it is very important that we have this tax so that people who choose to invest in the equity market will invest in those Australian companies which pay the full tax which is due; dividends paid will be franked; and imputed dividends will be paid over the superannuation funds. Senator Walsh says it is very important to do that because it will increase the amount of investment in those equities. What he has not bothered to say is that the imputation system is not quarantined to the investment tax; it can also be applied to the contributions tax. Therefore, if we excise the 15 per cent investment tax, the investment attractiveness of equities will remain. </PARA>
<PARA> One matter that is most important, in the Opposition's eyes, is that, if superannuation is to be attractive, it must be simple. One of the speakers in this debate today said that, once upon a time, when one entered into a superannuation agreement it was very simple. It is now extremely complicated. As I have said, if we are to have more Australians providing for themselves at the end of the day, instead of simply relying on government-funded schemes, we have to attract more and more people into superannuation schemes. The figures speak for themselves. In the private sector, only 39 per cent of people are in superannuation schemes. In the public sector, the number improves dramatically to 67 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> That still leaves an awful lot of Australians who are not covered and who should be made to feel that superannuation is a real option for them. As I said before in this debate, that means that people on the lower margin of tax rates, who presently find superannuation to be unattractive in its totality, have to be attracted towards it. It is particularly important for women to be attracted into superannuation schemes. For the most part, they are the people on the lower marginal rates because that is the nature of our present wages system. That fact, together with the fact that women live, on average, nine years longer than men, means that superannuation is a key question for women. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the question as to why we want to get rid of all the tax, not just a part of it. We do not want to say to 5,000 people that they do not matter a row of beans and to the remainder of the 3.5 million Australians that we do not think that we have to consider them too greatly either. The reasons why we are adamantly pursuing this course, and why we will call upon the Democrats not to change their minds from 1 June when they voted with us-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We can quibble about whether changing their minds and changing their votes are the same thing. The fact of the matter is that the Democrats did vote with us previously to get rid of the 15 per cent investment tax and they have chosen to do a deal with the Government. They say they have not changed their minds; they say that was their intention all along: but in the Democrats' original amendments which we moved in the Senate on 1 June they did, indeed, seek to include pooled superannuation trusts. The Democrats are no longer concerned about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important to note what Senator Haines was quoted as saying, as recently as this morning, in the Sydney Morning Herald:</PARA>
<PARA> The leader of the Democrats, Senator Haines, said that around 100,000 retired investors would be exempt from the tax because they were in ADFs. </PARA>
<PARA> However, about 5,000 investors in deferred annuities and pooled super funds-which have the same investment portfolio as ADFs-could not be exempted because of legal complexities. </PARA>
<PARA>This was regrettable. How would honourable senators feel if they were one of the 5,000? Would they feel that it was `regrettable'? I think I could find a much stronger adjective to use. She said that there was no way that these people could be excised from the tax. Well, there is, and that option is now before this Committee. That option is to leave the amendments as they are and to support our additional amendments that are now before the Committee, and at some other stage to include pooled superannuation trusts as well. The option is here for the Democrats to exercise. But, we read in the press that it is regrettable that 5,000 people are left out, that only 100,000 people are to be preferred and that the remainder of the 3.5 million are to be ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Haines was concerned with another aspect, too, which I will deal with when the Minister for Finance moves his amendments. I refer to the question of retrospectivity with regard to trust deeds, on which a number of legal people at a very late stage have been able to express an opinion on this very complex matter. It is worth putting on record why this has happened. I asked that the Government's amendments be made available to us. That was done. We were alleged to have had them 24 hours in advance, but we did not get them a full 24 hours in advance. The debate on the Bill was put off. As late as 5.45 yesterday evening, I spoke to somebody from the Treasurer's office and was assured that I would have the further amendment or addition-call it what you will-within half an hour. I received from the Government the additional amendment at 9.10 this morning. I have gathered-and other Opposition members have shared in this responsibility-various legal advices as to the effectiveness of the Government's amendments so that we may debate them when the Committee deals with clause 56. I thought it was important to place this on record because it is part and parcel of the reason why the Opposition persists in its view. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These five amendments pick up one of the errors in the Opposition's original amendment that was passed a fortnight ago-an error which the Opposition steadfastly insisted did not exist. The original error that the Opposition made with this legislation was to leave its carriage to two people whose ambition vastly exceeds their ability. When it was pointed out to Mr Connolly that this was the case, he responded, according to a report in the Age, as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Opposition spokesman, Mr Connolly, counterclaimed that the Government had either bluffed the Senate or had perpetrated `a barefaced ambush'. Mr Connolly said he still believed that the Opposition amendment covered all superannuation funds. It had been drafted by parliamentary officials, checked by the industry-</PARA>
<PARA>it would be interesting to know who from the industry checked them-</PARA>
<PARA>and it would have been seen days beforehand by the Government. If Senator Walsh was right, he owed Parliament an explanation as to why he had not pointed out the error earlier. </PARA>
<PARA>The sequence of excuses from Mr Connolly went `Walsh is wrong, Walsh had an ambush, it is Walsh's fault'. I wish to make a couple of other points on this part of the Bill, which is as good a place as any to make these comments. Opposition senators preached sanctimonious sermons at us for about three hours this morning and for several hours before that. For decades Liberal or coalition governments presided over the festering sore of superannuation. They watched superannuation degenerate into the crudest of tax rorts, which allowed crooks like the Kelly brothers and other cherry pickers to evade millions and millions of dollars in taxation under the pretext that they were providing for superannuation. All that was presided over with culpable negligence by Liberal Party governments. They had no policy-they still have no policy other than reactive opportunism. </PARA>
<PARA> As soon as the present Government began to clean up the superannuation mess-the festering, suppurating sore over which they had presided for decades-what did we have from the Opposition? We have reactive opportunism and sabotage. Initially there was a promise to repeal the lump sum tax, which is an essential component of a policy to prevent superannuation degenerating into a payment of deferred wages-which is what it had degenerated into, amongst other things. That promise no longer seems to be operative. Now the Opposition opposes the 15 per cent tax on fund earnings. The coalition wants to continue to preside over a superannuation policy which has the following investment effects: an incentive for funds to invest in foreign equities instead of Australian equities; an incentive for business to go in for debt financing instead of equity financing; an incentive to indulge in speculative investment instead of productive investment. That is the sort of policy that the Opposition wants to see continued. This is completely consistent with its record of many decades in government-a record of culpable neglect of superannuation policy and its degeneration into a tax rort. In short, the Opposition's past and present policy on this issue can be summed up as one of no guts, no brains and no principles. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendments moved by my colleague, Senator Bishop which are about fairness, equity and treating people in the same way. Is it not blatantly unfair that a person who deals with a bank could be treated differently from a person who goes to a life office to seek an approved deposit fund (ADF)? These amendments are about treating in the same way people who basically have made the same decision. One person could choose to go to a bank, which sells an ADF, and the other could choose to go to superannuation organisation and buy the equivalent of an ADF in a pooled superannuation arrangement. This proposal discriminates against friendly societies and all the registered organisations, and puts some people at a disadvantage compared with others. One person could be given an advantage in a plan and somebody else could be worse off. Our amendments seek to bring about fairness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is all very well for the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, to talk about promises that were made 20 years ago when the legislative environment was very different and to try to pin that on to the Liberal Party in today's environment. Does the Minister not recognise that the legislative provisions and the environment have changed? It might be a good debating point to say that 20 years ago the proposal was such and such, and that it was different again five years ago, but one cannot apply those undertakings to the environment that we are in today. This proposal seeks to exempt from tax superannuation plans, ADFs or pooled superannuation trusts. This is going to cause a flight of people out of certain plans into others. The Government is providing an opportunity for some people to be better off. What are people going to do? They are going to move their investments because of this legislation into different sorts of plans. Our amendment is to ensure that there is equity, that they are all going to be treated the same and that their investments are going to be the same. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Government that until a few months ago advisers were telling people to invest in particular types of plans because they provided better benefits. I refer to the issue of deferred annuities. It was acknowledged across the board by those who knew that deferred annuities were the best way for people to invest their money. There is no doubt that there are advantages. As a result of what is happening now these people are worse off. Fancy legislating to make people worse off when it was acknowledged, under the law that previously existed, that that was the way to go! Instead, the Government is deliberately discriminating against these people as a result of what has been offered and promised here today. What the Government is virtually saying is, `We want to give ADFs a marketing edge'. How does that fit with the integrity of the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party? The Government says, `We want to single out people and we want to single out those funds run by the banks and others, particularly ADFs, and we will give them a definite advantage'. I have got news for the Government. When the new changes are debated there will be problems. The Government is going to wipe out whole lots of ADFs. Within these ADFs there are segments which provide for capital growth equity link. There is no provision in the Bills to provide for this segmentation. So the Government is going to defeat what it is really after because there is no provision to treat its capital secured funds differently from others within this particular bracket as a result of its 90 per cent provision clauses and others. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats have been conned. All the people that they are referring to will not have anywhere near the coverage that they are talking about. If the Australian Democrats look closely at what is before them, they are going to be in trouble. I am surprised that they took the stand that they did a few months ago when they voted with the Government against our earlier amendment. By that vote, they lost their flexibility to support ours. The Australian Democrats cannot say that they have been swayed by the argument of the debate and the logic of that argument in the Senate, because they have already made up their minds to deny the benefits that they feel should be going to a restricted category. That category will not be as wide as they think it is because of the restrictive nature of the amendments. The Government, through its subsequent amendments, has conned the Democrats. The operations of the ADFs will be a lot narrower than the Democrats thought they would be. </PARA>
<PARA> What is going to be done about restoring the benefits that were promised to all the people in ADFs who thought they were going to get a benefit but, because they were part of a bigger ADF plan which had different components within it, will be excluded? How will they be excised? Perhaps during the lunch break the advisers could tell the Minister how that excising of the different types of equity links compared with the capital secured ones within the ADFs will work. There is a problem there and the scope of the legislation will be a lot narrower. If the Democrats are not going to support these amendments, this legislation will give a marketing edge to a particular group to the detriment of others who previously had an advantage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Administrator for the Northern Territory, Commodore Johnston, retires on 30 June. Commodore Johnston has had eight and a half years in office as Administrator of the Northern Territory. In paying tribute to the service and the work that both Commodore Johnston and his wife, Joan Johnston, have contributed to the Northern Territory I would particularly describe His Honour as a man of honour, hard work and humour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Commodore Johnston was no newcomer to the Northern Territory when he was appointed Administrator on 1 January 1981. He had previously served as part of his very distinguished naval career as the officer commanding northern Australia based in Darwin in that period that embraced Cyclone Tracy. In the period since 1981 the Administrator has seen under him-that is one way of putting it-four Chief Ministers: Chief Minister Everingham, Chief Minister Tuxworth, Chief Minister Hatton and Chief Minister Perron. </PARA>
<PARA> Commodore Johnston has brought to his tasks as the Administrator of the Northern Territory, as I have said, a particular background of honour; that, of course, draws very heavily on his own career in the Navy. He started as a midshipman at age 13 and served Australia well and also served in the United Kingdom. When I describe Commodore Johnston as a man of hard work I believe the fact that he has seen so many Ministers come and go in the political operation of the Northern Territory Government would probably give him much to contemplate and, of course, the operation of his Administrator's Executive Council must at all times have been a very interesting operation. </PARA>
<PARA> Commodore Johnston is well known for the very extensive travelling that he undertook throughout the Northern Territory and in doing so he endeared himself to the people of the Northern Territory. I do not believe there is anybody in the Northern Territory who has travelled as widely, as extensively, or as meaningfully as Commodore Johnston in the last eight and a half years. I continually look at my diary and try to cover the principal seven or eight urban towns and the 45 or so principal Aboriginal communities and I am always competing with that diary in an effort to get around and cover as much ground as I can. I can honestly say that due to the hard work of Commodore Johnston he has probably covered most of those communities frequently during his term of office. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Administrator is also a man of great humour. I think this has been the particularly endearing attribute that has drawn him so close to the people of the Northern Territory. I would like to take one moment to quote from a speech that His Honour gave last year in the 1988 Menzies Oration to the Menzies School of Health. The Administrator was describing his early arrival in the Northern Territory:</PARA>
<PARA>The first truly hectic day was Australia Day 1981 which seemed to be a never ending series of speeches and visits, each with an attendant change of clothing. One such visit was to the Fannie Bay racecourse for the Australia Day Cup, where, dressed in uniform I went for a stroll through the betting ring with Alec Fong Lim. My homecoming was complete when I was confronted by a well-oiled punter, clad in shorts and thongs and clutching his green can life support system. My inebriated friend focused with some difficulty on the white clad vision which confronted him and then asked, `Who the hell are you?' Drawing the last tattered remnant of my Canberra pomposity around me, I intoned, `I am your new Administrator'. Some seconds of silence ensued whilst this earth shattering news was dissected and digested and then the decision was delivered, `Big deal'. Off he went to terrorise some bookmaker. My preconceived view of the territorians' conception of my civic position had been well and truly vindicated. </PARA>
<PARA>That is just one example of the approach that Commodore Johnston has brought to this very important office, that of Administrator of the Northern Territory. Mrs Joan Johnston has also supported her husband continually throughout his various vice-regal jobs and attendant responsibilities. The Administrator is the patron of some 89 organisations in the Northern Territory, all of which, I believe, hold him very close. In all of those organisations he took a very intimate interest. Similarly, Mrs Johnston has also played a very important role in her own right with many women's and other community organisations throughout the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> They have forged very close relationships with the various aspects and people of the Northern Territory, particularly those people drawn from the Aboriginal communities that they visited so frequently. I am pleased today to pay a tribute to the eight and a half years that Commodore Johnston has been the Administrator of the Northern Territory and I wish both him and his wife well in their retirement for which they will be making their home in Darwin. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on this report at this stage, mainly in protest at the way things were run yesterday. There was a certain amount of on-and-offness about this report being tabled and when it was eventually tabled we were allocated, no doubt by arrangement between Whips, one from either side, little time to speak because of the pressure of Government legislation. However, I do recognise the need to get Government legislation through at this time of the year, as the session is coming to an end. We certainly do not want to keep the Senate back here next week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that where there are six people on an inquiry who have been meeting in this place and all over Australia for the past six months, anyone on that inquiry should be given the opportunity to speak on the report at its tabling. Otherwise I can see that, in future, it could affect the ability of this Parliament to fill the numbers on committees. That is one of the reasons I do want to speak on the report and I intend to speak briefly. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Chairman and the Secretariat for the way they have conducted the inquiry. I believe it reflects nothing but good on the Chairman and the Secretariat-not only the way it was conducted but also the way that the report was drawn up finally. On the drugs side, the use of drugs in sport has been a problem since the Olympics of 1964; that is when problems started to spread around the world. It started mainly from the Eastern bloc countries and spread to the Western nations as well, mainly for the reason that they have to be able to compete. The unfortunate part about it is that a lot of people do not realise that the athlete must have ability in a particular sport first. Secondly, that ability must be developed to possibly the end capacity of the human body so that it can be used on the track. Unfortunately, for a lot of athletes and competing nations around the world, it has not been left at that, just to get the absolute maximum amount of ability in the human body. Athletes have resorted to the use of enhancement drugs to get that little bit extra to be past their fellow men and women. Eventually, winning a competition is made rather one-sided if drugs are used and they certainly cannot replace ability. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to Australia and the Australian Institute of Sport, more particularly, I believe that the use of drugs at the AIS and in Australia for that matter in athletics is far more widespread than we had ever imagined when the inquiry first started. I believe that they were introduced, not by the heads of the AIS or the head of any department of that institution or athletic association around Australia, but by rather adventuresome coaches who were appointed, mostly in the field of the power sports. I refer to weight-lifting, rowing and those sorts of things. As I have said before, it was done to keep up with the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, when drugs were introduced in the AIS it seems to me that the head of the AIS and its top management certainly were not aware of it at the beginning. Had they been aware at the beginning, I think things would have been vastly different. What worries me is that a certain coach there-and I do not mind mentioning that it was Lyn Jones-was probably the instigator of the use of these drugs and, what is more, could have been the instigator of importing drugs and using Australian athletes to get them past the Customs checks. </PARA>
<PARA> Page xxxviii of the report contains the recommendation that regulations concerning the importation of drugs be looked at and, particularly, Australian athletes taking them past Customs. I also would like to mention that on page 271 of the report there is a schedule that was used at the AIS when obviously steroids were being issued to be taken by athletes. The point I did make during the inquiry is that although Lyn Jones in front of us all the time kept pointing out how professional he is in his game-that he is professional at this and professional at that-he distributed a chart which was supposedly going to be a research program on certain vitamin pills and seemed to be drawn up by a kid in grade 4. I do not want to downgrade anyone in grade 4, but he was very amateurish for a fellow who maintains he is professional everywhere. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to move on to other parts of the report and to the administration of the AIS in the lower levels rather than the higher levels. When it came to the administration of finances and purchases of vitamins, or whatever they purported them to be, I took it to be that steroids were being used. They were that amateurish that one of the coaches, justifying his purchase from a chemist shop in Sydney, came back to the AIS with a receipt to reclaim his money. Obviously writing that receipt himself, he put the wrong address on it. Instead of writing `Colin Bova, chemist, Burwood, Sydney', he put, `Colin Bova, chemist, Victoria.' I searched through the register of the Pharmacy Council of Victoria and no Colin Bova was ever registered in that State. Some of the methods used were very amateurish and I consider that the AIS, in using public money, should look well into its financial administration. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we came to the case I would like to mention briefly, Mr Acting Deputy President, where obviously the AIS was caught out using steroids and tried to make it sound as if they were used for therapeutic reasons; in other words, they were given to the athletes for medical reasons. I quote from page 199 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA>USE OF ANABOLIC STEROIDS FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES</PARA>
<PARA>The first of these cases occurred in 1986 and involved an athlete who subsequently went on to represent Australia . . . The second case was in 1987.</PARA>
<PARA>On the AIS policy of medical use of steroids, Professor Bloomfield, Chairman of the AIS Board, was asked what was the Board's policy in relation to an employee of the Institute who provided any banned drugs. He replied, `They should be dismissed'. Then he went on to say after further questioning on the therapeutic use of drugs, particularly with a second opinion: `Yes, we agree they can be used. We can see no major problem, provided it had been fully demonstrated to us that it may be necessary to assist in the repair of an injury'. Professor Bloomfield further agreed that this distinction between therapeutic and performance-enhancing use of banned drugs did not exist in writing but noted that on two occasions it had been implicitly approved by a decision made by the Executive. He also agreed that the anabolic steroids are totally banned in so far as high level international competition is concerned, and agreed that they should not be used under any circumstances but they are at the AIS. Carrying on further, when they obviously did use them, they did try to make a distinction between steroids and drugs used clinically. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted with interest a document `Drugs and the Australian Institute of Sport-Guidelines for Staff' on an AIS file. This paper was apparently for consideration of the AIS board on 7 October 1987 and stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Board recognises that some prescribed drugs may be used or may be contained in substances used in legitimate medical use by an athlete. Therefore athletes will be tested for anabolic steroids, only unless the director of the Institute otherwise directs. </PARA>
<PARA>The clear implication of this statement, Mr Acting Deputy President, is that in the Board's opinion, anabolic steroids have no legitimate medical use. It should be noted that the two cases involved in the administration of anabolic steroids took place in October 1986 and March 1987 even though this proposed rule has been around since 1986. As time marches on, I will turn briefly to quote Dr Ken Fitch of Perth, Western Australia, on the value of treatment of steroids:</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Bloomfield told the Committee that the therapeutic use of anabolic steroids could be justified if it could be fully demonstrated that they are necessary to assist in the repair of some major injury. In this context it is of interest to examine the success of the treatment. </PARA>
<PARA>As discussed previously, Dr Ken Fitch, Chairman of the Australian Olympic Medical Commission, has commented, for example, that `the use of anabolic steroids to treat injury cannot be deemed to be conventional medical practice. Quite simply', he said, `they have no role to play at all. It may be that some doctors are prescribing them but there is no scientific evidence of any kind to support their use'. </PARA>
<PARA> Concluding now, Mr Acting Deputy President, it has obviously been pointed out and backed by other medical experts that steroids have no place whatsoever in therapeutic use. Dr Fricker and Dr Macguire, having been caught out, tried to use the therapeutic value as a lame excuse. Obviously evidence that we had before the Committee by Dr Fitch and others-there was a Professor Donike, I believe-certainly proved that they were wrong. I believe that much more inquiry has to be done on the AIS to bring it back into the guidelines or the use that the AIS was formulated for in the first place; that is, to bring Australian athletes to the fore of world competition by fair and square means. Its emphasis should be on fairness in sport and not on taking part in drug use in sport around the world. For a time it may be successful for certain athletes, but then they pay for it later in injuries and with their own health. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a matter of public interest this afternoon to express some concerns over an incident which has happened overseas but is causing great concern among a group of my constituents back in Western Australia. Indeed, it is causing great concern among groups of people right throughout Australia and I would dare suggest that those concerns will be echoed from other places in the rest of the free world. The matter is the arrest and detention in Anchorage, Alaska, of Mr Sergio Buschmann.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Buschmann reached prominence in Australia here in the last few weeks. That prominence was particularly pointed in Perth where Mr Buschmann was detained by immigration officials. He appeared in court in an appeal against a deportation order and did eventually lose that appeal and was deported by the Australian Government. Mr Buschmann was en route-a safe route the Government officials were told-back to his present home in Stockholm when the aircraft in which he was travelling landed in Anchorage and he was detained by United States immigration officials. I do not profess to be an expert on foreign policy or the immigration laws of the United States, but I am led to understand, and so far it has not been denied to me, that the act by the United States Government through its officials is an illegal act under international law. Mr Buschmann had never had any intention of remaining in Anchorage or in the territory of the United States; he was in transit; it was merely a refuelling stop, and he should have been allowed back on the aircraft to complete his journey. </PARA>
<PARA> In making those comments, I have limited knowledge of the events that have happened, and that is a qualification I put on a condemnation of the United States Government and the United States immigration officials in Anchorage. If events are as they are reported in a number of media in Australia today, the United States really cannot stand up on platforms and claim that it supports civil liberties or freedom of movement of people. Whilst I have the opportunity of saying a few words in relation to what could be an illegal arrest and detention, I may also put on the record the fact that I did have a fairly significant involvement with Mr Buschmann and his supporters in Perth while he was in Perth. Honourable senators will not see any record of my involvement on the front pages of the print media of Australia or, indeed, on the television sets because there are different ways to work through a problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I have read media reports today which lay the blame for Mr Buschmann's present predicament at the feet of the Federal Government. I think because of my intimate knowledge of the events surrounding Mr Buschmann's arrest and his appearance before immigration officials in Perth, later his arrest, and finally his deportation from Perth, that the blame really does not lie with the Federal Government. I will not now point the finger at anybody, or lay the blame on any individuals involved, but I do make the point that Mr Buschmann was badly advised on the eventual course of events over in Perth. There were a number of commitments-</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1I4">Senator McKIERNAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think there is probably a time and place to level that responsibility and I do not believe that this is the time. I think that an individual's life possibly might be endangered and I do not believe in inflaming a situation that might ultimately lead to that eventuality. Turning to the point that I was making about ill advice to Mr Buschmann and his supporters at the time, I am aware, because of my intervention on their behalf over in Perth, that the Government was doing what it possibly could within the law to satisfy the demands that were being placed upon it regarding Mr Buschmann's leaving Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I regret to say that, despite the efforts of my office and myself, the officers of a number of my colleagues in the Federal Parliament and State colleagues and civil rights individuals, the advice that we were given and the agreements that were reached were not fully complied with by Mr Buschmann and/or his supporters. Because of that I think a lot of talking needs to be done before final blame is to be levelled at any particular individual or individuals in this sad event, not only for Mr Buschmann, but also for this nation and our record on civil rights. </PARA>
<PARA> I think a number of people have actually sought headlines, rather than trying to reach an amicable resolution of the situation that we found ourselves in. I find even today, on a report that has come through the Australian Associated Press, that the Civil Liberties Council is attacking the Government over the extradition moves that may eventuate in the United States to return Mr Buschmann to Chile where undoubtedly he will be interned, possibly even killed, or murdered, as would be a proper explanation of it. Unfortunately the Civil Liberties Council, which I hold in high regard, from the Press release that I have in front of me at the moment, has not got its facts right. It claims that the Australian Government repeatedly insisted that it would not extradite Buschmann to the tyrannical regime in Chile, yet the Government brushed aside the concern of the Uniting Church and other sponsoring groups and put Buschmann on a Qantas flight that landed in Anchorage on American soil. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately the author-the article is attributed to Dr Factor, who is an officer of the Civil Liberties Council-obviously has not checked the facts through. She has not checked her facts because no Qantas flight landed in Anchorage. Certainly Mr Buschmann left Australia on a Qantas flight; he arrived at Narita airport in Tokyo and then changed aircraft and airline. No Qantas flight flew into Anchorage or into the United States carrying Mr Buschmann. One part of the Press statement is right, that the Government did repeatedly insist that it would not extradite Buschmann back to Chile. Indeed the Government did not; the Government actually bent over backwards to ensure that Mr Buschmann was given a safe passage out of the country. Unfortunately Mr Buschmann or his supporters did not take up the offers and the flights that were offered to him at that point during the debacle. </PARA>
<PARA> It is sad and when we do look to an analysis of what has happened in this sad affair hopefully the blame, if any, can be clearly directed to where it properly should rest; but I do not think this is the time to do it. Before I sit down, Mr Acting Deputy President, I would remark that a number of members of Parliament, colleagues of mine in this place, and groups outside in the community, have expressed their concerns to the Australian Government on the detention of Mr Buschmann and his being taken off the aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> Our concerns have been listened to by the Government and the Government has lodged a protest to the United States Government. We will be doing, I am assured by Government officials, whatever is in our power as a government to ensure that the United States Government does not return or extradite Mr Buschmann to his most certain death in Chile. I think it proves again that our Government has acted responsibly in this matter and it is unfortunate that some individuals, including the Australian Council for Civil Liberties, have not sought and got the facts clear before jumping on the band-wagon. </PARA>
<PARA> I suspect that a headline is probably more important to some people at some times than is the protection of an individual's life. I will make this final qualification before I do sit down-and I am aware that politicians usually take three or four times to wind up. I make this statement to one and all in the campaign. Even though I have done what I could in my office as a parliamentarian for the State of Western Australia to assist Mr Buschmann to get safe passage out of Australia, I do not hold with each and every thing that Mr Buschmann stands for. I certainly do hold with the return of Chile to a democratically elected government. </PARA>
<PARA> I do have some dispute with Mr Buschmann over the means of achieving that return to a democratically elected government. Speaking with an accent like mine, I am aware of the sorrow and the suffering that people living under repressive regimes have to endure and I certainly hope that the people of Chile will, in the very near future, return to a democratically elected nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise in the Senate today what I regard as a very important matter that affects the life and well-being of a former Afghan Army general, one Mohammad Nida, who was previously a senior officer with the Supreme National Defence Council of Afghanistan until he effectively defected on 23 March last. Since that time he has been residing in India on a visa which will expire on 23 June next. Efforts have been made on a regular basis since that time to enable the general to be reunited with several members of his family in this country. As Chairman of the Afghan/Australia Council, I have written to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Ray, to ascertain the Government's attitude to the general's application to enter Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am most unhappy and dissatisfied with the response to date and I do not at this stage blame the Minister for that, but it may well be that there is some confusion of objectives between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. The end result is this: the general attended the Australian High Commission in New Delhi on several occasions and was subjected to fairly intensive questioning. From the information available to me, after having discussed the matter with people who should know, there would seem to be no doubt about his bona fides. Yet the Australian High Commission has summarily rejected the application and, at this stage, the Minister, Senator Ray, is relying on that advice and has not acceded to the request. </PARA>
<PARA> I regard that as a very serious matter because I do think it is incumbent upon the High Commission to explain its reasons, if it has good and valid reasons to object. It should make them known to the Minister responsible for making the decision. For it to have simply declined to do so to date is not good enough, and I think it is very important indeed that that should happen without delay. But what is, of course, of critical importance is that, because the visa expires next Friday, General Nida is in imminent danger of being forcibly repatriated to Afghanistan, where he faces certain execution. I have that on advice from people in this country who know the extent of the close relationship between India and Afghanistan, and have no doubt at all that, although lesser mortals have not been deported back to Afghanistan, in this instance there is every likelihood that a very senior army officer will be repatriated and once that happens, of course, he will not survive in Afghanistan for very long. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, information communicated to me this morning indicates that, as a result of a press conference given by General Nida in New Delhi yesterday, he has since found that a vehicle from the Soviet Embassy in Delhi has been driving up and down outside his apartment and he is very concerned that he may even be kidnapped whilst in Delhi. I have information that the Soviet Embassy in New Delhi has made it clear to the British Broadcasting Corporation representative that it believes that General Nida made misleading statements in his press conference. I know of no reason for that and neither indeed does the general. The concern is that, if the Soviet officials are determined to deal with him and have him either sent back to Afghanistan or simply dealt with on the spot, General Nida's life is in very real danger. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of utmost concern to me is a document which has been made available to me in the last 24 hours. It is over the name of one Rajiv Kapur, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees senior program officer for the UNHCR Charge de Mission in Delhi. I seek leave to table the document. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It reads as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Resettlement of Afghans in Australia</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The Australian High Commission has informed us that they have stopped all applications for resettlement in Australia from Afghans until they know what will happen in Afghanistan and if people can go back. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) All persons, including those who applied for Australia before, will therefore not be called for interview. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Any inquiry should be to the Australian High Commission and not to UNHCR.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Those who have already completed their medical examinations are not affected. </PARA>
<PARA> (5) This is only for Afghans. </PARA>
<PARA>On the face of that document, and assuming that it is genuine, that is a very clear case of discrimination against one particular ethnic group. I know of no reason why that should be so. The office of the Minister for Immigration is similarly not aware of any such decision by the Australian High Commission in Delhi and I publicly call on the Government to explain what seems to be a very unsatisfactory and discriminatory state of affairs. I know it has been the view for some years of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that, because Afghan refugees constitute about five million out of a total world refugee population in excess of 15 million, and the majority of them are from rural areas, they should all be treated as persons simply wanting to return to their homeland when the current war has ceased. That is simply not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA> The experience that I have from dealing with about 500 in Melbourne and another 1,000 or so around Australia is that they are model citizens; that they assimilate very well into this country; that they are very energetic and enterprising citizens and there are very many of them who are basically urban middle-class. They are not in the rural, peasant category; they are not wanting simply to return to a devastated Kabul; they are wanting to make a new life for themselves. I think it is an outrageously generalised approach that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade takes to this matter, simply to put all of the five million into the same category when, clearly, that is not so and, clearly, any case by case assessment would indicate that very many of them have credentials that would benefit this country greatly. </PARA>
<PARA> So I call upon the Australian Government to explain this memo, to say whether it is accurate that the Australian High Commissioner has made such a decision. If it is accurate, and it has made that decision, then on whose authority was it made? Why was it not communicated to the office of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, who is ultimately of course responsible for processing such applications? In the ultimate I urge the Government not only to reconsider but also to rescind this memorandum and not resume the current, in my view, overly restrictive approach that is being taken to the processing of such applications, indeed to expand it and to treat such persons on a much more generous and humanitarian basis. One can only say that, if the approach taken to date to General Nida's predicament is indicative of the attitude of the Australian Government, it leaves a great deal to be desired. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government will have blood on its hands if General Nida is deported by the Indian authorities when his visa expires on Friday next, because there can be no doubt at all that he will have a very short life expectancy if returned to his homeland. I therefore urge the Government to rethink the situation of General Nida in particular, and the resettlement of Afghans in Australia in general. </PARA>

As this Government's economic policies further squeeze Australian families the need for child-care is growing at an alarming rate as many mothers are being forced to go into the work force. In April this year more than 500 people marched through the city streets of Melbourne demanding affordable child-care and a boost in the number of available places. In New South Wales and Queensland waiting lists are such that many people are resorting to registering for a child-care place upon the birth of their child.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In Tasmania the child-care funding crisis has reached such proportions that last Tuesday a public meeting was held in Launceston to discuss the impending and crippling fee increases. These increases will put child-care well beyond the reach of the average family and it will make a mockery of this Government's so-called commitment to child-care. </PARA>
<PARA> The meeting in Launceston pointed out that the Federal Government is neglecting its commitment to provide in real terms a program to ensure that parents and children have access to quality child-care services, regardless of cultural background, disability of geographical isolation and in proportion to income. The reality is that under this Government child-care is becoming a luxury. In today's society and with today's economic climate, thanks to this Government's mismanagement, child-care is a necessity.

<PARA>The Federal Government has paid lip service to the child care issue during a period when families are being squeezed by tight economic policies. </PARA>
<PARA>For those families who cannot survive today's mortgage rates and the cost of living without two incomes, for those single parents who choose to work to support their children rather than to depend on welfare and for those unemployed parents who need time to look for jobs, to attend interviews or to attend job retraining schemes, reasonably priced child-care is a basic necessity of life. So it is also for young mothers in the education system, as a group of young mothers at the Tasmanian State Institute of Technology pointed out only last week. I quote from the Launceston Examiner of 7 June:</PARA>
<PARA>`I saw a parent here in tears because of the choice she had to make-whether to leave her children at home or bring them to lectures', said one nursing studies lecturer. `In this day and age people shouldn't have to make the choice between education and children.'</PARA>
<PARA>Featured in that Examiner article is a story of a young mother doing a course and who has two small children, 2 1/2 years and six months old. She said that the cost of child-care was a reason for going part time; she had given up full time studies and if the child-care facilities were adequate she would not need to be constantly ducking home to breastfeed the baby. But she will battle on. The feeling is that it is a vicious circle. Parents retrain so that they can go back to work to better provide for their children but while they are studying they and their children are missing out. Without affordable child-care these people would simply give up and turn to welfare hand-outs in order to care and to provide for their children. In recognition of this, most child-care centres in my home State of Tasmania have held their fees down for so long, or for as long as they could reasonably do so, but they simply cannot do so any longer. The crunch has come. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth subsidy ceiling of $90 per week per child has not increased in three years. It no longer covers the expenses involved in running a child-care centre. The Launceston Creche Committee has pointed out that child-care staff salary increases, 3 per cent superannuation, $10 national wage increase, 4 per cent second tier and 3 per cent national wage rise were not allowed to be included in the Committee's annual budget. As a result, the Committee estimates that a break-even fee which includes a conservative 7 per cent allowance for the consumer price index must be $136 per child per week. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, rising operating costs have left the centres with no choice but to increase their fees by at least 20 per cent from 1 July this year or close down altogether. The choice those centres face is either to cater for those parents in need and to become bankrupt doing so, or to cater for those who can afford $136 per week per child and provide an elitist service only. Surely, if the latter choice is necessary it defeats the very purpose for which child care centres exist. These centres have been forced to become businesses rather than community services, serving the elite few who can afford to pay for them, rather than the many who desperately need them. It is sheer hypocrisy, in my view, on the part of the Government, on the one hand, to say that it wants more women in the work force and yet, on the other hand, to fail to provide economic child-care facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> After these increases that are coming on 1 July, a family with two infant children and earning more than $32,000 a year will have to pay $260 a week for 40 hours of child-care, whilst for some lower income families a 20 per cent increase will put their daily child-care bill in excess of their daily income. In such a situation obviously some mothers have just got no choice but to leave the work force. In last year's Budget Mr Keating promised that the Hawke Government would expand by 30,000 the number of child-care places over the next four years. This is an announcement which the families have heard now several times and are becoming increasingly cynical about. It is simply an announcement that keeps getting repeated, not action. </PARA>
<PARA> I am constantly reminding the Senate that this Government has no child-care policy for its Defence Force children; that is, people for whom it has a special responsibility, not only as their employer but as an employer that requires them to go thousands of miles from their extended family and live in isolated and difficult areas. They are young couples, newly married, with little babies and they have no family support of their own. They desperately need child-care but constant postings to suit the service needs mean that they are never in one place long enough to rise to the top of a waiting list. </PARA>
<PARA> Some child-care centres in the defence forces have been started with self-help, but recently two of those have had to close due to financial problems-one for the Air Force at Point Cook, Victoria, and another one that is used by the Army and the Navy at Holsworthy in New South Wales. This Federal Government that skites about the 30,000 child-care places that it is going to provide us with refuses to lift a finger to help them and will not produce a child-care policy for the defence forces, having promised to do so for the last three years. The Government's track record in the area of child-care is heavy with rhetoric and with promises but its performance is rotten. </PARA>
<PARA> Only yesterday in the Hobart Mercury it was reported that a Ms Dianne Ridley had recently completed a study for the Federal Government on work related child-care and its effects on productivity. She pointed out that work related child-care was not just a women's issue, but could be an important factor in improving productivity. She also pointed out that, due to the falling birth rates, Australia's labour force was going to shrink and would make it more important for employers to minimise staff turnover and attract people back into paid work. So it is an economic necessity for Australia to provide more affordable child-care places. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time for this Government to wise up to the reality and to get its priorities right. We have all seen, sadly, in increasing numbers lately, the great Australian dream of owning a home vanish under this Government. Now it seems that affordable child-care for parents who are working to provide a home and to support their families is also going to follow the same path. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1988 is an omnibus Bill for legislation administered within the primary industries and energy portfolio. The Bill has been brought on at this time at the request of the Government to meet its legislative program. It makes a number of amendments to existing legislation, including repeal of the Sugar Agreement Act 1985, repeal of the livestock slaughter legislation, changes to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act 1977 and changes to the Wool Marketing Act 1987. The amendments are not being opposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The repeal of the Sugar Agreement Act of 1985 with effect from 1 July will rescind the current import prohibition on sugar, as announced in the May 1988 economic statement. The current domestic administered pricing arrangements will be terminated on 30 June 1989, the expiry date of the Commonwealth-Queensland Sugar Agreement. The revised agreement ends the 70-year-old embargo on sugar imports and will see the current import embargo replaced with tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA> From 1 July this year there will be a tariff of $115 a tonne, which is equivalent to $US4.2c a pound. This will run for two years. On 1 July 1991 the tariff will reduce to $95 a tonne and then to $70 a tonne a year later. The Government's original proposal was for a tariff of 35 per cent for raw sugar and 25 per cent for refined sugar from 1 July 1989, phasing down to 15 per cent from July 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> Industry was not consulted about the complications and implications of the Government's original proposal and the Opposition successfully moved for a Senate committee to address the problem of structural adjustment with minimum damage and with adequate protection for sugar growers. The Senate committee took a bipartisan approach and produced a solution which proposed a mixture of deregulation and protection with an Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) inquiry in 1991 to determine the arrangements to apply from the following year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate committee's recommendations to move up and down with world prices was not accepted by the Government on the grounds of complications with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations. But the Senate committee's recommendations did provide the basis for an all party agreement on a fixed tariff rate which is acceptable to the sugar industry. It should be noted that other sugar producing countries pay huge subsidies to their producers and the world price of sugar is therefore a corrupted price. Sugar ranks after wheat and cheese, along with citrus concentrate, as the most subsidised corrupt international trade item. </PARA>
<PARA> Studies have shown that sugar prices are the most volatile of prices for commodities traded internationally. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, has acknowledged this and has spoken of the need for what is called shadow pricing to determine the true world price and possibly to introduce special anti-dumping provisions similar to those in place for European cheese. </PARA>
<PARA> With the lifting of the embargo on the importing of sugar, the Government will need to monitor, firstly, the developing country 5 per cent preference on tariffs-these countries are the only significant raw sugar exporters and generally have a developed rather than a developing sugar industry-and, secondly, sugar imports from New Zealand which are tariff free and therefore provide an opportunity for sugar to be dumped into Australia via New Zealand. Concern has already been expressed by an ice cream powder manufacturer in Queensland, who mixes milk powders with sugar for export that his main rival, a New Zealand owned Australian company, is importing milk powders from New Zealand and may now also import the sugar. </PARA>
<PARA> Minister Kerin has promised to establish a sugar industry council and an IAC inquiry will be held in 1991 to establish the future needs of the industry from 1 July 1992. The Opposition does not oppose the phasing down of assistance, but I point out once again that the Government has yet to address the endemic problems on the waterfront and in coastal shipping that add to the burdens of our primary producers and pose a major threat to the Darwin and Perth markets for Australian sugar. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also repeals the Live-Stock Slaughter Export Inspection Charge Act 1979, the amendment Act for 1983, the collection Act for 1979 and the validation Act for 1984. The meat industry moved to a fee for service in respect of Commonwealth meat inspection services from 1 July 1988. The fee for service charging regime comes under the Export Control Act 1982 and has obviated the need for the livestock slaughter inspection charge legislation which related to a per carcass charge. </PARA>
<PARA> The change to a fee for service charging system has not been as smooth as industry and government expected and some meat processors have continued to deduct the $2.50 meat inspection charge from cattle producers account sales. This Bill now prevents that and makes it clear that the inspection charge is a fee for service and not a price per head. The Australian Meat and Live-Stock Corporation Act of 1987 changes to this Act implement agreements which have been negotiated between the Australian Meat and Live-Stock Corporation and shipping companies and remove an inconsistency in the Act which resulted from amendments made in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, on the Wool Marketing Act, the need for these amendments arises from the fraudulent use of wool samples in the wool sale room. Last year a wool broker was found guilty of using wool samples purchased after the sale to represent a further lot. This has led to a re-examination of the security surrounding samples of wool. The purpose of these amendments is to maintain the confidence of wool buyers by ensuring the integrity of wool testing and sampling procedures. Nearly all wool sold at auction is tested for key characteristics which form the basis for a commercial assessment by buyers and payment is also made from the payment of fees in relation to registration and inspection costs. The coalition wishes the Bill a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, for the most part this is a housekeeping Bill which will not be opposed by the Opposition, particularly in the light of the statement that has just been made by the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) and the amendments which the Government now proposes to the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill proposes a range of relatively minor amendments to the Audit Act 1901 and I think it is probably true that those amendments are most easily considered under two heads which relate to the two principal purposes of the Audit Act, namely: first of all, finance amendments which relate to the Minister for Finance and his financial administration of government departments; and secondly, audit amendments which relate to the duties of the Auditor-General and certainly to his audit procedures and to the scope of those audits. </PARA>
<PARA> In effect, the present Bill is a bandaid job on very old legislation; in fact, the Audit Act is one of the oldest Acts of the Parliament, having been enacted first in 1901. I think it is fair to say, as indeed the Public Accounts Committee has recently said, that there is a desperate need to reconsider the viability of the Act in its present form. The report of the Public Accounts Committee to which I have just referred and to which I think one or two of my colleagues will also refer in this debate is report No. 286 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, entitled The Auditor-General, Ally of the People and the Parliament. It has proposed some major changes in the nature of the Audit Act; in fact, it is re-proposed that it be split into two Acts. </PARA>
<PARA> The procedures under which we are operating suggest that I should not take the time of the Senate to elaborate on those points. Moving ahead to what will be the committee stage later: the two amendments which have now been circulated by the Government are derived from amendments which were foreshadowed to the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) by me on behalf of the Opposition. Indeed, one of them, namely, the amendment to clause 26, is a matter on which comment was made by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. In the light of the desire to enact this legislation now, subject to the amendments which the Government has now proposed and which are satisfactory to the Opposition, I will conclude these second reading remarks at this stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will keep my remarks short in the interests of allowing as many people as possible to speak. My concern arises initially out of my membership of the Public Accounts Committee and the concern that I express often about the need for accountability of government expenditure. Our attention on the Public Accounts Committee was first drawn to the implications of the Audit Act, and indeed in particular to clause 26, in the course of our inquiry into the use of consultants by government departments. During that inquiry, one of the exhibits that came our way was a proposal for reform of Commonwealth Government purchasing arising from government review under the financial management improvement program and in particular, in appendix 2 of that document, proposed amendments to the Audit Act, Finance Regulations and Finance Directions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the course of those inquiries we also had cause to question various government department employees concerning how they presently comply with the financial regulations and the manner in which observance is given to regulations that are already in place. It is significant that in the course of one of these hearings we heard evidence from the Australian Taxation Office about hiring a consultant and not complying with the need under the Finance Regulations to go to tender and purporting to rely on the exemption of section 52aa (2) of the Finance Regulations, which gives a list of exempt types of people when there is no need to go to tender. </PARA>
<PARA> On that occasion the Tax Office sought to have a survey conducted of basically the attitude of taxpayers to the Tax Office when their returns were knocked back. Instead of going to tender to find the best survey firm to carry out that survey it chose to rely on appendix A of Finance Regulation 52aa (2) and call these people management consultants. When I asked the witness whether or not the people to whom the contract was given held themselves out as management consultants he replied no. So clearly they did not comply and they did not fall within the exemption of appendix A and the Australian Tax Office was clearly in breach of the laws of the land as they prevail. I then endeavoured to find out what the penalty for this breach was and I found it was a $10 fine. We did refer the matter to the Australian Audit Office, which wrote as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> During the Committee's public hearing on Tuesday 18 April 1989, the question arose as to what types of consultancies services fall within the definition of `Management Consultancy Services' which is listed in Appendix A to the Finance Regulation 52aa (2) as one of the kinds of supplies which is exempt from the requirement to obtain quotations or publicly invited tenders. Specifically, the Committee inquired whether the Australian Audit Office considered consultants engaged in conduct market research surveys would be exempt supplies. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. It is evident that the services similar in nature to market research surveys such as public relations agents and advertising agents and media are listed as exempt supplies. Having regard to the definition of `Consultancy Services' outlined at Finance Direction 25/11 and the types of services listed in Appendix A of Finance Regulation 52aa (2), it is however considered that a strict application of the Regulations, market research surveys, being in the nature of a specialist service, would need to be specifically listed in Appendix A to be an exempt service. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a very long-winded way of saying that the present rules say that, to spend more than $20,000, one really has to go to public tender. This whole operation was to circumvent the need to do that so that the person engaging this surveying firm could make a subjective analysis. My concern and that of my colleagues on the Public Accounts Committee is that the amendment to the Audit Act does not make this situation worse. It is government money we are spending and it is taxpayers' money we are spending. The total amount of money which is spent in procurement of goods and services every year is $8 billion and I reckon that is worthy of some particular scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> So the compromise to which the Government has agreed to require the new guidelines which are pursuant to the document, Proposals for Reform of the Commonwealth Government Purchasing Arising from Government Review under the Financial Management Improvement Program, will indeed require that the new guidelines be tabled and subject to disallowance. I sincerely hope that we see an improved system of public expenditure guidelines and that they are in no way abused. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Audit Amendment Bill. This is a Bill that the Auditor-General would like through the Parliament as quickly as possible so, if I may make a request of the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), I have a few concerns about the amendments that have been put forward to clause 26. I seek an assurance that the guidelines that are to be issued by a Minister pursuant to regulations made under the proposed new section that shall be tabled in the Parliament and may be disallowed by either House will be subject to the Regulations and Ordinances Committee's scrutiny because, if that review were lost I would have difficulty in supporting the particular amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not a regulation as such but it is similar to a regulation, and I think we need an assurance before the passage of this Bill that that second amendment to clause 26 will come within the ambit of the Senate Committee on Regulations and Ordinances review. If that is the case, I will be quite happy.</PARA>
<PARA> The second request of the Minister is that the Government proceed expeditiously to implement the recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in report No. 296, The Reform of the Australian Audit Office, because again we are seeing a bandaid treatment here. I seek the permission of the Minister to incorporate in Hansard some comments that I have in relation to the Audit Office and the Audit Amendment Bill and the need for two separate Acts. I seek the leave of the Senate to incorporate those comments. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The comments read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Audit Amendment Bill</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Senate is debating the Audit Amendment Bill which seeks to make various changes to auditing of Commonwealth bodies and to enhance the powers of the Commonwealth Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Audit Act are essentially to, first, define the role and condition of the Australian Audit Office, and to improve its efficiency; and, secondly, to consider the proper role of the Auditor-General and the accountability of government departments and agencies of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Audit Act is a very old statute dating back to 1901. In fact, the importance of the correct oversight of the public account is indicated by the fact that the Audit Act was the fourth piece of legislation passed by the new Federal Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only have accounting practices, principles, and statutes changed, but the role of the Commonwealth has significantly grown with a proliferation of statutory corporations, utilities, companies and other organisations coming under the public umbrella. </PARA>
<PARA> Most modern statutes covering these activities are in two separate Acts of Parliament-an Audit Act and a Financial Administration Act. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is surprising to discover in this Bill before the Senate that the Audit Amendments contain both administration and audit changes. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore support the second reading amendment of the coalition, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . in view of the archaic nature of the existing Audit Act, consideration be given to repealing it with two separate Acts, one relating to financial administration, the other to the activities of the Australian Audit Office. </PARA>
<PARA>Such an issue has become even more relevant because of the tabling during the last few weeks of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts report entitled-The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament-Reform of the Australian Audit Office. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, reform is well overdue because in recent years we have witnessed a proliferation of `Band Aid Amendments' to meet pressing necessity. In a world of rapid administrative change and the creation of new financial instruments on almost a daily basis, a new flexible Act to meet the needs of the next century is well overdue. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition has realised this and that is why we are putting forward our second reading amendment. I hope that this might press the Government to act. It should, as a matter of priority, adopt the key recommendations in the Public Accounts Committee report on the Australian Audit Office. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that the Government agreed to delay passage of this Bill until the Public Accounts Committee was tabled in each House and I hope that Cabinet will take serious note of our recommendations-especially in regard to a wholly revamped Audit Act and a new Financial Administration Act. </PARA>
<PARA> While I have been actively involved in the preparation of the Audit efficiency report, there are nevertheless still areas of concern which need to be addressed and these lie principally in the area of Financial Administration and activities relating to the Australian Audit Office. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refer to individual clauses in this Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 4</PARA>
<PARA>The amendment to section 21 of the Act which deals with the maintenance of bank accounts bearing the designation Commonwealth Public Account provides some flexibility with the addition of the words `agreements made under section 20' in that the Minister may agree with any bank for the conducting of business in respect of the Commonwealth Public Account. </PARA>
<PARA>The Drawing of Money from the Commonwealth Public Account</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 4 amends section 31 of the principal Act and provides that no money should be drawn from the Commonwealth Public Account except in the manner provided by this Act. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been some doubt in the mind of the Auditor-General arising from the overlap in the wording between sections 20 and 21 dealing with the conducting of banking business and the Commonwealth Public Account. The clause effectively clarifies the position of section 21 to make sure that bank accounts opened under that section are in accordance with agreements entered into under section 20. </PARA>
<PARA> Under proposed clause 7, the Minister for Finance may direct that all of the moneys appropriated for the performance of a particular function by a Commonwealth department may be transferred to another department to use in the same function area. With the proposed amendments the Minister is in a position to manage the funds as required. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that such a change might lead to better accountability to Parliament of the expenditure of public money. However, my concern is with the interpretation of this clause and I seek a clarification from the Minister in charge of the specific effect clause 7 would have. </PARA>
<PARA> In clause 14, which repeals section 54 of the principal Act, some explanation is given of the difference between performance, efficiency and project performance audits. </PARA>
<PARA> It is, of course, essential for audits to be performed in order to scrutinise for inefficiencies in administration and thus improve management practices as in efficiency audits. It is also important to promote efficient use of resources on a large scale or small scale as in project performance audits. The question must still be posed: who is to perform these tasks due to the high numbers of people with proven auditing skills who are leaving the public service for the private sector?</PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, are these tasks then to be tendered out to the private sector and, if so, are the auditing procedures compatible with the procedures already used, an improvement on the standard form of government auditing?</PARA>
<PARA> Who is to be ultimately responsible for the functioning of the department and for the carrying out of recommended improvements, Minister?</PARA>
<PARA> I know from personal discussions with senior personnel in the Australian Audit Office and accountants in private enterprise that the Audit Office is having a great deal of trouble keeping its staff and recruiting new graduates. Honourable senators will know that international accounting firms snap up the cream of new economics and commerce graduates because they can offer lucrative salary and benefits packages, which the Government Audit Office cannot. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a problem not only confined to the Commonwealth Auditor-General, but also is experienced by his state counterparts and by recruitment people in the Department of Finance, the Treasury and the Tax Office. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the answer to attracting and keeping good staff is to review the conditions of work and the salaries and other benefits offered. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition believes it is vital that taxpayers' money is not only spent wisely and on worthwhile projects, but also that it is spent properly and efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 6, in adding the words `shall not knowingly or recklessly cause or permit', softens the previous position which stated that `an officer shall not cause or permit the account to be paid except in accordance with section 34 1(b) and subsequent provision?'</PARA>
<PARA> Proposed clause 24 of the Bill deals with guidelines by Ministers and the proposal for an inclusion of a new section in the Act which will enable the regulations to authorise a Minister to issue guidelines on any matters for which that Minister is responsible (provided they are matters on which regulations may be given). </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague the honourable member for Dundas in the other place on 3 May asked: does this mean the Minister will issue the guidelines and, if so, where is the role of Parliament?</PARA>
<PARA> Anyone reading the Audit Act 1901 will know that accountability was at the forefront of the minds of our first legislative framers. If one turns to the recent report of the PAC, the same principle remains paramount. I am most concerned that the only time that Parliament will have a role is when the regulations are made to give the Minister power to make guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> We ought not to be abrogating further the diminishing accountability of this Parliament and bolstering the already dominant executive. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore ask the Minister in charge, is there to be no accountability between the Minister and Parliament?</PARA>
<PARA> The Joint Committee of Public Accounts recently reprimanded more than half the secretaries of Commonwealth Government Departments for breaching clear guidelines in the preparation of their annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA> Departmental secretaries are required to publish in their annual reports the actions they have taken in response to administrative issues raised by the Auditor-General or parliamentary committees. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of clause 24, how are we as a Parliament supposed to respond to this survey which shows that half of the departmental secretaries have contempt for the guidelines laid down by the Prime Minister?</PARA>
<PARA> It would appear that managers are not accepting responsibility for their departments. Recent revelations about the employment of consultants give further weight to the diminished level of accountability that is being tacitly accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment deals with the role of the Auditor-General, and whether he is to remain the key link in the chain from government enterprises and agencies to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 21, audit of subsidiaries, is extrinsically involved in the projected future role of the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> It is argued that where the Government has an interest in an entity the Australian Audit Office should have a central role. An impression is given of an attempt to retain the mandate of the Auditor-General by the inclusion of 70bb. However, on closer examination the role of the Auditor-General is becoming increasingly redundant. This assumption may have been made by inserting the proposed new section 70bb. The role of the Auditor-General to report on financial statements and inspection of audits of the accounts and records of subsidiaries would in fact be tightened and reinforced. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, it is to be mandatory for subsidiaries to be audited as well as the parent company. The proposed section is to apply to subsidiaries acquired after the commencement of the section but does not disturb any present arrangements for the Auditor-General to audit and report on `relevant' subsidiaries or authorities. This means that a subsidiary cannot unilaterally dismiss the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> How is the last statement to be understood, as when subsidiaries become corporations, incorporated under the Companies Act 1981, the need for the Auditor-General will not be crucial in relation to its operations, as the corporation will no longer be subject to any review by the Auditor-General?</PARA>
<PARA> A corporation, for instance the Snowy Mountain Engineering Corporation, since becoming a public company accountable to its shareholders, will put its auditing to tender and a private sector auditor will be used, and the audit will be conducted according to the relevant companies legislation. The company code sets out the necessary requirements for the appointment of auditors and the form and content of reports to shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA> Where does this then leave the role of the Auditor-General? Quite clearly the Auditor-General's role will be excluded, not enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been envisaged that the Auditor-General will nevertheless carry out both the Audit Act and company legislation requirements concurrently. How will this be so?</PARA>
<PARA> In normal circumstances, it is not expected that an auditor other than the Auditor-General would be appointed to report under the companies legislation. In a sense, in this provision the Auditor-General is seeking to restrict access to outside auditors in relation to subsidiaries that are established in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Considering that, as I have already said, the number of auditors in the government services is dwindling, who then is to assist the Auditor-General to carry out the important task of audits?</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, since there appears to be an increase in the numbers of subsidiaries, statutory bodies and agencies run at arms length to Government departments it will be near to impossible for an audit to be carried out on many of these bodies due to the fact there is not enough personnel to complete the necessary tasks. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue is one of the instrumental elements of the Public Accounts Committee report that will require attention from the Minister and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a major difficulty that will have to be addressed-converting what are in effect standard private sector audit and accounting techniques in a way that would prove useful to meeting the requirements of Parliament and the issue of accountability of public money. </PARA>
<PARA> In the other place, the shadow Treasurer, Dr Hewson, quoted Professor Bob Walker writing in New Accountant. The quote is very apposite and worth repeating here in the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> The interest of Parliament and the normal checks and balance that might be appropriate in the private sector may prove to be insufficient when one is auditing government expenditure or funds allocated through government. When taxpayers funds are involved, the form of accountability to Parliament could be quite different . . . it cautions the profession on the extent to which it has rushed into the idea of public sector auditing . . . little concerns seem to be given to insulating an auditor from pressure. </PARA>
<PARA>One wonders whether the Auditor-General is to have a role as a `watch-dog' over any private sector auditors involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The role of the Auditor-General is further examined in clause 22, indemnity insurance of Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> This raises the question of whether the Auditor-General should be required to take an indemnity insurance so that he is put on an equal footing when competing with private sector auditors. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment is based on legal advice that such indemnity is appropriate although it seems that at present there are no specific circumstances that necessitate this amendment. Actions taken for damages against Auditor-General counterparts overseas have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> The independent status of the Auditor-General calls for a suitable indemnity provision in the legislation such as now proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> Regretfully, this provision is thought necessary because of what has happened in other countries where government auditors have been sued in civil action and so it is right and necessary that our own Auditor-General and his staff are indemnified against such a liability when carrying out their statutory tasks. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be very grateful if the Minister could answer the many questions that I have posed on particular clauses of this Audit Amendment Bill. The coalition does not oppose the Bill but I fervently hope it is the last such piece of legislation we ever see in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> If the recommendations of the PAC report to write wholly new audit and financial administration Acts is adopted by the Government, we will leave these band aid Bills which really only prop up a `horse and buggy' principal Act and bring Australian audit legislation into the modern era. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing my remarks I support the second reading amendment moved by the Opposition and look forward to the Minister's responses to my questions. </PARA>

An amendment is proposed to clause 7 to provide that the Minister may only direct the transfer of funds between parliamentary departments in accordance with the written recommendation of either or both of the presiding officers, as appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment to the Bill is to clause 26. That clause will introduce a new section to the Audit Act to provide that regulations may be made enabling a Minister to issue guidelines on matters for which that Minister has responsibility. It is proposed in these supplementary amendments to provide that such guidelines are disallowable instruments for the purposes of section 46a of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. This will mean that any guideline made pursuant to the regulations will have to be gazetted, tabled in both Houses of the Parliament and is subject to disallowance by either House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fourth nuclear explosion to be conducted by France in 1989 took place on 11 June. It was detected by an Australian seismological centre and had an estimated yield in the range of 40 to 150 kilotonnes. It is Government policy to protest against each test that takes place in French Polynesia. The Government has made its opinion known at the highest levels. A press statement condemning the 11 June test was released two days ago by the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Duffy. Australia also uses other opportunities in the United Nations and at other international meetings to draw attention to the opposition in our region to French nuclear testing in the South Pacific. At a press conference held on 18 May, President Mitterrand said that France would give up nuclear testing if the United States of America, the Soviet Union and Great Britain would do the same. The last bit of information I want to give is that the number of French tests to be conducted this year has been reduced from a previously planned eight to six although, unfortunately, I understand that the fundamental reason is economic.</PARA></TALK.START>

Is it a fact that Austudy payments, some unemployment benefits, the young homeless allowance and the job search allowance are not indexed for inflation, and that the family allowance, the mother's/guardian's allowance and orphan's benefit are indexed only on an annual basis, while age pensions are indexed half-yearly? Is it also the case that the amount of money political parties receive from the public funding of election campaigns is indexed quarterly so that, whether Mr Hawke calls an immediate half Senate election or a double dissolution this year, or a House of Representatives and half Senate election next year, all parties will receive funding which is fully protected against inflation? Will the Minister admit that this shows up a gross double standard in that politicians are protecting their own funding while allowing the living standards of the least well off in our community to fall?

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just go on a bit further for Senator Stone's elucidation. If we go on to the more serious part of the question, which I am sure Senator Powell is addressing rather than the other stuff, I should ask both Senator Powell and the Senate to acknowledge the fact that this Government's approach to income support and social policy is based on a comprehensive, careful, well researched, integrated outlook. It is not a knee-jerk response to particular problems; it encompasses all those problems in a comprehensive way. If one looks at the specifics Senator Powell has raised, the unemployment benefit and the family allowance supplement (FAS) are inflation adjusted. As a result of historic decisions in the April statement, all child related payments will be inflation adjusted as well. We should also take into account the fact that in the April statement we announced that we would bring forward inflation adjustment of pensions by six weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That leaves two other parts of Senator Powell's question-that is, the job search allowance and youth homelessness allowance. As Senator Powell would know after debate in this place yesterday, both the adequacy of these payments and the way that they interlock into a whole range of considerations that we debated yesterday are being given consideration by this Government, not only in response to the Burdekin report but also in response to a working group report presented to the State and Federal welfare Ministers yesterday. At the end of the day we on this side of the chamber have a comprehensive wholesale policy assessment which has been going on for quite a period. Just to stress the point, I think I should repeat one of the points I made yesterday. In 1986 Senator Powell recommended that we should simply index family payments. There was no attempt at that stage to examine their structure or attempt to develop a broader and more comprehensive outlook in terms of family packages. If we had taken that advice-and I will close on this point-and simply indexed payments in 1986, child payments would have been $26.34 a week to- day. Under our Government they now stand at $43.10 for older children and $33 for younger children. As I said at the start of my answer, not only Senator Powell but some other honourable senators should not come into this place with questions born out of that sort of cynical hypocrisy.</PARA>

Is it also a fact that if an Australian company or individual were to take over an overseas holding company which controls property in Australia through its local subsidiaries, the transfer of ownership would attract stamp duty of up to 5.5 per cent? Does this mean-and I think it does-that, where Australian land is owned by a foreign company, it will be cheaper for another foreign company to acquire the land by acquiring the shares of that foreign company than it would be for an Australian individual or company to acquire the land in the same or any other way-in other words, that there is a cost disadvantage to an Australian purchaser in those circumstances? Does the Minister agree that this poses a considerable disadvantage to Australians wishing to repurchase Australian real estate at a time when there is considerable community concern about the growing level of overseas ownership in this area?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Buschmann was deported on Sunday, 11 June, after he had appealed unsuccessfully to the Federal Court of Australia. The reasons for Mr Buschmann's deportation were to do with false statements on his visa application and not activities in which he is alleged to have engaged in Chile. Prior to Mr Buschmann's deportation action being commenced, he and his supporters were counselled that the best course of action for him would be to depart voluntarily. He did not accept that counselling. As Mr Buschmann, in discussions about the manner of his deportation, had expressed concerns about his personal safety, he was offered a choice of flights back to Sweden. He decided to return to Sweden via Tokyo and Amsterdam. We have now received advice that that flight landed at Anchorage and that Mr Buschmann and his Australian resident travelling companion were detained by US authorities. At this point of time it is unclear on what basis they were detained. The Government has instructed our embassy in Washington to raise these matters with the United States Administration. The Government had made representations to the US at senior levels expressing the view that the Australian deportation of Buschmann, taken after legal proceedings in Australian courts, should not be interfered with and that he should be allowed to continue his journey to Sweden, where he has resident status.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Does he agree with one of the principal conclusions of the report of the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) on non-tax charges that the Government's administrative reforms of various government business enterprises to date do not address what, in the Commission's view, is `the single most important factor underlying inefficiency in public enterprises' and that is `the absence of effective competition'? When will the Government discard its practice of making only minor changes to the regulatory environment of public enterprises, especially in telecommunications, rather than commit itself to wholesale and effective competition to increase efficiency and competitiveness as proposed by the IAC? Further, what does the Government propose to do in the light of the conclusion of the report that `the wide-ranging concerns expressed by industry to the inquiry suggest that it would be appropriate for government to consider instigating a separate inquiry, or program of inquiries, on aspects of regulation compliance costs'?</PARA></TALK.START>

I have not seen the IAC report and, therefore, I am not very well placed to make comments about its recommendations. I noted Senator Messner's reference to the absence of effective competition in publicly owned business enterprises. Prima facie, that must be taken to be correct.

I have organised to meet with them on site during July to take those discussions further. I point out that whatever sediment has escaped from Coronation Hill into the surrounding environment would be a pretty small percentage of the total sediment load that is expected in those streams during the wet season. It is a matter of concern if mining is to proceed. I have raised the matter and I intend to pursue it further. In terms of the environmental conditions that apply, obviously the Government would require rehabilitation of what work has occurred at Coronation Hill in the event of a decision not to allow mining to proceed, but if a decision is taken to allow it to proceed, clearly the Commonwealth will demand a full rehabilitation of the site at the end of its mining life.</PARA>

As other royal commissioners are being paid between $100,000 and $300,000 per annum each, what remuneration will be paid to Mr Dodson and on what basis was the remuneration determined for each of his three government jobs?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Pat Dodson has been appointed as an additional commissioner to inquire into Aboriginal deaths in custody. I believe that that distinguished Australian will bring much to the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Deaths in Custody particularly as it examines the underlying issues relating to deaths in custody that have occurred in Western Australia. Indeed, his appointment follows agreement between the Western Australian Government and the Federal Government to make that appointment. Before I answer the more technical parts of Senator Tambling's question, I say that I am delighted that Mr Dodson has been able to accept this appointment. It will be at the expense of his giving up some of those tasks and appointments which he presently holds. I will detail those in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a full-time royal commissioner, Mr Dodson will be paid an annual salary of $100,924 as determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. Whilst I do not have the report in front of me, I recollect that Senate Estimates Committee E recommended that in the case of royal commissioners-and I think it had in mind royal commissioners in relation to the Aboriginal deaths in custody inquiry-remuneration ought to be determined by the Tribunal. That is what has been done in this particular case. Senator Tambling should know that as Deputy Chairman of the Aboriginal Development Commission Mr Dodson is not and has not ever been paid any remuneration. However, when attending commission meetings Mr Dodson's air fares and expenses are met. Mr Dodson has informed the ADC Board of his retirement on 30 June 1989. So he will be retiring at the end of this financial year. Mr Dodson had set an original retirement date, when we were talking with him earlier, of 31 July 1989 as Director of the Central Land Council. On 28 June at a full meeting of the Central Land Council Mr Dodson will formally advise of his appointment to the Royal Commission and will retire from that position on 8 July 1989. As Director of the Central Land Council Mr Dodson is paid a salary which is equivalent to the senior executive service level 1 of the Australian Public Service plus a district allowance.</PARA>
<PARA> From the date of his appointment as a royal commissioner-that is from 1 July 1989 until 31 July 1989-Mr Dodson will be a part-time royal commissioner and will commence full time from 1 August 1989. It is not unusual for part-time royal commissioners to be appointed. During that period he will get a daily sitting fee related only to performing duties as a royal commissioner on those days.</PARA>
<PARA> As to other staff, I do not think that has been finally determined. Pat Dodson, I think, was to retire in any case from his position on the Central Land Council to return to Broome where I think he is the senior member of his tribe. I forget the exact title one gives to a senior member of the Yaoro Aboriginal tribe. He will be returning to Broome, which will be his headquarters for the conduct of this inquiry in Western Australia. The staff assistance support he will have has not yet been determined.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tambling reveals his bias in asking this question by talking of the so-called underlying causes. I do not think there can be any doubt in the minds and hearts of all honourable senators that there are indeed underlying causes for the deaths in custody which have occurred. It has been revealed in some of the reports that have already been put down by the existing commissioners and the retiring national Royal Commissioner. There are underlying causes relating to the deaths in custody of Aboriginal persons, as there would be for the deaths in custody of non-Aboriginal Australians. Honourable senators will be aware, for example, that the death rate of Aboriginals in custody has been shown by a royal commission examination of statistics to be about the same as those for non-Aboriginal deaths in custody. That is why in the statement made by the new national Commissioner Johnson and by me a month or so ago in relation to the refocusing of the Royal Commission much was made of the need to concentrate on the incarceration rate, the detention rate, of Aboriginals which is way beyond that experienced by the non-Aboriginal population of Australia. If one is an Aboriginal, one is 20 times more likely to find oneself detained in some form of custody than if one is a non-Aboriginal Australian. That is one of the underlying matters which have to be addressed. So there are true underlying matters that have to be looked at.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe Mr Dodson brings an experience, a capacity, and an understanding, which is, nevertheless, not of a biased character, to this inquiry. He will come, as I said, with an experience which is not available to other members of the Royal Commission.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to express a view on the dispute other than to say that the disputing parties should, as expeditiously as possible, settle their differences so that production can recommence normally in Bass Strait. I do not think it is appropriate for me to express a view about the rights and wrongs internal to the dispute other than to say that the processes of dispute settlement should be followed and that the dispute should be settled as rapidly as possible because it affects the strategic supply of petroleum to Australia. About six out of 10 motor vehicles are fuelled by oil that comes from Bass Strait.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The article which appeared in this morning's Age and which was referred to by Senator Beahan goes much further than talking about our reliance on the Bass Strait oil production and what the effects would be were Bass Strait to be shut down. It is an article which quotes extensively the Chief Executive of Esso Australia, Dr John Schubert. Once again we get a rerun of the old argument that the level of taxation imposed in the form of excise on the production of crude oil out of Bass Strait is somehow negatively affecting the exploration effort in Australia to find more oil and to meet our needs into the next century. It is an old and tired argument, an argument that is trotted out on every occasion. It is an exploitation of the industrial relations situation to use an industrial dispute to give that argument a further run. As I have said many times, the exploration effort in Australia is determined by three things. The first is: what are our prospects of finding oil? The second is: what is the price of oil on the world market? The third is: what are the costs of extraction including the costs of tax?</PARA>
<PARA> The best gauge of prospectivity is the number of wells that are drilled in the search for oil around Australia and the level of exploration, off-shore in particular. Notably on the North West Shelf and in the Timor Sea there is a very high level indeed. It is comparable with past years. Certainly, in terms of prospectivity, an effort is being made to find more oil. Whether it is there is another matter, but certainly the effort is going into finding more oil. In terms of prospectivity, the Government expects, by the end of this year, to have completed negotiations with the Indonesian Government about a zone of cooperation in the Timor Sea. That zone is held to be highly prospective. When we do that, we expect exploration and, hopefully, oil strikes in that area.</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the international price of oil, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries has been meeting over the last week. It has agreed to put more production onstream and thus one would expect that the price of oil would fall a little. Indeed, it has gone down one or two points. The price of a barrel of oil on the world market, if one takes all of the spot market indicators, seems to be firming between around $18 and $22. I think that is a sufficient incentive for further exploration effort. This Government has indicated also that we will be reviewing the excise arrangements on Bass Strait. That review is now under way. I expect that review to be completed and any legislative change that may arise from the completion of the review to be in place to operate from 1 July next year.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by tabling two documents. The first is the Australian Bureau of Statistics petroleum exploration expenditure for 1981-82 to 1988, the source of which is the actual and expected mineral exploration in Australia in December 1988. The second derives from the financial accounts of Esso Australia. The summary of these two tables is that the amount being spent is lower now than it was in 1981-82, but it is still a very healthy $495m per annum in terms of exploration. The profits going to Esso which have been returned as dividends to shareholders and not spent in exploration have increased dramatically. In fact, in 1988 the net profits after tax and profits in the hands of shareholders were $368m. It is clear on this point that a healthy profit is being made out of Bass Strait production. If Esso is true to the point that it needs incentives for more exploration, it can divert some of its profit to searching for more oil; there is no need for a reduction in the excise rate.</PARA>

It examined 21 recent defensive ESOPs-that is, employee share ownership plans. According to the Financial Review report, they arrived at the conclusion mentioned by Senator Crowley, that is, that they depress share prices by an average of just over 5 per cent. I am not aware of any similar broad ranging studies having been conducted in Australia. There are a number of facts which suggest that the position is similar.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For example, Mr Elliott has been engaged in recent manoeuvres to try to consolidate control of Harlin Pty Ltd over Elders-IXL Ltd. In the Australian of 8 June, Richard Gluyas-I am not sure how that name is pronounced; a wheat variety was once named that after the farmer who had selected it in South Australia-reported Mr Elliott's explanation of these manoeuvres:</PARA>
<PARA> Concern has also been expressed that Harlin has effectively taken over Elders without a formal takeover offer . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> But Mr Elliott rejects this interpretation saying people are `missing the point' of Harlin.</PARA>
<PARA> Harlin has two purposes . . . It serves as an executive incentive scheme and quite a good one at that, for certain Elders executives, and as a protection against the partial takeover of Elders.</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat: `as a protection against the partial takeover of Elders'. In other words, Mr Elliott was stating that Harlin is the vehicle for a defensive ESOP. The difference from a normal ESOP is that Mr Elliott and a few of his executives get to enjoy the benefits of participation at the expense of all the other shareholders, as I have pointed out before. Finally, it should be noted that, in the four weeks since Mr Elliott announced this latest manoeuvre, the price of Elders shares has fallen by 7 per cent, although not too much weight should necessarily be attached to that, because there has been a fall in share prices in general.</PARA>

On that occasion the Federal Court granted control of that portion of the sea out to the three-mile zone to the separate States. What form did the hand-over take? Was it legislated or merely by agreement? Did the hand-over refer to the seabed only and not to the water above the seabed? For either or both of these reasons is the Commonwealth not fully able to legislate to protect the marine environment anywhere below the low water mark, for example, to control sewage discharged to the sea from metropolitan Sydney?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I have traversed some of this ground-or water-with Senator Coulter before. The hand-over of powers to which Senator Coulter refers was both by legislation and by agreement. At the June 1979 Premiers Conference the Commonwealth and the States developed a constitutional agreement regarding the three-mile zone which gave the States jurisdiction. There was an exchange of letters. I think I referred to that exchange of letters when Senator Coulter last asked a similar question. In addition, the Fraser Government introduced the Coastal Waters (State Title) Act 1980 and the Coastal Waters (State Powers) Act 1980 which gave power to the States over those territorial waters. It further amended the Seas and Submerged Lands Act to ensure that there was conformity with existing laws. This legislation vested in each State proprietary rights and title in respect of the seabed of the adjacent territorial sea. However, the Commonwealth legislation reserves the Commonwealth's right to use the seabed for some national purposes such as defence, navigational aids, et cetera.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The answer to Senator Coulter's second question is that the hand-over referred to both the seabed and the waters above the sea. In answer to his third question I inform him that, while it would be possible to overturn those agreements and the legislation that I have just referred to, the Commonwealth has no plans to do either. This Government has not been in the habit of abrogating agreements, particularly when they are of such constitutional importance as this one. I would be concerned about our doing so. Senator Coulter referred to the issue of Sydney sewage. He has certainly referred to that issue here before. I reaffirm what I said the last time, which is that we cannot use the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act as it stands to control that problem. I do not believe that we will achieve much by continually going over the same ground.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not say yes, as Senator Stone suggests. I will say that the Government has welcomed the inquiry for a number of reasons. It should be noted that, even though for five years or so the PSA has had a role in both monitoring and setting maximum wholesale prices in this industry, a public inquiry has not been held by the PSA since 1984. Since then there have been a number of changes in the industry. The industry has been deregulated and we have had new pricing regimes, new pricing policies and so on. Recently petrol prices have been volatile, which the Government has been sensitive to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In welcoming the inquiry we have been sensitive to the fact that world crude oil and petrol prices have been rising. We are also cognisant of the fact that this country has the fourth lowest retail petrol prices of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. A number of issues are very much to the forefront of the PSA's decision in this area. Those issues are well known to the Government. I, for instance, have had strenuous representations made to me from the honourable member for Grey, Lloyd O'Neil, and the honourable member for the Northern Territory, Warren Snowdon. They are concerned about the lack of adequate competition in the industry, especially among retail outlets in their two electorates. As a consequence the PSA will give due consideration to that aspect of pricing. I have also had representations from the oil companies. Given the changes over the last five years, they have asked the PSA to consider a more transparent pricing formula. These two aspects of concern to the community will be adequately addressed by the PSA.</PARA>
<PARA> What we are talking about is the first Prices Surveillance Authority inquiry into this industry for five years. The Government sees it as an opportune and timely inquiry which will give both consumers and industry a chance to look at and have a say in the national petrol pricing regime.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Wednesday, 14 June, Senator Panizza asked me a question about the diesel fuel rebate scheme. I answered a portion of that question, but I am now able to provide a further answer. The questionnaire referred to by Senator Panizza is an important instrument often used in the auditing process. It is a simple and relatively short document to complete, and its main purpose is to gather the necessary additional information about a claimant's operations to assist the Australian Customs Service in the examination of claims. The answer is fairly technical and somewhat long, and will be of interest to Senator Panizza but perhaps not to other senators. I seek leave for the remainder of the answer to be incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The information read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Each claim is registered and entered in the Customs computer system on receipt. Claims which meet certain preset profiles are selected for further auditing. Claims may also be selected as a result of previous risk rating or even randomly. Generally speaking, only a relatively small proportion of claims is selected.</PARA>
<PARA> To enable a selected claim to be processed further, a questionnaire is forwarded to the claimant. Without the questionnaire being answered, it is not possible to complete the auditing process and to pay the rebate. The sooner a claimant returns the questionnaire, the sooner his claim is processed.</PARA>
<PARA> The Senator asked whether the questionnaire can be sent between claims thus preventing any delay in payment. I should point out that, unless a claim is lodged and selected for auditing, there is no reason to go to a claimant for further information. I should further point out that a selected claimant is asked to complete the questionnaire only once unless his operation has changed substantially.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's objective is to pay a rebate claim within three weeks of receipt. Of course, claims which have been selected for auditing would take longer but no longer than absolutely necessary.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Customs Service has the duty to ensure payment of the correct amount of rebates. Accordingly, a claim cannot be paid unless the Customs Service is satisfied that it is eligible for rebate.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Panizza also asked whether I can give him an estimate of the amount of diesel fuel rebate that is never claimed. The short answer is `no'. Only off road users falling within prescribed categories such as mining operations, primary production, residential premises etc. are eligible. It is up to users to decide whether they are eligible under the legislation. Therefore, if diesel users do not claim for whatever reason, the Customs Service would not know of their existence.</PARA>

The Commonwealth is undertaking a program of land releases for housing development. Minister West's 7 June 1989 statement details the whole program and specifically refers to the proviso that environmental conditions shall be met.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This program is being developed in close consultation between officers of the Australian property group and my Department. The important point is that the Minister for Administrative Services and his Department have the primary responsibility for identifying environmental significance and ensuring that environmental factors are taken into account. Formal arrangements exist between our respective departments to trigger when appropriate the processes of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act and the Australian Heritage Commission Act.</PARA>
<PARA> In his most recent correspondence with the Premier of Western Australia, the Hon. Peter Dowding, on progress with the proposed land releases, Mr West stipulated that specific land releases would be conditional upon environmental issues being resolved. These processes are securely based on cooperation between Commonwealth and State authorities. I am informed that, with respect to the Bushmead land in the Helena Valley east of Perth, environmental investigations are well under way.</PARA>
<PARA> Vegetation and wildlife surveys are under way to establish the nature of any jarrah and redgum stands and of wildlife habitats. An ethnographic survey of potential sites is also under way. Once those surveys are completed the Minister for Administrative Services will assess whether the proposed release of land is environmentally significant. If he does, then the Australian Property Group would refer the disposal of the property to my Department for formal assessment under the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth is clearly concerned that the environmental implications of this overall program will be properly considered. There are no doubt areas of potential environmental sensitivity. The extent to which the statutory processes for environmental impact assessment need to be applied will be determined in the circumstances of each proposed land release.

<PARA>The statement from the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) varies a little from his previous statement when he said that he would either come in here and demand an apology from me or he would apologise himself. This is a complete backoff. The Minister is now playing for time. I pointed out very clearly in my statement of 26 May that an assessment was given to a company that could have paid up to $5m less in royalty payments to the Commonwealth. The Minister then came in here and said that that was rubbish. He said that the particular firm was a bigger company and, therefore, should have got the contract. He said that the rehabilitation was better, so it should have got the contract. He ran through a whole series of reasons why the particular company should have got the contract. He comes in here today and says that he is not quite sure and needs another week. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Richardson can give it but he has to take it also. He cannot be like the collie dog. He can give it, but he cannot take it. On 26 May, which is almost a month ago, I made very serious charges that the Commonwealth had given an assessment to mine Christmas Island to a company that could have paid up to $5m less in royalties. Today, Senator Richardson comes in here and has the audacity to say, `Well, we are not really quite sure whether we did make a mistake'. He came in here on 26 May like a raging lion and he is now like a puppy dog. He was going to demand an apology and have me grovelling. The boot is now on the other foot, because the Minister has not met his deadline. There is still a very serious cloud hanging over his Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the Minister has misled, although not willingly, the Parliament on three or four occasions. I do not believe that it is the Minister's fault. He is being snowed by his Department. It has got him by the nose and is leading him around. He has played for time. The Minister knows that we are in the dying stages of this Parliament and that the Senate will rise tomorrow. The Minister has tried to bat out and play for time. I point out to him that there are a number of islanders waiting for some job opportunities to be created over on Christmas Island so that they can have some decent standard of living other than living on the dole. The Minister is not getting down to the issues here. </PARA>
<PARA> Three people were contracted to get the assessment for this mine. That was three or four months ago. I point out again that the Federal Court said about the assessment that it was political and was not conducted in the proper terms. That was an assessment made by a Federal Court judge. That is a very serious criticism of the Minister's Department. Yet he has not been able to find out what has happened in the last three months. Senator Richardson should take a little more care in administering his Department. I know that Christmas Island does not mean a great deal to him and that he is right into the environmental issues, but Australian citizens are over there wanting some sort of management of the Department that is administering their lives. The Minister is not giving it to them and should be condemned. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr President, we wrote to you seeking to bring on a matter of public importance relating to the crisis in China and the Government's response to that crisis. We did so aware of the mountain of business that is before the Senate. However, we were appalled by the fact that it seemed that the Government was going to go from this session of the Parliament without having put down a statement on China or give its response to the position in China and without having given the Senate the opportunity to debate that statement. As matters have developed today, apparently it was decided in the House of Representatives-and we are pleased that this occurred-that a resolution would be moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and that there would be an opportunity for the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) to respond.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Leader of the Opposition has responded to that motion and put down the position of the Opposition, and in view of the vast quantity of work that still remains to be done in this chamber, on consideration we have, somewhat a little reluctantly I might say, decided that it would be in the best interests of business in this place if we withdrew our letter. But I would not want it to be thought in any way that by withdrawing it we do not regard the debate on China or the seriousness of Australia's response as serious. As I sit down, I only say that I wish that Australia had responded in a way such as Canada has responded and put some real input behind the sentiments that it has been expressing. I withdraw the letter I have written to you, Mr President, and do not pursue the China debate today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to speak very briefly on the matter. First of all I thank you, Mr President, for the action which you took in December, through the Clerks, to obtain advice on this matter which touches in a very serious way on the powers of the Senate and of control by the legislature of subordinate legislation. Honourable senators will remember that it was the Senate which disallowed three orders which were made relating to export control and the non-provision of services by the Commonwealth which were necessary to ensure that goods could be exported. This was a matter of high political importance because you will recall, Mr President, that in the Mudginberri dispute, which was a landmark in industrial relations in this country some years ago, there was considerable criticism of the Commonwealth for the failure to provide essential inspection services, which added to industrial difficulties faced by that company. </PARA>
<PARA> In the dispute at Portland we had a repeat of that exercise, albeit in a slightly different form. It raises very important principles of industrial relations as to whether the Commonwealth, through its bodies, should use its compulsory requirements to augment industrial disputes which may be very destructive of individual enterprises and of the Australian economy. The technical point taken by the Government was that the disallowance by the Senate of certain regulations was not valid. It is a matter of regret to the Opposition that we had what I can only describe as a spineless legal opinion from the Attorney-General's Department which suggested that the disallowance by the Senate was not valid. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a court of law and this is neither the time nor the place to deal with the technicalities of the matter. But I want to put on the public record the fact that I describe the legal opinion as spineless because I believe that the Attorney-General's Department should have tried to find an interpretation which protected the right of the legislature to control subordinate legislation. The point is made in the tabled judgment that we have a situation where we are dealing with unicameral legislation-legislation which has come not through this Parliament but from the Executive Government. The control of that type of legislation is vested in this Parliament through the Acts Interpretation Act by giving the Parliament a power of disallowance. The opinion of the Attorney-General's Department reads down that power of disallowance to restrict us to having a power to disallow effectively whole batches of regulations. The Senate had picked out three particular orders that it regarded as offensive and had disallowed them. The opinion of the Attorney-General's Department said that the Senate had to disallow all or nothing. That is a very significant reading down of the Senate's power and of the power of this Parliament to control subordinate legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> For those who think this is a somewhat obscure matter, let me say that this is a very old struggle. It was in the 1920s that Lord Hewart wrote a book called The New Despotism. It is an English text of 70 years ago which makes the point that the capacity of the Executive Government to make laws by regulation without the control of Parliament gave a power which was despotic to the Executive Government; that is, a power which could be used to threaten the liberties of the people. One of the best contributions of this Senate to good government in Australia is the work of both the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances-I am pleased that the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of that body are present for this debate-and of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills which runs the rule over all legislation, not just subordinate legislation, and reports to the Senate whether it unduly trespasses on individual rights and liberties. There is bipartisan support and respect for the work of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. Senator Collins frequently seeks leave to make statements and to present reports. It is the unfailing tradition of the Senate to give him leave. Both Senator Collins and Senator Bishop, who currently is Deputy Chairman of that Committee, in common with all other senators, would say that it is a very valuable contribution to good government. It is not a political contribution; it is a contribution to try to ensure that we have good legislation in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that any lawyer with an understanding of the role of Parliament in ensuring that we maintain a free society would have bent over backwards to find an interpretation of a law which gave this Senate and the House of Representatives maximum flexibility in disallowing regulations which do not go through this Parliament. When I read the opinion of the Attorney-General's Department when it was delivered last December, I was surprised because I thought it was a very poor piece of work. I was even more surprised that it came out with entirely the wrong conclusion. Any lawyer would have realised that what one should have been seeking was an interpretation of the law which gave the Parliament the maximum power to disallow. The Attorney-General's Department needs to examine this opinion very carefully and to consider the principles that are at stake, and to examine how it came to give such a poor opinion. </PARA>
<PARA> We rely very heavily upon the Public Service in this place. We require good independent advice if we are to do our job well. Through the opportunity we have in debate in this place, I say to the Attorney-General's Department that I think its reputation has slipped. Through this and a number of other opinions that we have been given we have reached a situation where many senators pay little regard to an opinion from that Department. I say that with great regret because I have worked with officers of that Department and I have had great respect for many of them. I think of Mr Andy Menzies, who has continued to serve the Government in various capacities since he left the Department. There are many others for whom I have the greatest respect. I do not believe the Department is maintaining the standard that we expect of it. This opinion is a particularly poor example of its work. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that of the Department's opinion, it would be quite unfair not to refer to the opinion which was also delivered to us on 16 December and dated 15 December from Gavan Griffith, QC, the Solicitor- General of the Commonwealth. The Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth holds a peculiarly important position. He is the counsel to the Commonwealth; he is the source of continuous independent advice, beyond the Department. It is a position of great significance. The Solicitor-General should look very carefully at the opinion that he so cheerfully endorsed with his opinion of 15 December-the opinion of the Attorney-General's Department. In this opinion he confirms his:</PARA>
<PARA>oral advice of 13 December 1988 that, having perused the Opinion of the Attorney-General's Department dated 5 August 1987 concerning the effect of resolution for the disallowance of Orders 100C, 100D and 111A of the Prescribed Goods (General) Orders passed by the Senate 1 May 1986, I concur with the conclusions expressed in that Opinion that the resolutions were ineffective and that the Orders remain in effect. </PARA>
<PARA>It is extraordinary that this highly qualified and skilled law officer should not have seen what a poor opinion this was and how wrong it was. First of all in a preliminary way, but now in the orders in the judgment of Mr Justice Jenkinson that has been tabled today, the Federal Court of Australia, which dealt with this, indicates that the view that we expressed in December is the view that the court has sustained. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cooney should know that one of the lesser virtues of the law is its speed in dealing with issues. All of us who have been lawyers have grounds for embarrassment in that regard. I do not think Senator Cooney would place any significance on a six-month period, although I agree with him that it is an issue. In fairness to the court, one has to remember that the court was dealing with a series of issues and could not have been expected just to toss up an opinion in a way that a lawyer is able to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason I wanted to speak on this matter is that it is common ground in this chamber that the capacity of the Senate to disallow is a significant power which all parties have used in a proper way. I cannot pretend that there have never been mistakes. But there has been strong bipartisan support for that power. In December we saw the Government take advantage of a situation that was patently wrong. It is perhaps important to remember that in the debates at that time there were two separate issues. Firstly, there was the issue of whether Minister Cook should have acted in the way he did-a quite separate political issue-as a party to depriving the meatworks of essential Commonwealth services. He was clearly wrong in doing that. Secondly, the Commonwealth Government was prepared to rely on an opinion which was obviously wrong but which, if it had been right, it should have been anxious to see corrected. Clearly, it was a writing down of this important role of the Senate and of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the fact that the President has brought this material into the Senate. It is of importance to us. All honourable senators will appreciate the fact that he, through the Clerks, acted to try to seek clarification-and obtained a speedy correction-of that obviously fallacious opinion by going to Professor Whalan of the Australian National University, who in an opinion which was given to us before Christmas last year made it clear that he also thought the Attorney-General's Department was wrong. Quite frankly, I just hope that the Attorney- General's Department will smarten up its act and lift the standard of care which goes into the preparation of these matters. These are vitally important to the nation. If the Attorney-General's Department cannot do a good job in this area, we will have a lesser standard of government administration at every level. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>The report deals with the operations of the Committee in 1987-88 and includes statistical data and analytical discussion of the technical scrutiny undertaken by the Committee. As with previous reports, it represents a manual or set of guidelines for Ministers and their advisers on how the Committee approaches the application of its principles. I urge Ministers, and in particular their advisers, to read the report carefully as it may guide them away from some of the pitfalls in preparing delegated legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Briefly, I would like to add something that I pointed out to the Committee at its meeting this morning and that is highlighted by this report: the work of the Committee is increasing, not surprisingly. The number of instruments that are being prepared in terms of delegated legislation is continually increasing. But, despite that, the interesting thing-I am sure some honourable senators have noticed it-is that there has been a very measurable decrease in the number of protective notices that have been moved. In other words, what we thought was perhaps a temporary aberration is in fact a very welcome substantial improvement in the quality of the drafting of the regulations in accordance with the Committee's principles, which has led to a distinct falling off in the number of protective notices that have had to be issued in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my tabling speech in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>STATEMENT ON TABLING OF REPORT</PARA>
<PARA>This Report deals with the work of the Committee from July 1987 to June 1988. The Report sets out the basic statistics of the operations of the Committee over that period; in particular the numbers and types of instruments examined and the number of Ministerial undertakings obtained and implemented in respect of concerns raised by the Committee. Perhaps more importantly, however, it describes how the Committee has interpreted the principles under which it operates and how it applies those principles to the protection of personal liberties and parliamentary proprieties. These are set out in some detail and with various examples. </PARA>
<PARA> The reasons for this approach are, firstly, to inform the Senate of the work of the Committee. All delegated legislation is, of course, made under the direct authority of Acts of the legislature, and its legal effect upon individuals is in no way less than that of Acts. A heavy duty rests upon the Committee, therefore, to represent those interests with which the legislature is so closely associated; to act as an agent for the Senate in scrutinising delegated legislation for breaches of individual rights or legislative prerogatives. I hope that the Committee continues to carry out this duty as effectively as it can. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important reason for this approach is because the Report should be used as a manual or check list by officers in departments and statutory authorities who advise on and draft delegated legislation. I dealt with this at length last year when presenting the previous annual report of the Committee. I now repeat my strong recommendation that every Minister takes all appropriate steps to ensure that senior departmental officers apply the principles noted in the Report when preparing delegated legislation for consideration by the Minister. It is a test of managerial efficiency for these senior officers to place before the Minister drafts of delegated legislation which comply with the published standards of the Committee. These standards should be well known; not only are they set out in consolidations such as the present report, but the Committee also regularly tables or incorporates in Hansard descriptions of its scrutiny work throughout sittings along with all correspondence in relation to the more important matters which it raises. This is done at the same time as the Committee finalises its consideration of a matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Report also deals at length with procedural difficulties the Committee meets in its operations. An entire Chapter of the Report discusses the requirements for proper Explanatory Statements. Other parts of the Report address delay in implementing undertakings and the necessity for departmental officers to be familiar with the standards of the Committee. These discussions of the difficulties of the Committee are intended as constructive assistance to departmental officials in achieving the standards set by the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also seek leave to incorporate the usual Chairman's statement about the work of the Committee during the present sittings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>STATEMENT ON WORK OF COMMITTEE DURING AUTUMN SITTINGS</PARA>
<PARA>Over the past sittings the work of the Committee has been characterised by two main features. </PARA>
<PARA> The first of these is the continued high volumes of delegated legislation which has come before the Committee for scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> The number and types of instrument confirm the continued reliance of the executive on delegated legislation as a standard mechanism to facilitate day to day Commonwealth public administration. As such the work of the Committee is doubly valuable to the Parliament in both scrutinising the results of the law-making power which it has delegated and in supervising the actions of the executive itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the volume of delegated legislation suggests that directives and instructions of the executive which previously may have been confined to the corridors of power in the different departments of state, are now subject to parliamentary scrutiny. The role of the Parliament in the oversight of the administration of its Acts is thereby strengthened. The domain of Ministers and their senior departmental advisers has been subjected to the fresh air of tabling and the brisk wind of possible disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA> This tendency is only welcome, however, as long as the delegated legislation is justified in terms of filling-in administrative details, prescribing lengthy objective technical standards or providing for situations where frequent minor changes are necessary to schemes or programs. The instruments themselves must also, of course, comply with the Committee's standards of personal liberties and parliamentary propriety. In this context of the proper use of delegated legislation the Committee has detected some disturbing tendencies, which will be discussed in detail later in this statement. In the meantime, the attention of Honourable Senators is drawn to the following table, which describes the various instruments actually considered by the Committee during the present sittings. The list covers the entire sweep of Commonwealth administration, with delegated legislation made on the advice of virtually every department of state and important statutory authority. Honourable Senators are reminded that, for example, the Statutory Rules alone, which are the most numerous single type of instrument considered, and which come under a single item in the list, are made on advice from almost every executive portfolio. Some of the instruments in the Table were made late in 1988 but not considered until the Autumn Sittings 1989. </PARA>

<PARA> The second important characteristic of the legislation examined by the Committee in the past sittings was the tendency for instruments to contain various provisions dealing with rights, appeals and tabling, which have been recommended by the Committee during the course of scrutiny of instruments during previous periods. </PARA>
<PARA> This trend follows the statement by the Committee at the conclusion of the last sittings, which encouraged Ministers and advisers to pursue a qualitative improvement in those aspects of delegated legislation of concern to the Committee, particularly in relation to personal rights and liberties. It is not possible to say whether this will continue, particularly as the standards of the Committee are not static but are continually expanded and refined, but at present it is an important justification for the past efforts and initiatives of the Committee. The Committee is pleased with the co-operation it has received and continues to receive from Ministers and officials. </PARA>
<PARA> The reasons for this may be that the Committee's efforts to set high standards for delegated law making have resulted in the acceptance of such standards by competent administrators and drafters. The goal of the Committee's advocacy of civil liberties and parliamentary proprieties is to see its principles incorporated into the mainstream of administrative practice and this is an on-going process. </PARA>
<PARA> All of the protective notices of motion given by the Committee were satisfactorily resolved and none are now before the Senate on behalf of the Committee. The Committee has, however, continued its traditional very active level of activity. At present there are some three dozen items on the Committee's Agenda, ranging from typographical errors to questions of broad principle. </PARA>
<PARA> It is usual in these statements to include a list of undertakings given by Ministers to amend legislation to meet the concerns of the Committee. The following list of those undertakings during the present sittings is particularly interesting in that only 4 protective notices of motion of disallowance were necessary during the sittings in respect of the entire agenda of the Committee. It is an indication of the helpful attitude of Ministers that these matters have been finalised promptly and with such procedural informality. </PARA>
<PARA>TABLE 2</PARA>
<PARA>In applying its scrutiny principles to delegated legislation, the Committee considered a range of matters and obtained a variety of Ministerial undertakings which included the following. Some of these were in respect of concerns raised in the previous sittings but where undertakings were not accepted by the Committee until the present sittings. </PARA>
<PARA> Incorporation by reference in delegated legislation-In response to a general initiative of the Committee, the Attorney-General undertook on 20 January 1989, in respect of delegated legislation which is the responsibility of his portfolio, to furnish the Committee with instruments which are incorporated in delegated legislation, thereby themselves acquiring legislative force, to summarise the nature and effect of the incorporated instruments in the Explanatory Statement and to indicate where a copy may be obtained. The Attorney-General also undertook to write to Ministerial colleagues advising them of the undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA> Building (Amendment) Ordinance 1988 (A.C.T. Ordinance No. 73 of 1988)-The Minister for the Arts and Territories undertook on 16 December 1988 to amend the Ordinance to correct a drafting oversight relating to a confusing miscitation of a paragraph. </PARA>
<PARA> Motor Omnibus Services Ordinance 1955 (A.C.T. Determination of Fees No. 33 of 1988)-The Minister for the Arts and Territories undertook on 16 December 1988 to amend the Determination to clarify drafting relating to the heading of a clause. </PARA>
<PARA> Rules of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory (Amendment) (Statutory Rules 1988 No. 257)-The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the A.C.T. undertook on 19 and 23 December 1988 to provide full Explanatory Statements to accompany future amendments of the Rules. </PARA>
<PARA> Industrial Relations Regulations (Statutory Rules 1989 No. 12)-The Minister for Industrial Relations undertook on 11 April 1989 to amend the regulations to provide that possibly prejudicial evidence could be challenged by parties affected by it rather than left to the discretion with an official. Previously, the regulations gave the Registrar a discretion to admit evidence given in earlier proceedings before the Court, the Commission or a Registrar but did not provide for objections to the use of such evidence. (Senate Daily Hansard, 2 May 1989, p. 1543-1545.)</PARA>
<PARA> Wool Marketing Regulations (Amendment) (Statutory Rules 1989 No. 14)-The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy undertook on 11 April 1989 to amend the regulations to provide for a reasonable time limit within which a mandatory inspection ordered by an official had to be completed. (Senate Daily Hansard, 2 May 1989, p. 1543-1546.)</PARA>
<PARA> Australian National Railways Commission (General By-law Amendment No. 2)-The Chairman of the Australian National Railways Commission undertook on 11 April 1989 to amend the By-law to remove strict liability, dual liability and conclusive proof certificate provisions relating to criminal offences. (Senate Daily Hansard, 2 May 1989, p. 1543-1544, 1546.)</PARA>
<PARA> Notice of Declaration under the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988-The Minister for Industrial Relations undertook on 4 May 1988 to provide Explanatory Statements to accompany future Notices and to institute a system of citation. </PARA>
<PARA> In previous statements at the conclusion of a sittings, it has also been usual to draw attention to matters of concern to the Committee in its continuing task of technical scrutiny. Over the last few years there has been some repetition of these themes; inadequate Explanatory Statements, delays in answering correspondence, tardy implementations of undertakings, and some lack of appreciation of Committee standards. </PARA>
<PARA> While not wishing to play down the importance of these, there have been some improvements here just as there have been in the substantive contents of delegated legislation dealing with civil liberties and parliamentary proprieties, and probably for the same reasons. These particular problems continue to be in the forefront of issues pursued by the Committee. They have, however, been dealt with exhaustively in the present Eighty-Fifth Report and in previous statements and reports. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important area of concern to the Committee at present is more threatening to its standards and has more potential to damage its achievements. This concern is the increasing use of new legislative and administrative techniques outside the usual experience of legislative scrutiny. The conceptual framework of delegated legislation is straight forward; an Act of Parliament will set out the broad scheme of a policy or program within a fairly detailed framework, with executive law-making confined to matters too technical, trivial, detailed or changing to justify the procedural solemnity and rigor of an Act of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> These new techniques of `quasi-legislation', however, stand the established theory on its head. Acts may now be mere skeletons, with considerable detail made by legislative or quasi-legislative instrument. In a parallel development this added detail is not technical or minor but can tend to be the substantive core of the scheme. Finally, this quasi-legislation is expressed in terms which are difficult to classify. Typically, an Act will provide for `guidelines' or `directions' to be issued in respect of a particular matter. These will not always be subject to disallowance or even tabling. Even where they are so subject their terminology and content is such that it is difficult to tell whether they are mandatory and prescriptive. It is, for example, an improper exercise of a discretion under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, to apply a guideline without further consideration. There is a serious danger to parliamentary propriety if such instruments by-pass the scrutiny and supervision of the Parliament. Expansion of the use of these instruments at the expense of detailed provisions in Acts and the more orthodox instruments of delegated legislation may increase the power of the Government at the expense of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It goes without saying that such quasi-legislative instruments are usually not subject to the presentational discipline of the Statutory Rules Publication Act, with consequential deficiencies in access, presentation and citation. </PARA>
<PARA> The challenge of this quasi-legislation is particularly difficult. One response must be to liaise closely with the other Senate legislative scrutiny committee, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, to co-ordinate information and responses. This has the potential at least for the Senate to be informed of the extent of these practices. No Commonwealth agency, for example, has a complete record of all delegated legislation and quasi-legislation. As well as information and publicity, however, the reply to the challenge may require a wider and more flexible range of options to be available to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Such options could include the right of partial disallowance and amendment of delegated legislation; the Senate could then debate and vote upon individual parts of a quasi-legislative instrument, in the same way as it does on a Bill. This would avoid the situation where the Senate is presented with an all or nothing option in considering delegated legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Another would be to develop mechanisms that would assist the Committee's scrutiny. For example, the accompanying documents could contain an assessment of the impact of instruments on the rights of people and Parliament. More hearings by the Committee could be useful, not only with public officials but with personal representations and evidence from members of the public who may feel that their rights are unduly diminished by legislation. These changes could be complemented by provisions for the possible suspension of the operation of quasi-legislative instruments during a long adjournment, if those instruments appear to infringe the Committee's principles. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be that the time is fast approaching when the Government should re-examine long standing delegated legislative instruments which are known to affect individual rights for reasons which may not be as persuasive as they were when those instruments were made. </PARA>
<PARA> A requirement that the instruments comply with the Statutory Rules Publication Act would also be very useful. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of these remedies require statutory provision but some could be instituted or developed on the initiative of the Committee, which is now considering courses of action. Many of the above suggestions are not merely speculative but have been introduced in various States. Any additional options open to the Committee would also improve its scrutiny of the more usual types of delegated legislation apart from quasi-legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Another significant aspect of the work of the Committee since the previous Sitting has been the holding of Conferences, Meetings and Seminars which have discussed the issues and challenges of bipartisan, technical, legislative scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important of these was the Second Conference of Australian Delegated Legislation Committees, held in Parliament House from 26-28 April 1989. The Conference was opened by His Excellency the Governor-General, the first occasion on which the new Governor-General conducted a function in Parliament House. His Excellency was introduced to the delegates by the President of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Conference was attended by some 50 delegates from the Commonwealth, the Northern Territory and all States except Tasmania, where delegates had to withdraw due to the State election. Overseas delegations attended from Botswana, the British Virgin Islands and New Zealand. The working sessions of the Conference were chaired by members of the Committee. Major papers were delivered by the Legal Adviser to the Committee, Emeritus Professor Douglas Whalan; the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Professor Dennis Pearce; the President of the AAT, His Honour Justice Trevor Hartigan; the Chairmen of 2 State delegated legislation committees, Ken Jasper MLA from Victoria and Bob Hetherington MLC from Western Australia; a former Chairman of the Senate Committee, Senator Austin Lewis, and the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Bob Collins. </PARA>
<PARA> The papers presented dealt with current issues in the scrutiny of delegated legislation. Those from the parliamentarians emphasised the bipartisan and non-policy nature of the work of their Committees; those from the other distinguished contributors dealt with the effect of legislative scrutiny on public administration, legislative scrutiny techniques and the place of legislative scrutiny in the general system of administrative law. The papers were all the subject of considerable discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Committee participated in the Conference: Senator Collins and the Deputy Chair of the Committee, Senator Bronwyn Bishop, both chaired several working sessions; other members of the Committee, Senators Pat Giles, Kay Patterson, John Stone and Bob McMullan, also chaired working sessions, introduced speakers, led discussions and hosted functions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Conference unanimously agreed that all committees investigate and report on the nature, the extent and the implications for delegated legislation committees of the proliferation, within the Commonwealth, the States and the Territories, of legislative and quasi-legislative instruments which are either not subject to parliamentary scrutiny and control, or whether so subject or not, represent a developing trend towards executive law-making. As noted earlier in this statement, the tendency towards quasi-legislation is perhaps the greatest challenge facing legislative scrutiny committees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Conference also resolved that it would accept the offer of the Western Australian Delegated Legislation Committee to host the Third Conference in Perth in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The entire proceedings of the conference were recorded by Hansard and will be produced in a convenient form, tabled for the information of the Senate and made available for distribution to the public. Senator Kay Patterson has taken a particular interest in the dissemination of the proceedings to educational institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> As a complement and a foil to the Conference the secretariats of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee and the Scrutiny of Bills Committee held a series of seminars for middle managers from Commonwealth departments and statutory authorities. More than 60 public service managers attended the seminars. Working sessions were conducted by the Clerk and Deputy Clerk of the Senate, by staff of the Procedure Office, by the Legal Advisers of the Committees, and by departmental officers. The purpose of the seminars was to emphasise the standards and principles of the Committees and to offer assistance in their implementation. Valuable personal contacts were made at the seminars, which have assisted the Committee secretariats in their work. In addition, suggestions made by middle managers in relation to processing documentation for the Committees have already been implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently the Regulations and Ordinances Committee and the Scrutiny of Bills Committee jointly hosted a meeting with the Administrative Review Council, one of the most important organisations in the Commonwealth administrative law system. The meeting allowed the Committee and Council members and their respective staffs to discuss their roles and operation. The meeting was addressed by the Chairman of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, Senator Collins; by the Chairman of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, Senator Cooney; and by the President of the ARC, Dr Cheryl Saunders. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Collins emphasised the possible danger of new final specialist tribunals diluting the functions of the AAT itself, Senator Cooney discussed Ministerial discretion and administrative review, while Dr Saunders stressed the need for the Council and Parliamentarians to exchange views regularly on developments in administrative law and the role of the law in making public administration fair and accountable. </PARA>
<PARA> The program of conferences and seminars is to continue. Further middle management meetings will be held, in order to cover as wide a number of participants as possible and to meet the keen demand evident from the first 2 seminars. Other conferences are being arranged for senior management and for professional legislative drafters. As noted later in this statement, the Committee has also offered to provide assistance should the new Legislative Assembly for the ACT decide to establish legislative scrutiny machinery. </PARA>
<PARA> These seminars are particularly important, not only to disseminate the standards and principles of the Committee, but to influence the administrative pro- cesses during which delegated legislation is formulated and made. They emphasise prevention rather than cure and represent the pre-emptive rather than the re-active nature of the Committee's operations. The seminars complement Committee hearings, which are usually in respect of a single instrument. The seminars, on the other hand, are designed to improve compliance with the Committee's concerns over the whole range of delegated legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> On 11 May 1989 the new Legislative Assembly for the ACT met for the first time and Commonwealth statutory provisions were proclaimed which transferred responsibility for most ACT Ordinances to that Assembly and for most ACT Regulations and similar instruments to ACT Ministers. Those Ordinances and the delegated legislation made under them are, therefore, no longer tabled in the Parliament and of course are not subject to scrutiny by the Committee. The transferred ACT Ordinances were deemed Acts and any future amendments or new legislation will be made by the ACT legislature and not by a Commonwealth Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the transferred Ordinances and instruments were amended as a result of Ministerial undertakings following initiatives of the Committee and their standard of protection of personal liberties and maintenance of parliamentary proprieties thereby improved. In its examination of ACT Ordinances the Committee had functioned as a de-facto scrutiny of bills committee. ACT Ordinances, while legally delegated legislation, in practice dealt with substantive discrete issues in the same way as Commonwealth or State Acts, and actually provided for Regulations and other instruments to be made under their authority. </PARA>
<PARA> On the date of self-government some recent undertakings given to the Committee by the Minister had not been implemented and there was corres- pondence outstanding. This matter had been addressed previously and on 31 August 1988 the then Minister for the Arts and Territories, the Hon Gary Punch MP, wrote to the Chairman that he would direct his departmental staff to clear outstanding undertakings if possible. If this could not be done then the Minister would recommend to the new ACT government that appropriate and urgent amendments be made. On 11 May 1989 the Chairman wrote to the then Minister, the Hon Clyde Holding MP, reminding him of this undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chairman also wrote to the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly for the ACT inviting a delegation of members from the new legislature to meet with the Regulations and Ordinances Committee and the Scrutiny of Bills Committee to discuss technical legislative scrutiny and to assist the ACT legislature to adopt similar machinery should they wish to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The members of the Committee take this opportunity to thank their colleagues in the Senate for their continuing support and commitment to its bipartisan work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the luncheon break, the Committee was dealing with the six Bills that make up the superannuation package. In that debate we saw a classic case of a lot of sound and fury that essentially signified nothing very much at all. A lot of allegations were flung around and a lot of assertions and sweeping statements were made about who would be disadvantaged and who would not. During that 3 1/4 hours we heard that the variation in numbers of people disadvantaged ranged between 5,000 and 3 1/2 million, which is a fair margin of error. I think we need to recognise that there has been a lot of rhetoric flung around about deals being done, people being hurt, decisions being made and gone back on. Perhaps it is not a bad idea if we just run through all of this again, particularly since, during lunchtime, I had an opportunity to read the editorial in today's Australian, which gets this matter about as wrong as it is possible to get. In part that editorial says of the Government and its legislation:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Its 15 per cent tax on employer contributions, as well as a 15 per cent tax on the earnings of superannuation funds, is indefensible. These replaced the 30 per cent lump sum tax, which it introduced six years ago, ostensibly as a way of making annuities more attractive. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, of course, the 15 per cent tax on employer contributions is being offset by an equivalent reduction in the lump sum tax, and an anti-detriment clause ensures that people who are worse off as a result of the contributions tax can get a refund from the Commissioner of Taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> The earnings tax, as I pointed out this morning, is designed to encourage our superannuation funds-which control about $100 billion in investments-to invest in Australian companies which pay tax. I have not heard anything from the Opposition that indicates why it thinks it is better to encourage people with $100 billion to invest to go offshore, to go into American companies  or--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that in a minute. It is interesting that Senator Chapman should raise that question. Why does the Opposition think it is better to go into tax avoidance areas, to go offshore and so on? Why should we encourage that? Why should we not give those people an incentive, however small, to stay onshore? I invite people who argue that somehow or other I supported the earnings tax at some stage to go back and have a look at my 1987 election campaign speech, in which I particularly singled out the life and super funds for going offshore. I urged the Government at that stage to introduce an incentive which would encourage them to invest in Australian companies-in particular, in Australian companies which pay tax. That is an additional benefit that the earnings tax provides.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There will be no benefit to the life and super funds if they simply buy up parcels of shares in companies that do not pay tax. The benefit will occur when they buy parcels of shares in companies which can give them the advantage of imputation so that they can reduce their earnings tax to zero. Many funds have indicated that they will not pay any earnings tax. The Australian Mutual Provident Society (AMP) cheerfully announced a couple of weeks ago that it will not pay any earnings tax because it has invested in taxpaying Australian companies. This means that it has seen a significant increase in deferred annuities, the very area where some Opposition senators complained that there would be a massive detriment. I understand that the AMP has something like 2,000 of the 5,000 members of fixed interest deferred annuities (DAs), yet it claims it will not be paying any earnings tax, which means that its fixed interest DA members will not be affected in any way at all. Since the other 3,000 members are spread around National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd and other similar organisations, it is highly likely that they too will be protected by the fact that the different sorts of DAs offered by the superannuation funds will finish up becoming a kind of investment casserole in which it is all mixed in together and everybody benefits as a consequence of that. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt at all that, since the Treasurer (Mr Keating) announced the changes to the scheme on 25 May, DAs have become very attractive. Some $1.97 billion was invested in DAs at the time that the Treasurer made his announcement last year. Most of the funds then-knowing that the earnings tax was going to be applied to them-looked to ways to reduce that. As a consequence, something like $6.3 billion is now invested in DAs-treble the amount from 14 months ago-because the funds were looking to minimise the earnings tax. DAs have burgeoned; there is no question about that. If this amendment of the Government's is not passed, only approved deposit fund (ADF) members will be discriminated against. While I am on the subject of the Australian editorial I might point out that the newspaper takes the opportunity to have a swipe at the social welfare sector. It points out:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . superannuation reduces the liability for pensions in future Budgets as the population ages, and as such is the most responsible way for the nation to save . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I am not going to argue about the fact that we need to encourage people to save for their retirement. That is why a tax deduction is available to people who invest in superannuation funds. It is why this legislation doubles that tax deduction-giving, I might add, an immediate benefit of $750 per year to people on the highest marginal tax rates. </PARA>
<PARA> So there is an inbuilt incentive in here. But I would like somebody to tell me why it is intrinsically better for the Government to say, `You can deduct from your tax $3,000-worth of investment that you are paying into a super fund, and, if you are on the top marginal tax rate, we will give you back nearly $1,500'. Why is that intrinsically good when the same people who recommend that system regard it as intrinsically bad to give a family on a very low income $1,500 a year? Why is it better to deprive Consolidated Revenue of $1,500 than to pay out of consolidated revenue $1,500 for a social welfare benefit?</PARA>
<PARA> I am not arguing about us all contributing to our own retirement. People in this place contribute 11 1/2 per cent of their salary, and we do not have any say in that at all. It is a good thing to make people aware of what their future is likely to be. But I do not like to see people applauded when they are wealthy and in a position to take advantage of superannuation while those who are on low incomes and not in a position to take up superannuation are derided for draining Consolidated Revenue by requiring the Government to provide them with an age pension after retirement. I think we direct an indignity at many elderly people if we blame them for the size of the Budget deficit or surplus. </PARA>
<PARA> The editorial writer might also like to have a look at the scheme that the Australian offers. If whoever wrote the editorial is so keen on getting people into super funds, maybe that person should do an analysis of how his or her own company operates. What are the superannuation facilities that the Australian offers to employees? Do they extend to part-timers and casual workers? I bet they do not. Does the Australian encourage women employed in the company to take out superannuation, as it would no doubt encourage men? I bet it does not. </PARA>
<PARA> We talked in here for 3 1/2 hours this morning about incentives and disincentives, equity and lack of equity, and level playing fields and playing fields that were anything but level. We have a superannuation and pensions system in this country which is most inequitable. In some ways this legislation attempts to rectify those inequities. It also attempts to rectify a few other economic problems we have when large companies go offshore by offering those companies encouragement to stay onshore. </PARA>
<PARA> We then heard comments from various speakers about how this legislation was going to cause a flight of investors from one plan to another, presumably from DAs to somewhere else. As I pointed out a moment ago, nothing could be further from the truth. If the behavioural changes of the last 12 to 14 months are any indication, people are going into deferred annuities as never before. Why? It is because the majority of deferred annuities have a high share exposure and the companies know that they will get a benefit from imputation and will be paying no earnings tax. Very few funds, if the announcement from AMP is any indication, will be paying any tax at all except ADFs. That is why the Democrats moved that from July of last year those people in particular were exempt. If the only way we could exempt them was by dropping the earnings tax altogether, as a last resort, we were prepared to do that. We no longer have to resort to that. The industry seems to be reasonably satisfied that the amendment that the Government has come up with will not cause behavioural changes. </PARA>

<PARA> This does not alter the fact that, contrary to some of the things that have been said in this chamber today, DAs are still an excellent way-indeed, one of the best ways-for people to invest their money. The 1988-89 increases in the investment area, which have trebled from a bit under $2 billion to something over $6 billion in the last 14 months, indicate that the new laws have encouraged people to go into these sorts of areas. There will not be a marketing edge for ADFs. There cannot be a marketing edge for ADFs. The only people who are protected under the amendment proposed by the Government are those people who were in funds as at 25 May last year. I cannot see how anything that happened subsequently can possibly be judged as providing a marketing edge for approved deposit funds. If anything, there is probably still a marketing edge for DAs. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever else there is or is not in this legislation, as a huge feature in the Sydney Morning Herald this week indicates, superannuation is still the best tax break around. Not that it is not complex. Of course it is. It is complicated because of the changes made in 1983 and in 1985 which we opposed and Senator Watson and his colleagues supported. It is complicated by all those pre- and post-1983 situations and by an assortment of taxes on eligible termination payments. But it is still the best tax break around. The pity of it is that it is currently not available to as many people as it should be and the majority of people who cannot take advantage of it are women. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was an interesting dissertation by Senator Haines as to why the Australian Democrats have chosen to do a deal with the Government. The Democrats would prefer the 100,000 people to tell the 5,000 people in roll-over annuities that they are too insignificant to worry about, that it is all too difficult to cope with them and to tell the rest of the 3.5 million Australians who are in superannuation funds that they do not matter a row of beans. Senator Haines also chose to use this morning's Australian editorial. In line with the attention that we pay to the reporting of these matters-Senator Walsh always pays attention to what is in the press-it is interesting to look at some of the comments that have been attributed to Senator Haines in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald. It is an article that I referred to a little earlier. It was written by Mr Paul Cleary, who stands by his recollection of the conversation he had with Senator Haines. In that part of the article dealing specifically with the Government's amendment to accommodate the Australian Democrats the comment goes likes this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When it became public, the Government and the Democrats were bombarded with pleas from several groups to change it, saying that they would be unable to change trust deeds applying to the funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, they claimed, it was unworkable. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Haines said that if the Government had not fixed the problem she would have voted with the Opposition, which wanted to remove the 15 per cent earnings tax altogether. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment will have to be approved by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA>Interestingly enough, Mr Connolly had a discussion earlier today with Mr Ron Dean, the Deputy Commissioner of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC). Mr Connolly said that when he asked Mr Dean whether he or any other officer of the Commission had had a discussion with the Democrats as to whether the Democrats' proposed second amendment would overcome the problem, that is, the half a dozen lines that we had in the form of an additional clause to yesterday's published document, Mr Dean replied that he had had no contact with the Democrats nor to the best of his knowledge had any members of the Commission, nor had they been requested by the Government to advise upon the practicality of the proposed amendment. Mr Dean confirmed that the Treasury officers had made contact with the ISC on the general subject in the context of the existing superannuation regulations; they were advised that the regulations did not conflict with the proposed amendment. The ISC was not asked to approve, nor did it approve, of that amendment. This information is totally contrary to what Senator Haines is reported as having said in the report in the Sydney Morning Herald. Mr Cleary stands by the statement that is attributed to Senator Haines that she would require that the amendment be approved by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what I am quoting. As I said, Mr Cleary stands by his recollection of the conversation that took place with Senator Haines. Of course when the Government comes to move its amendment to clause 56 we will be able to look in some detail at the question of retrospectivity and the ability to amend trust deeds. Just as Senator Haines has had the odd piece of correspondence from the Chairman of the Commonwealth Bank, we have also had lots of correspondence and, more particularly, something with a little more substance to it. It was interesting that Senator Haines accepted a letter from someone who is virtually the chief executive but I did also suggest that it may have been more useful if she had talked to the bank's legal advisers. Those questions will come when the Government moves its amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At this stage it is important to say this: very simply, the Opposition has pursued its course of action, that is, to excise the 15 per cent investment tax on superannuation funds; all of them. It is a simple concept; it is an effective concept. Indeed, in terms of the cost to the revenue, we have said that we will not touch anything else in the package so that the Government will still stand to reap most of the revenue which, after all, was the intent of this package of Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has made its position quite clear. It has said that we believe that the 15 per cent investment tax is a disincentive to savings. There are many parts of the industry-in fact, all of the industry, with the exception of one particular company which seems to have been supporting the Government's point of view-opposed to the tax. The rest of the industry is opposed to the tax. The rest of the industry wants to see it dropped and, dare I say it, the superannuants would also like to see it dropped because they are the losers in this package. We had a discussion here earlier this morning whereby we discussed in great, contrite detail whether the Treasurer had said that nobody would suffer at all or whether it was only one special group of people or whatever the true clinical meaning of what he had to say was. But the important thing is this: the Government wished the populace to believe--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Watson" NAMEID="VJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator Watson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Something that wasn't true.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Senator BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Precisely. As Senator Watson says, they wanted them to believe something that was not true. They wanted them to believe that it would be okay. As I have said, there are two ways to increase the number of people in superannuation. As Senator Haines said, we need more people contributing to the funds. The two points are these: firstly, through the tax system we need to attract more people into the scheme, to stop them saying, `I want to take my after-tax money and spend it on something now from which I will get instant enjoyment'. We want to convince those people that it is in their interest to take that after-tax money and to place it into a superannuation fund with the expectation of taking a benefit in the years ahead-for those in their thirties, decades ahead. That is a big proposition to put to people who are young, to people who feel that they would like to have a bit of the good life. So it is important that the tax advantage is a good one. We will not do that by whacking on a 15 per cent investment tax. The second point is, and it is a good old-fashioned concept, the KISS principle-keep it simple, stupid. In other words, it has to be easy to comprehend. It has to be a proposition that can be explained to people in simple terms, terms they can easily grasp. Quite clearly from the debate that has gone on in this Parliament, from the reams of reports that have been written, and from the ease with which the Government has been able to place red herrings across the trail of what is really at stake here, it certainly does not meet the criterion of keeping it simple.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I reiterate: the Opposition at all times remains steadfast in its resolve to have the 15 per cent tax on investment excised, to have that investment money exempt from tax. When we come to the Government's amendment a little later another point will need to be looked at, and that is very simply that even accepting what Senator Haines says as true, that she is getting what she wanted--</PARA>

I implore the Democrats to see reason on this issue, to give the people another chance, to give those 3.5 million superannuants who stand to lose another fair go. I implore the Democrats to think about it again. Rather than do a deal-get into bed with the Government-they should support their original position, vote for the Opposition's amendments and put in place a system to get rid of this iniquitous, insidious 15 per cent investment tax.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Maybe it would satisfy even Senator Bishop if I argued that I should not talk to the Managing Director of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation but that I should talk to the lawyers. I point out that Mr Sanders, the Managing Director of the Corporation, in his letter said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I understand you are aware that officers of the Bank and Treasury have been discussing whether the provisions of the above Bill would enable Approved Deposit Funds (ADF's) to distribute selectively the exemption from tax to eligible depositors only. </PARA>
<PARA> Treasury have asked us to comment directly to you on the following sub-clause which they have drafted for inclusion in the Bill . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He then cites the addition to the Government's amendment. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The intention of this sub-clause is to provide a basis on which complying fixed interest ADF's can provide eligible depositors with tax exempt earnings on their original 25 May balances without giving other depositors claims to share in the tax exempt earnings. </PARA>
<PARA>Our concern was with those people who had invested in good faith prior to 25 May; those who assumed that they were going to get a secure and non-taxed benefit. He further states:</PARA>
<PARA>Our legal advisers are of the opinion that the inclusion of this sub-clause will enable the Commonwealth Bank ADF to amend its Trust Deed to give effect to that intention without fear of successful challenge by non-eligible depositors. The amendments to our deed would provide for the ADF to adjust the 1988/89 and subsequent earnings of eligible depositors in this way. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not need to talk to the lawyers. One presumes that the Managing Director of the Corporation has talked to its lawyers, that he has run the amendment past its legal section and given its lawyers the opportunity to have a close analysis of it, and that they have indicated to him that it satisfies their concern that they may not be able to implement the legislation without running into a legal minefield. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the rest of the Opposition's concerns have been with whether people will be disadvantaged and who did what deals with whom. I mentioned earlier today redeemable preference shares, but it might be worthwhile pointing out that a letter from David Lennon of Lloyds International Ltd, which was forwarded to the Opposition spokesman in the House of Representatives, Mr David Connolly, makes a very valid point with regard to the value of redeemable preference shares used even by fixed interest funds. Lloyds International said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is possible for the low risk roll/over funds to invest in equities yielding franking credits on a capital guaranteed basis. This is possible by way of investment in Redeemable Preference Shares paying fully franked dividends with the payment of dividends and repayment of invested capital guaranteed by major Australian trading banks. We believe that since the proposed commencement date for the tax (1 July 1988) approximately $2 billion to $3 billion of such shares have been issued in Australia and have been subscribed for by both ordinary superannuation and capital guaranteed funds. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> This significant market has developed on the basis that the relevant funds in question would be subject to tax. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, the market had developed on the basis that the funds were taking advantage of the imputation element within this to reduce their 15 per cent tax to zero. Lloyds continues:</PARA>
<PARA> If such tax legislation is to be opposed, we submit that it should be opposed on a prospective, rather than a retrospective, basis preferably as from 1 July 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>Lloyds wants this legislation to continue because that has opened up a market for redeemable preference shares, which is why most people in the industry are arguing that very few funds will be paying any tax at all. The return to the investor funds from the preference share investment, according to Lloyds, was calculated on the basis that the fund will receive the benefit of the relevant franking credits. Lloyds says:</PARA>
<PARA>Although the dividend yield on these investments is attractive (to a tax paying investor) it does not compare with the return on a traditional ``at interest'' investment upon which an investor is not subject to tax. </PARA>
<PARA>However, there is a significant offset component. Mr Lennon of Lloyds further states:</PARA>
<PARA> We understand that the Commissioner of Taxation has issued private rulings to the effect that, where dividends paid thereon are commensurate with the capital sum invested, they are not offensive in terms of the anti-avoidance provisions of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that if the funds invest properly, as they are being encouraged to do, this alleged wide sweep of people who allegedly will be hurt some time down the track certainly will not be. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition seems to be making a great fuss and bother about some deal that has been done when what has happened, as I have explained before, is that people in approved deposit funds, who were going to be the only ones paying 15 per cent tax, have now got an exemption from that tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition Senators might care to remember that the superannuation industry would not be in such a mess were it not for the fact that they themselves in the past have supported significant Government amendments to the superannuation tax area and opposed an amendment of ours back in the early 1980s that would have allowed indexation to apply in an area where it was quite significant, given the rate of inflation that we have been suffering during the 1980s. It would have been nice if the concern expressed by the Opposition today for people who will be hard hit had been something that it had taken to heart itself over the last few years. Maybe if it had, we would not have had so many women aged 45 in tears in my office because they had been on a class B widows pension and found that when their youngest child turned 16 they were forced off it and put on the unemployment benefit. They were told to go out and get a job or go on unemployment benefit. That legislation did not pass this place with the support of the Australian Democrats. We were totally opposed to it. The Opposition said, `But it's a Budget measure; we have to pass it'. It said the same thing when pension consumer price index increases were delayed by six weeks just before Christmas in 1986. It said the same thing when it supported the 2 per cent discounting of ex-service pensions in the same year. I suspect that the concern being expressed by some members of the Opposition is not for the struggler, not for the battler, but for the person on $55,000 plus a year, who has been, and will be, able to take advantage, through the tax system, of superannuation benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to Opposition senators: the next time the Government is trying to pull the rug out from underneath you, look to the needy in this community. Have the same care for them as you have expressed for those who are fortunately in a position to take care of themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as going back on decisions is concerned, maybe we could run through a few of the Opposition's changes of mind as it seems to believe that this is such a terrible thing to do. Why did Opposition senators change their minds on the health reinsurance fund? Again, this legislation grossly discriminates against the elderly. It defines those over the age of 65 as chronically sick on their first day in hospital, no matter what their sickness. Where is the equity in that? When they so cheerfully supported the Government in the removal of Austudy did they care about the families whose 15-year-olds lost that benefit? They should not talk to me about backdowns and deals when they have just backed down on wheat legislation and left very many growers on the west coast of South Australia worse off. I understand that today the Government has talked Opposition senators into backing down on the Resource Assessment Commission, which sells out the environment to developers. Opposition senators should not come in here and play holier than thou. </PARA>
<PARA> From time to time in this place, we all make assessments on current information of what we do. We find out that we do not have enough or that we have been given misleading information and then reassess our position. I would have thought that any sensible person did that. But, apparently, it is only okay when the Liberal and National parties do it. And even on those occasions-this is not one of them-when somebody else does it, it is totally reprehensible!</PARA>
<PARA> We then hear from Senator Watson about how we should treat all people the same way. We cannot have some people paying a lot of tax and some people not paying any tax at all. Yet, the earnings tax in this legislation can be manipulated in such a way that nobody needs to be any worse off if the funds are doing the right thing. On the other hand, apparently it is perfectly all right for us to have a tax system that states that people who go out and buy a house for investment can get everything written off against their tax but people trying to put a roof over their children's heads cannot get any sort of deduction. I find it particularly offensive that one can borrow $80,000 or $100,000 to buy a house to put somebody else in and get a tax deduction; but, if one borrows the same amount of money to put one's children in, one cannot get those deductions. Where is the equity in that?</PARA>
<PARA> The figures of the Real Estate Institute of Australia show that, since Opposition senators helped the Government reintroduce negative gearing for housing investors, there has been a massive distortion in house purchasing. Investors in the market have trebled and first home buyers have dropped. </PARA>

Those interest rates are no longer controlled by this Government because again Opposition senators helped it to deregulate the financial sector in this country. Those people are hurting to the tune of $800 a month.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another little uneven playing field is the capital gains tax. Make a gain and one is taxed only on that part of the gain after inflation. If one puts one's money in the bank and earns interest, one is taxed from dollar one. No inflationary component at all is taken into account. </PARA>

Honourable senators cannot get up in this place and talk about level playing fields when there is nothing in the tax system that is fair or equitable for most Australian families. They should not come blustering in here to talk about how some people are better off than others. There is no need for the earnings tax to be affecting anybody except to the benefit of Australian companies which impute. Maybe, if some of the billions of dollars that the life and super funds have to invest were kept onshore, we would not have an economy which is overheating: we would have access to financing that was sufficient so that competition was not so high that ordinary families are paying 17 and 18 per cent for their money. If these companies stayed onshore instead of going to the Cook Islands, maybe we could actually afford tax breaks for ordinary Australian families.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Haines has really been quite unkind in some of her remarks today. I always find it very difficult to debate with Senator Haines. She takes the thrust of what one says, basically espouses it as if it is her own and then tries to put one's position in the most distant view as if it is a cowboy sort of attitude. She tends to distance herself from what one has actually said, whereas the thrust of much of what she has said is really in agreement with the Opposition's stated goals. I find it unfortunate that she found this morning's debate a lot of rhetoric and not much substance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Temporary Chairman, I commend you on your tolerance towards Senator Haines and the latitude that you have given her, but we will not respond in detail because some issues raised are more appropriately addressed in later sections of this Bill when we refer to the Government's amendments. It is more appropriate that I address those issues there. So Senator Haines should stay with us because we do intend to canvass those issues and draw attention to the pitfalls which are inherent in what the Government has put forward. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Haines must not put too much faith in her earlier comments about the infallibility of the anti-detriment provisions of the legislation. They are not really a genuine attempt to rectify or to ensure that the benefits of net tax are not actively affected by the 1988 amendments. In other words, it is more of a political gimmick, a political exercise. I will now spell out the rationale and reasons for saying this. Senator Haines should not put too much faith in these anti-detriment provisions. Firstly, let us look at some of the serious limitations of the anti-detriment provisions, which I think are more shadow than substance, in the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill. Earlier she accused us of too much rhetoric and not enough substance. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider a number of cases. The first limitation of the anti-detriment provision is that it cannot take into account any loss resulting from the taxation of investment income. Only compensation for the 15 per cent contribution tax is intended. That is the only relief. It does not extend any further. That is the first problem with Senator Haines's faith-or what should be her lack of faith-in the anti-detriment provision. Secondly, the anti-detriment provision applies only to a lump sum benefit paid to a person over the age of 55. That is limitation No. 2. Limitation No. 3 is that, in determining whether any detriment has occurred, the unrealistic assumption must be made that the threshold of the old tax rates always would have remained at 55. The indexed tax threshold, which starts at 60, is used for the new tax calculation. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, it is up to the taxpayer, as I mentioned this morning, to provide evidence to satisfy the Commissioner of Taxation that detriment has occurred. It appears that the Commissioner will not initiate an application. It is the poor old taxpayer who will suffer the disadvantage, the person who we were told would not be 1c worse off. He will have to apply to the Tax Commissioner. We asked how. The Minister said he will have to write the Commissioner a letter in his tax return. What a way to deal with the problem. When will the poor individual get compensation? Will it be in the previous year's assessment or the current year's assessment? Will it be at the time his application is made, or will returns for previous years in which the detriment could also have arisen be amended?</PARA>
<PARA> The provision is intended to give only partial compensation in a number of cases. It does not give full compensation. For example, a person may have had long service leave prior to 1983 but only recently may have taken up superannuation entitlements. In such cases the whole or most of the benefit would have built up from contributions subject to the 15 per cent tax, but a substantial part of the benefit would be a pre-1983 component, which was referred to in such charitable terms earlier, and would not benefit from the reduced tax on the post-1983 component. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable senators opposite want specifics we will give them specifics but it will draw out the debate. A benefit may have built up at a much higher rate since 1983 than it had previously done. A detrimental effect would apply for the same reason as it did in the previous situation. Another case would be where the old tax rate exceeded the taxpayer's marginal rate and accordingly the marginal tax rate would apply. I ask Senator Haines not to put too much faith in the anti-detriment provision. I think she is chasing the shadow and not the substance. If she were chasing the substance she would agree with our amendments. But unfortunately, for the only time in her life, she has cut off her options too early. </PARA>
<PARA> I express a concern about the introduction of what I might term award or productivity superannuation. I come back to the problems created by the adoption by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner (ISC) of an approach that an award fund is liable to accept contributions virtually without regard to the scale of benefits. That is extraordinary. Why is one group of superannuation funds excluded from this essential provision, which goes to the heart of what we are all about here today, whereas all the other groups are to be treated separately?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Messner" NAMEID="9I4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Do you mean that the reasonable benefit limit should apply?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. No matter when a person joins an award or productivity fund-as a young or aged person, just before retirement or when one has just had one's sixteenth birthday-if that person is in another fund his benefits from the original fund must be reduced. But it is not so with a productivity fund. Where a person has been a member of an employer sponsored superannuation fund for 30 or 40 years and subsequently joins an award fund it is the original fund that must reduce the benefits. This approach to the administration of reasonable benefits via the ISC-unfortunately, he has placed us in some difficulties because of a lack of adequate guidance-has placed award funds in an extremely favourable competitive position. In other words, these funds do not have to incur the same expenses as other superannuation funds in ensuring that benefits are reasonable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Trustees of award superannuation funds are obliged to certify on their ISC return that they comply with the reasonable benefits scale. This is not the case in relation to accumulations from other sources. To sum up, there is no valid reason why these funds should be able to ignore the responsibilities placed on other superannuation funds with which they are in competition. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider the vulnerability-I use section 23 to achieve my purpose-of the provision relating to movements in the pre-July 1988 funding credit balance. This provision was supposed to be a bit of a save-all. The Government allows movements in the pre-1988 funding credit balance, which is right and proper. Administratively, the provision is very complex. Its good effect is dependent on another body and another Act, the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act (OSSA). The provision is made up of a number of components. I acknowledge the assistance of Deloitte, Haskins and Sells in providing me with an attachment. The provision is made up of an opening amount which is specified in the notice given by the ISC under the OSSA, subsection 15d (7). That is fair enough. It may be increased by amounts which are transferred in, but one can do this only under notice given by the Commission through the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act, subsection 15d (7). It can be decreased by amounts which are transferred out under notice given by the same body under subsection 15d (7). It can be further decreased by amounts which are withdrawn by the ISC under notice given under section 15d (6) where the fund advises the ISC of substantial changes in membership of a fund or in benefits provided. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we have an everything loss clause relating to where a prescribed event occurs and the fund fails to advise the ISC of it. There are an awful lot of obligations to the ISC. A failure to advise in time would mean that one could lose the whole of one's pre-1988 funding credit. It requires a day by day monitoring of the pre-July 1988 funding credit. Hence its vulnerability. Certainly, in the old days most funds did not have the necessary mechanisms. Money will be channelled into the big life offices and the big banks. Nobody else will have the sophistication to be able to handle it all. I think that it is a sad reflection when by legislation we are channelling money into certain specified areas. Then under section 275b in the Bill contributions must be applied against a pre-July 1988 funding credit balance. There is then the further complexity-it is true that this complexity is based on fairness-that it is indexed by the movement in the July quarter estimates for full time adult average wages on ordinary time earnings at that date, and that will be the opening balance for next year. </PARA>
<PARA> Complications of this sort are beyond most people. They add an administrative cost and a complexity that are unfortunate. Indeed, the whole thrust of what is happening is to make investment in superannuation funds a less attractive proposition because these administration costs will be passed on and that will result in a lower rate of return for participants in the fund. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendments I have moved will effect an excising of the 15 per cent investment tax from life offices and registered organisations in the business they do that is appropriate to superannuation funds. I think that it is pertinent in speaking to my amendments for me to comment briefly on some of the remarks made by Senator Haines in this debate. First, she engaged in what one might call the classic apples and oranges argument-that is, not to compare like with like. When talking about fairness and a level playing field in superannuation, I did so in the following context: what is necessary is to attract more Australians into superannuation funds in order that more Australians will become self-sufficient, or at least partially so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The level playing field argument that I used was that one needs to make it attractive to people who take their hard earned after tax money and who have the choice of either spending it and getting instant enjoyment from that expenditure and paying no tax to obtain that enjoyment, or of putting that money into a superannuation fund in the hope and expectation that after many years they will get a benefit which otherwise they would not have had, but under this package of legislation that money will be subject to yet further tax. When I talk about equity and fairness, I am talking about people who have taken hard earned after tax money, money on which they have already paid tax, and in good faith invested it in a product which is designed to give them some security in their retirement. This Government has chosen to make 20 amendments affecting the future of an investment into which people have entered in good faith. We are talking not about transfer payments or safety nets but about individuals who have made a decision based on all the facts and information available to them and having taken proper advice. This Government wishes to change the rules. It wants to make it less attractive for those who are already in and to make it darned unattractive for new people to come in. </PARA>
<PARA> I did not want to get into the business of exchanging competing letters with Senator Haines, but she chose to talk about a letter which she received from the Chief Executive of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. I have a letter from the State Bank saying that it confirms that it cannot amend its trust deeds retrospectively. I have had further communications from the Unit Trust Association of Australia complaining of the same thing. When we come on to debate the Government's amendments, we will look firmly at what is and what is not technically possible and what is and what is not legally possible. It is with some sadness that I read a letter dated 2 June from the State Superannuation Board from the Office of Full Time Employees Representative, a letter written to Mr Connolly on behalf of 500,000 public sector employees in New South Wales, congratulating the Opposition and the Democrats `for combining to reject the taxation on superannuation fund earnings in the Senate last night'. What will that body write tomorrow? Will it say, `We are terribly sorry that the Democrats reneged on the deal and, instead, chose to go to bed with the Government.'? Will it write that the Democrats do not care about this group of people any more? That is what it will write. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA>It is ironic that while the Government is attempting to tax long term superannuation investment funds, it is now suggesting that there may be a case for some taxation relief on other forms of investment, to encourage more people to save. There is no better way to create a large pool of long term investment savings in Australia than to encourage every worker to contribute to a superannuation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Many thousands of people were thanking the Democrats and the Opposition for the stand we took on 1 June. I implore the Democrats to look to reason and fairness. I ask them to look to creating that level playing field in the context in which I have described it. I ask them to support our amendments which affect that part of the superannuation trust funds which will complement other amendments which they and the Opposition have already passed and which are now part of the legislation. What a disappointment it is to know that unless the Democrats have a change of heart and see reason, the thanks that have flowed from thousands of good Australians will have fallen on deaf ears. </PARA>

<PARA> (6) Page 43, clause 26, proposed paragraph 159sg (1) (c), lines 16 and 17, leave out the proposed paragraph, insert the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(c) in relation to the year of income commencing on 1 July 1988-$125,000; or''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment deals with the raising of the lump sum tax free threshold from $65,000 to $125,000. This amendment is consistent with the coalition's own published policy for retirement incomes. It recognises that in the future, with a greater participation rate in superannuation and increased benefits, the average lump sum amount of approximately $60,000 will inevitably rise. It is a genuine attempt to increase the sum to the appropriate amount equivalent to what it costs the Australian taxpayer to fund a married couple in their retirement years. It is aimed at encouraging self-provision in retirement and decreasing reliance on government-funded pensions. The Government claims that such a step is only directed at the top end of town. The average lump sum now of $60,000 indicates that it thinks that this will not change in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition does not agree with this proposition. It is part of a range of incentives which the coalition has provided in its retirement incomes policy and deals with the enhancement of people's ability to enter into superannuation. With Labor's investment tax in place-as I said, we are still hopeful that when we come to the general purpose clause we might see a change of mind by the Australian Democrats-people's end benefits will decrease. So it is no wonder that they will not believe that the present lump sum of $60,000 will not significantly increase. It is our objective to make it more attractive for people below the $60,000 mark to be part of superannuation and to attempt, as I said, to make people truly self-reliant. It is in line with our own published retirement income policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief. Of course, the Government will not be accepting the Opposition amendment, principally for two reasons: Firstly, there is an obvious cost to revenue in it, although that cost in the early years will not be a great deal. However, it would continue to grow over time. Secondly, it is self-evident that it is heavily skewed in favour of people with larger lump sums or who are higher income earners generally. I was surprised at the extent to which it was skewed in that direction. In 1987-88, the most recent year for which we have figures, less than one-half per cent of lump sums affected by this provision were in excess of $55,000. So the Government's belief is that, in going to $60,000, it has certainly gone far enough.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I put it to the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) that so many of the complications of this Bill are due to the failure to select the $60,000 threshold. Had the Government selected a figure between what the Opposition is proposing and the $60,000, it could have had a much simpler and more equitable Bill. Senator Haines would have been satisfied because it would not have had its 1983 components and its pre-1988 credits to contend with. Why did the Government not go for a simple Act, which could have been easily understood and would have appealed to the average wage earner in Australia? As the Government acknowledges, the loss to revenue certainly in the initial years would not be all that great and the Government would have had an Act which people would have understood and could have followed. It is unfortunate that people in the twilight of their years, who suddenly find that they have never had so much money in all their lives, have to go through an investment maze in order to try and get a safe and secure investment for their retirement years. It means that those people have to go to an investment adviser who at the present time has great difficulty in understanding and delving into the labyrinth of superannuation law. Perhaps it is not too late to revise what has been done to make it a simpler and a more understandable Act in the Budget session.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Page 74, after clause 56, insert the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA> 56a. After section 290 of the Principal Act the following section is inserted:</PARA>
<PARA>Fixed interest complying ADFs-exemption of income attributable to certain 25 May 1988 deposits</PARA>
<PARA> `290a. (1) For each amount that, apart from this section, would be normal assessable income of a continuously complying fixed interest ADF of a year of income, the proportion (if any) calculated under subsection (2) is exempt from tax. </PARA>
<PARA> `(2) The proportion is calculated using the formula:</PARA>
<PARA>Aggregate of current 25 May balances</PARA>
<PARA>Aggregate current balance</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>where:</PARA>
<PARA> Aggregate of current 25 May balances is the aggregate of the current 25 May balances of eligible depositors, as at the reckoning time in relation to the year of income;</PARA>
<PARA> Aggregate current balance is the total amount deposited with the fund (together with accumulated earnings), as at the reckoning time in relation to the year of income. </PARA>
<PARA> `(3) An election for the purposes of the definition of ``reckoning time'' in subsection (4):</PARA>
<PARA> (a) shall be made by notice in writing to the Commissioner; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) shall be lodged with the Commissioner on or before the date of lodgment of the return of income of the ADF for the year of income to which the election relates, or before such later date as the Commissioner allows. </PARA>
<PARA> `(4) In this section, unless the contrary intention appears:</PARA>
<PARA> ``continuously complying fixed interest ADF'', in relation to a year of income (in this definition called the ``current year of income''), means a fund that is a fixed interest complying ADF in relation to each of the following years of income:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the current year of income;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the year of income in which 1 July 1988 occurred;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) each year of income later than the year of income mentioned in paragraph (b) and earlier than the current year of income;</PARA>
<PARA> ``CS policy'' has the same meaning as in Division 8 of Part III;</PARA>
<PARA> ``current 25 May balance'', in relation to an eligible depositor as at the reckoning time, is the balance as at that time determined by varying the original 25 May balance, in accordance with the following rules, during the period from 26 May 1988 to the reckoning time:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the balance from time to time is not to exceed the original 25 May balance and is not to be less than nil;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) subject to paragraph (a), an amount deposited with the ADF by the depositor before 1 July 1989 is to be added to the balance;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) subject to paragraph (a), an amount repaid to the depositor from the ADF is to be deducted from the balance;</PARA>
<PARA> ``eligible depositor'', in relation to an ADF, means:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a depositor whose 55th birthday occurred on or before 25 May 1988; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a depositor whose 50th birthday occurred on or before 25 May 1988 and who, on or before that date, made a deposit with the ADF that consisted wholly or partly of the roll-over (within the meaning of Subdivision AA of Division 2 of Part III) of an eligible termination payment, being an eligible termination payment that included a concessional component (within the meaning of that Subdivision);</PARA>
<PARA> ``fixed interest complying ADF'', in relation to a year of income, means a complying ADF where both of the following conditions are satisfied:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) not less than 90% of the amount that, apart from this section, would be the normal assessable income of the ADF of the year of income consists of either or both of the following:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) interest or a payment in the nature of interest;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) an amount included in assessable income under Division 16e of Part III;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) at no time during the year of income did the assets of the fund consist of or include any of the following:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) units in a PST;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) CS policies issued by a life assurance company or a registered organization;</PARA>
<PARA> ``original 25 May balance'', in relation to an eligible depositor, means the amount of the deposits (together with accumulated earnings) standing to the credit of the depositor as at the end of 25 May 1988;</PARA>
<PARA> ``reckoning time'', in relation to an ADF in relation to a year of income, means the beginning of the year of income, or such other time during the year of income as the ADF elects in accordance with subsection (3). </PARA>
<PARA> `(5) This section does not apply to an ADF in relation to a year of income unless the Commissioner is satisfied that the whole of the benefit that would accrue to the ADF from the application of this section in relation to the year of income has been, or will be, passed on to eligible depositors.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment will provide an exemption from the 15 per cent earnings tax for a proportion of the assessable income of certain approved deposit funds (ADFs) that derive most of their income as interest. The exemption will apply to income that is referable to the deposits held in funds as at 25 May 1988 by two groups of depositors. The first group consists of people who are aged 55 years or over at that date. The second group consists of those who are aged 50 years or over at 25 May 1988 and who, on or before that date, had rolled over into the ADF all or part of an eligible termination payment that consisted wholly or partly of a bona fide redundancy payment, an invalidity payment or an approved early retirement scheme payment. Where such depositors withdraw any of their 25 May 1988 balances, the amount of the exemption the ADF is entitled to will ordinarily be reduced to reflect that withdrawal. However, the exemption will not be reduced to the extent that a person re-deposits amounts previously withdrawn with the same ADF by 30 June 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> To qualify for the concession an ADF must satisfy two conditions at all times from the 1988-89 year of income to the year in which the exemption is claimed. The first condition is that the ADF must receive at least 90 per cent of its investment income in the form of interest. Secondly, the ADF must not have any investments in pooled superannuation trusts or life assurance policies. This condition will ensure that funds do not obtain tax exemption on their direct investments while effectively deriving significant non-interest income through indirect investments of those kinds. </PARA>
<PARA> A fixed interest ADF will not be entitled to imputation credits to the extent to which any franked dividends that it receives are exempt. The Government understands that this amendment meets Australian Democrats' concerns that people in the circumstances that I have described ought to be protected from the impact of the tax on ADF earnings. The amendment makes it a requirement that fund managers pass on to the depositors in question the benefit of the concession provided. I commend the amendment to the Committee. I have already tabled a supplementary explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make only a couple of other comments. The first is that the Government-I do not think that this is news to anybody-would rather the Bills had been passed as they were presented. These amendments will involve some additional complications. However, the Government made the judgment that it is better to make this concession in order to ensure that the package of Bills is passed, thereby removing the possibility that some 300,000 people who received lump sum payments in this financial year, taxed at the rate applicable in this legislation, would not receive an additional and, as the National Mutual described it, an effectively retrospective taxation slug. </PARA>
<PARA> It is different to the amendment first proposed by the Democrats and rejected by the Senate last Thursday week in so far as it is much better targeted than the original proposal. Of course, that has made it more acceptable, or should I say less objectionable, to the Government than the original Democrat proposal. Senator Watson in particular has indicated that he sees a lot of problems with this and that the Opposition has had advice from somebody or other; I cannot anticipate what that is. I just draw to the attention of the chamber the fact that 13 days ago Mr Connolly was claiming that the amendments that the Opposition moved in the Senate two weeks ago were not defective, that is, defective when measured against what the Opposition meant them to do. He also claimed that they had been scrutinised and approved by the industry. As I said earlier today, it would be interesting to know who in the industry had conducted that scrutiny and given the tick. Clearly it was someone almost unbelievably incompetent, given that the person worked in the industry and did not pick up the defect in the amendments originally moved by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not my intention to speak again on this amendment. But, in view of some of the things that have been said already, and probably will be said again, I draw attention to a letter dated 2 June 1989 from the AMP Society, which was circulated to householders in the Australian Capital Territory recently. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> In the midst of government legislation, three facts emerge quite clearly. </PARA>
<PARA> First, that future government age pensions will not be adequate for most of us. With an ageing population, it will be extremely difficult for the government to fund future pensions for everyone at the level we would like. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, that the government is still encouraging you to provide for your own retirement benefits. This is clearly evident through changes in legislation that continue to favour Superannuation as an investment. </PARA>
<PARA> And third, that Superannuation is still one of the most attractive long term investments. In fact, it is one of the most tax-effective forms of investments available today. </PARA>
<PARA>Later the letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> An additional change that may have created confusion was the introduction of a 15% levy tax on all tax-deductable contributions (less expenses). We will be writing to you later in the year about this. This levy will be mainly offset by lower rates of tax than previously applied on benefits taken in retirement. In this way your after-tax position at retirement remains virtually unchanged and indeed may be enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not sure whether the AMP Society is the largest superannuation fund in Australia, certainly, it is one of the larger ones. To my knowledge, that is the most recent assessment of the AMP. Of course, it is well known that National Mutual has been publicly supportive of the Government with this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Watson should have read the press statement that Eric Mayer sent out a couple of weeks ago when he was aghast at having discovered the amendments being moved by those opposite. Senator Haines has already quoted the relevant section from a letter written by the General Manager of the Commonwealth Bank regarding the Commonwealth Bank fund because it had been believed that there would be difficulties in amending trust deeds. I am not really sure whether there would have been difficulties, but the final six or seven lines of the amendment have been put in because the benefits of the concession must be directed towards qualifying depositors and not spread across depositors generally. We understand, and the Commonwealth Bank clearly agrees with us, that this has removed the difficulty, if any, that amending trust deeds would have entailed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) of relevance. He wants the Bill passed; yet, to take people's attention away from the thrust of the Government's amendment, he has introduced extraneous factors which are of no relevance to the provisions. We should get on with the job of dealing with the provisions before the Committee. The conditions with which an approved deposit fund (ADF) will have to comply as a result of these Government amendments are interesting. There are two conditions: the first is a requirement that not less than 90 per cent of the fund's investment income must be in the nature of interest. Some of these funds perhaps have within them a growth fund or an equity linked fund. What is the provision in the Bill to separate the components of the ADF for the purposes of fixed interest? Each is not a legal entity. There could be difficulty in funds complying with this 90 per cent requirement because an ADF is a generic term and, within the umbrella of a fund there may be different sectors each with a different intent and each with a different purpose. There is no mechanism in this Bill to bring out the different components within an ADF in order to comply with these requirements. Does this mean that these new provisions will excise a number of ADFs that Senator Haines-perhaps naively-hoped would be included? That is the first problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, ADFs cannot have investments in pooled superannuation trusts or life assurance policies. Another requirement which I think represents a further exclusion is that a fund must be a continuously complying fixed interest ADF. This means that at all times since its inception the fund must have been complying. That is another avenue for exclusion of ADFs. Senator Haines has really had the wool pulled over her eyes. </PARA>
<PARA> The next matter, I think, requires some comment from the Minister. It concerns a fixed interest ADF. The Minister will know that there are many trustee sorts of companies and others who nowadays, because of increasing interest rates, have what are known as flexible deposits with a flexible and varying interest rate. They have one interest rate one quarter and, if the general level of interest rates rises, their rate will go up. Do investments in these sorts of funds come within the definition? On an ordinary person's reading of the clause, flexible interest rates, which are very common nowadays, appear to be excluded. Why was it necessary to use the words `fixed interest'? It was not necessary. The Opposition is becoming very suspicious nowadays because every word seems to have a hidden meaning. I think there is the potential for excluding a lot of ADFs, which may be 89 per cent and they have a 3 per cent portfolio, which pushes them over into the 92 per cent category, and they are excluded from the very provisions that we are trying to encourage as a result of this Government amendment today. </PARA>
<PARA> There are so many weaknesses in this whole shabby deal which has been devised by the Government to let the Democrats off the hook. That is really what it amounts to. Basically the Government has got its way. Senator Walsh has almost got his original Bill, so he should not apologise to anybody. All he has done is put in a lot of complications which have the effect of achieving his original intent anyway. Well done! He has hoodwinked the Democrats in a major way. So we have the problem of flexible interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Now let us come back to the substance of what the Government is trying to achieve. Many ADFs, as I mentioned, have what are known as various sub-funds, with each sub-fund having a separate investment philosophy. We hope that each sub-fund will be treated separately within the proposed amendments; otherwise, members with capital-stable sub-funds will be disadvantaged. We must get an answer to that. The Minister should respond. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just had confirmed what I believe. First, as a question of law, I am advised that the Government cannot legislate for all the sub-funds which are within some funds. I think Senator Watson has been told this before. That is because sub-funds are not legal entities. Legislation can only be directed to something which can be identified as a legal entity. The answer to Senator Watson's last question is very similar. What overall fund managers do to the various sub-funds they control is really a question for the fund managers. It is not something for the Government or, it seems to me, something that the Government could get involved in if it wished to. I should add this qualification: the last six or eight lines of the amendment require the ADF to pass on to the qualifying depositors the benefits of the tax concession, if any.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Tasmania)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(5.14)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the great majority of cases they will not be able to pass on the concessions. I only hope Senator Haines listened to that response, which is the biggest letdown we have heard today. The Australian Democrats must acknowledge the reality. The Government cannot say it is not responsible for how the sub-funds make up their ADFs, but surely it will acknowledge what is commercial practice and legislate accordingly. It has effectively denied all these sorts of funds-the whole packet-the concession the Government says they are entitled to under this legislation. What a hoax! I hope everybody here acknowledges what has just been said. The Government will place beyond the legislation, beyond the amendment, the great majority of ADFs and particular things that it is supposed to be legislating for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I repeat: these approved deposit funds, which have various sub-funds each of which has a separate investment philosophy, will now be placed at risk in relation to the amendment devised between the Government and the Democrats. That is disappointing. It is disgusting. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point is that considerable complexities are involved in translating the exemptions into unit pricing. For example, mechanisms will have to be established which will pass benefits of the proposed exemption to the defined eligible depositors. Instead of an ADF having a particular unit price, I suppose it will have three unit prices-one for the general body which has been missed out, one for the 55-year-olds and over, and another for the people who have been retrenched in the age 50 and over category. That alone will create more administrative complexity. I remind the Minister for Finance that that surely must discriminate against a great body of people. If some get a benefit to the detriment of others, there must be people who will be disadvantaged. Hence Senator Bishop had a valid point in relation to the numbers of people that would be affected-perhaps not in a significant way but who would nevertheless be affected as a result of the change. I remind the Minister that it is likely that the not inconsequential cost involved will be spread over all the ADF members and not just those who stand to benefit. That is an essential principle of trust law. They cannot allocate those costs to a particular group that supposedly benefits. In other words, the people who will be disadvantaged will be disadvantaged further because the costs of administration will be spread over the whole fund because they cannot, according to trust law, allocate this to particular categories. It is another inequitable situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth point is that the proposal discriminates against similar persons who have invested in personal super, deferred annuities and pooled superannuation trusts (PSTs). The amendment, as we have mentioned earlier, does not pick up all intended persons. Unfortunately, it has a retrospective application and trust deeds will have to be amended. Because the Government has introduced all these new amendments there will be a whole host of new problems which have to be spelled out somewhere. Up to date nobody has had the guts to come forward and spell out what all these problems will be. There are administrative difficulties with the proposed amendments. These must be added on to the enormous costs of this initial package. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at these new problems. The funds have now got the problem of identifying depositors aged 55 at 25 May 1988. They will have the problem of identifying depositors over 50 on 25 May 1988 who have received concessional components in their eligible termination payments (ETPs). This date is not ordinarily recorded on computer files. It means that the superannuation funds, ADFs and so on will have to examine each statement of the termination payment for each member over 50 at 25 May 1988. Naturally that exercise will be quite time consuming but at least it will be a one-off exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> Then the investment criteria present no problem for certain types of approved deposit funds if they are all of the fixed interest component type. But I have just given an example to show that not all the ADFs are of the fixed component type. They have a fixed component element in one subgroup and a flexible component in another. That will rule the whole of the ADF ineligible by virtue of these provisions. There will have to be a retrospective adjustment for depositors, in one case, over 50 and, in the other case, over 55 who withdrew since 1 July 1988. That will involve checking the details of each payment made and adjusting the person's interest on allocation and the pay as you earn taxes as applicable. </PARA>
<PARA> For the large funds that exercise will really be quite onerous in checking back on people who have fallen into this category. We then have the problem of how we will allocate interest for eligible depositors. They will now be on a different basis from other fund members. Again, this will present record-keeping difficulties and some changes to their already complex new software which they had to introduce just to accommodate the original changes. Again, the position is unclear of what happens to benefits which are rolled over into a fund which qualifies for special tax treatment in another fund. If an eligible depositor is aged 55 plus and held a deposit in another approved fund as at 25 May 1988, what happens if he rolls over that fund into another ADF? Presumably the aggregate of the current 25 May balances is increased in one fund. But the rules of one fund might be different from the rules of another into which he has rolled over. How can one meet the continuously complying section of those poor unfortunate people who have moved out of one fund with a particular company and into another where investment was, in one case, segmented and, in the second, a whole ADF fixed interest component? They will be disadvantaged. I would like the Minister's response to that in due course. </PARA>
<PARA> We have this term `aggregate of current 25 May balances'. This causes further confusion, uncertainty and doubt. Is it adjusted for interest allocated to the depositor or will it exclude the effect of the interest allocations? If we exclude the interest, there would be special administrative difficulties. They would have to keep separate records of members' balances at 25 May and the interest earned. Any withdrawal would then have to be split into interest and capital at 25 May 1988 component. This will be almost impossible to accommodate. Similarly, new deposits will need to be broken into components backdated to 25 May 1988. Not only will we have a complete shemozzle but the Government will also find at the end of the exercise that it will be passing the benefit to very few people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Now that the Government's amendments are before us, there are several things that need to be drawn attention to. The first is to answer the points made by Senator Walsh concerning the manner in which the Government chose to deal with the Opposition's amendments. The first thing to say, of course, is that the amendments that were introduced initially into this chamber on 25 May were exactly the same amendments as were introduced into the lower House. It is interesting to note that during the debate in that place not one query or point was raised. I listened to Senator Walsh answer a question of mine at Question Time when I said how interesting it was that the Government chose only to draw people's attention to this technical deficiency at 10 o'clock in the evening. He was at great pains in an answer to a question to say, `No, it was not 10 o'clock in the evening, it was half past nine'. Again, we see the red herring being drawn across the trail. Is the Minister for Finance so contemptuous of this chamber that he believes that the Government has no need to take seriously anything that is moved other than in the House of Representatives? Is that the reason why we did not discover it until half past nine at night? Is the reason that Senator Walsh holds the Parliament in contempt?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us take a look at what happened after that. Let us look at the difficulty that the Government had drafting the amendments to accommodate the Democrats. Let us see what happened when I asked on several occasions whether I could have those amendments. I was told that I could not have them. We then started to hear the scuttlebutt-`The Government has been working on them for well over a week now but it really cannot come up with the answer. The Democrats haven't given their kiss of approval to them yet'. In the final analysis, we did see the amendments, because of Senator Watson's good prodding of the Minister. The Minister said he would give us 24 hours notice of his amendments so that we could at least have a look at them and appraise them. We were told that there was some disquiet that came from the Democrats on that count because they really thought they ought to have them exclusively. Whether that is true only they can say. </PARA>
<PARA> Having seen those amendments and having had other folk look at them in the short space of time available, it became quite apparent there were many things that were problematical about the amendments, not the least of which is the question of the ability to change the trust deeds, legally or otherwise in a retrospective manner. Before I go on to deal with the legal opinions and views that are held, I would like to complete the story of the behaviour of the Government with regard to the amendments and how they were dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will note that following Senator Walsh's 9.30 p.m. revelation that somehow our amendments were technically flawed-that was very simply that the No. 2 Bill which was then before the Parliament required a further amendment to include pooled superannuation trusts-the rest of the amendments, of course, were made to the superannuation Bill which was a separate Bill which was introduced by the Government six months after the No. 2 Bill, which, as I have said before, was originally the No. 6 Bill of 1988, was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the complex nature of the legislation and the manner in which the Government had chosen to present that legislation, Senator Chaney requested assistance from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and perhaps of the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of the Treasury officials to assist in the drafting to ensure that good and solid debate took place and that the drafting was really up to scratch. Senator Walsh declined that request. Senator Walsh having declined that request, we then went back to the parliamentary Clerks who were unable to deal with the drafting themselves and had to go out to the private sector. The private sector was most helpful and we eventually had the required amendments which have been moved and sadly defeated in this place today. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation we have now reached is that the Democrats did not quite like what the Government put up to them because they were concerned about the question of amending trust deeds. What did they do? I read in one version in the paper that they were actually going to put some sort of explicit instruction in the legislation which would authorise, in very specific words, the trustees to alter their trust deeds. But it does not do that. I go back to a very rare document which one really cannot get in this place any more-the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 1989 supplementary explanatory memorandum that accompanied the original amendments. The last paragraph on page 1 says:</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the amendment is to relieve eligible depositors from the impact of the tax otherwise payable by an ADF on income attributable to those depositors' investments in the ADF at 25 May 1988. It is expected that ADFs which qualify for the exemption will pass on the benefit of the exemption to eligible depositors. </PARA>
<PARA>It `intends'; there is no compulsion. It is not required. It is simply an expression that we hope that it will all happen some how. No wonder the Democrats were not satisfied with that. To comply with the Democrats' so-called wish, desire or assumption, many approved deposit funds (ADFs) would have to amend their trust deeds retrospectively. How did the Government deal with that problem? It brought back yet another wonderful supplementary explanatory memorandum. This one is readily available. Somehow, we pretended this one did not exist! The explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the amendment is to relieve eligible depositors from the impact of the tax otherwise payable by an ADF on income attributable to those depositors' investments in an ADF on 25 May 1988. It is to be a precondition of the exemption that ADFs pass on the benefit of the exemption to eligible depositors. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Minister to explain to me how that is an explicit instruction to a trust manager or a trustee to have the power to retrospectively change those trust deeds. In dealing with that question we were able to get some legal advice. We had some advice from a Queen's Counsel (QC) in Melbourne. The Senate will be surprised to hear that on this occasion Melbourne and Sydney are in agreement. The QC said that he had been able to see the Government's amendments as they were given to us-by the Democrats-last night. A person from the Treasurer's office said to me last night that I could have the amendments within half an hour. When that did not occur I rang the office of the Minister for Finance and was told that I could have them at 9 o'clock this morning. We were due to sit at 9.30. I received them at 9.10 a.m. In the interim, the Australian Democrats had the decent courtesy to let me have a copy of them. That is an example of the contemptuous way in which this Government treats the Opposition. Subject to those restrictions, the QC stated:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) beneficiaries under a superannuation deed may obtain accrued rights;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) those accrued rights are legally enforceable and would take a very clear expression of legislative intent indeed to alter those accrued rights;</PARA>
<PARA>Where is that intent? He went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> (c) some trust deeds may provide the power to make retrospective variations to trust deeds in which case any such accrued rights are subject to that overriding right of the trustee-see for example Perpetual Trustees W.A. Limited -v- Corporate West Management Limited &amp; Others 13 ACLR 568;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) in the absence of such a power in the trust deed accrued rights could not be validly altered by the trustee;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) a direction by legislation to a trustee to alter accrued rights would not be by itself sufficient to alter those rights;</PARA>
<PARA> (f) the retrospective alteration of accrued rights can usually only be justified by the trustee acting bona fide;</PARA>
<PARA> (g) it is not clear that a trustee directed by legislation to retrospectively alter accrued rights would be acting bona fide. It would depend on a number of circumstances difficult to project in the absence of sighting the legislation, looking at the trust deed etc. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that if the relevant legislation comes to light and if they could cite the relevant deeds he would be pleased to give a further opinion. Some views expressed in that hastily prepared opinion remain true of the law of equity. Very specific legal problems have been alluded to with which I will deal later. Advice on those problems was given by a senior legal counsel with one of the major players in this field. We also have and advice which has been provided by Mr R. J. Ellicott, QC, on the instruction of Minter Ellison. He also gives an important opinion. The advice states:</PARA>
<PARA>I have been asked to advise in relation to the proposed amendment (s.290a) to the above Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The intent of the amendment is to exempt a proportion of income from the 15% tax to protect eligible depositors, i.e. depositors who, by definition, meet certain age criteria. However, the exemption is not to apply unless the Commissioner is satisfied that the whole of the benefit has been or will be passed on to eligible depositors with an ADF. An ADF is, I am instructed, a trust which is normally constituted by a trust deed and which confers rights and benefits on the beneficiary/depositors. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not had the benefit of considering an example of such a deed for the purpose of this advice but, in the circumstances, this is not essential because, as will appear, my advice is general in character and relates to trust law generally. </PARA>
<PARA>I advise as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Where rights have become vested in depositors as a result of the provisions of a trust deed it would not be possible to deprive them of their rights without their consent. </PARA>
<PARA>2. A trust deed might sometimes contain a power to divest contingent rights or to vary the interests of beneficiaries. However, in the absence of such powers or of power in a court to vary a trust, the trust deed must operate according to its terms and it will not be possible to divest vested rights. Similarly, rights to future income from a fund cannot be changed unless provisions enabling a relevant variation of the trust exist. </PARA>
<PARA>3. Thus if a deed provided that the net income after deduction of expenses including any tax should be distributed in certain proportions among depositors, it would not be possible for trustees to alter the effect of that provision unless there was some power to do so. Proposed sub-section (5) would not in my view, by itself, be sufficient to confer that power. Depositors who had such rights could of course sue the trustee if it attempted to satisfy sub-s.(5) in disregard of the trust deed. </PARA>
<PARA>So the Government is setting up potential legal actions. The advice further states:</PARA>
<PARA>4. The result of the application of these principles is that it may not be possible in many cases pursuant to sub s. (5) of proposed s. 290a to satisfy the Commissioner that a benefit from the tax exemption has been or will be passed on. </PARA>
<PARA>WARDELL CHAMBERS</PARA>
<PARA>15th June 1989</PARA>
<PARA>R. J. ELLICOTT QC</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Minister: where in the legislation is the type of instruction indicated by the Melbourne QC? Will the Minister respond to the point raised by Mr Ellicott that we cannot retrospectively alter the deed to take away already existing vested rights or those that exist in the future? I would be pleased if the Minister would provide me with an answer now so I can go on to deal with why the legislation does not do what it purports to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Watson asked me a question which related to the term `fixed interest complying ADF' which appears at the top of page 5 of the amendment circulated by the Government. Senator Watson was afraid that the definition of `interest qualifying'-I do not know why it is in inverted commas-would be taken literally. My advice is that that term is essentially meaningless in the context in which Senator Watson has raised it and that the critical definition is the one that appears in paragraph (a) (i) which says `interest or a payment in the nature of interest'. That phrase is very common in legislation. It has a well-defined legal meaning. It can be defined as interest in the broadest sense.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for his confirmation on that issue, but I would be far happier with the definition if it said `interest means' rather than `interest consists of'. We have a specific term but later on it does not say that it means something; rather, it says that it `consists of'. For the purposes of the record I hope that funds can rely on that definition because it could be quite significant in determining whether they meet the 90 per cent requirement. The proposed new section states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>This section does not apply to an ADF in relation to a year of income unless the Commissioner is satisfied that the whole of the benefit that would accrue to the ADF from the application of this section in relation to the year of income has been, or will be, passed on to eligible depositors. </PARA>
<PARA>Very few people would understand that the whole purpose of that is to give them authority to change their trust deeds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I assure the Minister that it will be necessary to change the trust deeds. This is an attempt to provide clarification. But if we take away a benefit from a particular category and give another benefit to somebody else, it is necessary to change the trust deeds. At the same time I would have thought that we would have to canvass all the people who were affected. From a practical point of view, can the Minister see people actually answering the question, `Are you happy to have your benefits under this trust deed reduced'? Who will answer yes to that inquiry? Nobody will answer with, `I am happy about having a trust deed altered so that my previous entitlement will be reduced because of a need to satisfy a cosy deal between the Government and the Australian Democrats'. I put it to the Minister that this is not adequate. Senator Bishop has outlined several legal opinions which indicate that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problem with the amendment that I have just referred to is that it is too general; it leaves a discretion. To cover adequately the issue that the Government intends to cover, it would have been necessary that the legislation specifically detail and outline or make clear that some beneficiaries will be discriminated against in relation to the benefit. We would be much happier if the Minister could help the debate by tabling the legal opinion that gives effect to the legislative amendment that he has put before us here today. Has he an opinion from the legal section of the Australian Taxation Office or the Attorney-General's Department? That would certainly aid the debate. If he has it, I ask him to table it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As far as I know, the amendment was drafted in the normal way. I have just been advised that there is no legal opinion. I am not sure that Senator Watson has understood this properly. He keeps talking about taking a benefit away from some other person in the fund. This amendment ensures that, unless this benefit from a tax concession is passed on to qualified depositors, the fund does not get the benefit of the tax concession. By definition, no benefit will be taken away from some other member of the fund if the trust deed is changed. I am not sure whether Senator Watson has understood that. I have put it on the record and I really cannot see any point in continuing that discussion. He may not agree with the Government. That is his right. He may not agree with it on policy grounds or on legal grounds, but the Government believes it is sound and I do not see much point in continuing the argument.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) is not doing this deliberately to confuse my position. I have previously indicated that because of this series of amendments-I was not referring to subclause (5); I acknowledge that subclause (5) was necessary to give effect to the need to change the rules-there will be various unit prices. The Government will certainly discriminate against certain people if it is to give added benefits to others. That has to be reflected in some way in the trust deed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The argument that the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) has just put shows how cynically he regards this whole exercise. I hope that the Australian Democrats listened and paid attention to that degree of cynicism. By this further amendment to clause 5 (c), which requires the total distribution to eligible depositors to be made before the benefit can accrue, the Minister is effectively wiping out any benefit to so-called eligible depositors who are in funds where the trust deed requires that that benefit be distributed across the board. In other words, the Government is effectively locking them out, as it has done at every stage in this debate. Let us look at it. The Government has effectively locked out a fixed ADF which has 99 per cent of its investment in fixed interests. If one unit is held in a pooled super trust, it is out of action; it is barred from getting the benefit. It is not just barred for that year of income: it is barred for the entire quarantine period-potentially a 15-year period. The point is that, at every turn where the Government has allegedly attempted to accommodate the Australian Democrats, it has gone out of its way to make fewer and fewer people eligible for the benefit to be paid. I seek leave to table the advice of Mr Ellicott, QC, because it is pertinent to this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Senator BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was indeed a well considered opinion on the time constraints. The abuse and the lack of concern that the Minister shows for the parliamentary process are indeed contemptible. A press release dated 13 June put out by TPF&amp;C Consultants-a well-known group of actuaries that the Minister had the temerity, on one occasion, to call a group of `management consultants', when in effect it is the world's second largest actuarial consulting company-drew attention to some of the points raised. It said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many ADFs do not presently allow different classes of investor and may not be able to retrospectively amend their rules. </PARA>
<PARA>Well, the Minister has taken care of that! If the Government does not retrospectively amend, if it does not make it possible for certain people to be advantaged, no benefit accrues at all. What a cynical exercise!</PARA>
<PARA> Another little pitfall for players is the 90 per cent rule. It is based on normal accessable income of the ADF. If an ADF could accidentally fail in this test due to the fluctuations in the interest rates or other causes, once failed it is barred forever-not just in that year, I remind the Committee, but barred forever. Indeed, perhaps then somebody who is an eligible depositor could take action and sue the trustee because he or she had allowed this to occur. What a minefield we are creating!</PARA>
<PARA> Let us take a look at how realistic the purpose set out in the second of the supplementary expenditure memoranda dealing with the aim of the amendments is. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The amendment will exempt from tax a portion of the investment income of a complying approved deposit fund that receives most of their income as interest. The income to be exempt is broadly part of the ADF's normal assessable income-that is income other than taxable contributions and certain non-arms length income that is taxable at the top personal marginal rate attributable to amounts held on deposit including accumulated earnings at 25 May for certain eligible depositors. </PARA>
<PARA>What does that really mean? What is the real intention? If one is an eligible depositor, will one gain an exemption for all the interest paid in respect of the deposit? Not likely! Let us take an example. I understand that this example has been made available to the Australian Democrats as well. I hope that when they read the example they will pay attention and perhaps they will decide to support our clause of intent of the Parliament when I move that subsequent to these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> Will the amendment to section 290a (2) exempt from tax all future investment income on balances which were continually complying fixed interest ADF as if they had been quarantined from the 15 per cent investment tax? Together with accumulated earnings, which would appear within the clause, the definition of `aggregate current balance' does not appear in the definition of `aggregate of current 25 May balances' for the calculation of the proportion of the total income of the ADF which is exempt. Thus, if a 50 years old depositor has $50,000 and has been invalided out, is in an ADF and is an eligible depositor as at 25 May, by the time the depositor reaches the age of 65, it will accumulate to $208,862 if the ADF earns 10 per cent per annum interest. Of this $158,862, $75,000 relates to the interest on the $50,000 deposit without compounding but $83,862 is the interest on the interest. The amendment of the Government and the Democrats would not appear to exempt the $83,000. That is, more than one half of the expected investment income which they pretend will be exempt will not be exempt. Is that honest? Is that clearly defined legislation? Is that coming clean with the 100,000 depositors?</PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider the same type of example in the breakdown step so that we can all understand. Let us assume that there is a fund catering solely for persons who were eligible depositors as at 25 May. Let us say that at that date the aggregate of current 25 May balances was $1,080 and that figure would increase to $1,200 by 30 June 1989. In the year ending 30 June 1989 section 290a would not exempt all of the $120 of the income but only $108, because under the formula that is laid down in the Government's amendments if we divide the $1,080 by 1,200 and multiply it by 120, we get $108. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go through the process year by year. Let us say that by 30 June the following year another $150 had been earned. We apply the section again. We go through the same exercise. We divide the $1,080 by 1,500, multiply it by $150 and the exempt sum is $108. We do it for the following year. The sum of $1,080, being the basic sum, is divided by 1,500 and multiplied by 150-because that was the interest earned-giving us $108 as the exempt sum. That is only 72 per cent of the income of the fund which was 100 per cent correct for eligible depositors. As we go on, less and less of the sum that is invested attracts the exemption. Is that honest? Is that coming clean? Is it pretending to do one thing and doing another?</PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is so complicated-deliberately and by design-that it has confused many. It will be a turn-off for many. It has exposed the deliberate obfuscation which this Government goes in for. And the Democrats fell for it. Remember that letter of congratulations that come to the Opposition and to the Democrats? `Thank you', it said to us, `for looking after our rights'. People are certainly not going to thank this Government for looking after their rights and they are not going to thank the Democrats either. </PARA>
<PARA> In this complicated convoluted legislation we are debating, the Government stands condemned by its own falsity in pretending to do one thing and meaning another, just like the Treasurer's statement which we have exposed here today. He tried to confine the statement that nobody would be 1c worse off but allowed the community at large to believe something else. That is the practice of this Government. Perhaps the Prime Minister can shed some tears for the way the Government is behaving today. Perhaps they would be more honest tears if one could honestly believe that this Government had a skerrick of concern for superannuants, people who are trying to provide for themselves, trying to work for a better Australia. What a shameful exercise we have seen in this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA>In moving our amendment to insert into the Bill our general purpose clause we are giving the Australian Democrats one last chance.

<PARA> The proposed new clause is very clear. It is designed, as I said right at the outset and as I have said right through this debate, to make superannuation an attractive proposition for people to invest in, to give them that level playing field so that they can be attracted into investing their money for a long term benefit rather than spending their after tax income on instant enjoyment or gratification. We have established very firmly that we need to attract additional people into superannuation if we are to become a more self-sufficient nation with regard to our elderly people. The intent of the Opposition has always been clear. The intent of the Democrats at one stage was clear; they voted with us. We are now going through the shameful experience of seeing them renege and do a deal with the Government. I commend the amendment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The softly spoken and ill-heard words of the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) indeed cement the deal done between the Government and the Australian Democrats. It does seem that the Democrats have decided to select their 100,000 people, cast aside the 5,000 people who are in roll-over funds, discount any importance of those people who are in ordinary superannuation funds, and simply say that it was all too hard and all too difficult. We now have a piece of legislation which, as I said earlier, comes into the category of near enough is good enough. It is a disincentive to savings and for people to enter into superannuation schemes. It is a hideously complex series of Bills. The manner in which it has been dealt with is a disgrace. This final vote will simply be a question of shame. We do not support the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. That is precisely what we are trying to ascertain. That is very much the nub of this whole matter. When we read the second reading speech, we saw that there was to be a commitment of $20m and that the money was to be disbursed over the next 18 months so as to cushion the impact of the reinsurance changes on those funds most heavily affected. Until the Minister gave that response a minute ago, most people were entitled to believe that that would be done in the normal fashion, namely, by payment into the pool and distribution out of the pool on the basis of the need demonstrated by those for whom the pool and the reinsurance arrangements were set up. What we did not realise until we were minded to pursue this bunny down its burrow was that this is a direct subvention to the funds with which the Government has done the deal for this $20m and which have been the primary proponents demanding that this legislation be passed untouched, unamended, unscrutinised, unsunsetted, or whatever the appropriate term of art is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a matter of very considerable significance to us to have clearly on the record that the money will not be paid into the pool. The result of the arguments that we and the Government have had about who supports the reinsurance pool arrangements and what the long term contributions into the pool may or may not have been is now clearly indicated from the Minister's answer that the reinsurance money will go directly to those funds most heavily affected. We know which funds they are in terms of their overall place in the marketplace. It is now a matter of our putting to the Minister: is he able to specify by name the funds-we know which ones they are in a generic sense, namely the newer funds; and we know which particular spectrum of the whole reinsurance market they occupy, namely their general category-described in the Minister's second reading speech in the other place as `those funds most heavily affected'?</PARA>

<PARA> There is one other general question which relates to this Bill and which I might ask the Minister before I come to the specifics of proposed new clause 38a. That is that there has been some misunderstanding-possibly on my part-as to the extent to which the Government is in a position to indicate that it will nominate members to serve on the Senate Select Committee which has been appointed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before we leave the matter of the $20m, I should like to outline to the Minister for Resources what I understand is the purpose and process involved here and get his corroboration that I have properly understood them. As I understand it, the $20m will pass through the reinsurance fund but will not be used for the normal purposes for which that fund was created-namely, to pay certain claims, which are defined in certain ways-but rather to ease the entry into this new scheme of those funds which will be most severely disadvantaged by the introduction of this new scheme. Roughly the proportion of that $20m which will go to each fund will be in proportion to the extent to which that particular fund is adversely affected by the introduction of the new scheme.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That, in the strict limits in which the honourable senator has defined it, is a true interpretation. But I should add that the Government proposes here to change the 35-day liability provision and to see that all 65-year-olds would be eligible under the new provisions, and that the entitlement is expanded to include supplementary benefits as well. The Government wants to change the character of entitlement and the eligibility for entitlement. Because of that, it deems it appropriate to take some money out of the public purse and put it in these funds to make the connection in the transition phase as a one-off provision.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understood that, but the point still remains that the money is not going to meet the actual claims which come out of the fund but, rather, will go to companies which are most affected, given that the rules have changed to include the over-65s as well as the 35-day rule. It is important to get on the record just where that money is going and how it is to be used.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter that I think is important at this stage is the amendment to include proposed new clause 38a. I have been very concerned that since we adjourned on this matter, there has been an intense lobbying campaign. I can only think that a lot of it was generated by the Minister for Resources himself. Quite a bit of the lobbying has been from people who have been misled as to the nature of this sunset clause. The impression has certainly been given to some people that the effect of the sunset clause is to sunset the whole of the reinsurance scheme. I want to put on the record what this sunset clause does. Its purpose is simply to sunset the new arrangements. The application of the sunset clause will mean that the arrangements will revert to those which obtain as of today, so it is only sunsetting the new part of the arrangements and not the whole of the reinsurance pattern. </PARA>
<PARA> It has also been claimed-quite wrongly, I believe-that the application of a sunset clause introduces a high degree of instability into the insurance system. The one thing that the insurance companies desperately need is a much higher degree of stability so that they can plan their premiums and know exactly where they are going. The Government itself has introduced the high degree of instability into the insurance system because it has progressively run the reinsurance pool down over the years and has changed the rules in various ways and it will change the rules by this Bill, as the Minister has said, from the 35-day rule to include also all those over the age of 65. So historically the instability has been introduced by the Government. But there is more than that. This Senate has set up a select committee to inquire into this matter. Clearly, the creation of that committee itself, if it is to do useful work, will result in recommendations for modification to the terms and conditions of private health insurance and, hopefully, somewhat more broadly than that, the whole area of health insurance, including both public and private. Out of that will come recommendations for change so that further down the track there will be change. That is anticipated by the very creation of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The instability in the insurance industry is created not by the sunset clause but by the fact that the conditions in the industry are themselves unsatisfactory, calling into need the creation of a Senate committee, which, hopefully, will bring into existence a report which will recommend changes which will lead to a much greater degree of stability and a much more satisfactory arrangement in the whole area of health insurance, both public and private. The effect of the sunset clause is merely to say to the Government, `You will have three months after that committee reports on 1 March, and in that three-month period you will be on notice either to relegislate the clauses which will be deleted by this sunset clause or, hopefully, to take note of the Senate committee's report and bring into place something better which will introduce longer term stability in the industry'. </PARA>
<PARA> I think everybody agrees-even those most rednecked private insurance companies that are after risk insurance-that they want some level of understanding as to where the Government wants to take the whole area of health insurance over the next five or six years so that they can properly plan their premiums and what sorts of services they provide. Members of the public by the same mechanisms can have some assurance that when they join one or other of these insurance schemes that scheme will remain in place for some reasonable period into the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The sunset clause itself does not introduce the instability. The instability is in the system. The instability will be solved by the report from this committee if the Government chooses to take up the results of that report and relegislate at the end of this year. That, of course, is an inherent part of the Senate committee process. If one were to assume that the deletion of this sunset clause would produce stability one would have to presume that the Senate committee would come up with no recommendations for change or recommendations for change which were not going to be accepted by the Government. The reason for the sunset clause is to say to the Government, `Look, you are on notice, you have to take note of that report when it is available and you will hopefully legislate on such with greater long term stability and a better arrangement will come into existence'.</PARA></TALK.START>

I take it from the very fact that the Government is putting the $20m into the reinsurance pool that it realises that this legislation will have a deleterious effect on the reinsurance arrangements and that is why it is putting in the money. As I understand it now, that money will not be put into the pool at all but it will be kept by the Government and then given out to the newer and closed funds when they become badly affected. I would like the Minister to tell me whether that is fact. What happens if more than $20m is needed to shore up the reinsurance pool? If less than the $20m is necessary, does that mean the Government will not put the whole $20m into the reinsurance pool?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will answer both speakers in the hope that it may bring this debate to a speedier conclusion. I am a bit reluctant to rise and address the Australian Democrats on what has been said by Senator Coulter. But I do not think that I can sit here and allow his remarks about the effect of the sunset clause amendment to pass unchallenged. There is a fundamental misunderstanding about what the effect of his own amendment would be. It would now appear to be on the part of Senator Coulter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrats' amendment to insert a new clause 38a has been something which we have taken a long, hard, close look at. The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has advised that the clause, as it has been drafted, would not achieve the objective of reverting to the existing arrangements after 30 June 1990 if no legislation came through and replaced all of the provision-if we were left without any legislative change following the committee's report. It would not, in the terms of the Parliamentary Counsel, achieve the objective of reverting to the existing arrangements. There would be gaps left in existing legislation. It would make the existing legislation then unworkable. To achieve the objective that Senator Coulter appears to want, the draft would have to say that previous provisions reapply. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed sunset clause is not acceptable to us as it would provide for only a temporary application of new reinsurance arrangements. The temporary application of the new arrangements would not assist in achieving the objectives of the changes, that is, providing support for community rating and assisting the aged and chronically ill who predominantly belong to the longer established open membership funds to maintain insurance at reasonable cost. The amendment would achieve nothing more than very temporary relief with the use of the Commonwealth's $20m one-off contribution. That hopefully may settle the argument between us. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the question that Senator Sheil raised about how the $20m might be used. The $20m is to be paid over 18 months in instalments. It would go to a private account which would be controlled by the Private Health Insurance Administration Council. It would be able to invest and earn interest on that amount if it wished. But the money would be administered through that account in terms of the fund, as I have explained earlier. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This $20m is becoming even more mystical as we go along. The very fact that the Government is giving $20m for reinsurance purposes shows that the Government realises the medical insurance companies will be disadvantaged by this legislation. I now know that it is going into a private fund that will be used for investment purposes. I suppose out of that the Insurance Commission will dole it out a bit at a time to the insurance companies as they get into trouble. The Government has estimated the amount of trouble that they will get into will be $20m. I do not know on what grounds it has estimated that figure. But what say it is $40m or $15m? In other words, it could be more or less than $20m. What will happen to those funds in either circumstance?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not criticise Senator Sheil in any way but may I make this point clear: the objective is to distribute the money quarterly. It is to conclude after 18 months, having disbursed all of the $20m, plus what interest that $20m may have earned. It is to go to those funds which have a real need. It is not intended to be some open-ended arrangement. It is not intended to be a first payment for something that might later occur. It is a flat amount for that purpose. I make the point again that the reason that the Government thinks it is necessary to do this, which in all the circumstances is an unusual step, is that we are conscious that we are expanding the eligibility for all 65-year-olds to be entitled and the range of benefits they can attract. On that basis we think there is a need to make a payment of this sort. That is a fairly straightforward and obvious position.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister in that statement has just admitted that he will distribute more than the $20m. The $20m will be invested and will earn money. The Minister has now said that all of that money will be paid out to the medical insurance companies as they get into a mess. On top of that, it is a one-off payment which he seems to think is some kind of act of grace following the drastic reductions in the Government's contribution to the reinsurance pool. At the present time it is only giving $1m, and after this $20m plus one-off payment the Government will cut out its contribution altogether and will leave the medical insurance companies, the new and closed ones, to fly with whatever feathers they have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am saying that $20m is obviously just an estimate of how much trouble the companies will get into. If the companies do not get into so much trouble, I take it that the Insurance Council, which will invest the money, will not dish out the whole $20m to the reinsurance pool. That is on the one hand. On the other hand, if the insurance companies are in more trouble will the Government help them out of that hole?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will confine my remarks to the specific provisions of clause 38a which is the proposed sunset clause. I wish to make one or two preliminary remarks. The first is that, in criticising the Opposition for the position it has taken, both the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) and now the Voluntary Health Insurance Association of Australia have attempted to raise the question of our commitment to the principle of community rating. I want to make it abundantly clear, so that there can be no misunderstanding of this matter, that the Opposition is committed to the principle of community rating. It does not seek, it will not seek and its forthcoming health policies will not be seeking to derogate from the underlying principle of community rating. Any attempt to infer some other view on community rating related to our position on this particular commitment of ours is absolutely specious.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My second point is that there are some comments which have appeared in today's Age to which I wish to draw attention. An article under the heading `Health changes may be thwarted' says in part:</PARA>
<PARA> But the chief executive of the HBA, Mr Derek Shaw, said the Opposition and Democrats were showing a total lack of understanding of the issues and would `double the problem overnight'. </PARA>
<PARA>One is tempted to draw the inference from that that Mr Shaw and the Hospital Benefits Association are some disinterested parties in this matter whose concerns are purely for the good health of contributors and the Australian population as a whole. Nevertheless, that is quite interesting set against a letter dated 14 June-yesterday-to Mr Shack, the shadow Minister for health. It was signed by Mr A. G. McGregor, the Chairman of Mutual Community Ltd, and it says in part:</PARA>
<PARA>You should understand that this-</PARA>
<PARA>he is referring to the Opposition parties' attitude towards the sunset clause-</PARA>
<PARA>will achieve virtually no benefit and from our company's point of view would not permit us to proceed with a merger with HBA in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>It makes the point that some of the vested interests-not the interests of contributors, not the interests of the sick or the aged, not the interests of the wider Australian community, but the commercial interests of some players in this game-are alleged to be affected, or potentially affected, by this decision. It is upon that basis that a large amount of criticism, to which Senator Coulter has already referred, has been mounted during the last 24 hours. Many honourable senators will undoubtedly have received from the Minister for Community Services and Health, Dr Blewett, a file of papers indicating the extent to which various organisations around the country are opposed to, or do not like, the proposals which are now before us. There are a large number of organisations which accept and applaud the Opposition parties for the steps they have been taking. One press release states:</PARA>
<PARA> Elderly people across Australia would applaud an amendment by the Australian Democrats to the Government's proposed changes to health insurance legislation, according to the president of the New South Wales Council of Senior Citizens, Mr Joe Weston. </PARA>
<PARA>By and large it is a fairly futile exercise to weigh up the number of people who make press statements on one side and the number of people who are cranked up to make press statements on the other side, but it is much easier to relate this to the intrinsic merits of the argument which have been put forward. We are persuaded at this stage of the intrinsic merits of the sunset proposal and the necessity for this matter to be re-examined by the Senate once the three-month period has elapsed following the report of the Senate Committee which we have established and which the Government has now indicated that it will serve on. </PARA>
<PARA> I will make a series of brief remarks which go to the principles which relate both to the sunset clause and to the provisions of the Bill to which that sunset arrangement will be applied. It is unfortunate that in the last couple of years the debate about health and public policy on health has been almost exclusively about money. Senator Peter Baume, both in his contribution to this debate and as Chairman of the former Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare of which, if my memory serves me correctly, both my colleagues who are here at this moment-Senator Walters and Senator Sheil-were members at various times, drew attention to the fact that there is not enough debate about the goals of health policy, about the outcomes of health policy and about evaluation and about whether we are actually achieving those goals and outcomes. Here in the Senate the debate in recent months has been primarily about issues such as pathology fees, pharmaceutical fees, insurance arrangements, reinsurance arrangements and an expenditure of $20m, or whatever it happens to be. The current debate has been influenced very much by issues such as the cost of private health care, schedules of doctors' fees, the rebates and the like. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to get some perspective into this debate which I hope will be one of the achievements of the Select Committee. I hope this achievement will be focused upon when this matter comes back to the Senate. For example, the contribution to the growth in spending on medical services in Australia from 1979-80 to 1987-88 is related very much to the question of expenditure per service. If we look at the figures we will see that approximately 9.7 per cent of the cost of increasing growth in spending on medical services is due to simple population growth; about 24.4 per cent is due to the growth in services per capita; and 65.9 per cent is due to the expenditure per service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition believes that this Government's system is in imminent danger of collapse under the weight of the increasing burdens of public sector expenditure. For example, private sector spending accounted for 45.5 per cent of total recurrent costs in 1970-71, whereas by 1985-86 it had fallen to only 27.5 per cent. Of course the public sector, the taxpayer, has to pick up the cost of the withdrawal of the private sector which has been squeezed out of these areas of expenditures. That is happening at a time when health spending has risen from 5.9 per cent of gross domestic product in 1973-74 to 7.9 per cent in 1986-87. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate that, contrary to what the Government claims, the burden falls very much on those who are least able to afford it. Increasingly, access to better quality health care is a factor of having private health insurance. About 80 per cent of people who had a gross weekly income of more than $800 a week in 1986 had private health insurance compared with only 20 per cent of those whose gross weekly income was less than $126 a week. Frankly, the pressures of this system, which is now being bandaided-pressures of continuing unaffordability of private health care, of private health insurance-have forced people into a greater reliance on the public sector, on the increasing queues in public hospitals around the country. It is not a desirable long term outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> We in the Opposition have consistently said that we want to support and encourage a greater proportion of the Australian people to be in a position to be able to afford and to undertake provision for their own health insurance arrangements, and to be able to buy packages of health insurance which are both affordable and tailored to the particular needs they have. We do not believe that the system which the Government is now propping up achieves those goals and those outcomes. As a result, we believe that the Senate inquiry is an important part of getting some of those facts into the public debate. By passage of this amendment at this stage we will be in a position of requiring the Government to make a response to the recommendations of that Senate Committee within a fairly short period. For those reasons, I indicate that the Opposition supports Senator Coulter's amendment. I trust that this will bring to a conclusion the debate on the health aspects of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill now before us. </PARA>

<PARA>The decision to limit the life of the legislation to 12 months will mean that all health insurers will have to review their attitude to the enrolment of elderly persons. As at the end of 12 months any fund that actively recruited them would face an enormous market disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA>I point out to the Minister-he may care to comment-that in that paragraph what Mr Schneider is suggesting about what may be done or should be done is illegal because that is not the way the funds are supposed to operate under the Act.

Further, the Minister, in circulating that letter and perhaps encouraging the view that that is the way that organisations might behave, is also encouraging illegality.

<PARA> (1) Page 32, after clause 48, insert the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA> Applications for review by Administrative Appeals Tribunal</PARA>
<PARA> `48a. Section 105aab of the Principal Act is amended by omitting subsection (1) and substituting the following subsection:</PARA>
<PARA> `(1) In this section, ``reviewable decision'' means a decision of the Minister, or of a delegate of the Minister, under subsection 40aa (8) or (10), section 40ab, 40aba, 40ac or 40afh, subsection 40ad (1a) or 43a (4), section 44 or 45a or subsection (2) of this section.'. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment seeks to give proprietors of nursing homes the option to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal if the appeal to the Secretary to the Department is unsuccessful. As the legislation stands at the moment, if an appeal to the Secretary is dismissed the next line of appeal is to the Minister responsible for the Department of Community Services and Health. The Opposition feels-to use the cliche that has been used right through this debate-that this is Caesar appealing to Caesar. It is not giving nursing home proprietors very much chance of putting forward their representations to an independent body that can consider their concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> We consider it a very reasonable amendment. It certainly gives nursing home proprietors a chance. It removes the need for the Minister to have to seek advice from his Department when it has already made a ruling that could have gone against a nursing home proprietor. The amendment stands on its own feet. It is clear and simple. I seek the support of the Australian Democrats and of the Committee for this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment relates to the provision of access to the basic 008 facility-that is, a local call cost facility for clients of the Department of Community Services and Health. I understood that this amendment had the support of senators on all sides of the chamber. Indeed, all of us who represent or are concerned about the welfare of constituents in rural areas believe that this amendment will provide greater access to officers of the Department and officers of a number of other departments. Clearly, in the interests of equity, people in rural and regional areas should be able to contact their departmental officers by way of a local telephone call in the same way as do people in urban areas. That is the purpose of the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In reply to interjections that were made during my colleague Senator Powell's speech, it is quite clear that the Opposition does not understand the logic of the correct way to apply this provision. Last week Opposition senators were attempting to tell Telecom Australia that it had to provide a 008 service to a government department that may be unwilling to offer that service. Telecom cannot impose that requirement on a department. We believe that this is the correct place in which to insert such an amendment. It is a request to this particular Department to request Telecom to provide a 008 number.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, if Senator Coulter was here, he did not listen. We proposed an amendment to clause 35 which would have meant that it was the intention of the Parliament that 008 services be provided to agencies and government departments. If the Australian Democrats are suggesting that somehow government agencies and departments could thereby have ignored that provision and not compensated Telecom Australia, they are playing games with words. It is clear that in the course of that debate Senator Powell got very cold feet indeed, to the point where she asked for the matter to be stood down so that we could talk about it further. After having trotted out a number of specious objections as to why it was not a good idea, the Democrats came back into the chamber and suggested that they might be in it after all. Ultimately, the Democrats had the cheek to query us about the cost of the proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose I should not be quite as castigatory as that because that is now the substance of our response to the Australian Democrats' amendment. That was the first and only time we have ever heard the Democrats ask the cost of any proposal which they have put before this chamber. I think that it is high time that we took a responsible request, made for once presumably seriously, in like vein. Accordingly, we will oppose this amendment, but I give notice that in the report stage we will move an amendment to refer the matter to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in order to accommodate that presumably genuine question raised by Senator Powell about the true cost of such a proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> Since that proposal was put forward by Senator Powell, I have indeed had put to me a number of conflicting assessments of the cost from my colleagues and from others, one of which suggested that Mr Howe had said that the Department of Social Security was already providing such a service in every State except Victoria and proposed to introduce the service in Victoria in the near future. If that is the case, it may be that this proposal is not even necessary in that Bill, but the Democrats do not seem to have been aware of that when they tried to move their motion the other day. In respect of all those other government departments which the Democrats now propose be dealt with separately, I think we owe them the courtesy to tell them how much it will cost. If Senator Powell was fair dinkum last time, then she should be fair dinkum now in wanting to know the answer before the Democrats proceed with this proposal, irrespective of knowing the cost. Therefore, we will be moving accordingly. </PARA>

I just want to put these views on the record: I think this is a precious and pretentious little amendment by the Democrats. This is an example of the Democrats trying to govern all things. If one was going to move an amendment like this, I would have thought that, first of all, one would adduce evidence to establish that the Department does not do this when it is necessary. Of course the Department does this when it is necessary. It provides a phone number for people to ring in from the country to find out what the arrangements are with health insurance, health changes and so on. It does that now. It does not need something to be put into an Act to require that to be done. It is a normal administrative provision. It will continue to do those things in the future. This amendment makes it part of an Act. My view would normally be that it does not have a place in an Act. It is better left to be handled administratively. If necessary, if one is unhappy about those provisions, one should go to the Minister and I am sure that he would make sure that it was done. The principle has been accepted by the Government in another piece of legislation. The Government will accept it reluctantly in this piece of legislation. I say: let us get on with the job and pass the rest of the Bill before the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must follow up on what Senator Alston had to say about this 008 telephone number. When it comes to getting a fast buck or a fast vote, the Australian Democrats are pretty good learners. Last week they did not know what a 008 number was. They thought that if a call went into a government department the tab would be picked up by Telecom Australia. Senator Powell could not answer that last week. Senator Alston was pointing out that we were simply putting the facility in that Bill so that Telecom would be prepared for any request by a department to have such a number. The Australian Democrats knew nothing about it. When we pointed out to the Democrats that remote areas as well as closer areas have to have access, we were immediately told by Senator Powell to use the reverse charge facility. I explained at the time that reverse charge calls cost far more than 008 numbers, but they still would not have it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having done their homework since last week and having found out that putting in a 008 number is not an engineering feat of great significance in this day and age, they now have the hide to come back with the hypocrisy to tell us that they have thought about it going in and that every department has to have it. I know that every department has to have it for long distance calls from remote areas. As has been pointed out both in the press and in this chamber, every State except Victoria seems to have this facility. Perhaps Victoria is all built around Melbourne and has not got any remote areas. The Democrats are being very hypocritical. The idea is all right but, as has already been pointed out, the costing must be done. They wanted the costing done last week. Let us do the costing, get on with the game and show it to them. </PARA>

I think the answer to that is no, but if Senator Alston wants me to get some further detail and information for him, I am prepared to do that. But I note, for the record, that Senator Alston has indicated that he wants this to go to a Senate committee to be examined. I suggest that may be the best place for the Government to present its information.

<PARA> In conclusion, I make the observation again that the Department of Community Services and Health provides this service without it being in the Act when there are changes to health legislation, for the purposes of accommodating country dwellers to get access to that information from the Department, and will continue to do so in the future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our approach to this has been that it is a desirable position to reach ultimately, but it is responsible to know what it will cost. I do not see how we are going to be in a position to know that unless we are supported in the reference to the Senate Standing Committee by either the Government or the Australian Democrats. If the Government simply supports the Democrats' amendment sight unseen, we will never know the cost. That is one of the real problems with Telecom Australia's community service obligations. One simply has to accept that they are somehow benefiting the community in a general sense without really knowing what the amount of the burden is. I would have thought that the Government could achieve its objective in acting responsibly in economic terms, the Democrats' objective and our ultimate objective of seeing this included in the legislation by the Government being prepared to have it costed by that committee. We will all then be in a position to make a sensible judgment about the matter. Otherwise, it seems to me that the Government runs into the sort of fundamental principle that Senator Walsh would be hitting you over the head with, which is agreeing to something without knowing what it is going to cost the Government. Surely, that is a pretty fundamental principle as well. I ask the Government to reconsider on that basis as well, because it can accommodate all the valid concerns in the matter if it first has it costed and then we can proceed to implement it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While we are discussing this amendment, I would simply place on record, as I did when the amendment was moved to earlier legislation, that the initial attempt to do something in legislation along these lines did come from Senator Sheil. In our view, it was an attempt, as Senator Coulter has said, which was inappropriate. In terms of the wording of that particular amendment, it was not workable. But it is a shame, once the National Party did start to look at the interests of its constituents and attempt to come up with something in this chamber which was in its interests, that it is cut off at the pass, particularly as Senator Alston has weighed in as a new dry-as-a-bone dry in the Liberals, once again to work against the interests of National Party constituents. The Australian Democrats are certainly not doing that any more than we did on the wheat legislation and any more than we will on this one. It is in legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To a degree, one has to empathise with the position put by Senator Cook that something like this may be better done administratively. When one looks at the provision of 008 facilities across government departments, as I have, one sees that there is a great discrepancy. Unfortunately, the Department of Community Services and Health does not have as good a record as, for instance, the Department for Social Security, which I acknowledged last evening. It is hoped by us, and I thought by the Opposition, that legislating in this way would be an encouragement at the very least. Following the passage of an amendment such as this, it is in the hands of the Department to structure its provision of this access in the best way it can. We believe that is the way it ought to be done by the Department; not through the second-hand method which was attempted initially without the essential costing that the Opposition sees as important now, which was not the case last week. That is the reason I have raised that issue and the Opposition has risen to the bait rather beautifully. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is opposing part 5 of the Bill. The effect of the action that we are taking in the Committee at the moment is to remove the transfer of the community services and health legislation to the Disability Services Act. If we pass this legislation in its present form 4,000 mentally and physically retarded in New South Wales and Queensland alone-I do not know how many more are in other parts of Australia-will be forced out of their nursing homes and sheltered accommodation into suburbia. That may be quite all right for some people. But there are other people who are so physically or intellectually handicapped that they will never be able to cope in suburban type accommodation. This situation has arisen without consultation with the patient's family, or without any consultation with the physically handicapped people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Organisations such as the Challenge Foundation of New South Wales, the Epilepsy Association of New South Wales, the Endeavour Foundation in Queensland, the Society for Crippled Children New South Wales and the Paraplegic-Quadriplegic Association of Western Australia will have to go out into the rental market and rent houses in order to transfer the substantially handicapped persons from sheltered institutions into the real and wide world. The service deliverers will have to meet the massive rents that are being demanded at the moment. These are being inflated as a result of the Government's high interest rate policies. People are having to sell their homes and to move into rented accommodation. My estimate, for Sydney alone, is that about 600 homes would be required to be provided which would already overheat the current rental market. Those organisations would also have to find house parents who are committed and dedicated to caring for four or five severely mentally handicapped people, most of whom require very special attention. Some are not in control of their bowel or bladder movements. The question must be asked: where are these super-dedicated house parents to come from?</PARA>
<PARA> Many welfare organisations have said-these are the people who are expected to provide these services-that these people are not available. I ask the Minister whether he knows how many people are prepared to work 24 hours a day caring for other people's children, who are now adults. A lot of property owners will not want to rent their houses to these types of institutions. Many people will not want handicapped people as neighbours. All of this will happen without any indication from the Government that it will fund these extra charges. One of the major providers of welfare services in New South Wales has indicated that economies of scale will be affected drastically when residents are moved from group or institutionalised accommodation and put into residential care in rented suburban homes. That organisation estimates the cost will be in the vicinity of $60,000 per person as opposed to $15,000 per person in a nursing home. Service providers are strapped for funds already and they are at a loss to know how they will get additional funds. The economy is such that people are struggling to maintain a reasonable lifestyle, to keep a roof over their own heads. Under the present Nursing Homes Assistance Act, the homes are 100 per cent funded. If the nursing homes are placed under the Disability Services Act, the funding will be reduced by between 50 per cent and 80 per cent, depending on the subsidy provided for staff. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to know whether any costing of these charges has been done. I do not believe there has been. An added responsibility, which has been termed legal duty of care, has to be accepted by the welfare organisations. They have to ensure that patients are neither physically nor sexually abused. The staff in nursing homes and sheltered accommodation are currently responsible in that area. It is almost impossible when one house-parent has the responsibility for four or five mentally handicapped people, caring for them 24 hours a day, to meet that obligation. The physically disabled will be isolated by the proposal because of their unique transport requirements. Their physical health will also be put at risk. Transferring handicapped people from the security of the nursing home environment will cause grave practical problems for which the service providers have absolutely no answer. Special accommodation will be required, such as special beds and transport. When these people move into ordinary suburban homes which house only four or five people these necessities will not be able to be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> The welfare organisations-or, as they prefer to be called, the service providers-have given an undertaking to parents, many of whom are very elderly, family and clients that home care for life will be provided for their relatives. The service providers will not be able to give this guarantee under this disability legislation. They cannot honour these commitments, considering the thrust of the Disability Services Act into the community, regardless of the need for client costs. They will be at the mercy of landlords, neighbours and others. How will they get any guarantees that an owner who rents out a house to these community organisations will not want to sell the property in 12 months time because of changing economic circumstances or because of an interstate employment transfer? All these variations have not been taken into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other issues to consider. What happens to the patients' social lives? Those who can work may go to a workshop or a day care centre. Some may be so physically or mentally handicapped that they may not be able to go to work and may be restricted to the house. What happens to them? What happens when the ones who can work come home from work and what happens at weekends? As things stand now, group transport can be organised. Trips to the circus, to the cinema or out into the hills on picnics are arranged for them. Discount rates apply for such bus trips. But, if people are living four and five to a house, these outings and excursions will not be able to be organised. None of these things have been taken into consideration by the Department or the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA> The Opposition certainly wants to improve the quality of life for these less fortunate people. We do not believe that this high risk social experiment will work. It has not worked anywhere else in the world. In some cases patients will be far worse off. This is not only the opinion of my colleague the shadow Minister for community services, the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite). A meeting in Canberra yesterday of the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of the Disabled (ACROD), the peak body of voluntary service providers, passed a resolution supporting the National, Liberal and Democrat motion to refer the matter of accommodation for the disabled to a Senate committee. I certainly welcome the fact that the Australian Democrats supported us in that reference to a Senate committee. They have given these people half a loaf, which I suppose is better than no loaf at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to Senator Coulter that, although we have referred this accommodation problem to a Senate committee, if we let this legislation pass with part 5 included it will not be as effective as we would have liked. Included in the resolution of the ACROD meeting was an appeal to the Democrats to remove part 5 from the Bill. The voluntary service providers in that peak body wanted an opportunity to put their fears and their concerns on these issues before a Senate committee, which could then make a bipartisan judgment on the evidence before it. The ACROD resolution was carried unanimously by 85 executive officers from all over Australia. I appeal to Senator Coulter, with whom I have shared some committee responsibilities and whom I have always found a very compassionate and reasonable man, and to his colleagues to give their support to the peak body on this matter of nursing homes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The intention behind the process in train here seems to be entirely laudable and a move in the right direction. However, in recent days I have become aware of considerable failings in this program on the ground. There seems to be a considerable gap between what is proposed and what everybody agrees is desirable and what is actually happening in nursing homes, particularly the nursing homes caring for people who are mentally handicapped to some considerable degree. It seems that the Government is proceeding without doing what I understand it said it would do, namely, assess the needs of individuals patient or clients to see whether it was appropriate for them to be moved. Moreover, it said that it would not set up proper assessment criteria in the whole program but would find out how well the program was working and feed that information back to modify the program as it went along.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, I have only got a handwritten copy of these. I am reading from them, so it is a bit difficult for me to give them to the Minister for Resources, but I will read them through. I refer to the letter which the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) sent me yesterday. In that letter he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I give you my assurance that the proposed amendments to the NHAA and the subsequent transfer of nursing homes from the NHAA to the Disability Services Act will result in increased independence and support for everyone who is currently in an NHAA home. </PARA>
<PARA>That certainly seems to me to confirm what I have been told by those who are the care givers-that everybody will be shifted out of those homes irrespective of whether it is appropriate or not. That is what the Minister said in his letter. He said `for everyone'. That was the basis of the question. I am encouraged by what the Minister for Resources has said. He is obviously at variance with his senior partner in the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall read these questions through quickly, and perhaps the Minister will get the tenor of them. Does the Minister recognise that there are severely intellectually handicapped people for whom this type of accommodation is not suitable? Evidently he does. What is to happen to these people? I again draw attention to the variation between the reply of the Minister for Resources and that given by the Minister for Community Services and Health in his letter. Does the Minister recognise that the cost of the care in cottage style accommodation for these people will be higher than in nursing homes? Has provision been made for increased funding?</PARA>
<PARA> Will individuals be individually assessed as to their suitability for this changed accommodation? That was apparently the intention but I am led to believe it is not happening. If they are being assessed individually, who is carrying out that assessment? Is the correctness of the assessments being itself assessed? Is the assessment being assessed to find out whether they are appropriate? Who is carrying out that assessment? Have assessment criteria for the appropriateness or otherwise of the whole program been established? I am led to believe that prior to or during the implementation of this program no assessment criteria were set by which its effectiveness or otherwise could be established. If assessment criteria have been set, will the Minister provide them? How well is the program performing by these assessment criteria if the assessment criteria have been set?</PARA>
<PARA> Is the Department of Community Services and Health asking nursing homes and disabled organisations to sign contracts in relation to the new arrangements in which no ongoing funding from government is being offered? I am also led to believe that the contracts are very much one-sided and that the nursing homes either sign the contract or get no funding. Is the Government holding a funding gun at the heads of nursing homes in that respect?</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, have departmental officers inspected the conditions in homes for the intellectually disabled? Is the Minister aware of numerous claims that departmental officers have refused to carry out inspections actually within the homes themselves to find out precisely what the conditions are? I have been told repeatedly that officers have merely visited the offices of the nursing homes and not actually gone into the nursing homes themselves. If the Minister would like those questions more slowly, I can go through them, but I think he has probably got the tenor of them. </PARA>

The Minister for Resources said that there will always be some intellectually handicapped people retained in nursing homes. If large nursing homes which cater exclusively for handicapped people have been told that they have got to abide by the Government's regulations and have their people out in community-based accommodation, and they are left with half a dozen or so people, what viability remains in those nursing homes?

<PARA> The reports came to what I think is an unexceptional, but nonetheless very important, conclusion: that young disabled people are the most disadvantaged people in Australian society, that we ought to be concerned about the quality of life for those people, and that by and large that was obtained when they lived in a more normal environment or an environment akin to that of other Australians rather than in institutions. Therefore, the reports concluded, there was a need to re-emphasise our programs to see that young disabled people had that quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA> In this legislation the Government is trying to deliver on that objective. In making transitions there are always difficulties of implementation. I want to go to Senator Coulter's list of questions soon, but I would like to take a moment to answer what I think was the essential question being asked by Senator Walters. In transferring nursing homes so that they go under the Disability Services Act, it is proposed that a new system of funding-not the old deficit financing system-be introduced. That system of funding is that, for services like podiatry and physiotherapy which are performed in institutions, cost of living indexation will be provided at the current rate of the grants to the institution. Those cost of living indexations would guarantee that the real value of those funds was maintained. The same money amount that is provided now on a per bed basis will be provided and will be indexed so that in real terms it will remain the same. But there is a recognition that there ought to be a meeting of some extra costs. There fore, things like the qualification of employees for long service leave or superannuation, which are not calculated on a per bed basis but occur upon qualification, ought to be picked up too. The Commonwealth will pick them up. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether that answers Senator Walters's question in full but those funding measures are proper and, indeed, necessary on two bases. The first one is that they remove the open-endedness of deficit financing which currently applies. But, secondly, they guarantee the transitional safety net that is necessary in order to bring these changes in. </PARA>
<PARA> I go now to the list of questions that Senator Coulter asked me. I might have some difficulty in reading some of the writing so I will go through the list. I am sure Senator Coulter will correct me if I have misunderstood his question. Senator Coulter's first question related to the intent to transfer all. I have answered that. The answer is no. I do not think there is any difference at all. Senator Coulter is in error if he wishes to read into the contents of Dr Blewett's letter to him and my reply a minute ago a difference. Dr Blewett in his letter is saying that all will benefit and there will be an across the board improvement. That is consistent with what I am saying. It does not mean to say that everyone will transfer out of nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Coulter's second question was, `Do we recognise there are severely handicapped people?', the answer is yes. I am not quite sure what Senator Coulter's third question was. But the fourth question is along the lines of: `Are the costs of care higher under the new proposals?'. The answer to that is: not necessarily. I have said in my answer to Senator Walters that there will be money available to cover the types of costs that Senator Coulter may be concerned about. The fifth question was: `Has provision been made for this funding?'. The answer is yes. Senator Coulter's sixth question was: `Are individuals being individually assessed and, if so, by whom?'. They are being assessed by the organisations concerned. They are the bodies that carry out the assessment. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Coulter's eighth question was whether we checked on those assessments. The answer to that question is that we would largely accept those assessments as being valid. The next question was: `Have assessment criteria for the whole of the program been proposed or is there a set of principles?'. The principles and objectives of the Disability Services Act are the principles and objectives that we hold to assess these people against. They are set out in the Act. The next question was: `How well is the program performing?'. That is a question of what assessment the Department makes of progress thus far. In the Department's view and in the view of the clients by way of commentary to the Department, that program is performing very well. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coulter's eleventh question was a question to the Department about contracts. There was a follow-up question: `Are we holding guns to their heads?'. The answer to that is no; we are not holding guns at people's heads. The contracts are annual contracts for the purposes of the transition. Can Senator Coulter remind me of question No. 13?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for his answer. As I understand it, the services will be kept up to date with consumer price index increases. The present money paid to the individual carers is being paid at the rate that they get at the moment, plus increases, some long service leave and other things like that. As the Minister would realise, if one had a 90-bed nursing home, for instance, and one was told that it had to close and that one had to transfer one's patients to the community based accommodation, the actual care in looking after 90 people in much smaller groups in various accommodation would involve more staff, additional assistance in dressing and showering people and all the assistance that should be given to handicapped people, even feeding and cooking for them. There is an additional cost involved because of the accommodation, staff and extra services as a result of smaller, community based accommodation. I have nothing but praise for the Government if it is able to fund that fully because, as the Minister has said, that certainly will create a far greater benefit to handicapped people. The question that I am very concerned about and it is the concern of the majority of the carers is: how on earth is the Government going to fund this new proposal? Several of the carers in some of the nursing homes have come out with the idea that it will cost at least three times the present cost of caring for each individual patient. I do not know whether they are accurate in their costings. They say that to look after someone in a larger nursing home costs at least three times less than putting that person into community based accommodation. Has the Government taken this into consideration? Where is the money coming from? Has all of this been costed?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walters has raised what I regard as an important point. I will try to answer that point as fully as it requires. The Government's view is that we want to make the transition. There is a general view that that is the desirable outcome and that it would improve the quality of life of these disabled people who are, after all, not geriatrics. They are disabled and they should be treated humanely. There are costs in making that change. I choose these words carefully because it is important to make the point that while we would like to see the transition made by 1992, which is set out as the target date, it is not the Government's intention to bulldoze, force, push or shove. Rather, what the Department has been doing is talking to the institutions and working out, in their particular circumstances, the best outcome that can be attained for them. We are working with the institutions to make the transition. Already nine institutions have made the transition and 21 have applied to do so. That is an indication that the way we are proceeding is the proper way and it meets the needs of the institutions for which Senator Walters may be concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister has not answered my question about the funding. Some of these nursing homes that have not yet made the transition are saying, `It's going to cost us at least three times more per patient to have them in community based accommodation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Resources said, if I understand him correctly, that the assessment of individuals in nursing homes is carried out by those who are the present carers. If a nursing home which has 70 or 90 patients who are seriously mentally handicapped, many of whom are older patients and therefore do not fall within the category in which the Minister attempted to embrace all clients who are being dealt with here, wants to remain open because it deems it totally inappropriate to move those patients into cottage-type accommodation where the problems of nursing and caring for them will be increased and where it will become more expensive, why is such a nursing home told that it must shut, that it must move all its clients into cottage-type accommodation? If that is not true, why did one such home write to Mrs Bedlington, the Director of the Department of Community Services and Health in Sydney, in June 1988 and say that it could not commit itself:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . to any contract unless the eventual terms of it are capable of fulfilment. We will not take the easy course of signing and hoping, if in the process we put the long-term lives of our clients at risk, even at geriatric stages, or impose or seek to impose upon them anything they dislike or may prove detrimental to their health,</PARA>
<PARA>The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>We cannot embark on any transitional measures beyond our considerable achievements, unless we have demonstrated to us that funding will in perpetuity exist . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That may seem an extreme claim, but these people have actually signed contracts with parents, some of whom are now dead, to provide that service themselves and, therefore, they are legally bound to do that. The letter further states:</PARA>
<PARA>We ask that it be made clear that departmental Officers who have said: ``sign or there will be no funds'', were incorrectly stating Government policy or intent, perhaps be reason of over anxiety . . .</PARA>
<PARA>And still further on it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA>We are assured by Officers of your department that the special bulletin is in error when it states ``Until A Disability Services Act contract has been signed . . . services will continue  . . . and will be required to adhere strictly to the requirements . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That all reads very much as though the Department is closing some of these nursing homes, which are providing services to seriously mentally handicapped people who are no longer young, in an attempt to force them into accommodation that is inappropriate. I would like an assurance that that is not the case and that the funding and care of these people, which is appropriate, as assessed by the care givers at the moment, can continue and that the gun is not being held at their heads. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to Senator Coulter's question is that we can give that guarantee. It is not the intention of the Department to force the closure or the transfer of individuals. I will make a general, philosophical observation: when issues of change are involved there is a tendency for anxiety to arise and for criticisms to be based on what could occur and not on what is the case. By and large, that is a problem of bad communication, I suppose. Nonetheless, it is a human foible and I recognise its existence. There are elements of that foible in some of the people who may be making those representations to Senator Coulter. As I said to Senator Walters earlier, the best way of assuaging those fears is to deal with the Department which should work through the case of each nursing home, taking into consideration what future arrangements would be. In terms of the assurance that Senator Coulter seeks about bulldozing or forcing the closure of nursing homes, the answer is no, that is not our intention. The funding is to continue in the way in which I have described which is, I think the honourable senator will agree, in a form that makes it an appropriate provision in these circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister has indicated that the same amount of money will be allocated to nursing homes that is presently allocated with a link to increases in the consumer price index. Senator Walters and, I think, Senator Coulter raised a valid point that I do not believe has been answered yet relating to the cost of this arrangement. The cost of group accommodation is said to be between $15,000 and $18,000 per person. The providers of these services have told us that the cost of community housing could be as high as $60,000 per person. Surely before the Government embarks upon a major move such as this, there must be a costing. The Department must have calculated what it will cost to transfer people from group accommodation into community housing. What is the cost? Surely the Minister does not expect the Committee to pass very important legislation that will affect the lives of disadvantaged people, without knowing the cost.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept totally the thrust of the Government's philosophy in this area. It is the only way to go. I do not think there is any dispute about that in this chamber. I accept also the second point the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) made by way of a general assumption, that in times of change there is much anxiety. But while accepting both of those points, I have spent a great deal of time in the last year, as have other senators in this place, discussing this matter. There does not seem to be a great deal of anxiety or concern about the attitude of senior people in the Department. There is incredible concern about what they are being told by the people further down who are, whether the Minister likes it or not, putting the gun at people's heads. They may be denying it to their superiors, but it is happening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I agree that we have to move. I agree that there is anxiety associated with change. I accept that people want to protect their own patch and the way things have been done before. It is accepted that those attitudes will arise. I do accept the Government's thrust in these matters. I remember discussing this matter with former Senator Grimes; I supported his philosophical position. But I must admit that in the last six months I have become more and more concerned that while the general philosophical thrust is undoubtedly correct, the implementation is really hurting people, because some people who are dealing with these various institutions are not dealing with them in any reasonable way. There are institutions in my State of Queensland-the Minister knows them well-that are running into great difficulties. For the first time ever they are in deficit. There are costs not being picked up any longer. There are people they will have to care for who have particular lifestyles that they want to maintain-whether we like it or not. We do not want the younger people to have those lifestyles, quite correctly, but the older people are in those lifestyles. They find it comfortable and want to stay there. We should not wander around and make all sorts of judgments from on high and say, `This is not good for you'. They are happy in those circumstances. They have been living in those circumstances for some time-sometimes for 15 or 20 years-and they want to stay there. </PARA>
<PARA> That type of provision needs to be maintained. The Government is not maintaining it. Regardless of what the Minister says here, the Government is forcing many of those organisations into deficit. Those organisations are not being funded. The people on the ground are not being funded. The people on the ground are not dealing with it in a decent and reasonable fashion. That is what we are getting. I am quite sure that, if the Minister were to talk to his back bench members, they would say that they were getting exactly the same type of information. At least with representative government, people on the ground are hearing these things. The Minister's senior people up here in Canberra may not be hearing them. It is happening. What is going to happen? Are we just going to plough on with these types of problems continuing or will the Minister do something to make sure that there is a more humane, reasonable and sensible application on the ground where those people are giving the care?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Macklin makes a lot of sense. But appealing to the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) is not enough; it is not in the Minister's hands. The concern that Senator Macklin raises is now in the hands of the Australian Democrats. The Democrats, by supporting the amendment that the Opposition is moving, will take out of the legislation that transfer of the Nursing Homes Assistance Act into the Disability Services Act. If the Democrats support the amendment, the legislation will go before a Senate committee. The unions, the providers of the services and the patients who are able to make submissions to the Senate inquiry will be able to put their cases before a Senate committee that will have people from the National Party of Australia, the Liberal Party of Australia, the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party. Let that be the way we address the problem. I say again to the Democrats: do not pass the buck to the Government; it is in your hands. Senator Macklin and Senator Coulter know the problem. The Australian Democrats have the capacity to do something about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will speak on another point that Senator Macklin raised. We came in here tonight and addressed Senator Cook, whose major responsibility is for resources and a number of other matters. He is only filling in for the responsible Minister, the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett). Senator Cook is getting his advice from the advisers of the Minister for Community Services and Health. I have a note here that supports Senator Macklin's accusation that people are being coerced into signing these agreements. I have permission to use the note in my speech to put this matter into the record. The Chief Executive of the Crowle Home for Sub-Normal Children has been told that if it signs the contracts it has almost as much time as it likes to come up with a transition plan. In the meantime it is guaranteed grants at least equal to the last year's grant plus consumer price index. But the Crowle Home has been told-I hope Senator Macklin is listening to this-that there is a general shortage of funds. It has been implied that, if it does not sign the contract, it is definitely going to suffer. The formula, as per the Department's bulletin, would be strictly enforced. In areas where it has not spent its budget level, it will be stuck with it in future years. This was very serious to the Crowle Home as, at present, it has underspent its wages vote by $80,000 because it cannot fill certain positions. That will mean that in next year's budget it will be $80,000 underfunded. Honourable senators on both sides of the chamber know that that is coercion in any way that one puts it. In fact, the Manager of Crowle puts it in even stronger terms. He feels that he is being bribed or threatened. Those are not my words; they are the words of the Manager of Crowle. The Minister gets up and gives us all the assurances and reassurances that things are great out in the welfare world; but, today, as I pointed out in my speech, the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of the Disabled met. Sixty-five people from every State in Australia gathered and passed a resolution. It was unanimously passed that this part of the legislation be withdrawn until a Senate committee can determine the response of the welfare agencies, the unions and all those types of people actively engaged in these nursing homes. The Minister has not given us an accurate cost. Will it cost $10,000 to put people in community accommodation? Will it cost $20,000 or $30,000? The Minister cannot tell me that it has not been costed because I do not believe that that is a fact. I do not believe that any responsible department or any responsible Minister would draw up legislation without any costing. It is unbelievable that the Minister can come into the Senate and say that. Can the Minister give us even a ball park figure?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are some things that I need to say about Senator Boswell's comments. First, by a slip of the tongue or an error of speech, he referred to disabled people as patients or clients. They are not. They are disabled people. They are not patients. They are people who suffer some disability but are otherwise able to make decisions for themselves. To regard them as patients is to misunderstand the type of person we are talking about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point, before I come to Senator Macklin's comments, is that Senator Boswell asked whether we can give a ball park cost? He seems to make an assumption that all of the individuals concerned might choose to go into community care, into a community group housing arrangement or some such proposition. One of the difficulties in offering a ball park figure is that the very idea of giving individuals choices as to what type of accommodation they go into makes problematic the forecasting of the costs until one finds out the choices that they have made. The type of accommodation that they may go into is home accommodation, in which case many of the costs may be met. It may be hostel accommodation; it may be nursing home accommodation. Therefore, the funding provided will be funding as we go along to meet the choices and the outcomes that arise from those choices. That is a perfectly reasonable answer to Senator Boswell's question. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now turn to the matters raised by Senator Macklin. I accept his comments that, at middle management level, there may be people in the Department who are bulldozing or forcing or however their actions are interpreted by the people at the other end to constitute that type of behaviour. I accept his recognition that that is not the intention of the Minister for Community Services and Health or the Department. His comments have been taken on board by us and by the advisers in attendance. We will take whatever steps are necessary within the Department to ensure that that is not the demeanour or the behaviour of departmental officials. Further than that, if there are particular cases that we should know of, we will investigate and take particular action on them. If we are apprised of those circumstances, we will do that. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Macklin also made the point that some people may wish to choose to remain in institutional care. That is a fair choice that they may wish to make. It is probably not the choice of younger people but those who have been aclimatised to that type of living may wish to stay in-if I can put in these terms; I do not mean to be patronising-the security that they feel in that type of arrangement. These proposals enable us to assure Senator Macklin that, in how they elect to be accommodated, they will have the same level and types of care that they would have in an institution. The first question Senator Coulter asked me was whether all people will be moved out of nursing homes. Within these arrangements, there will be an ability to meet that elected choice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my movement around nursing homes in Victoria one thing that has concerned me has been the fact that funding for nursing home residents is on the basis that the day the resident goes into the nursing home is counted as one day and the day the resident goes out of the nursing home is counted as the same day the resident went in. If the resident dies there is no funding for the resident on that day. Many nursing homes are so strapped for funds that they rush a new resident into a bed the day a patient has left that bed, that is, the day the patient has died. It was brought to my attention in a small town I visited recently that a man in a nursing home there had died and his sister was put into a bed in the same home that afternoon. Because the nursing home staff found it so distasteful they shifted all the patients around so that the woman did not have to go into her deceased brother's bed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask the Minister whether it would be possible for residents to be funded for the day they go into the nursing home and the day they go out of the nursing home if they die. It does not leave the staff of the nursing home time to grieve, especially if they have been nursing the patient for 10, 11, 12 or 15 years. It is another example of the callous way nursing home residents are being dealt with. The Minister said in one of his speeches that what we are really on about is the quality of outcome and the quality of life. I agree that they should be goals. But if we are so mean we cannot fund a resident for the day he dies, there is something wrong with the system. When we were debating changes to nursing homes and their funding, Opposition senators drew attention to the fact that there would be serious problems in the nursing home industry because of current changes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the Minister's attention to a report which will appear tomorrow, commissioned by the Victorian Age Services Peak Council, which confirms the fears that the standard of nursing homes and quality of life will have fallen in many nursing homes. The report makes the points that working conditions for nurses and other staff are pressured, causing stresses in the system and explosive industrial relations implications; that communications with residents and their relatives have worsened due to a rushed atmosphere in many homes. The Minister has just told the Committee tonight that what he is on about and what Minister Staples is on about is quality of outcome and the quality of life. We have here a situation where patients die in nursing homes and their beds are filled before the bed is cold, with no time for staff to grieve or to deal with the situation. What we shall see now, because of the change in funding, is a rushed atmosphere in many nursing homes where nobody talks to a patient about being afraid to die, or about the fact that their daughter has died or that there is something wrong with somebody in their family. The staff do not have time to cope with those matters any more. The report also shows that activities for residents are being cut back to medical and nursing necessities, so that there is no time for any extras, and that building and equipment maintenance is also suffering.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples), in a statement on 3 May, said that the new arrangements being progressively introduced were based on the needs of residents. I cannot believe that the Minister can now hold to the view that arrangements which are being progressively introduced are based on the needs of residents. We see what is happening and we predicted that the position would worsen, and I predict that it will become even worse. The study which has been carried out on 27 Victorian nursing homes-more Victorian nursing homes than the Department has visited-has shown in both the private and voluntary sector that this Government's arrangement for the funding of nursing homes is failing. This will affect, and indeed is affecting, older people who deserve a better deal. It is affecting the industry as a whole. In recent years geriatric nursing has become much more acceptable, but with the changes that are occurring leading to a lowering of standards nurses will flee geriatric nursing. I believe that this Government has a lot to answer for. I hope that the Minister will have a response to the report I have mentioned, which is an indictment of this Government's treatment of elderly people, particularly elderly Victorians. </PARA>

<PARA>The Government has said that in order for a hostel to receive recurrent subsidies it must have a 20 per cent quota of financially disadvantaged residents. Hostel owners had to sign an agreement to this effect by 10 January under the threat of losing subsidy. We seek to remove that 20 per cent aggregation between hostels. We believe that it is unfair to hostels, many of which are church owned and have been funded by residents-by people who have liquidated their assets to be able to get into a hostel and to provide for themselves in their frailty or old age. These are not wealthy people. Under this legislation as it stands, the people who have liquidated their assets, these `near poor' people, would be subsidising the really disadvantaged people. The Opposition maintains that disadvantaged people have the right to live in old people's homes and accommodation, but that this should not be subsidised by people who have saved and who have put aside some money during their lifetime. I believe that the Australian Democrats will support these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to hear the Minister's response on these amendments; I am not completely clear as to their effect. I have been approached by elderly people who have gone into nursing homes under conditions in which they have signed a contract between themselves and the nursing home that the nursing home will provide certain services to them, and that they will provide certain money to the nursing home. Subsequently the nursing homes have found it necessary to abrogate that contract because the conditions imposed on the nursing homes by the Government have been changed. Elderly people who believed that they had made such an arrangement for the rest of their lives have found themselves further disadvantaged. I am not clear whether Senator Boswell seeks to overcome that difficulty by way of his amendments. If that is the case, I would like to hear the Minister's response. If that is the case, it seems to me unfair of the Government to push nursing homes into a position where they are forced to abrogate a legal contract between themselves and some of their residents.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposed amendments are not relevant to the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Amendment Bill. This Bill deals with planning for the future. These amendments seek to make provision for people who might be financially disadvantaged in certain circumstances. Therefore, they are not relevant to this Bill. To some extent that should take care of some of the questions raised by Senator Coulter. On the point he made, I am advised that out of 974 nursing homes, 972 have signed this agreement. I think that speaks for itself in terms of whether there is any reluctance on the part of the institutions themselves to agree to these proposals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition's amendments seek to vary the new hostel recurrent funding agreements so that hostels which have not received Commonwealth capital funding-that is, where there is 100 per cent resident capital funding-should not be subject to requirements to accommodate a percentage of financially disadvantaged people. The amendments, as I have said, are not relevant to the Bill. Rather, they are relevant to the issue of variable capital funding in respect of legislation passed by both Houses in 1987. I think Senator Boswell is trying to widen the debate. The background of his interest in these amendments was the Uniting Church in New South Wales. I have here a letter from the Uniting Church New South Wales Synod, Board for Social Responsibility, signed by the Rev. Harry J. Herbert, General Secretary, written to the Hon. Peter Staples, Minister for Housing and Aged Care, in which Mr Herbert says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I believe that the arrangements as set out in your letter are most satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA>He says in a concluding paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA>I regret that an obvious misunderstanding has occurred, but I am delighted that the issue has been settled and the agreement is most suitable to our purposes. You can be assured that my aim is to have the largest possible number of financially disadvantaged person admitted to Uniting Church hostels.</PARA>
<PARA>I table that letter because it does go to the point that Senator Boswell is raising. On behalf of the major organisation affected, it is writing to say that it is now satisfied, given the assurances that the Minister has given. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to disagree with the Minister for Resources. We may be at cross purposes. The Government has said that in order for hostels to continue to receive a recurrent subsidy, they must have a 20 per cent quota of financially disadvantaged residents. Hostels have had to sign an agreement to that effect by 10 January 1989 under threat of losing their subsidies if they did not sign the it. Many of the hostels are involved. Many of the Uniting Church's hostels are involved, but others are involved too. These hostels were funded by residents borrowing money and committing themselves to repay the capital. They very often involved their own church. I suppose that the Catholics had raffles and the Lutherans had lamington drives and so forth. The church actually raised the money, thus relieving the Government of the responsibility of paying the capital to build the facility. So the Government did not have to provide the capital, but it had to provide the recurrent expenses. The Government, by introducing this arrangement, will retrospectively alter the arrangements that are in place between the individuals who have put up their own money and the churches and the other organisations that have borrowed money to set these places up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What this legislation does is to say, `If you do not have 20 per cent of disadvantaged people in your particular home, then we will not continue to fund you'. The Opposition maintains that the residents of these homes have paid for the homes. They paid the capital expenditure on the homes. The Government is now retrospectively altering an agreement which says that the people who built the homes and provided the capital to build the homes have not got to provide 20 per cent of places for the disadvantaged. The residents in these homes are going to have to subsidise the disadvantaged people who could not afford them. We maintain that the severely disadvantaged have got to have somewhere to live but that it is not the responsibility of the original movers who provided the capital; it is the responsibility of the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is one fundamental flaw in what Senator Boswell has put. He has put that each hostel has to have a 20 per cent disadvantaged component. That is not so. The point that the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) has brought out is that across the aggregate population of all the hostels for the Uniting Church there is 20 per cent of disadvantaged people. Some may have none, some may have 5 per cent and some may have some other percentages.

I believe that the Minister has written to the Uniting Church and given it that assurance. Assurances are wonderful, but they are not as complete as having them included in the legislation. This is what I am trying to get across to the Minister. Yes, I think the Uniting Church has been given that assurance, but it is not in the legislation. If Senator Coulter supports this amendment, it will be enshrined in this legislation. I think we are both going in the same direction; we both want to get to the same place.

<PARA>Dear Reverend Herbert</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that a meeting took place on the 30 March 1989, between yourself, Reverend Ian Bowden and senior members of the Department of Community Services and Health about your organization's capacity to meet the requirements of the Commonwealth Hostel Recurrent Funding Agreement to accommodate financially disadvantaged people. </PARA>
<PARA>The meeting took place as a result of my concern that the Uniting Church was basically unaware, despite extensive negotiations and correspondence with the AAVCA Hostel Negotiating Committee, whose NSW representative is from the Uniting Church, and the Director of the Uniting Church's Synod Aged Care Agency, of my detailed proposal on aggregation specifically developed to address the concerns of the Church hostels in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>Some specific aspects of the aggregation proposal were raised with me in discussion with Mr Kell of Woodfield Retirement Village and Mr Townley on 20 April in Canberra. These aspects are covered by the arrangements set out below. </PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to be able to confirm the following as my understanding of the agreement reached at the meeting with you, an agreement not being different from arrangements previously put to Uniting Church Hostels. These arrangements were set out in the letter dated 21 November 1988, which was sent by the State Office to every hostel, and accompanied the proposed recurrent funding agreement to be signed by the hostel. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore I was surprised by the debate in the House of Representatives, considering that the outcomes of joint negotiations has been known months before the Opposition members raised these matters. Prima facie it seemed as if the Uniting Church was attempting to re-open the issue after negotiations had been settled. </PARA>
<PARA>It is specifically agreed that the Uniting Church in NSW may meet the conditions for accommodating financially disadvantaged people by achieving the 20% requirement as an average of the occupied place days of all existing Uniting Church hostels receiving recurrent funding in NSW. </PARA>
<PARA>Completion of the necessary documentation can be achieved by the signing of a single agreement that includes an attachment that will nominate the percentage of financially disadvantaged persons to be accommodated in each of the hostels, such that the average of 20% over all occupied place days can be met. As already discussed with the Sydney office of the Department, this will need to be decided upon and completed by 30 June 1989. I have asked the Sydney office to contact your office shortly to assist you in settling this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>I would also like to confirm that although the 20% figure will remain a constant and essential requirement as an average over all existing Uniting Church hostels in New South Wales, the specific percentage nominated for any individual hostel may be varied by agreement. This specific percentage is to be achieved as an average of occupied place days in that hostel over a financial year. Minor variation in the achievement of the specific percentage will of course be taken into account, as there will always be variations in a hostel's admission rate and in the care needs of potential residents. </PARA>
<PARA>For your information, all hostels will be able to monitor their achievement of their required percentages through the monthly recurrent subsidy claims form. From June, 1989, hostels will be able to commence recording the financial status of residents on the form. Through a simple updating, hostels will be able to easily monitor their current monthly levels, and their year-to-date levels in achieving their specific average. </PARA>
<PARA>I understand the definition of a financially disadvantaged person was also raised. It has always been the Commonwealth's intention that the persons so targeted are the frail aged in receipt of maximum rate pension who are also non-homeowners and, to this extent, changes in the Social Security arrangements impact on the definition of financial disadvantage from time to time. The current definition is attached. </PARA>
<PARA>On the basis of the meeting held and the agreement reached on the proposals, I believe that it is not now necessary for me to meet with you. However should you require any further assistance, please contact the State Office or either of my officers who participated in the meeting with you. </PARA>
<PARA>I appreciate the time both you and Reverend Ian Bowden have made available, and the co-operative approach taken to resolve any misunderstandings of the earlier negotiations with the Uniting Church in New South Wales. I look forward to further development of our relationship in providing residential care services for the frail aged. </PARA>

When I wrote my letter to ``The Sydney Morning Herald'' and when I approached Opposition members of parliament, I was acting under advice that aggregation of the 20% ratio was not acceptable to the Government. The responsibilities of my Board within the church cover chaplaincy, welfare, and social justice issues. While the Synod Aged Care Agency is a unit of our Board, I am not involved in day to day administration. </PARA>
<PARA>I regret that an obvious misunderstanding has occurred, but I am delighted that the issue has been settled and the arrangement is most suitable to our purposes. You can be assured that my aim is to have the largest possible number of financially disadvantaged persons admitted to Uniting Church hostels. </PARA>
<PARA>I look forward to future good relations with your Department. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>

Our amendment simply seeks to exempt from the areas of financially disadvantaged placements those hostels that have been fully self-funded. Complying with this requirement means that legal contracts entered into by the hostel management with the residents who capital funded those hostels would be overridden.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise one matter. The Bill says that in section 9aa the Minister may, by notice in writing, published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette, specify a number as the maximum number of hospital places for a region, et cetera. The Minister's second reading speech indicated that the Government's objective was to provide 100 residential care places per 1,000 people, aged 70 years and over, with a mix within this 100 of 60 hostel places to 40 nursing home places. Earlier in the Act, under section 3, interpretation, an eligible person is described as being an aged or disabled person who is assessed as requiring hostel care services, et cetera.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Frequently, one finds in these places disabled persons who, very clearly, are in need of care. Given the Government's objective of providing 100 residential care places per 1,000 people aged 70 years and over, I ask the Minister: What provision is there for beds for those who are disabled and in need of this type of care who are under the age of 70 years, as is so often the case? Is it a fact that the aged are the people who miss out and cannot get places or are there some other criteria for determining beds for those who are disabled-people who have been involved in motor vehicle accidents and the like?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intend to speak to the Senate this evening in my role as one of the Senate's representatives on the Council of the Australian National University. During my comments, I shall, at times, refer to that university as the ANU. Honourable senators would be aware that the other representative of the Senate on the Council of the ANU is Senator the Hon. Peter Baume, who previously held several ministerial positions, one of which was Minister for Education. The Council is the ANU's chief decision-making body on a wide range of administrative matters. Its total membership is 44 which comes from a wide background as specified in the Australian National University Act. In general, the Council meets each month apart from those months when the scheduled meeting date is part of a university vacation. For the purposes of my later comments, I should outline that the normal procedure is to hold Council meetings on Fridays and to begin at 9.30 a.m. Sometimes the Council's business has concluded by about lunch-time. On those occasions when that does not happen, a session of one and a half to two hours after lunch is usually long enough for the Council's business to be concluded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A meeting of the Council was held last Friday, that is, 9 June. A glance at the agenda revealed that it would be a long meeting. Yet it would not have been expected by many that the meeting would not conclude until shortly before 5 p.m. Certainly, it was the longest meeting of the Council which I have attended. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter that I wish to report upon is a proposal which was discussed last Friday to establish an Elizabethan theatre and associated buildings on the campus of the ANU. At first sight such a proposal may seem to have considerable merit. But, when it is realised that the project requires the sublease of part of the land which has been leased to the university, there may be grounds for second thoughts. That sublease would pass to a private developer who would build not only a theatre but also four to five shops, a restaurant and a motel with approximately 80 rooms, referred to in the developer's proposal as an accommodation block. The land and buildings are to revert to the university after 40 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Last Friday's Council meeting was not the first occasion on which this matter was mentioned. In August 1987 the Vice-Chancellor reported to the Council about a proposal to build an Elizabethan theatre. A cost of $750,000 was mentioned. The Vice-Chancellor said then that the proposal had not developed to a stage where it could be put before the Council. However, he did say:</PARA>
<PARA> I would want to say to the Council that our experience with the Arts Centre, which is still encumbered by debt, convinces me that we need to be very sure of the figures before we consider proceeding in any formal way. </PARA>
<PARA>In October 1988 the building and grounds committee reported to Council that it approved the principle of the siting of an Elizabethan theatre complex on the campus. It was at this stage that a commercially sponsored development, much larger in scope than the original proposal, was first before the Council. It was agreed by the Council that, with some important caveats, negotiations on the matter could continue about the value of the site, concessions for the ANU and protection for the university in the event of failure of the venture. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall now outline the proposal which was put to the Council by Hathaway Productions Pty Ltd, which I shall refer to as Hathaway Productions. Hathaway Productions proposes to construct and operate a replica of Shakespeare's second Globe Theatre. The replica would seat 1,200 patrons. The proposal is that it will be built on university land subleased to Hathaway Productions. Hathaway Productions states that the Globe Theatre will cost $2.5m for construction and fit-out. The company makes it clear that it expects that subleased land will be made available at no cost or for nominal rental. In relation to the location, the company stated:</PARA>
<PARA> A perfect location for the Globe has been identified (from 14 possible sites) south of the cross road to the University Staff Centre and abutting the boundary of the University crown lease nearer to Lake Burley Griffin. As the original Globe was next to the Thames, a water frontage is particularly appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpose that any developer would consider a frontage to the water of Lake Burley Griffin to be, as the company states, a perfect location. One of the beauties of Lake Burley Griffin is that development has, in the main, been kept away from its foreshores. Whether or not this is university land, any commercial development along the foreshores of Lake Burley Griffin must be carefully investigated. What is the problem with just one development? The problem is that it is a foot in the door. If Canberra residents want access to the lake to remain freely available to the people, they should consider this matter carefully. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to Hathaway Productions' proposal. The company states that it will fund a chair of Shakespearean studies and will provide an annual prize for the best essay on Shakespeare in the English Department. The university is to have use of the theatre for an unspecified percentage of time at no cost for teaching and performance. Hathaway Productions will also construct a museum at a cost of $3m and provide four to five shops, called retail outlets in the company's proposal. A restaurant will be built and the cost of the restaurant and the shops will be about half a million dollars. What the company refers to as an `accommodation component' will be built for $3m. In papers other than the papers containing the company's proposals, this component was referred to as a `three star motel'. At the end of 40 years, the subleased land, the theatre and all buildings would revert to the ANU. </PARA>
<PARA> The company summarises the benefits to the ANU as follows: a very high profile theatre, unique in the world for performances, teaching and research; a chair of Shakespearean studies; access to theatre time and to the museum for education and research; a flow of scholars and cultural tours to the university, enhancing its international standing; and full ownership of the entire complex, as a going concern, at the end of the term. </PARA>
<PARA> These possible benefits should not be disregarded. On the other hand, there are many problems associated with the proposal. The ANU's finance committee is far from convinced of the viability of the project. It is generally accepted that the theatre would not pay its own way and it and the Shakespearean chair would have to be financed from motel profits. No matter how tightly a contract may be drawn, the university would have to be absolutely certain that it would not, at some time in the future, be faced with a financial burden caused by the failure of the project. </PARA>
<PARA> A second matter to consider is whether Canberra needs a 1,200-seat theatre or what the addition of such a facility will do for the viability of other theatres in the national capital. And, if a new theatre is necessary, should it be a replica of the Globe Theatre? Of course, it will not be a true replica. For a start, I imagine electricity will be used for lighting-a convenience not available in Shakespeare's time. But, even so, if the structure should replicate the Globe internally, why should we not consider an external structure which is architecturally Australian? After all, this new Parliament House in which we now operate is not built as a replica of the provisional Parliament House or of the House of Commons at Westminster. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem is whether land allocated for the university should be passed over to a private company to build a motel, a restaurant and shops. I commend those universities which raise funds through research activities and through the provision of services by way of contract. But should a university raise funds or receive an endowed chair by selling off or forgoing for a lengthy period real estate which forms part of its campus?</PARA>
<PARA> Another important matter that must be considered is whether the ANU is legally able to sublease its land to allow Hathaway Productions to proceed with its proposals. The land forming the ANU's campus is held under a lease granted pursuant to the Australian National University (Leases) Ordinance 1967. Under clause 1 (a) of that lease, it is stated `that the land hereby leased shall be used for university purposes only'. I understand that the ANU (Leases) Ordinance 1967 has now been passed to the Australian Capital Territory Administration and thus has the status of an Act. Nevertheless, the agreement was made between the university and the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The ANU's solicitors have provided an opinion which casts doubt on the ability of the university to sublease its land for the purpose described in Hathaway Productions' proposal. In part, that opinion states:</PARA>
<PARA>In summary then, I believe that the proposed sublease is not consistent with the above 1 (a) covenant of the University lease in perpetuity. </PARA>
<PARA>In explaining his conclusion, the solicitor stated:</PARA>
<PARA>I come to that conclusion principally because the provision of the motel and of the restaurant, the retail shops and to some extent the restricted use of the theatre of the University, taken in conjunction are, in my opinion, sufficient to take the whole project outside the permitted use of the University's land. </PARA>
<PARA>It is possible that the whole project should not have proceeded as far as it has because of the legal impediments. The university's solicitor also made other comments which, though strictly not of a legal nature, are quite pertinent to the whole project. The opinion carried the following comments:</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the question of ultra vires, the project also has political and public comment implications for the University of which you are aware. It must be expected that the provision of a large (by Canberra standards at least) theatre, a major restaurant and a significant motel on the University campus to be run along commercial lines, will give rise to a number of objections, not the least from commercial operators of similar Canberra facilities who believe that the promoters of the Globe Theatre project will be receiving an unfair advantage in relation to establishment costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter of some concern is the sensitivity of the site itself. Clearly there will be design and siting implications to be considered and the possibility of objections from public interest groups on this score. </PARA>
<PARA>So what did the Council of the ANU do when faced with the problem of whether to proceed with the proposal? This was the last matter to be discussed last Friday. Before it was discussed, some councillors left for a variety of reasons, but most of those who did leave did so because of transport bookings they had made, probably on the assumption that the meeting would not last so long. A great deal of discussion ensued without a formal motion before the Council. Eventually the Vice-Chancellor moved:</PARA>
<PARA>In view of the advantages to the academic community and to Canberra of the proposed Globe Theatre development, Council resolves to pursue the matter by:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Inviting the Board of Faculties to advise Council on the proposal for a Chair of Shakespearean Studies;</PARA>
<PARA>2. Inviting the Buildings and Grounds Committee to comment on the project as presently proposed;</PARA>
<PARA>3. Inviting the Vice-Chancellor to advise the Council on ways (if any) that consideration of the proposal may continue in the light of legal advice that the proposal in its present form is inconsistent with the clause 1 (a) of the lease made under the ANU (Leases) Act 1967;</PARA>
<PARA>4. Advising Hathaway Productions that subject to the Council being satisfied on the matters resolved above, the University will invite Hathaway Productions to carry out a detailed assessment of the costs prior to final consideration by the Finance Committee and Council. </PARA>
<PARA>The motion was put to a vote and carried by 12 votes to 11. I know of at least one member of the Council who was present and who did not vote, and there may have been another one or two who abstained. There is no doubt that a quorum was present. With two vacancies on the Council, the quorum was 21. But the fact is that only 23 from a possible 37 who were present at some stage last Friday cast a vote for or against the Vice-Chancellor's motion. For a project of this magnitude to be carried by one vote when so many councillors had to leave due to time constraints is, to say the least, most unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA> Last Friday evening I heard on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio news, scarcely an hour after the Council's narrow adoption of the Vice-Chancellor's motion, that the Australian National University Council had given the go-ahead for the proposed Globe Theatre development on the foreshore of Lake Burley Griffin. That is incorrect. Mr Jim Hutchins, a director of Hathaway Productions, was reported on the same radio service as saying that construction could be under way in about three months. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite simply, that will not occur. The next step is for Council to consider three specific matters as outlined in the Vice-Chancellor's report. After that, Hathaway Productions could be invited to carry out a detailed assessment of costs for submission to the finance committee and to Council. Even then the project may not proceed because of a number of obstacles. The most significant of these is the legal matter. I expect that if a final decision were made by the university to proceed with the project, it could be subject to a legal challenge. If that challenge were upheld, who would have to bear the legal costs-the person or persons initiating the challenge, the ANU or Hathaway Productions?</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the legal doubts in relation to the lease, a particular subsection of the Australian National University Act, still very much in Commonwealth hands, must be taken into account. In part, section 26 (2) states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Council shall not, except with the approval of the Governor-General, alienate, mortgage, charge or demise any lands, tenements or hereditaments of the University, except by way of lease for any term not exceeding 21 years. </PARA>
<PARA>I presume any approval of the Governor-General would be made on the advice of his Ministers-that is, Ministers of the Commonwealth Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I have earlier mentioned the difficulties the ANU's finance committee had about the viability of the project. Swift or glib talking by Hathaway Productions will not satisfy that committee. Hard data showing absolute viability will be essential before the committee and, in turn, the Council will be satisfied. </PARA>
<PARA> I also mentioned the actual need for another theatre in Canberra or a theatre complex as outlined by the promoter. Will existing theatre proprietors, restaurateurs and motel proprietors remain silent if it appears Hathaway Productions is receiving favoured treatment in relation to the land it wants to sublease? Will public interest groups allow development to proceed on such a sensitive site? Knowing the way in which concerned citizens of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) express their views, I doubt that they will sit back and allow the project to proceed unimpeded. </PARA>
<PARA> One other matter may or may not be important but I consider I should mention it this evening. The business name ``Hathaway Productions'' is registered in the ACT. I have, however, referred to Hathaway Productions on a number of occasions as ``the company''. In fact, Hathaway Productions' proposal was submitted with a cover sheet listing the proposer as ``Hathaway Productions Pty Ltd''. There is, however, some doubt whether Hathaway Productions is actually incorporated in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> I could have raised further matters in relation to the project tonight. Nevertheless, I have said enough to acquaint honourable senators of what is an important matter to have come before the Council of the ANU. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a brief speech tonight in reply to some allegations made in Senator Tambling's adjournment speech last week concerning a document which I had tabled entitled On Shaky Ground, which is a critique of the dissent to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts on the resources of Kakadu National Park region. I tabled that document last week and spoke briefly to it as the only possible way to redress an injustice done to the Jawoyn people, the traditional owners of the Coronation Hill area in the Northern Territory, and to others, under parliamentary privilege, in that dissenting report which quoted selectively some eight pages in all of in camera evidence, much of it out of context.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> According to Senate procedures in force at the time the dissenting report was tabled, there was no way in which those who had been misrepresented, including the Jawoyn or even members of the majority of the Committee, could respond to the allegations contained in the dissent by quoting other parts of the same in camera evidence. Tabling the document was the only way I could see to redress the balance and challenge the conclusions of the minority of the Standing Committee. All I wish to do tonight is to answer a few of the specific allegations made by Senator Tambling in this chamber last week and in his subsequent press release. I remind the Senate that I chaired the inquiry on the Kakadu region and thus am very familiar with all the evidence presented to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tambling has no evidence for the claim that I knowingly saw material which should not be viewed by women. I deny the allegations, as I did last week. There is no suggestion in the Hansard record of either the public or in camera evidence of the conversation he alleges took place concerning my viewing of restricted material, allegations which have taken nearly three years to surface since the hearing of 29 October 1986. Far from fearing death by spearing, as Senator Tambling alleges, I note that the Jawoyn Working Party has issued a press release pointing out that On Shaky Ground was tabled with its permission and did not contain material offensive to the Jawoyn. If any such drastic sanctions were to apply to me, they would apply equally to the male senators present at the hearing-and one of them is here today-unless they can demonstrate proof of Aboriginal initiation to manhood--</PARA>

<PARA>by a fellow by the name of Joe Fisher, who was an early prospector in that area and he was the one that, in fact, had been the custodian of that area for some 40 years. </PARA>
<PARA>They are Mr Coulter's words, which are now denied. I made no allegation at all against Mr Fisher, as Senator Tambling claimed in his press release. Senator Tambling also questioned my statements about pressure applied by Mr Coulter to expedite approval for exploration at Coronation Hill. This information was taken directly from evidence given to the Committee in 1986 by Mr Bob Ellis of the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Authority who named his source at that stage in Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. Mr Coulter, to my knowledge, has not complained in the interim, that is, in three years. </PARA>
<PARA> As the time is so late I will confine my remarks to answering those few allegations made by Senator Tambling and I will finish by quoting from a press release of the Jawoyn Working Party on 9 June, which reads in part:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Robert Lee, Chairman of the Jawoyn Working Party, today strongly rejected statements by Senator Grant Tambling over the issue of Coronation Hill and the Sickness Country. </PARA>
<PARA>`Once again the Senator has shown himself to be totally out of touch with anything to do with Aboriginal matters. </PARA>
<PARA>`The Senator has never sat down and talked to the custodians of the Sickness Country to find out what they have been saying. Now, at the first opportunity where Jawoyn people have been able to get their ideas across about the minority Senate report, he has jumped at the chance to deliberately ignore our views with cheap shots at another politician. </PARA>
<PARA>`In his attack on that politician, he talks about Aboriginal law. It looks like the Senator's knowledge has been taken from the back of a corn flakes packet. </PARA>
<PARA>`If he knew anything about Aboriginal law, he would know to respect us, to talk to us, and learn from our knowledge of the Sickness Country. Instead he laughs behind our backs while he makes speeches supporting his mates in the Government and mining industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I thank my colleague Senator Crichton-Browne for yielding his place on the list. I shall detain the Senate for only two or three minutes. There are two things I want to do. The first is to make some very brief comments in relation to matters raised by Senator Colston this evening in relation to the proposed development of the Globe Theatre project and associated matters on the Australian National University campus. I do so because of a particular interest I have in the Globe Theatre project. May I say that I know nothing of Hathaway Productions Pty Ltd or of any associated motel or other development. My interest arises purely out of an interest in the Globe Theatre project and the fact that in October of last year Professor Stephen Prickett, who is the Head of the Department of English at the Australian National University, after some conversations with me, which had taken place over the previous months, wrote to me indicating that there would be a trust appointed if the Globe Theatre project were to proceed. He indicated that if it proceeded a trust would be established, and he invited me to be a member of that trust.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I responded on 18 October to Professor Prickett that if a trust were established to deal with the development of the Globe Theatre project I would be more than honoured to serve on it. I simply put that on the record so that if at any stage this matter comes up for debate people will know of the particular interest which I have in it. May I say, having also spoken to my colleague Senator Peter Baume on this matter, I believe that the interests of the Parliament and of the Australian National University will be well and adequately protected by the two parliamentary representatives from the Senate who are on that Council. I am sure they will properly discharge what they see to be their formal responsibilities and obligations as members of that Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter which I wish to raise is quite a simple one. There has been over the course of the last couple of weeks some real interest in questions of liberty and freedom. They have manifested themselves primarily in discussions about what has been happening in China and Eastern Europe and, indeed, the question of the struggle of liberty, the re-establishment of liberalism, if I may us that term, and the contending intellectual philosophies of liberalism and libertarianism and such matters. My attention was drawn to a speech delivered by Mr Andrew Norton to a conference of the Australian Liberal Students Federation held in January 1989 which raised in a very perceptive way a number of those issues which are currently in public debate. I simply seek leave of the Senate to table, for the information of honourable senators, a copy of that speech. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the more interesting debates in recent times concerns the validity and propriety of the use of international conventions as a basis for domestic legislation. It has been quite a vigorous argument. I am not about to question or challenge the line of view taken by my Party on these matters. It has been a matter of public record for some time. I have been impressed by the argument itself. There is an argument that says it is right and an argument that says it is not right to use international instruments. We can ask how much thoughtful argument has gone on in relation to this matter. The answer is not very much.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Brian Burdekin is a name well known to most honourable senators here. Next to Mr Justice Einfeld he is the most significant figure in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. It is interesting that Senator Puplick referred to a paper. Recently Mr Burdekin has also written a paper entitled Protection for Children in Australia: Some Reflections on the National Inquiry into Homeless Children and the New Convention on the Rights of the Child. This paper advances an ingenious argument. In the first paragraph Mr Burdekin states:</PARA>
<PARA>Claims are sometimes made of human rights, as embodied in the international instruments developed through the United Nations, are somehow alien or antithetical to the Western liberal tradition. Such claims cannot stand up to serious scrutiny. The international law of human rights, although proclaiming universal standards, has a great part of its philosophical and historical roots in the documents which form major landmarks of the Western heritage: the English Magna Carta and Bill of Rights, the French Declarations of the Rights of Man and the Citizen, and the United States Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA>In the first part of the paper Mr Burdekin tries to develop some argument related to underlying political philosophies to justify the use of these conventions. His paper proceeds to discuss this argument in the context of the national inquiry into homeless children, copies of which were received by honourable senators within the past month or so. The sections of the paper include the inquiry itself. He describes what went on and the implications of a rights based approach-in other words, how he approached the problem himself as the person conducting the inquiry. He discusses the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the role of the family. It is not necessary that everyone should agree with his arguments. It is important that the arguments and his proposition should be in the public place. It is vital that we should be able to consider all the arguments as to whether the use of these instruments is proper or improper. Because I am impressed by Mr Burdekin's paper, like Senator Puplick I seek leave to table the paper for the information of honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I continue to raise the matter of a report put down by a Mr Cooper who was highly critical of the minority report of the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts concerning the potential of Kakadu National Park. I would not have bothered to raise this matter in the first place nor again tonight except for the fact that Senator Zakharov-I notice she has left the chamber-in pursuit of prosecuting Mr Cooper's argument came into this chamber and tabled his report. Senator Zakharov has criticised me because under Standing Orders quite properly I used in camera evidence to substantiate the arguments and the conclusions that the minority report drew. I can only assume that Senator Zakharov would have had the minority report draw conclusions without any evidence to substantiate those conclusions and criticise us more aggressively if we had done so. Senator Zakharov allowed Mr Cooper, who happened to be privy to what she described as in camera evidence of the Jawoyn people, to use in camera evidence in his written criticism of our report in breach of the Standing Orders and in contempt of the Committee. She ensured that the only copy known, at least to the Senate, was tabled in the Senate. Therefore, he was covered by the provisions of the tabling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Zakharov has been very aggressive in her criticism of the minority report in using in camera evidence. If Senator Zakharov wanted the in camera evidence used by Mr Cooper to be available to the public at large she could have sought a resolution from the Committee that the in camera evidence be made available. She did not do that. Sadly in my view Senator Zakharov allowed herself to be an instrument of Mr Cooper, as I said earlier, in prosecuting his case and providing, as he has, selective in camera evidence. It is with some disappointment that I record that Senator Zakharov came into the chamber and conducted herself in the way she did without first notifying me or any member of the Committee who signed the minority report. The reason she was able to table Cooper's report without dissent was that she had not been gracious enough to give prior notice to the shadow Minister on duty or to those people who signed the minority report who might, with sober reflection, have disallowed the tabling of the report and insisted that she seek a proper and appropriate route to have the in camera evidence tabled. </PARA>
<PARA> For those who are fans of Gwen Meredith I will continue that which I began last week. By the dint of time I was denied the opportunity of telling the Senate that Mr Cooper had claimed that the evidence given to us by Jawoyn women who were described as elders was inappropriate to be made available to the Committee and that it was of no consequence. Mr Cooper was saying that they were mere women and that not only was their evidence not to be considered consequential but also that they should never have been there in the first place because the place of women is not to be alongside men. I say with respect that that flies in the face of the view of the Aboriginal Land Commissioner who, under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, took their evidence at great length in determining whether the land claim should be approved. I refer to page 77 of the in camera evidence of those senior women. I asked whether Coronation Hill and associated areas were areas of significance. Senator Zakharov seemed at that time to be trying to give their evidence for them. I said:</PARA>
<PARA>They have said that Coronation Hill is quite free of sacred sites of significance and that there is a major Bula on Sleisbeck. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So mining on Coronation Hill would not hurt Aboriginal sites?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Mr Nipper Brown, the senior custodian of the Jawoyn people, said, `It can go ahead'. A pretty unqualified answer, I would have thought-a simple question, a simple answer. Just to make sure that I had heard him right, I asked, `Is that one, Coronation Hill, okay?' Nipper Brown said, `Yes'. I would have thought that would have been pretty indisputable evidence, but it did not satisfy Mr Cooper from the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Protection Authority, nor Mr Ellis or Senator Zakharov. As I said earlier, the evidence given by Phyllis Wynjorroc and Sarah Flora before the Land Rights Commissioner in Darwin was the foundation, the cornerstone, of his determination in respect of the provisions of the Act as to whether the land ought to be proclaimed as land for the Aboriginal community. In respect of areas 4 and 5, he found in the negative. </PARA>
<PARA> I have read out the substance of the evidence. Mr Cooper referred to my questioning variously as firm, close and improper. Readers of the transcript can judge Cooper's objectivity and, I might say, honesty for themselves. We have had it put to us more recently by Cooper and others that the people were threatened and intimidated, that they were saying yes when they meant no, that they had a need to say that which they judged us to want them to say. It is not without significance for me to record that Senator Townley, in his very humane, generous, sensitive and understanding way when it was pointed out by Senator Zakharov, in a moment of desperation, that there was a difference of opinion there on that day, referring to two versus seven out of nine, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Not from the elders, we did not. Does anybody here feel under any pressure today? The ladies seem to be relaxed. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Fordimail, the man who was speaking in favour of the area being a sickness country that should not be mined, said, turning to the ladies, `Are they putting pressure on you?'. Senator Townley turned to Phyllis Wynjorroc and said, `Phyllis, are you okay?' Ms Wynjorroc said, `Yes'. Senator Townley, to the most senior custodian in Nipper Brown, said, `Nipper, are you okay?'. Mr Brown said, `Yes'. So not only were we not insensitive to any suggestions, and that is why we had the hearing-I will come to that if time allows me-in a very relaxed form, but also we denied access to the public so that the members of the Aboriginal community could feel quite relaxed with the Committee and not feel that they were being scrutinised by either their peers or the public. We then went to the trouble of asking them whether they felt relaxed. Given the nature of Peter Jatbula and Mr Fordimail, I have no doubt they would have made it clear to us had they thought they were under any apprehension or anxiety. Cooper, when referring to the presence of women, says in the report:</PARA>
<PARA> Once again, this information was conveyed to the Committee in a submission-</PARA>
<PARA>this is Cooper telling us that women should not be there-</PARA>
<PARA>however, the dissenting report fails to acknowledge this evidence, despite using large extracts of the Barunga transcript obtained in such problematic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>I feel quite moved to find out who told us that the women should not be there. When I checked to see whose evidence I am chastised for not using and for not placing it ahead of that of the Jawoyn women and the Jawoyn people generally, I discovered yet again that Mr Cooper is telling us that we ought not to take cognisance of the direct and precise evidence of Jawoyn people. I find this man's arrogance absolutely breathtaking. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Cooper asserts that the following part of the minority report is incorrect:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Peter Jatbula and Mr Ray Fordimail were of the view that Coronation Hill was a Bula site and seven other Senior Custodians and senior Jawoyn people were of a contrary view. </PARA>
<PARA>That is Mr Cooper telling us that we were quite wrong because we said seven out of nine people agreed. The Cooper report states:</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, reference to the transcript shows that only four out of the nine custodians were of the contrary view. </PARA>
<PARA>I quote the evidence. I regret that I have to read it but it is the only way to make it clear:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE: There is no Bula on Coronation Hill?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Brown: Nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE: So the Coronation Hill area is not a sacred site area?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Brown: Nothing. It is free. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE: You went with Mr Davis [to Sleisbeck]?</PARA>
<PARA> Ms Wynjorroc: Yes. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE: And you saw that Sleisbeck was where the Bula was, not Coronation Hill?</PARA>
<PARA> Ms Flora: Yes. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE: Sleisbeck-that is the big one. It is the big one, the important one?</PARA>
<PARA> Ms Wynjorroc: Yes, very important. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE: But not on Coronation Hill?</PARA>
<PARA> Ms Wynjorroc: No. </PARA>
<PARA> CHAIRMAN: Do the other people here agree with that?</PARA>
<PARA>This question was directed to everybody. One person put his hand up and offered dissent and that was Mr Fordimail who said that he disagreed. Mr Fordimail, who had already been the lone voice in claiming the Coronation Hill was a Bula site, told us in later evidence, that I will not bore honourable members with now, that he learnt that from his father as a very young man. He said it should not be mined. Mr Fordimail said:</PARA>
<PARA>I just want to mention that the other senior custodian-</PARA>
<PARA>presumably meaning one-</PARA>
<PARA>who is not here at the moment, agrees with me. </PARA>
<PARA>He did not seek to encompass anybody else. He was talking about one other. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA>We both disagree that there is not any connection with Bula on Coronation Hill. </PARA>
<PARA>Forgive the two negatives but I am quoting Mr Fordimail. He is saying that the two disagreed. He was referring to Peter Jatbula. I might add that Mr Fordimail's evidence followed Mr Nipper Brown's evidence, in which Mr Brown said that there is no Bula on Coronation Hill and that mining was all right. Subsequently, in evidence, Mr Fordimail made it quite clear that Nipper Brown was the senior custodian and that he, Mr Fordimail, was considerably junior to him. I believe that any sensible reading of the evidence demonstrated that a benign presence-Mr Fordimail and Mr Jatbula-believed Coronation Hill was to be a Bula site and that nobody else did. </PARA>
<PARA> It does no credit to Mr Cooper, in my view, to imply the contrary, circulate what will now be a document widely made available to the public and to suggest that the contrary is true. I regret having to refer to Mr Cooper but that is the reason why I am on my feet. Having read pages 10, 11, and 12 of Mr Cooper's report, which anybody who is interested in the subject will bother to do, I find them utterly incomprehensible. Because of the thrust and logic of most of what he says I cannot make any sensible conclusions from them. However, he suggests that the minority report was written in such a way and the evidence was extracted so selectively that it cleverly tripped up the witnesses and was totally misleading. </PARA>
<PARA> I am at a loss to understand Cooper's logic. At best, it is some sort of pathetic attempt by Cooper to explain away, in some obscure way, the clear, explicit and precise evidence given by the senior custodians in the face of his clearly held view, in the face of evidence which he had given himself and in the face of evidence which he sought to proffer as being that of the Jawoyn people. </PARA>
<PARA> This pompous Cooper again criticises me on page 12 of his report for ignoring his evidence. On page 13 of this report Cooper again belittles the evidence given by Phyllis Wynjorroc and he seeks to explain away her unqualified evidence to suit his own purposes. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Phyllis' statement that `there is just the one Bula place now' is revealing because it conflicts with a considerable body of documented research-</PARA>
<PARA>and this research was done by nobody but Mr Cooper-</PARA>
<PARA>and with her own knowledge of the Bula Sickness Country that there are a number of important Bula site foci of which the Sleisbeck site is only one. We are left to assume that Phyllis is simply telling the Senator what she thinks he wants to hear. </PARA>

<PARA> On page 14 of this document Cooper takes exception to the minority report drawing on the evidence of Nipper Brown and Barraway in respect of the registration of Coronation Hill by the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Protection Authority. We did that because that was the primary evidence given to us. We simply responded to the evidence given by Barraway and Brown and we drew our conclusions accordingly. Mr Cooper takes exception to the fact that I and my colleagues drew the conclusion that we could not be satisfied that Nipper Brown or Barraway had registered Coronation Hill as a sacred site.

<PARA> Mr Barraway-No, I have never. </PARA>
<PARA>He did not sound too confused about the question. I then asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Have you ever thought of Coronation Hill as a sacred site?</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, I was asking him whether he had ever contemplated Coronation Hill as a sacred site, never mind signing an application for it to be registered by the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Protection Authority. Mr Barraway answered:</PARA>
<PARA>No. </PARA>
<PARA>I then asked Nipper Brown, the senior custodian:</PARA>
<PARA>Can women go on Coronation Hill anywhere?</PARA>
<PARA>I asked that question because we had been told by Mr Cooper that it was a sacred site; that women would know that it was a sacred site and therefore they should not be anywhere near it; and that their evidence was irrelevant. Mr Brown answered:</PARA>
<PARA>Yes. They looked at the mine. </PARA>
<PARA>He was thinking in contemporary terms. I then asked Sarah Flora:</PARA>
<PARA>Sarah, you say that you have been on Coronation Hill?</PARA>

<PARA> Ms Wynjorroc-It is all okay. </PARA>
<PARA>Ms Wynjorroc is an elderly lady. I asked her the following question:</PARA>
<PARA>Has it always been okay as long as you have known?</PARA>
<PARA> Ms Wynjorroc replied, `Yes'. I pressed it even further. The transcript reads:</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You have never heard stories about Coronation Hill being a sacred site?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>That is a leading question, I would have thought, under Mr Cooper's definition. The answer was no. Not satisfied with that answer, I led her further. The transcript reads:</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No whispers or no stories?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ms Wynjorroc-No. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has never been a scared site?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I am never satisfied with an explicit answer. I have to pester these people and persuade them that they are wrong. Ms Wynjorroc, under duress to answer the way I wanted her to answer, said `No' again-in spite of what might have been perceived to be my line of questioning. I would have thought that by definition and by the evidence the conclusions we drew were not unreasonable. The reason the Committee concluded that the application for Coronation Hill to be made a sacred site by Nipper Brown or Barraway was dubious was that their names were shown on the application forms. They are both thoroughly illiterate. They cannot read the words `Emu Bitter' on a label. They would not know what they were signing on a social welfare cheque except that they become familiar with the composition of the words, or the letters. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told by Mr Cooper that of course they signed the form-their crosses are on it, their signatures are on it. I asked them a simple, elementary, fundamental question and I was told by them that they had not signed the form. Mr Cooper is very angry that I drew the illogical conclusion that they had not signed the form. In my view, on the evidence before us, they had never thought that Coronation Hill was a sacred site. But Mr Cooper always has thought so, apparently, and that is what enraged him. The evidence speaks for itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Cooper speaks about the Barunga meeting on 15 August called by the Jawoyn elders to ask that the nine employees of the Coronation Hill joint venture desist from working for the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) and withdraw their labour. I was not there personally, so, on balance, I have to make a judgment in the scales of belief as to who was telling the truth. I am told by BHP senior personnel who were there that the meeting concluded that the Jawoyn employees should continue their employment. Mr Cooper says that is not true. On balance, I have to look for evidence which substantiates the claim of one or the other. Jawoyn people are still working as employees on the Coronation Hill joint venture. The very day I wrote the report, I rang representatives of the Coronation Hill joint venture and asked how many people were up there. They said, `There are 40 people at this moment living on the site'. I would have thought that was fairly compelling evidence to anybody who has an orderly mind that the majority of the Jawoyn people are not dissatisfied with Jawoyn people being employees of BHP. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Cooper went on to tell us that Nipper Brown and Sandy Barraway approved of mining because they thought it could be conducted without explosives. I repeat the evidence of Mr McDonald, who is an elder of the Jawoyn people. I will not repeat all of it--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take the three minutes, and ask for an extension. At the invitation of BHP Mr McDonald went to Groote Eylandt, where BHP has a mining operation. I asked about that matter and Mr McDonald said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> They showed us what they were doing on Groote Eylandt. We went to Groote Eylandt, had a look around at what BHP does with them there. They showed us around there and the Aboriginal people were happy with what BHP had done with them. When we came back we had a meeting about that with the Jawoyn mob and they said if there is mining like that it all right. </PARA>
<PARA> A representative from BHP told me that BHP had taken the people to Groote Eylandt, explained how it worked and the Aboriginal people had seen explosives being detonated. Mr Cooper dismisses that by saying that Mr McDonald was but a junior elder of the Jawoyn people. Anybody who disagreed with Mr Cooper had a defect, without question. When it came to Mr Fordimail, who was junior to Nipper Brown, saying that Coronation Hill was a site of significance, the fact that he was junior was totally inconsequential. It is only when Mr McDonald is junior that it is material. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Cooper claimed that the minority report numbers of the Jawoyn people living or being at Coronation Hill were incorrect. I can only say that the number was confirmed by the management of BHP on the very day that I wrote the minority report. I am fussy about statistics, and I bothered to ring and ask for a count on that very day. They rang the manager out on the site, who did a head count, rang me back and told me the number of people who were there. Apparently that does not satisfy Senator Zakharov, Mr Cooper or the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Authority. I notice that Mr Cooper does not contradict our evidence that on 13 September 1988 nine Jawoyn people worked at Coronation Hill, a further 58 had signed applications and an additional 17 Jawoyn people-prospective employees-visited the site between April and September 1988, at the time when the minority report was written. Those statistics are in the report and Mr Cooper is stunningly silent on them. Mr Cooper seeks to disagree with our assertion that the majority of senior custodians support mining. I do not intend to repeat the evidence or retrace my steps. The evidence given directly to the Committee is capable of standing alone. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, before I turn to another subject, I see that my time is about to expire, so I will have to continue these remarks at the next sitting of the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make some brief remarks about two permanent residents of Australia. The first is Mr Chae Sun Lee. I am in receipt of information that the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs may enforce a deportation order against Mr Chae Sun Lee on 18 July this year. Mr Chae Sun Lee, who was born on 24 April 1940 in Korea, became a permanent resident of Australia on 28 April 1976. He actually entered Australia on 7 November 1974. Since his entry to Australia he has not departed the country. Therefore, he has spent an uninterrupted period of time in Australia since that date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 17 November 1984 he was arrested and charged with attempting to unlawfully kill on two counts. He protested his innocence all the way along the line, still protests his innocence and an appeal is pending. He was convicted and sentenced in Perth on 28 June 1985. He was sentenced to a minimum term of imprisonment of 4 1/2 years and a maximum term of 9 1/2 years. On 18 July 1989, the date on which the Department of Immigration plans to deport him, he will have been in Australia for an uninterrupted period of 14 years, eight months and two weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, traditionally it has been official policy not to deport any person who has been residing here legally for at least 10 years. Mr Lee has been and presently is attempting to appeal against his conviction. He is also waiting on a decision of the Legal Aid Commission in order to appeal against the Department of Corrective Services in Western Australia because he is claiming medical and physical neglect during his time in prison; in fact he has lost the sight of one eye. I do not want to say too much about that as an appeal is pending. However, if this deportation order is carried out in July, it will mean that his appeal will not be brought before the courts beforehand. That does not appear to be particularly just. I place on record that, as Mr Lee has an appeal pending against Corrective Services in Western Australia, he should not be deported until his appeal has been heard. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Australian resident whom I wish to mention is Mr Eduardo Rojas. He is 21 years old. He came to Australia from Chile just two years ago. He came in on the immigration program based on humanitarian concerns. He had previously been a political prisoner in Chile. He and his wife have two children, who were both born in Australia and, therefore, are Australian citizens. Mr Rojas accompanied Mr Sergio Buschmann while Mr Buschmann was in Australia. In fact, he was given the job of accompanying Mr Buschmann back to Sweden to help ensure his safe passage to that country. Not only has Mr Buschmann been detained by the United States authorities at Anchorage in Alaska, but it appears that Mr Eduardo Rojas has also been detained. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Eduardo Rojas is a permanent resident in Australia. It appears that the United States may be considering a possible exchange of both Mr Buschmann and Mr Rojas for two Chilean officers. It appears that the United States may be in negotiation at present with regard to extraditing both of these people to Chile. My concern is that this should not happen to a permanent resident in Australia. In Mr Buschmann's case we are looking at the various refugee conventions to which Australia is a signatory. Mr Rojas is a permanent resident of Australia and, therefore, is entitled to the protection of Australian authorities. I exhort the Government to ensure that Mr Rojas is returned safely to his family in Australia as soon as possible. </PARA>
