<TITLE>Tasmania: VHF, UHF Transmission</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned residents of Tasmania respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the mountainous terrain and geography of Tasmania makes VHF television transmissions the most suitable for the State.</PARA>
<PARA> That more than 30,000 Tasmanians will have to purchase new television receivers and new antennae if commercial television in the State is forced to change from the VHF to the UHF band.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore request that the requirement by the Department of Transport and Communications to force Tasmania's two commercial television stations to change from the VHF to the UHF band by 1993 be immediately rescinded.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned about the increase in violent television programmes for children and particularly those programmes promoting violent toys that are available for sale in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray:</PARA>
<PARA> That you support the Broadcasting (Prohibition of Violent Programmes for Children) Act 1988 which has been presented by WA Independent Senator for Nuclear Disarmament, Jo Vallentine. This Act aims to prohibit the broadcasting of children's TV programmes that are violent and that promote toys modelled on characters, weapons or other war accessories which are also available for sale in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> We, the undersigned:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) are opposed to the holding of an arms bazaar, AIDEX '89, at the National Exhibition Centre in Canberra on 28-30 November 1989;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) believe that it is inappropriate for Australia to seek to offset its balance of payments deficit incurred through the import of expensive and unnecessary military equipment by seeking to double military exports over the next three to five years;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) regard it as offensive that on one hand we offer foreign aid to neighbouring countries to improve their material standard of being, while on the other hand the merchants of death seek to persuade their rulers to buy military equipment which is entirely inappropriate to the needs of the people;</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners respectfully request that the Senate urge the Government to cancel this exhibition just as its predecessor, PADEX, was called off in 1986, the International Year of Peace.</PARA>

<TITLE>X-rated and Violent Video Material</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of citizens of Australia points out:</PARA>
<PARA> that all State Governments, States Attorneys-General, most women's groups and the majority of men in Australia, including significant numbers of members of Parliament, are totally opposed to the importation and distribution of `X' and excessively violent `R'-rated video pornography in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> that most `X'-rated material available in Australia is imported;</PARA>
<PARA> that the Federal Government, by its Customs power under the Constitution, and not the A.C.T. Government, is solely responsible for controlling the importation of this pornographic material;</PARA>
<PARA> that by continuing to allow the importation of such pornographic material, the Federal Government is neglecting its responsibility to the women, children and families of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners, therefore, request the Senate to:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Ban `X'-rated pornographic material at the point of entry into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Exclude from the `R'-rated all gratuitously violent material.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and the Senators in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That every abortion kills an unborn human baby.</PARA>
<PARA> That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights.</PARA>
<PARA> That in 1988/89 the Federal Government paid $6.9 million from taxpayers' funds for 64,788 abortions under Medicare Items 6469 and 274/275 alone.</PARA>
<PARA> That in the same year Federal Government grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State public hospitals.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of motions are coming before the Senate today which seek leave for committees to meet. There are motions moved by Senator Alston, Senator Burns and Senator McKiernan. On behalf of the Opposition I make clear our attitude to these matters, which is that, as a general rule, committees should not sit while the Senate is sitting. I want to make this clear because we have made an exception with respect to the Senate Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Airline Pilots' Dispute. We did because the Committee was given a very tight deadline, questions of safety were involved and we thought it was inconsistent with our putting down a motion requiring a tight deadline and an early report, and then refusing the Committee the capacity to meet. As far as we are concerned, that is the exception.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We feel that we have to justify that on the facts. That is the attitude of the Opposition party room, which I thought I should express so that it would be known that their views were regarded as significant and important. This should be seen as exceptional. We have received a number of requests which would have involved as many as eight senators at a time being tied up. From the point of view of quorums and from the point of view of keeping the chamber operating and so on, that does give rise to difficulties. The motions which we are agreeing to today-that is why I want to make this explanation-in the main do not affect senators. A number of committees which do not require the attendance of senators are meeting and that is why we are going along with it. We are agreeing to a meeting of the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations, which meets at 10 p.m. Because of the particular circumstances and because it is being held at that hour of night, we do not think that it will impede the smooth and proper running of the Senate. I simply make it clear to those many honourable senators on committees that the Opposition's view in general is that they should meet when the Senate is not sitting. </PARA>

<PARA>CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL</PARA>
<PARA>(No. 4) 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1989, which is now before the Senate contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, Schedule one, operative on and from the first of January 1988, allows continued duty free treatment of ethyl hexanol. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule two operates on and from the first of July 1988 and provides a free rate of duty for rye grass seed and certain gasoline and other oils. This rate was previously applied by the Customs Tariff (Rates Alteration) Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule three contains a minor amendment to subheading 9616.10 to align it with the international harmonised system. It will operate on and from the fourteenth day of October 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule four, operative on and from the first of March 1989, provides for the accelerated liberalisation of trade in textiles, clothing and footwear goods of New Zealand origin. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule five, operative on and from the first of July 1989, contains:</PARA>
<PARA> Further changes under the ANZCERTA agreement to remove tariff and quota restrictions on apparel from New Zealand and achieve free trade access a year earlier than originally proposed;</PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to take account of changes in the names of a number of countries or places which qualify for preferential treatment;</PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to give effect to the Government's decision on the mining, construction and agricultural equipment industries. These changes allow duty free entry to certain mining and agricultural equipment not normally made in Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA> A reduction in the rate of duty on soda ash to compensate for the effect of changes to the customs valuation system made on the first of July 1989. This reduction follows a report by the Industries Assistance Commission and subsequent discussions with the industries concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule six operates on and from the first of August 1989. It provides quota free and duty free access for certain ski boots and cross country ski footwear. It also implements a free rate of duty for certain fabric woven from PVC coated polyester, and woven cut corduroy. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedules seven and eight contain amendments to correct industry assistance anomalies resulting from the introduction of the harmonised tariff. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule seven, operative on and from the twelfth of October 1989 provides a free rate of duty for certain cast coated paper and paperboard. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule eight amendments will operate from seven days after this Bill receives royal assent. The goods covered in this schedule include machines for working metal, knives and cutting blades for wood chipping machines, plywood, sensitised papers and certain machines containing a computer controller. </PARA>
<PARA> Also contained in schedule eight are amendments to extend the provisions of the Australian system of tariff preferences (ASTP) to Poland and Hungary. Far-reaching reforms in the political and economic spheres are in train in both these countries. The government attaches priority to the coordinated action being taken by western industrialised countries to give support and encouragement to these changes. Our action is consistent with measures already adopted or being adopted in various other countries such as USA, Japan and New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in schedule nine, which is to operate on and from the first of January 1990, is an amendment to item 19 in schedule four as a consequence of changes proposed by the Customs and Excise Legislation Bill (No. 4) 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>FINANCIAL IMPACT</PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the amendments to the textiles, clothing and footwear arrangements contained in this Bill are considered to be negligible. </PARA>
<PARA> The revenue impact of changes to the mining, construction and agricultural equipment industries is expected to be virtually nil as the equipment concerned is not manufactured in Australia in the normal course of business. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments relating to soda ash involve no budget outlays. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision of ASTP status to Poland and Hungary can be expected to result in some increase in imports though this is unlikely to have any significant impact on domestic markets. Imports in 1988/89 were approximately $31 million from Poland and $28 million from Hungary. Customs revenue forgone as a result of the application of developing rates is expected to be approximately $1 million in respect of Poland and $0.7 million for Hungary. </PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult to assess the net financial impact of the proposed tariff changes to correct tariff anomalies. Some will have the effect of reducing or removing import duty, others will increase duty or permit reinstatement of bounty. However, the measures proposed will generally only restore the position which applied before 1 January 1988 and are not likely to result in any substantial change to revenue or outlays. </PARA>
<PARA> Details of the amendments contained in this Bill have been included in an explanatory memorandum which has been circulated for the information of honourable members. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>CUSTOMS AND EXCISE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1989</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is an omnibus measure proposing a series of amendments to the principal Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901, along the lines of the similarly titled Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bills introduced into this place over the last few years. In addition, this Bill proposes a series of repeals of various unproclaimed sections of early 1980s Customs and Excise Acts, following a recent review of unproclaimed Customs-related legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The main proposals contained in the Bill relate to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the termination of manufacturing in bond, announced by the Government in the context of the 1988 May Economic Statement (Clauses 7 and 8);</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the amendments to the Commercial Tariff Concession System (Part XVa of the Customs Act 1901) announced by the Government on 14 September 1989 (Clauses 18 to 29); and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the new requirement that all potable spirits imported into Australia in bulk containers be repackaged in licensed premises prior to entry for home consumption (Clause 9), and that locally produced spirit be repackaged in non-bulk containers prior to entry for home consumption (Clause 37) as announced by the Government on 18 December 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall refer briefly to each of those proposals now. </PARA>
<PARA>Manufacture in Bond</PARA>
<PARA> Manufacture in bond arrangements permit the production of prescribed goods in a manufacturing warehouse licensed by Customs, for both domestic and export markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The stated objective of the manufacture in bond scheme is to promote local manufacture of goods. The scheme is meant to assist local manufacturers by:</PARA>
<PARA> Allowing them to defer payment of duty on imported inputs used in production until the completed (manufactured) product is entered for home consumption; and</PARA>
<PARA> Allowing goods manufactured in bond to be entered for home consumption at the lesser amount of either the combined duty of the imported components or the duty payable on the finished article if it were imported. </PARA>
<PARA> Other inherent benefits of the scheme are that wastages of imported materials and/or components in the production process are not dutiable, duties are not payable on imported inputs used in the manufacture of goods for export and, prior to the May Economic Statement of 1988, manufacturers were not liable for duty on imported inputs used in the manufacture of goods sold to Commonwealth authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> In January 1987 the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) reported to the Government on export concessions (Report No. 399 dated 16 January 1987) and recommended, inter alia, that manufacture in bond be abolished. </PARA>
<PARA> The commission found that the original objectives of the scheme have not been pursued. At the time of the inquiry the only goods being produced were blended oils (manufactured by one plant) and telecommunication equipment (manufactured by 14 licensed warehouses, which has subsequently been further reduced to only 4 warehouses). </PARA>
<PARA> The manufacture in bond scheme has not promoted Australian manufacturing industry and it tends to discourage investment in, and the sourcing of, materials and components from other domestic import competing industries, because with concessional entry under the scheme, it is often cheaper to source materials and components from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme has also not been effective in promoting exports as only a small proportion of the goods produced in bond have been exported. The IAC noted, and the Government accepted, that there are alternative and more effective assistance schemes in existence which provide duty concessions on imported inputs, notably the commercial tariff concession system and, from the viewpoint of export promotion, schemes such as the duty drawback and by-law for export schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government accepted the IAC's recommendation to abolish this scheme and announced, in May 1988 as part of the May Economic Statement, its intention to terminate manufacture in bond. The proposed amendment in clause 8 of this Bill will terminate the manufacture in bond facility as from 1 January 1990. The activities of blending and packaging however, will still be permitted in licensed warehouses. </PARA>
<PARA>Commercial Tariff Concession System</PARA>
<PARA> The main purpose of the amendments to Part XVa of the Customs Act (relating to the commercial tariff concession system) is to overcome the narrow interpretation that has been placed on the provisions contained therein by decisions of the Federal Court such as that in Corinthian Industries (Syd) Pty Ltd v Comptroller-General of Customs and others, contrary to the original intent of the Government when the scheme was introduced in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding that the Government has announced that the new Industry Commission will review the overall objectives and operation of the commercial tariff concession system, it believes immediate action is necessary to implement the proposals contained in this Bill, in order to restore the original intention of the system, overcome operational problems and provide additional benefits to industry. The changes proposed will enable the system to be effectively administered in the period up to the Industry Commission report, expected in late 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of background to the proposed changes in clauses 18 to 29 of this Bill, it is opportune to recall the original purpose and intent of the legislative provisions in this part of the Customs Act. </PARA>
<PARA> On 2 July 1982 the Industries Assistance Commission reported to the Government of the day recommending that a modified commercial by-law system be introduced. The Government accepted the report and introduced the commercial tariff concession system with the clear intention that it would be broad in interpretation and predictable in administration. </PARA>
<PARA> The system provides a mechanism to allow the duty free entry of goods, where goods serving similar functions are not produced or capable of being produced in Australia in the normal course of business. </PARA>
<PARA> Experience with the system has pointed to several changes which could be made to improve operational efficiency. In the May 1988 Economic Statement the Government announced that it would modify the system to more closely align its operation with the Government's industry and technology policy objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequent to that Economic Statement, decisions by the Federal Court have highlighted restrictive and narrow interpretations to various definitions contained in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> To restore the Australian Customs Service's ability to administer the legislation in accordance with the Government's intentions, it is necessary to make appropriate changes to the legislation and fine tune operational aspects of the system. The amendments proposed in this Bill seek to achieve this. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, it is proposed to delete from the legislation the interpretation of ``particular goods'', ``serving similar functions'' and ``capable of being produced/repaired in the normal course of business'', and the term ``particular'' from the phrase ``particular goods'' where it is no longer relevant. (Clause 18 refers). </PARA>
<PARA> These definitions have proven to be a source of contention and have forced administrators to interpret the legislation more narrowly than the Government intended. The removal of these definitions from the legislation and their replacement by principles for the interpretation of key phrases (Clause 19 refers), will ensure that administrators, importers and local manufacturers have a clear understanding of the system's objectives and will provide the flexibility to ensure that the system can be administered as the Government originally intended. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, as the Federal Court has determined in Corinthian Industries that the existing legislation limits the scope of a concession order to the particular goods that are the subject of an application, legislative amendments are necessary to enable commercial tariff concession orders to be issued in relation to the relevant class of goods rather than the narrowly specified products sometimes described in applications. This power, contained in clause 20, is necessary because, under the current provisions, neither the applicant nor the Comptroller-General of Customs is empowered to change the wording of an application. In practical terms this means that if, for example, after approaches to local manufacturers, an applicant accepts that a concession can only be issued for a narrower range of goods than that applied for, such a concession cannot be granted unless a new application is made. This results however, not only in a substantial loss of time, but importantly, the loss of the original operative date of the concession. </PARA>
<PARA> Another proposed amendment concerns section 269e, relating to the national interest discretion, amongst other matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently the Comptroller-General of Customs has the power to refuse to grant a concession order if he considers such a concession is not in the national interest. The Government considers that such power is more appropriately vested in a Minister, and therefore clause 22 effects the necessary amendment in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, amendments are proposed to sections 269n and h of the Act by clauses 27 and 24 respectively to facilitate the granting of specified period concession orders, and simplify the date of commencement of all orders. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, an application can be preceded by a notice of intention to make a concession order which allows the applicant twenty eight days to obtain and present the information required for a legal application. If the application is received within the twenty eight day period the date of lodgment of the notice of intention becomes the operative date when a concession order is issued. The Government proposes to abolish this practice and automatically make the date of effect for all concessions twenty eight days prior to date of lodgment of the application. Such action will reduce paper work for clients and unnecessary checking by administrators. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, under the current legislative regime concession orders cannot be granted for periods during an application's processing time. The Government believes in principle that in such circumstances a concession should be available, an initiative widely supported by industry. It is therefore proposed to amend the legislation to allow a concession order to be granted from cessation of availability of locally produced goods or from the normal date of commencement to the day local production commenced or a local manufacturer satisfies the capability to produce criteria. (Clause 27 refers).</PARA>
<PARA>Abolition of out of Bond Bottling/Packaging</PARA>
<PARA> The final matter I wish to address concerning this Bill relates to the proposed amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901 in Clauses 9 and 37 respectively relating to the new control regime for imported and locally produced potable spirits. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments propose that all potable spirits be bottled or packaged into non bulk containers in licensed premises prior to their entry for home consumption, which is the point at which duty is assessed and collected. The amendments will have the effect of removing the facility which currently exists for such spirit to be entered into home consumption in bulk containers. Such a practice has been identified both by this Parliament's Public Accounts Committee, and by the Industries Assistance Commission in its report No. 408 of 19 November 1987 on the Customs and Excise Bond System, as one which increases the possibility of illicit spirit production via the mixing of duty paid spirit with illicit spirit. </PARA>
<PARA> To address the possible risk both to Commonwealth revenue and public health from this practice of bottling or packaging spirit outside of licensed premises, the Government proposes as from 1 January 1990 to effect the change outlined. </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining provisions in this Bill propose a series of minor policy or technical drafting changes, which are explained in detail in the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. One of the proposed amendments however, I would like to touch on briefly here. That relates to the amendment in Clause 6, which provides a head of power to permit the making of regulations to impose a fee for services to defray the costs incurred by the Australian Customs Service in respect of preparing certain kinds of import entries lodged under Section 36 of the Customs Act 1901. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government appreciates the sensitivity which attaches to any cost recovery initiatives, and will only proceed with such fees after suitable consultation with relevant government agencies and industry bodies. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments in this Bill have no direct financial implications. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the accompanying explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA> Debate (on motion by Senator Reid) adjourned. </PARA>

<PARA>BROADCASTING AMENDMENT BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill represents the first stage of legislation to reform the operation of broadcasting regulation. It contains measures that address some immediate deficiencies in the Broadcasting Act 1942. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill gives the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal access to more appropriate remedies in cases where a commercial radio or television licensee does not meet the basic suitability requirements that are currently applicable to a licence. It also includes amendments to:</PARA>
<PARA> confirm that the Minister can initiate, and the Tribunal can hold, joint inquiries into the grant of a licence for a supplementary or independent commercial FM radio service in a regional area;</PARA>
<PARA> allow aspirant public broadcasters to transmit sponsorship announcements when conducting test transmissions; and</PARA>
<PARA> allow public licensees to broadcast community promotional material. </PARA>
<PARA> Further reforms are to be developed quickly and will be contained in amendments to be introduced in the Autumn and Budget Sittings of Parliament next year. The reforms to be introduced early next year will focus on measures to improve substantially the operation of key areas of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's responsibilities, in particular, the ownership and control enforcement scheme. These reforms will be consistent with the wider review. The final package, to be presented in the second half of next year, will incorporate the conclusions of the wider review of broadcasting regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> I will deal now with the ownership and control provisions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, the Tribunal would be faced with extremely limited options if, after conducting an inquiry that it was required to hold, it were to find that a commercial licensee was no longer ``fit and proper'', or no longer had the financial, technical or management capacity to provide an adequate and comprehensive service. It presently may only impose licence conditions or suspend, revoke or not renew the licence. But if the licensee's unsuitability was due to the conduct or character of a person in a position to control the licensee company or its operations, licence conditions may not be an effective remedy. This is because the conditions may not be capable of affecting the influence of the relevant person on the licensee company. The only other remedies available-suspension, revocation or refusal to renew the licence-would put the service off the air. </PARA>
<PARA> Cessation of a service would penalise not only the licensee company, but also the viewing or listening public and other innocent shareholders and creditors. There is a need to give the Tribunal more flexible and less draconian remedies. This Bill achieves that objective. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill allows the Tribunal, where it finds that a commercial licensee is no longer suitable to hold the licence, to issue specific directions to relevant parties and/or to impose appropriate licence conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> These provisions do not create new substantive powers for the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of licence conditions, the Bill simply confirms that the existing power of the Tribunal under section 85 of the Act can be used as an alternative to licence cancellation. Similarly, in the case of directions, the Bill only extends the current directions power under section 92m of the Act to enable it to be used in the event of a failure by a licensee to meet basic suitability requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> In some circumstances, licence conditions or directions may still be insufficient to deal with the situation. In these cases, the amendments allow the Tribunal to order divestment of relevant interests. </PARA>
<PARA> If a relevant interest is directed to be divested a strict six month deadline will apply. This is because by then it would have been fully established by the Tribunal, if necessary through court and Administrative Appeals Tribunal avenues, that the licensee failed to meet the suitability requirements and that divestment was the appropriate remedy. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage the Government proposes no change to arrangements for any divestment that may be required in other circumstances, such as following a breach of ownership limits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides powers for the Tribunal to impose licence conditions and to issue directions to apply pending divestment. These powers will mirror the existing provisions that are available to the Tribunal pending its consideration of a share transaction. The purpose of this power is to enable the Tribunal to prevent actions that might adversely affect the service. </PARA>
<PARA> The range of licensing remedies provided in this Bill enables the sanctions of licence suspension or revocation to be put in a clearer perspective. These remedies are best used as an ultimate deterrent against repeated or serious breaches of the Act. This Bill will remove concern that such draconian actions could be taken by the Tribunal because it had no other real alternative. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point I would like to refer more generally to the powers that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has long held under section 85 to impose licence conditions at any time, and, under section 92m, to issue directions pending an inquiry into an ownership transaction. In recent months some doubt had been cast on the possible validity of the section 92m, power and a possible procedural requirement may have inhibited its use in practice. These doubts had led to calls for additional powers to be provided to the Tribunal. In the light of advice from the Attorney-General's Department, the Government now considers that the current section 92m powers are valid. There are no undue obstacles to the use of these powers, or to the imposition of licence conditions, in cases where such steps would be properly warranted by the circumstances. Accordingly, the Government is not proposing any amendments in this respect at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also makes some minor adjustments and clarifications that reinforce existing policy and do not pre-empt the Government's ongoing review of broadcasting regulation about which I will say more, later in these remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill places beyond doubt the power of the Tribunal to inquire concurrently into applications for grant of both commercial radio licences and supplementary licences in the same market. These amendments answer arguments that the Act may require those applications to be considered sequentially, an interpretation that could substantially delay the introduction of new, competitive radio services in non-metropolitan markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also will permit public broadcasters to transmit community promotional material. Presently, public broadcasters may transmit community information, which under recent interpretations, may not be promotional in nature. The Government considers that this is too restrictive and that public broadcasters should be able to promote actively genuine community events of interest to their listeners. </PARA>
<PARA> While the promotion of commercial sponsors will continue to be prohibited as a form of advertising, the Government is considering the implications of recent Tribunal findings (and a Federal Court decision) on these aspects, and may propose further clarifying amendments if that seems necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment has been cast in broad terms on the basis that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has power to make Program Standards in this area if the Tribunal considers that to be appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also allow public broadcasters undertaking test transmissions to broadcast sponsorship announcements as if they were licensed services. This will assist aspirant public groups to pay for the tests, and enable them to gauge the level of support likely to be available within the community. Any breaches of the sponsorship requirements during the test would be an offence, and may also be taken into account by the Tribunal when it comes to determining who should be licensed. </PARA>
<PARA> The continued growth of public broadcasting as an integral element of the Australian broadcasting system is fully appreciated by the Government and these amendments will continue to assist that growth. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes proposed today serve to introduce immediate improvements to the present system. The basic legislation needs further improvement. I turn now to the question of further, more fundamental reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The Broadcasting Act has rightly been described as a complex, unwieldy piece of legislation. The Government is committed to its ongoing reform. In November 1988, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure tabled a report making recommendations on changes to the role and functions of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. This was followed by a supplementary report in May 1989. Both reports have proved to be valuable contributions in pointing out deficiencies in the present system and setting out issues for reform. </PARA>
<PARA> In July of this year, the Minister for Transport and Communications, released a Departmental discussion paper, ``Review of Broadcasting Regulation'', that focused mainly on the current regulatory system and suggested some options for change. Public comment was sought on that paper. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the submissions received so far in response to the Departmental discussion paper have argued for extensive changes to the system of broadcasting regulation. Several interest groups have asked for more time to address the issues before making their full submissions, and the Minister for Transport and Communications has agreed to this. </PARA>
<PARA> The public debate has provided valuable further perspectives on difficult problems. There is widespread agreement on the need to introduce measures to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the ownership and control scheme. But even more importantly, there has been general support, properly qualified by the need to protect the public interest, for the view that there would be merit in a more wide-ranging examination of broadcasting regulation. The submissions consistently argued for this. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport and Communications has asked his Department to proceed with options for ongoing reform, building on the reforms already introduced by this Government. In 1987 this Government fundamentally reformed the television ownership and control limits in the Act. The following year we reformed the limitations on the ownership and control of commercial radio stations. </PARA>
<PARA> We replaced the old two station rule for television ownership with limitations based on audience reach. We replaced the old limits on radio station holdings with new limits which recognised growth and development in the radio industry. We also introduced cross media limits between radio, television and newspaper outlets in the same marketplace. Broadcasting ownership and control policies have thus been clearly stated and implemented by this Government. The rules embodying these policies have been laid down in the Act. In this area efficiency reforms are now called for. </PARA>
<PARA> At present the limitations on ownership and control are enforced by complex mechanisms, including an extensive system of notification and approval of a wide range of commercial transactions. Other areas of commercial activity do not have the same degree of oversight upon them-be it by the Trade Practices Commission, the National Companies and Securities Commission, or the Australian Stock Exchange-this is because, historically, the community and the Parliament have considered broadcasting to warrant a higher level of public scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there needs to be a mechanism to scrutinise and enforce ownership and control limits by means that impose less of a burden on licensees, investors and the Tribunal. We intend to bring forward in the Autumn Sittings next year a package of measures to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the ownership and control scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Ownership and control rules serve four separate main purposes. The first is to limit the concentration of ownership, control and influence of the media. The second, which is related to the first, is to encourage competition and diversity in programming and the range of views to be presented. The third is to restrict foreign ownership. The fourth is to support the present licensing requirements including the suitability of prescribed interest-holders in individual licences. There may be merit in developing legislation that addresses these aspects separately, so that non-controlling investors are not unnecessarily caught up in regulation addressing the suitability of those who control licences, and so that there is greater consistency with general business regulation that affects foreign ownership or aspects of ownership that affect competition. </PARA>
<PARA> This ``efficiency package'' may also streamline the Tribunal's public inquiry processes. However, in addition to taking immediate steps to introduce efficiency reforms in well settled areas of broadcasting policy there is a need to examine the principles of broadcasting regulation from a wider perspective. This aspect of the review will be directed at ensuring that future legislation more clearly serves explicit Governmental policy objectives, in particular, that the industry is subject only to the minimum regulation necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, full deregulation is not appropriate for this industry because it involves so many important public interest issues. For that reason appropriate licensing arrangements and standards are still necessary, as are rules to limit cross media ownership, audience reach and multiple licence ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> The regulation that is retained in the revised scheme will need to be capable of efficient administration. There will need to be certainty for all affected parties, while maintaining appropriate public access and providing for natural justice. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the high level of public interest in this area, I will now outline briefly its scope and the direction that the Government will be pursuing in its ongoing reform of broadcasting regulation. We will be addressing seven key areas. </PARA>
<PARA> First, future broadcasting legislation must serve the explicit policy aim that there be no more regulation of industry than is necessary to support stated objectives. The Government has previously spelled out objectives that address diversity and quality of programming, Australian content, local programming needs, concentration and diversity in broadcasting media ownership and control. It is the responsibility of Government to provide the environment in which broadcasting objectives can best be met. </PARA>
<PARA> This requires further consideration of the proper balance between structural measures-including an appropriate level of competition, perhaps linked to some self-regulation-and external regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, Mr President, there is the area of new services and service delivery methods. The current scheme of legislation in broadcasting, radiocommunications and telecommunications needs to be re- examined to recognise the interactions</PARA>
<PARA> between broadcasting services and broadcasting-related services, such as Video and Audio Entertainment and Information Services or VAEIS and narrowcast services;</PARA>
<PARA> between broadcasting services and some emerging value added telecommunications services;</PARA>
<PARA> between broadcasting services and the cinema, video-hire and other VCR-derived services; and</PARA>
<PARA> between broadcasting and the Australian film, music and entertainment production industries. </PARA>
<PARA> This is certainly not to say that any regulation should be applied uniformly-or at all-to the various types of services; indeed quite the contrary. When the Minister for Transport and Communications released his Department's discussion paper, he said that the Government is committed to ensuring that services are not subjected to unnecessary regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> Where different technical or commercial arrangements deliver services that are essentially similar to the user, then it is inappropriate to subject them to different regulatory regimes. At present there are quite different regulatory arrangements governing programs provided in the cinema, on video-tape or through broadcasting. But as the differences in the means of access to programs become less significant, the regulatory differences need to be reduced or eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA> New applications for communications technology are being developed, and the distinction between broadcasting services and these new applications is becoming increasingly unclear. We need regulation that facilitates and encourages these new services. This means that they should not be subject to ad-hoc regulatory arrangements; nor should they be artificially forced into a traditional-and even outdated-broadcasting regulatory regime. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time we need to recognise the interlocking nature of the various pieces of communications legislation, and continue to ensure their consistency and integration, and their relevance to what is happening out there in the real world. But this does not necessarily mean an all-embracing single communications Act. Rather it means the progressive updating of the legislation to achieve the objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> The third area comprises all those activities that are traditionally referred to as ``planning''. Communications planning processes need to be restructured to ensure accountability through a more transparent process. </PARA>
<PARA> Present arrangements require the Minister and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to be heavily involved in judgments about when a service area needs or can support new commercial services. We need to develop arrangements that provide greater scope for broadcasters to take initiatives and carry them forward on their own responsibility to tap new markets and new market segments. We also need to examine whether community needs are better recognised and met by the integration of planning and licensing arrangements under the umbrella of an independent authority. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the fourth area is that part of the Act dealing with ownership and control. The continuing need for limitations on ownership and control in the broadcasting industry-notably in the areas of foreign ownership, audience reach, cross media limits-is generally accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> Efficiency reforms are now called for in the regulatory mechanisms which presently supervise and enforce these limits and the Minister for Transport and Communications intends to introduce such reforms in the Autumn Sittings next year. The wider review, however, may consider other aspects of ownership and control not dealt with in the efficiency package. </PARA>
<PARA> The licensing system is the fifth area. This needs to be examined to achieve a more efficient and rational approach to licence allocation, review, and renewal. A broadcasting licence is still a valuable and marketable asset. There is a case for greater use of pricing mechanisms in licence allocation. This is the basis of the Government's National Metropolitan Radio Plan and has already been used in the process of AM/FM conversion for commercial metropolitan radio stations in all the mainland State Capital cities. There is now scope to extend such arrangements further. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, a licence carries with it certain public responsibilities and there are minimum suitability and service requirements that need to be met. The present legislative formulation of these requirements warrants further examination. However, whatever the outcome of such examination, allocation methods will need to continue to take account of these responsibilities and requirements; and regulatory powers are needed in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Bill addresses some of the immediate problems in this area of licensing. But there is a need for further efficiency amendments and scope for further and more fundamental reform. This will be addressed with a view to developing arrangements that support the objectives of diversity, quality, and responsive commercial programming while eliminating undue regulatory intervention. </PARA>
<PARA> Sixth, the regulation of programming standards needs to be examined to ensure that quality is maintained in the broadcasting system. It is the Government's responsibility to safeguard the public interest, but this can be achieved by creating the right regulatory environment for industry to provide services of an acceptable standard. The question of whether standards need to be established by statutory regulation or self regulation needs to be looked at. However, this Government has no intention of abandoning its support for Australian content, quality children's programming and safeguards for community standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The seventh, and final, area involves the re-examination of the nature, responsibilities and method of operation of the regulatory agencies and the divisions of responsibilities between them and the Government. Regulatory policy is a matter for the Government and the Parliament. However the administration of regulation, as well as the provision of advice on its substance, can be and is presently assigned to, different regulatory agencies. Arrangements for administering regulation need to be consistent with the policy objectives for that regulation. While we need appropriate transparency and accountability in important regulatory decision making, we also need to find ways to streamline procedures so that regulatory processes provide opportunities for community involvement and do not unduly impede commercial arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> While many of these issues have been addressed to some extent by recent review activity, we need to look at them again from a wider, more fundamental perspective. Proposals received during recent public consultations provide a valuable foundation for this exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> In examining future options, there will be wide consultation, both within the Government and with all interested parties outside Government. The Government wants to see the fullest public debate. This will include scope for further public comment directed to the Department of Transport and Communications throughout the review process and the release of position papers on relevant issues as the review progresses. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian broadcasting industry has generally met audience and community needs well over many years. While we need to maintain continuity with this past achievement, we also intend to ensure that arrangements are in place to foster new and emerging market opportunities and to meet community needs and aspirations. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Government does not underestimate the complexity of the task that we have set ourselves. Those who may suggest that the fundamentals of broadcasting regulation are amenable to quick or simple reform fail to comprehend either the complexity and importance of the issues or the constraints of the existing legislation. Nonetheless we would hope to be in a position to introduce further legislation to improve regulatory efficiency during the Autumn Sittings, with the balance of our reform program being presented during the Budget Sittings. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is expected to have no significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>INDUSTRY COMMISSION BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> As foreshadowed in the budget, this Bill is to establish the Industry Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill sets out the scope of the Commission, its functions and policy guidelines, the constraints on Government changes to industry assistance without a Commission report, and composition and procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> It also proposes repeal and transition provisions with respect to the Industries Assistance Commission Act 1973 and the Inter-State Commission Act 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> On Budget night, the Government announced that the Industries Assistance Commission is to be restructured and renamed the Industry Commission which will become the Government's major review and inquiry body in industry matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Since that time, the Government has attached a high priority to the introduction of legislation enabling the establishment of the Industry Commission. That priority has reflected the Government's assessment of the need to continue the process of structural reform in this nation. The Industry Commission will be central to that. </PARA>
<PARA> Through its advice to the Government, the Industry Commission will play a key role in helping industry to become more efficient, more productive and more internationally competitive. And that is central to ensuring better growth prospects and better economic conditions in this nation over the years and decades ahead. Promoting efficiency is about promoting a better economic environment where growth and employment can be sustained. </PARA>
<PARA> Since coming to office, this Government has undertaken structural reform over a wide area of industry and business activity. Too quickly, people forget the fundamental nature of the financial market deregulation-including the freeing-up of capital movements and the floating of the exchange rate-that has fully brought Australia into the international economy. As a result, Australian industry has been forced to face squarely the imperatives of doing business in an international environment-and it is only in that environment that Australia will be able to provide the basis for sustained and rising living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Structural reform has also been embodied in the fundamental reviews of taxation announced in 1985 and since. We have moved to a situation where Australia has a fairer and more efficient taxation system. That has been conducive to creation of a healthier business environment where firms and individuals are rewarded more for enterprise and hard work and less for their ability to secure unfair advantages through a distorted tax regime. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally, the Government has instituted major programs of reductions in tariff and other assistance to industries. </PARA>
<PARA> As announced in May 1988, tariff protection is being progressively reduced bringing Australia more into line with the sort of competitive pressures that our trading partners face. </PARA>
<PARA> More recently, the Government has begun a process of major reform on the waterfront. This will be, of course, a progressive process, building on the understanding already achieved, and which will continue to draw on the commitment and patience of all relevant parties. In stark contrast, our predecessors were too apt to put the problem in the too hard basket. The reforms of the waterfront and coastal shipping will provide a sound basis for achieving greater efficiencies in the movement and distribution of our goods. Employment prospects at large will be enhanced as the benefits of that greater efficiency flows through the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, the Government has not shied away from the fundamental reforms required in the labour market. Together with the trade union movement and employers, the Government is working towards the development of a system that will promote greater productivity and modernisation of labour and management practices. That reform has gone hand in hand with seeking moderation in wages growth consistent with the requirements of the macroeconomic situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Substantial employment growth in the economy has already been achieved. These labour reforms offer the prospect of generating still more jobs and, through more productive and competitive industries, creating greater job security in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> All these reforms are bringing and will continue to bring real benefits to the Australian economy. They have also been part and parcel of a more sophisticated appreciation in Australia of the economic realities facing this nation. Those realities include the need to be more competitive and the need to be more hard-nosed about the use of Government resources. That debate is to be warmly welcomed-and the establishment of the Industry Commission and the transfer of the functions of the Inter-State Commission to that body will allow the Commonwealth to continue to play its major role in the development of sound industry policy in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The formation of the Industry Commission represents a new phase in the Government's ongoing strategy of structural adjustment. It is evidence of the Government's commitment to repond to the more sophisticated debate throughout the community on industry development and of the consequent greater requirements for information on policies of industry assistance and development. The Industry Commission will be better placed to participate fully in these developments and we must not waste any time in facilitating that process. </PARA>
<PARA> In that regard, the Industry Commission will further the important role that the Industries Assistance Commission has played in the structural adjustment process in Australia. It will build on the Industries Assistance Commission's earlier work which was instrumental in awakening the community to the costs of many industry assistance policies. As an institution, the Industries Assistance Commission has been an important force in economic policy in Australia, building community awareness of the need for Australian industry to be outward looking and inter- nationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Industry Commission will have a broader charter and, with new guidelines attuned to the challenge ahead, will be an important stimulus for reform. </PARA>
<PARA> By providing independent and expert advice to the Government and through its public inquiry processes, the Industry Commission will facilitate the ongoing structural change that is needed in the economy. The Industry Commission will work to involve a wide range of groups in its inquiries as part of the process of building community awareness. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with that broader charter, all references on transport matters will in the future be sent to the Industry Commission rather than to the Inter-State Commission. The staff and functions of the Inter-State Commission will be absorbed by the Industry Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> This is particularly timely. We are all fully aware of the need to continue to address vigorously the transport issues confronting Australia. They go right to the heart of the question of how we in Australia can move our goods across vast distances at the lowest cost with due regard to the broader needs of safety and possible alternative uses of existing transport systems. </PARA>
<PARA> The Inter-State Commission has been at the forefront of inquiry and analysis of transport issues. It has been a dispassionate, objective and expert source of analysis in this area and has established a high quality network on transport issues which can be integrated into the Industry Commission. That expertise and experience must be fully brought to bear in the broader charter of the Industry Commission. In this enlarged body, the resources of the Inter-State Commission will have a key role in the identification and analysis of the interrelationships between all sectors of the economy and the transport sector. The ISC's expertise needs to be brought out in the wider economic perspective provided by the Industry Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> For a start, sound policy development should be based on a full appreciation of the facts. For instance, we should be aware of the extent to which subsidising railways for passenger operation is a cost to the Australian community; and we should be aware of the need to build on the recent reforms in coastal shipping and the need to improve railfreight operations in order to ease the burdens on our roads. All these aspects are interlinked. And that is the essence of what the Industry Commission is about. Namely, the identification of economic interrelationships and the specification of the costs and benefits involved in these relationships. It is only with this sort of information that the Commonwealth Government-and, indeed, the State Governments-can make sensible and considered choices as to future policy. Choices that will ensure better and more sustained growth prospects for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided to establish an Office of Business Regulation as an administrative unit within the Industry Commission to absorb the functions of the Business Regulation Review Unit. </PARA>
<PARA> That Office will have a very important role. It will be dealing with matters that go to the heart of productivity in this economy. Inordinate and unnecessary regulation has a cost-just like any other barrier to efficient operation of business-and that cost is ultimately borne by the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Impediments to efficient operation of business and industry through regulation require as much attention as impediments flowing from other forms of industry regulation and assistance. It is therefore fully consistent with the charter of the Industry Commission that the functions of the Business Regulation Review Unit should be absorbed into this body. It will, apart from anything else, allow the Business Regulation Review Unit to gain the benefit of the economy wide perspective that will flow from the broader operations of the Industry Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> In all of this, the Government sees the establishment of the Industry Commission as providing an opportunity for a renewed and reinvigorated role for the States in the consideration of industry assistance matters in this nation. The States, of course, have responsibilities in many sectors of the economy-in intrastate transport, port authorities and electricity generation-which can impact significantly on the efficiency and competitiveness of industry. The Government will therefore be looking to cooperate closely with the States in the future on structural reform of the Government sector in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, the Government would welcome the States' positive and full participation in the Industry Commission's process of public inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA> With that in mind, the Commonwealth will be approaching the States for their assistance in drafting the terms of reference for three inquiries that cover matters relating to State Government responsibilities. As announced by the Treasurer earlier this month, those matters relate to railways, the operation of statutory marketing arrangements and the generation and distribution of power. </PARA>
<PARA> We will be inviting the States' full participation in those and all other relevant inquiries. We trust that the States will grasp the opportunity in using the Industry Commission as a source of analysis and information on matters relating to the Australian economy in general-not just those matters falling within the purview of the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This then is the context. I turn now to the key features of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that the Bill draws largely on the provisions of the IAC Act 1973, but also draws on appropriate provisions of the ISC Act 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> Except for an aspect of the repeal of the ISC Act, the Bill proposes that the commencement date of the Act would be by proclamation, or six months from Royal Assent, whichever is the sooner. </PARA>
<PARA> The definitions clauses include a broad definition of industry, which is intended to reflect the broadened charter for the Commission and the widest possible scope for its inquiries relating to industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Definitions also include ``subject of Commonwealth power'' which follows the provisions of the Constitution. This is relevant to the scope of matters on which the Commission can require evidence and information relevant to an inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal functions of the Commission are to hold inquiries and make reports on industry matters referred to it by the Minister. Bearing in mind that the Commission is to contribute to the process of structural change as described generally in policy guidelines for the Commission, the Commission's functions also allow it to do anything incidental to its functions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government intends that, as part of analysis and advice on microeconomic reform issues, the Commission will give advice on business regulation, and prepare occasional research and information papers that contribute to enhancing community understanding of issues relating to structural reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill sets out general policy guidelines to which the Commission must have regard in the performance of its functions. These are:</PARA>
<PARA> to encourage the development and growth of Australian industries that are efficient in their use of resources, self-reliant, enterprising, innovative and internationally competitive;</PARA>
<PARA> to facilitate adjustment to structural changes in the economy and to ease social and economic hardships arising from those changes;</PARA>
<PARA> to reduce regulation of industry (including regulation by the States and Territories) where this is consistent with the social and economic goals of the Commonwealth Government; and</PARA>
<PARA> to recognise the interests of industries, consumers, and of the community likely to be affected by measures proposed by the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission must also have regard to any other matters notified by the Minister. For example, as in recent inquiries sent to the IAC, the Commission may be asked to have regard to the Government's environmental objectives in relevant inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA> Reports resulting from an inquiry process will be required to be tabled by the Minister within 25 sitting days after receipt. There is a provision for delay recommended by the Commission; for example, where the Commission is made aware of Governmental trade negotiations that might be disturbed by the timing of publication of a report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains provisions similar to those in the current IAC Act which constrain a Commonwealth Minister from taking certain prescribed actions unless a report by the Commission has been received within the previous 12 months. Allowance is made for a delay in the receipt of a Commission report. </PARA>
<PARA> Prescribed matters follow those in the IAC Act 1973 and concern changes in import duties and restrictions, and changes in financial assistance to an industry for more than two years. Financial assistance and an industry are defined. </PARA>
<PARA> Exemptions to prescribed matters are also set out. </PARA>
<PARA> Principally these include:</PARA>
<PARA> payments to Commonwealth corporations;</PARA>
<PARA> the imposition, increase or reduction of a tax (other than customs duty);</PARA>
<PARA> changes in customs duties that are only made to match corresponding changes in excise duties;</PARA>
<PARA> maintaining the level of customs duty previously applying where a decision by a Tribunal or Court on a tariff classification has had the effect of altering the duty;</PARA>
<PARA> the making of a commercial tariff concessional order or a by-law under the Customs Act 1901; and</PARA>
<PARA> action concerning international trade agreements and developing country tariff preferences. </PARA>
<PARA> The conduct of inquiries into matters referred to the Commission by the Government is intended to provide, as in the Industries Assistance Commission Act, for the fullest possible participation by all interested parties. The Commission is given wide discretion into how inquiries are to be conducted, and will not be overly bound by formal legal procedure, although there are appropriately strong protections and penalties for breaches with respect to a range of inquiry procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission will widely publicise the existence and the nature of inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not consider it necessary to restrict the flexibility of the Commission by overly prescribing the Commission's procedures. There are therefore no standing provisions requiring draft reports to be prepared pursuant to inquiries, or for the Commission to present a range of options in making recommendations to Government. These procedures may be left to the discretion of the Commission, it being understood that, as is the case with the IAC, the Commission will usually produce a draft report pursuant to an inquiry, thereby facilitating community debate, and will usually present a range of options in its recommendations to the Government. The Minister, in referring a matter to the Commission, will be able to require the publication of a draft report or the development of options in any particular case. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to make clear the Government's intention in respect of these matters, the Government has decided it is worthwhile to bring forward an amendment to the Bill during the course of its consideration to provide explicitly for possible requirement of a draft report and options in recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission will have powers to obtain relevant information and documents for the purposes of an inquiry and the power to hold hearings, which will be held in public unless confidential material is involved. The Commission will also have power to summon persons to attend hearings and to answer questions or produce documents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that the Commission is not to be given false or misleading evidence or information, and is not to be taken in contempt. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to contribute to widest possible community debate and understanding of the issues of an inquiry, the Bill provides for documents, statements and submissions received in the course of an inquiry to be made public. Nonetheless, there are provisions for information to be held as confidential where a person objects and the Commission considers the evidence should be protected. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill maintains the protection of witnesses to an inquiry, and people making submissions to an inquiry, that are in the IAC Act. In particular, the Bill provides for penalties on persons who prejudice another person's employment because of their participation in an inquiry process. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill specifies that the exercise of the Commission's powers for the purposes of an inquiry, for example to obtain information and documents from any person, including a State, is limited to the extent that the subject matter relates to a subject of Commonwealth power. The definition of subject of Commonwealth power is given in terms of constitutional provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the IAC, the Commission will have a Chairperson and from four to eight full-time Commissioners, these being statutory appointments by the Governor-General for up to five years. </PARA>
<PARA> To supplement the Commission's resources and expertise from time to time, there is provision for the appointment of Associate Commissioners by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a range of procedural provisions concerning Commissioners, which follow those of the IAC Act and other Acts providing for statutory appointments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains a separate part dealing with repeals and transitional arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the IAC Act 1973 to be repealed. It also provides for the repeal at the same time of all but specified sections of the ISC Act, which remain as long as there is a holder of the office of Commissioner of the ISC. The Bill makes separate provision for the repeal by separate proclamation of those remaining parts of the ISC Act relating to Commissioners should there no longer be a holder of that office. </PARA>
<PARA> These repeal provisions are based on advice of the Solicitor-General in order to be consistent with provisions in the Constitution relating to the ISC. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for moneys and staff of the IAC and ISC to be transferred to the Commission. Similarly, current inquiries by the IAC are to be transferred and completed by the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> There are provisions protecting the terms and conditions of appointment of ISC and IAC Commissioners who become Commissioners of the new body. </PARA>
<PARA> Transitional provisions protecting prior records and witnesses are also included. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally miscellaneous provisions of the Bill include a requirement that the Commission prepares an annual report which is to be tabled within fifteen sitting days of its receipt. The annual report is to address the economic performance of industry and the effects of assistance and regulation on industry and on the economy generally. The Government sees this report as an important component of the Commission's role in increasing community understanding of issues concerning structural change. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, a key contribution to the transparency of industry policy is to be made by the publication and tabling in Parliament of annual reports of the Commission. With a broader charter, the Commission's annual report will continue and expand the benefits that have flowed from the IAC's annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier today, the IAC's annual report was tabled. That report ranges widely in its discussion of the benefits of micro-economic reform. It puts forward robust views and analysis of current industry policy issues, including a critique of strategic trade theories. It provides a stock-take of sectoral assistance measures. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been times when sectional interests, and even governments, have been uncomfortable with the perspective the IAC has brought to structural reform. No doubt this will also be the case with the most recent annual report. It will no doubt continue to be the case with the Industry Commission's annual reports-and it will continue to be an inescapable part of promoting transparency, vigorous community debate and broader understanding of industry issues. </PARA>
<PARA> To conclude, the establishment of the Industry Commission represents the Government's continued commitment to that transparency and full community debate in the development of policies relating to industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission is intended to make a major contribution to further structural reform in Australia. It will be a catalyst for productivity and efficiency gains, and thereby lay the groundwork for income and employment growth and security. It will build on, and broaden, the strengths of the IAC and the ISC which it succeeds. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's economy-wide perspective, its broad charter and public inquiry process will play a key role in promoting policies at both government and business levels to improve the competitive and dynamism of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides for an effective and broad ranging institution to serve the needs of Parliament, the people and government. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill, and I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>HOUSING ASSISTANCE BILL 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The Housing Assistance Bill 1989 authorises the Commonwealth to enter into a new 10 year housing agreement with the states, the Northern Territory and, for the first time, the Australian Capital Territory, and appropriates moneys for financial assistance to the states and these territories for housing purposes in 1989-90 and for the years 1990-91 to 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Labor Government was elected in March 1983 with a firm commitment to renegotiate Federal Housing Arrangements with the states. The key objective of this Government's housing policy platform was to ensure that all Australians had access to adequate and appropriate accommodation at a price they could afford. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth-State Housing agreement is the Commonwealth Government's major housing program. It aims to relieve housing related poverty and to deliver housing assistance equitably to people in different housing tenures. Financial assistance has been provided to the states under a series of such agreements since 1945. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1984 we introduced legislation for the Housing Assistance Act 1984 and a new Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement to take effect from 1 July 1984. That agreement reflected the consensus view of Commonwealth and State Housing Ministers of how best to deliver an effective and equitable program of public housing assistance and demonstrated our commitment to a long term public housing strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> We backed up these changes with massive funding levels. In the five years ended 1988-89 we provided almost $3.4 billion under the CSHA, more than double the $1.6 billion provided in the last five years of the previous government. </PARA>
<PARA> Our initiatives have allowed us to boost the stock of public housing dwellings considerably, from 245,000 at 30 June 1983 to 316,000 at 30 June 1988, an increase of almost 30 per cent. While public housing accommodates about 5 per cent of all Australian households, it is targeted on those most in need in our society. At 30 June 1987 almost 70 per cent of public housing tenants were on pensions or benefits representing 26 per cent of the total number of pensioners and beneficiaries who rent. Almost 1 in 4 families with children who rent live in public rental dwellings. </PARA>
<PARA> These figures show that our targeting of public housing assistance and the level of funding provided have made a major impact on housing related poverty in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> But pressure on public housing has continued to grow and there is an ongoing need to ensure that our programs remain well targeted and effective. Against this background, we undertook a major review of the existing policies and practices under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement with the aim of identifying improved strategies for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> This review found that the viability of the CSHA was under threat and that unless action were taken by the Commonwealth, there would be a significant diminution of states' public housing effort in future years. </PARA>
<PARA> This was because states had been using commercial borrowings to meet their matching requirement and the resulting debt servicing obligation, combined with a growing rent rebate Bill, had been eroding their capacity to fund new public housing. The review concluded that significant changes should be made to the current arrangements for financing, targeting and administering public housing. </PARA>
<PARA> The review recommended a number of specific changes to CSHA provisions for funding, including changes to matching and the use of funds. These recommendations were designed to put the provision of public housing on a more secure long term financial basis, and to ensure states make a greater financial contribution to the provision of public housing. </PARA>
<PARA> Following consideration of these recommendations, we put forward a proposal to the States for a new CSHA at the May 1989 premiers' conference. After detailed negotiations with states a new agreement was developed which forms part of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The new agreement will represent the most significant reform of public housing since the CSHA was first introduced by the Chifley Government in 1945. At the same time, the principles introduced by this Government in the 1984 agreement remain valid. These are to alleviate housing related poverty and to ensure that housing assistance is, as far as possible, delivered equitably to persons resident in different forms of housing. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the new agreement it is proposed that in each of the 10-years from 1 July 1989, Commonwealth financial assistance to the States under the CSHA will be provided entirely in the form of grants, rather than as a mix of grants and concessional loan council moneys. Half of States' matching effort will also be required to be met with grants. This will result in a major increase in real State effort and will ensure that States' ability to finance public rental housing will no longer be constrained by a burgeoning debt servicing obligation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the five years ended 1988-89, state contributions made in the form of grants were only about one-tenth of the value of Commonwealth grant contributions. </PARA>
<PARA> States have also agreed to absorb any future losses on their rental operations. </PARA>
<PARA> From now on the great bulk of Commonwealth and State matching funds will be used for the direct provision of public rental dwellings. Based on 1989-90 funding levels we expect that the impact of these new arrangements will allow around 52,000 net additions to the public dwelling stock over the next five years. At the same time around 650,000 people will be able to be offered public rental housing, an increase of around 20 per cent on the past five years. </PARA>
<PARA> This public housing effort will allow a greater focus on those in greatest housing need-very low income earners and social security recipients for whom home ownership is not an option. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to this agreement, a large proportion of Commonwealth funds were being provided through loan council borrowing arrangements. While adding to overall funds, loan council arrangements distorted the allocation of funds among states, so that the funds were not sufficiently targeted to areas of highest need. For example, the Northern Territory received about half the level of funds received by New South Wales, in spite of the vast difference in population. </PARA>
<PARA> This anomaly will be rectified under the new agreement. All funds will now be provided as grants and their distribution among states will move to a per capita basis. This will be a major step in directing assistance to where that assistance is needed. The phasing in of the per capita distribution over three years will allow states time to adjust their operations. </PARA>
<PARA> The new agreement demonstrates our commitment to improving access to home ownership for low income earners. States will continue to be able to draw on funds retained from past allocations to finance their general home purchase assistance programs. The net level of these funds is currently of the order of $360 million. States are encouraged under the agreement to gear up these funds with private sector funds, to boost the assistance available. States' capacity to draw in private sector funds will also be expanded considerably as a result of our decision to clearly exempt such raisings from loan council borrowing limits. This removes any uncertainty which existed in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> A proportion of new CSHA funds also will be directed to home purchase programs from 1989-90 onwards and these will be targeted to existing public tenants and applicants on the waiting list. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition states are able to meet the other half of their matching obligation with home purchase assistance loans and this will add a further incentive for them to expand their programs. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes will encourage a far more efficient use of funds than in the past and will allow states to considerably expand their home ownership lending programs by implementing innovative schemes to closely meet the needs of low income home buyers. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the next five years we expect that around 200,000 low and middle income home buyers will receive home purchase loans under CSHA programs. This is a substantial increase on the 68,000 home loans provided in the five years ended June 1988. Because repayments on CSHA home loans are linked to income, this initiative will significantly boost access to affordable home ownership for lower income earners. </PARA>
<PARA> Assistance under the agreement is well targeted, and priority in granting assistance is determined by need. However, a key change will be made to existing administrative arrangements to ensure that we continue to meet these objectives, and improve our linking of public housing with other assistance programs. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past States have been able to use general agreement funds without any reference to specific Commonwealth priorities or objectives. A new system of priority setting will be implemented under the agreement through the establishment of a joint Commonwealth-State planning process. Through this process we are aiming to ensure, without inefficient duplication of administration, that the provision of public housing assistance remains in accord with the principles of the CSHA and responsive to the needs of clients. It will focus on improving equality of access to appropriate accommodation and will ensure better co-ordination of public housing provision with other programs. </PARA>
<PARA> It is envisaged that the development of Commonwealth-state plans will ensure that the priorities of all groups, including youth, people with disabilities, Aboriginals and the aged are met under public housing arrangements. There is a range of Commonwealth programs which need to be linked to public housing provision (for example, programs covering accommodation for the aged and people with disabilities), and the joint planning process will ensure this occurs. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of the joint planning process we will be consulting with community groups, to ensure a full range of views on public housing is taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an increasing awareness in the community of consumer protection issues to uphold the dignity, independence and freedom of the individual, to preserve people's rights and to provide protection of those rights. </PARA>
<PARA> The new agreement provides that information will be made available to clients about housing assistance and policies. In addition independent appeal mechanisms are to be established in each state by September 1990. These initiatives link with our user rights strategies for service provision in the areas of aged care, supported accommodation and home care. </PARA>
<PARA> The position of clients is to be further enhanced under the new agreement. The Commonwealth and states are to examine the issues of increasing choice of housing between public rental and home purchase assistance, portability of eligibility for assistance between states and improved maintenance arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this government has backed up the new arrangements with funds. In 1989-90, for the first time, over $1 billion will be made available in grants under the agreement. Furthermore, the Commonwealth government will guarantee at least this level ($1.028 billion) for each of the three years 1990-91 to 1992-93. Total funding for those years will be determined annually in the Budget context. This $4 billion guarantee is unprecedented and shows this government's determination to deliver on its social justice commitments in housing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for two further appropriations in 1989-90. $9.8 million will be appropriated for specific grants to the states and the Northern Territory for housing assistance for young people. </PARA>
<PARA> These funds form part of our social justice package for young Australians which is part of the response to the problems highlighted in the Burdekin report on youth homelessness. </PARA>
<PARA> The funds will be used to provide accommodation linked to support services for homeless young people. This will help them become more independent and guide them to longer term stable accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> $14.7 million will also be appropriated to provide additional mortgage relief funds. These funds will be provided to the states and the Northern Territory to assist low and moderate income earners who are experiencing difficulty in meeting their mortgage commitments. These funds were earmarked in the Budget and are additional to those already provided through the mortgage and rent relief scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Commonwealth government is committed to housing access, and to the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. The structural reforms embodied in the new agreement together with the substantial increase in funding and forward commitment for future years will significantly enhance our public housing effort. Based on current funding, over the next five years we expect to see around 650,000 people offered public rental dwellings, 52,000 additions to the public rental stock and around 200,000 home loans provided to low and moderate income families. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we will be able to make significant inroads in alleviating housing related poverty in 1989-90 and over the 10-years of the agreement. We will also see improved public housing effort by all parties to the agreement, better targeting of assistance to high need areas, improved choice of assistance and more open, accessible and responsive administration. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Department of Administrative Services covers an inordinately wide range of activities and there was very considerable debate during the Estimates Committee hearings on many of those aspects. I do not propose to go over again too much of what was covered in the Estimates Committee hearings. The Department of Administrative Services is obviously undergoing some major changes. There is a process of commercialisation in much of its activities, a principle that we on this side of the chamber support. I have the impression that, in that process of moving towards a more commercialised basis of operations, there have been a few hiccups along the way, and I guess that is understandable. I do not know whether, in responding to my remarks, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) might wish to comment on that general impression that I certainly gained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to pursue a couple of matters a little further. After the Estimates Committee hearings, I received answers to some of the questions I had put on notice. They were not available at the time of the hearings. The first to which I refer particularly is an answer that I received to my question about how much, if any, office space leased by the Commonwealth, both domestic and international, was unoccupied in 1988-89 and, in each case, what was the approximate cost of this unoccupied space and its allocation. </PARA>
<PARA> The answer that I received was very detailed. It listed all of the properties involved. What amazed me was that the cost of office space leased by the Commonwealth and unoccupied during 1988-89 totalled a staggering $9.95m, nearly $10m, which was expended on, to quote the Department's words, `unoccupied leased office space in Australia'. In the answer it was also stated that, of this amount, $5.93m was attributable to rent paid for unoccupied office space during planned fitout but, nevertheless, I find that figure extraordinarily high. On my calculations it represents 2.51 per cent of total rent outlays, so $1 in every $40 that the Commonwealth spent in 1988-89 on rent has gone for dead rent. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some notable examples in the list of properties given. In my own State of Victoria the amounts range from $22,559 for a property at 33 Railway Parade, Camberwell-I do not know what that is-to $920,907, or almost $1m, in 1988-89 in dead rent for one property alone at 538 Collins Street, Melbourne. Another $682,366 was spent on dead rent for a property at 340 Albert Street, East Melbourne and $208,313 was spent on a property at 58 Queensbridge Street, South Melbourne. They are the biggest ones. The list goes on. The total for Victoria, in round figures, was $2.46m which was close to the New South Wales total of $2.6m. It seems to me that the total figure for dead rent is extraordinarily high. I should like the Minister's comments on what I have raised and, in particular, what steps are being taken or will be taken to prevent similar waste in future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Short's calculations are right but the conclusions he draws are somewhat unfair. The question of dead rent is trending down. Anybody who goes back through the transcripts of a series of Estimates Committee hearings will see that that is right. I think it is ironic that the Government is being criticised for a 2 1/2 per cent average dead rent when, time and time again, I hear in this chamber that the commercial sector is more efficient, lean and so on, and its average dead rent is 4 to 6 per cent. I am not saying that 2 1/2 per cent is a satisfactory figure, but it is trending down and a lot of that results from questions asked at Estimates Committee hearings and pressure coming from the Minister to reduce the figure. As I say, compared with the commercial sector, it is quite an achievement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that Senator Short's major concern was rent paid for a property at 538 Collins Street. That was intended for the National Crime Authority. At first it said it was satisfactory but it came back later and said that the security aspects were not satisfactory. I do not think that the Department of Administrative Services can be held to account for that particular site. It is now being occupied by the Australian Taxation Office. I would have thought that higher security would have been needed for Tax on some occasions than for the National Crime Authority, but nevertheless, Tax has gone there. In conclusion, no-one likes dead rent. No government, either Labor or Liberal, has liked dead rent. But at least the trend is down and well below the commercial sector. We must be vigilant to make sure that that trend continues down. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister in anticipation of his checking that. My understanding is that the Menzies Foundation had never received Commonwealth funds. Indeed, that was one of the reasons why, in 1979, the Fraser Government refused to provide the Evatt Foundation with a grant of funds from the taxpayer. One of the other reasons was that the whole basis of the Menzies Foundation was very different from that of the Evatt Foundation as it was then proposed, because the guidelines or rules and regulations relating to the Evatt Foundation at that time-and I think I am correct-was that a person had to be a member of the Labor Party to be involved with the foundation at all. As Malcolm Fraser said back in 1979 in the debate in the House of Representatives, the then Government refused to provide the foundation with a grant because:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . some of the purposes of the Foundation, as revealed by one of the documents-</PARA>
<PARA>that were presented to the Government in relation to the application-</PARA>
<PARA>indicate a very close relationship to the Australian Labor Party rather than to broader national perspectives. </PARA>
<PARA>I would be interested to hear the contrary view expressed by the Minister, but I do not think that there is any doubt that the H. V. Evatt Foundation is an ALP front organisation. It was established by the ALP and its original constitution provided-and this is what I was referring to before-that only current members of the ALP National Executive are eligible to become members of the foundation. I think in later years that has changed, but that was certainly the case when the foundation was established and in its first couple of years. In 1987 the foundation established a research centre which, according to an ACTU circular, consists of a:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . network designed to give Trade Unions and community groups access to researchers. </PARA>
<PARA>The Evatt Research Centre, under that guise, jointly with the Australian Public Service Federation, recently undertook a project and produced a document entitled State of Seige designed to promote the public sector. The following opening sentence of that document sets its tone and the whole flavour:</PARA>
<PARA> This book extends the union movement's analysis of public sector funding and reform to the State tier of government. </PARA>
<PARA>What the Government has done with its funding of the H. V. Evatt Foundation is to give a commitment on the basis of a letter written in 1984 from the then President of the Foundation, who I think at that time was the then Australian Council of Trade Unions President, Cliff Dolan, although I am not 100 per cent certain of that. According to the answers I have received from the Department in response to my questions on this, in April 1984 the President of the H. V. Evatt Foundation wrote a letter to the Government seeking a commitment of funds. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) replied in July 1984 saying that the Government had agreed to commit $2.5m of taxpayers' funds to this Foundation over a period of 10 years. That is an awful lot of money. Without any doubt, it is reasonable to say that that is money for purely party political purposes and I think that the taxpayers have every right indeed to be very cranky at parties that shell out their moneys for organisations whose whole purpose is party political. I would welcome the Minister's comment on this because it is, in my view, a very important issue. Some might say that $2.5m is not very much over the spread of government expenditure, but it is a lot of money and there is a very important principle involved as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A bit of dexterity has been used by Senator Short when he goes back to the 1979 constitution and later admits that it has been changed, but does not spell out how it has been changed. I certainly refute the suggestion that Senator Short has made that the H. V. Evatt Foundation is very close to the Labor Party, et cetera. I have been on the National Executive of the Labor Party for seven years and I have had hardly any contact at all with that organisation. Maybe the odd letter has come in saying that it is providing this scholarship or this research fund. Even in the internal wings of the Labor Party, I cannot ever recall a discussion in which the H. V. Evatt Foundation has particularly come up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am still trying to get the honourable senator an answer to the early part of the question: did any money directly-and, I should add, indirectly-go to the Sir Robert Menzies Memorial Trust from the Government. I do not know whether the money went there by way of tax deduction or as a direct grant, but my recollection is that the stimulus for the H. V. Evatt Foundation to apply for money came from what it saw as money going to the Sir Robert Menzies Memorial Trust. However, I do say that it is only my judgment, but it is not fair to say that the H. V. Evatt Foundation is a Labor Party front. I really do not think it is. I do not think that the Labor Party has much influence in the way it operates-certainly not in an organisational sense. I have no doubt that some members of the Labor Party are involved in the H. V. Evatt Foundation. As to the second question of whether that organisation is entitled to that amount of money, that is a government decision; it is a decision that the Government has to justify and the Government has to live with. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wanted to raise a couple of points. I am sorry that they are a bit all over the place. I understand that the retiring Electoral Commissioner, Dr Hughes, in a recent interview said that, for practical, administrative reasons, it would be impossible to hold an election later than, I think 5 May. I wondered what are the constraints. Are they constraints of staff or something else that bring forward that date, which I thought otherwise, constitutionally, would have been much further progressed into May?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Without agreeing with Dr Hughes on that subject-I read the article and heard him interviewed-I wish to say that the constraints on getting a Senate vote counted are not staff restraints, per se. It is one of those things: the number of staff can be trebled but there might be no more productivity because it is the competency of the staff which is involved which is important. The reality is that, if there were to be a half Senate and House of Representatives election, it would be something like two weeks after the date of that election before the Commissioner can strike a quota for the Senate. He has to wait for all postal votes and all absentee votes to come in. Technically it could be done earlier, but then one in 1,000 counts would go astray-something of that magnitude. Having done that, given the counting methods now involved, following that there could be up to a six-week count in New South Wales, in particular, because of the number of ballot papers cast and because of the large number of candidates running. That is the factor that is involved. The more candidates who run, the more likely a long delay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1987 this Parliament put two other provisions into the Act. One was bulk exclusion by which, at the very last quota, all the rubbish, if I can call it that, can be thrown out in the knowledge that they can never get up to the two or three main candidates. The second is the provision for delayed transfer of preferences. Again, that speeds up the process. I think Dr Hughes was probably lodging a bit of an ambit claim for the fifth, but certainly it would bring enormous pressure and difficulty if the election were to be held in late May. Let us not specify in between times. If it were late May, that would bring an enormous pressure to get the count done. It is not a question of just saying, `We will throw in an extra million bucks', because competent people are needed to track those preferences through. Remember that 80 to 85 per cent of voters in the election for the Senate provide no difficulty in the count because they put the number 1 in the box and, therefore, it is all automatic, because it is from a registered how-to-vote card. It is for those 20 per cent who vote below the line that the mechanical transaction is needed. If the number of staff is doubled but the competence is reduced by half, it is back to square one. </PARA>
<PARA> So essentially he is right in saying that there is that sort of constraint. It has always existed. The more complex the counting system, the more it pushes the barrier back into May. I would say that, certainly by late May, the options run out. I do not know what the constitutional situation is if the election is not declared by 1 July when senators are due to take their place here. I do not want to know; I do not want to see that happening. </PARA>

<PARA> I am concerned that the answer given does not properly address the policy issues that have been canvassed. My specific question was the extent to which the resources are being applied by the Department where various State divisions were, in effect, involved in competing for the same projects in conjunction with other private tenderers or contractors seeking to get work from the Government. The reply I received from Mr Ian Woonton, the Acting General Manager, was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> I have canvassed our State offices and there were two projects in which different State divisions of Australian Construction Services were involved. These were the Alice Springs Airport development and the Darwin International Terminal building. </PARA>
<PARA> On the Alice Springs project, three State offices, Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia/Northern Territory submitted expressions of interest, all with different joint venture partners. </PARA>
<PARA> On the Darwin project, the Queensland State Office undertook some design work and the South Australia/Northern Territory Office submitted a proposal to a tenderer. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not provided specific details of the resources applied and the costs involved. At the hearing, Mr Jacka indicated that this information would not be regarded as ``Commercial-in-Confidence''. I have since discussed this matter with Mr Jacka and we agree, on reflection, that it is. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect, I do not believe that I am seeking the individual arrangements that are made with particular tenderers or contractors; rather, I believe that the departmental resources involved in cross-subsidisation on a particular project where different divisions are participating is a quite serious misuse of Commonwealth expenditure. I would like to know the extent of funds that have been applied and the resources involved, given the extensive nature of the two projects named-the Alice Springs Airport development and the Darwin international terminal building. </PARA>
<PARA> I fail to see how the departmental resources applied to professional architectural and engineering services of this nature would be less than some considerable thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars.

<PARA> Generally, the resources applied by ACS were insignificant, due to our subsidiary role to the major proponent. </PARA>
<PARA>Even if that were not the case, there is a dilemma. These people are asked to behave in a commercial way and, if they act in a commercial way and become profitable or break even, I cannot see any basis for a complaint. One cannot retain all the old restrictions on these sorts of bodies and expect them to operate in a commercial way. I think Senator Short mentioned that there were some hiccups in relation to the commercialisation aspect, and that is so. Having freed them up, governments would find it difficult to resist interfering and to say, `Yes, we have freed you up, but we still want you to abide by this or that', which constraints do not apply to the private sector. If the stage were reached where the sort of competition about which the honourable senator speaks was running these bodies into a loss situation, I believe he would have a much stronger point, but surely one must spend a dollar to make a dollar. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The dollars the Minister wants to spend are obviously quite significant, and I dispute the point that is made in the last paragraph of Mr Woonton's letter. Let me reinforce the point by again quoting a portion of his letter. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the Alice Springs project, three State Offices, Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia/Northern Territory submitted expressions of interest, all with different joint venture partners. </PARA>
<PARA> On the Darwin project, the Queensland State Office undertook some design work and the South Australia/Northern Territory office submitted a proposal to a tenderer. </PARA>
<PARA>Three different divisions of the Department were involved on one project and two were involved on the other. In relation to funds, what is the Minister's definition of `insignificant'? There can be only one successful tenderer at the end of the day and, whilst I would draw the comparison with the commercial sector, I am sure that, if we had a professional architectural or engineering office of national significance which sought to look at a particular project, it would coordinate the resources of its various State divisions and it would ensure that three State divisions did not waste significant resources. Will the Minister quantify the extent of resources that have been applied on these projects and, as part of the commercialisation project, does the Government intend to allow State divisions to run around willy-nilly, without coordination, on other government projects which are all off the taxpayers' nipple and which involve a considerable wastage of taxpayers' funds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is an interesting economic theory. The honourable senator is effectively saying that competition does not lead to lower price tendering. On the major point as to whether there should be a national overseeing of tendering processes, I will refer that to the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) for his consideration, because I never dismiss those sorts of suggestions out of hand. The trouble with that sort of centralised approach is that managers are not really allowed to manage. They have to be overseen from Canberra and then the whole freeing up process begins to be pulled back: if they are overseen in this regard, why not oversee them in regard to industrial relations or a dozen other practices? Why not reimpose a whole variety of controls? If that occurs, we are back to square one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I will refer to the Minister for Administrative Services the suggestion that it would be a better practice to have some national overseeing body of competitive tendering. I repeat that I do not believe that the taxpayer will necessarily be worse off in the end. One would hope that much of the creative competition would lead to a lowering of prices, if there was no collusion, and then those other government departments could effect considerable savings. Hopefully, if they tender for other Government jobs and compete in the marketplace, it will lead to a lower price. If it does not lead to a lower price, perhaps we will have to revise the philosophy of market capitalism. </PARA>

In answer to my question on notice about this matter I received the advice that in 1988-89 Department of Administrative Services expenditure on ministerial consultants was $1,996,670, or nearly $2m. That information is published each year in the annual report, as required under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984, but that report has not yet been tabled. The advice I have had from the Department is that the annual report will be tabled before the end of this calendar year, but that will relate, as I understand it, to the cost of consultants in 1988-89 presumably. It is not possible to ascertain from the Budget Papers the cost of consultants in the current financial year 1989-90. Apparently, these costs- and I quote from the answer I received from the Department-are met from within the appropriation for running costs, namely, division 120.1. The item could be as long as a piece of string and, in my view, there should be a requirement on the Government to reveal at the time of the Budget how much it is proposing to spend on ministerial consultants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Apart from that, I again raise the question about the propriety of the use of ministerial consultants on Ministers' staffs and the way the Government has been doing it. Ceilings are supposed to apply to ministerial staff, just as there are ceilings on the staffs of shadow Ministers. Ministers are already supplied-I know it varies from one Minister to another-with something like 10 staff on average, at public expense, and that is probably an underestimate. These people are employed as professionals to meet the Ministers' political and ministerial requirements. Over and above that, we have had this device, which has been increasingly used since 1984, of putting consultants on the payroll as well. Indeed, there has been a 500 per cent increase since 1984 in the annual cost of consultants on Ministers' staff. In 1984 the figure was $364,092; last year the figure was almost $2m. It has gone up sixfold, a 500 per cent increase. All up, the cost since 1984 is now about $7.5m. Those figures exclude completely the cost of the thousands of consultants, I would think, nowadays employed by government departments and agencies. I am not suggesting that government departments and agencies should not use consultants; I think in many cases it is a very sensible thing to do. But I make the point that the figures I am talking about now completely exclude those. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of the use of consultants on ministerial staffs that concerns me, and I note it with interest, is that if one looks through the list of consultants, whilst there are some exceptions, it almost looks like a who's who of former Labor parliamentarians, Party members and candidates. Having looked at the list of people that are employed as consultants and the purposes for which they are supposedly employed, there is no doubt that many people on those lists are not there because of any expertise they have in the particular areas for which they have been engaged; they are there simply because of their links with the Australian Labor Party. We have gone through this before. We have named on previous occasions certain consultants who stand out strikingly in that context, and I do not propose to do that again. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I raise in relation to this-and I think it was my friend and colleague Senator Boswell who asked the question that elicited this information-is that the total staff of Ministers, throwing in consultants, the ministerial media group and Ministers' staffs, has shown a staggering increase. Ministers' staffs have gone from 165 in 1983 to 228 in 1989. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I think so. I think this is information supplied by the Department in response to Senator Boswell's question. For example, the number of consultants has gone up from three in 1983-84 to 28 in 1989. Indeed, there was more than 28 used in the course of the year as a whole; but there has been an enormous increase in consultants. The ministerial media group has gone up by several. Anyway, the total increase in Ministers' staffs, on the figures that became available in response to Senator Boswell's question, over the period is 63, from 165 to 228. Over the same period, the Opposition's additional staff has gone up by 11, from 48 to 59. So the Opposition resources have gone up by 11 and the staff resources available to the Government have gone up by 63.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In every case under the Hawke Government there has been a mighty increase in the number of staff it has allocated to itself. A point that concerns me very much is that these increases are over and above the Remuneration Tribunal's determinations, as I understand it. The Government gets around the determinations of the Remuneration Tribunal by, in particular, the use of consultants. I think it is a practice which is open to very considerable abuse. I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments on this. It is not an issue that we are raising for the first time. It is an issue that has concerned us on this side of the chamber for some considerable time. That is the reason we have been raising it. There does not seem to be any response to those concerns. I think it is about time that there was a response, and I would be interested to know whether the Government, through the Minister, has changed its attitude towards this matter. </PARA>

Senator Boswell should not smile; I have never missed him. I think the first great act of the Fraser Government when it came in was to reduce the Opposition staff entitlement. So when the Opposition comes in here and bleats about how it is being treated, do not expect me to break down and sob. In fact, the Opposition has been given a 19 per cent increase in staff, whereas Mr Anthony and Mr Sinclair, as soon as we went out of government, made sure that we were fitted up nice and properly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, in a more serious vein, Senator Short makes a point about the use of consultants and the philosophy of consultants. It has been discussed many times before about whether it is better to increase average staff over time or bring in specialists to do a certain job. I have to declare a self-interest in this: I have never employed a consultant, so I do not have personal experience as to how they operate. I notice that one of the consultants, Mr Garnaut, was employed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans). I do not agree with everything that is in it, but it is a marvellous report. It was certainly value for money. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like Senator Short to add, for my education, whether the coalition, if it were returned to office at the next poll or the one after, would not employ ministerial consultants. If he would not say that, would he say so now? Would he tell me how many consultants it would employ so that we can measure its bona fides and see whether its criticisms are valid? Or is it just a case of an out-group whingeing about what an in-group has and doing exactly the same when it becomes an in-group? Would he let us know how many consultants the coalition thinks government should hire in any one year, so we can see whether we can hold it to its promises? I do not recall a coalition spokesman giving us a guarantee on that. Can Senator Short guarantee that the Opposition, if it ever wins office, would maintain the staffing level for the opposition, or would it slash it as it did in 1976? Can Senator Short say in advance what he thinks is the appropriate level of consultants for Ministers and would the Opposition abide by that in government?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, a rise of less than half the percentage increase that the Government donated to itself. That is a typical example, along with the stamp allowance, of the way the Government has set out to try to diminish and disadvantage the capacity of the Opposition to have the backup services that it is so happy to provide to itself. I would not mind if it were straightforward and honest and if it said, `Yes, we are kicking you to death', but to have that supported in this chamber by the sanctimonious stuff that the Minister has just given us is irritating. The Government has kicked us to death and yet the Minister claims some kind of virtue in the sense that the Government gave us a bit of an increase-an increase less than half the size of the increase it gave itself. If that is supposed to be fair and open-handed and the Minister is being virtuous for having been involved in it, heaven preserve us from the situation that may develop if it ever stops being `noble' in such a way. Diminishing the present Opposition's capacity to counter the enormous resources the Government has given itself has the same impact as a government reducing an opposition's actual staff numbers while keeping its resources stable. It seems to me that there is no difference in principle. Therefore, I cannot see what the Minister's self-righteous mode is aimed at, except to obfuscate the clear reality that the Government has handed itself massive resources, at enormous cost to the public, and has failed to allow the Opposition to have resources to match that kind of increase. The figures which Senator Ray has revealed demonstrate how ludicrous the self-righteous approach is that he has adopted in the chamber today.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not believe that I am being self-righteous. I just point out that when the Fraser Government came to government in 1976 it cut back Opposition staff. That was one of the first things it did. It was not aimed at saving money; it was just out of vengeance. Because it had such a majority it thought that it would be in office forever. The Opposition has had an increase in staff of 19 per cent. When have we ever established a correlation or ratio between government and opposition staff? If the Opposition had done that in government it would now have a strong point. From 1975 to 1983 the then Government said, `The Opposition will get 30 per cent of what ministerial staff have'. If we had put that in as a formula we could run with it. But the Opposition still has not answered the central question; it whinges about consultants. I ask it how many it would employ if it won government. What guarantees can the Opposition give the public? Would it employ six, 10, 12, 15 or what? There is no use criticising the Government unless the Opposition is willing to put its colours up on the flagpost and say what it would do. But it will not do that. It does not want to tie itself down because it does not want to be measured off in future when it ignores it.</PARA></TALK.START>

I asked for a break-up and it was established clearly that several amounts had been overdue for more than 60 days. For example, in 1987-88, $6,000 had been outstanding for more than 60 days; in 1988-89, it had increased to $179,000. The answer to the question taken on notice then gave some examples of the worst of the overdue payments. One was to Watson Ferguson Pty Ltd which was owed $5,113.14 for 156 days.

I may be wrong, but I am unaware of the fact that the Budget Statements this year to any significant degree were larger than or different from those last year, although they may have been. Could we have an explanation as to why there has been an 80 per cent increase in the retail price of the Budget Statements and whether the criteria for pricing have changed? I ask this question particularly in the context of the fact that it is vitally important to many people to have possession of the Budget documents. On the face of it, an 80 per cent price rise seems larger than even the rate of inflation which the Government has managed to push on the Australian economy this year. </PARA>

Another question in spite of all that is whether government has a responsibility to make sure that certain publications available to the public appear at a certain price. Certainly that should be done by a government directly allocating money rather than expecting some enterprise to carry the cost. There is no doubt that future governments may take up the suggestion in this area. I am sure the suggestion has already been taken up with respect to some publications, or so I would assume. I refer to certain vital publications that we would want to appear as cheaply as possible. It is the old tariff-bounty argument. We are almost arguing on the bounty side of this equation. I agree with Senator Baume that the cost of Budget Papers at that price is getting prohibitive. I am thinking of scalping my copy. But it is really then up to a government to determine whether it wants to subsidise it. That then becomes a government policy.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> ready access to supplies of new technology, equipment, consumables, goods and services via easy to use common use contracts with suppliers that have been negotiated using the public sectors collective buying to secure best prices and advantageous terms of commercial dealing; and</PARA>
<PARA> a professional, economical and convenient purchasing service which offers expertise in tendering and contracting. </PARA>
<PARA>Can the Minister please define for me the client agencies that are envisaged in this particular program and the extent to which it will have an impact in remote and regional communities around Australia? For example, by way of explanation, the Minister may be aware that considerable media coverage has been attracted to various activities of the Department in the Northern Territory in recent weeks. This largely arises from a letter from an officer of the Department, a Mr J. Harrison, the Area Manager, Northern Territory Operations, which has been distributed throughout the Northern Territory to various organisations and bodies that have obscure and indirect links to the Government, offering various facilities to them. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> This letter is to introduce you to a Commonwealth Service Organisation called the Purchasing and Sales Group of the Commonwealth Department of Administrative Services. </PARA>
<PARA>As our Group title suggests we are the centralised National Purchasing and Disposal Body, for the Commonwealth Government, with offices in all States and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA>Recent Government endorsed changes to our charter has meant that the way in which we have operated in the past and to whom we can offer our services has also changed. Please refer to the attached glossy flier for a broad overview of these changes. </PARA>
<PARA>What these changes mean to your organisation is that this now gives you the opportunity to access our Commonwealth Government period contracts to obtain better prices for your organisation's requirements because of the Commonwealth's bulk volume purchasing power. </PARA>
<PARA>Please note however, that in the future there will be a small surcharge on most contract items which will be incorporated in the price of the items on contract. The contractor will then remit this surcharge to our Group. Your organisation will not have to make any additional payments. This surcharge will in time be eroded through even cheaper contract prices for these quality items due to the additional buying power, which accrues from you using our National Contracts. </PARA>
<PARA>The range of items on the Commonwealth Contracts is vast. They range from vehicles of all types, office furniture and equipment, personal computers, domestic furniture, refrigerators, washing machines, room airconditioners, office requisites and foodstuffs (both fresh, frozen and tinned-available from Northern Territories Contractors). I have not by any means exhausted the list of contract items. It is to be noted however, that these items are in the main free of sales tax. If your organisation is not sales tax exempt then the appropriate sales tax surcharge will have to be added to the contract rate. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on in considerable detail and invites these various arm's length, obscure and indirect organisations dealing with government to now take advantage of this particular aspect. What concerns me in particular is the imposition that this has in remote and regional areas of Australia. I accept that competition is always a good thing, and, depending on the Minister's initial argument, I will be pleased to pursue that a little bit further because of other information. I would like to ascertain from the Government the extent to which this new centralised purchasing organisation will in effect impact on the economies of remote parts of the community. As I said, the Minister will probably be well aware that the Northern Territory media in the last week or so have reported considerable impacts right across the small business community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I could pursue the matter, I notice that, amongst the tabled papers today, the Minister has tabled a document from the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) which is entitled Commonwealth Procurement: Policy Framework. It is dated October 1989. The advertising gimmick on the top of it is `Better Buying', with a great tick mark underneath it. The Department obviously is now acknowledging that it has a purchasing reform group as part of this. The logo is `Service is Our Business'. The document is quite comprehensive and I will address it briefly this afternoon at the appropriate time in addressing papers. With regard to the various sections of this there is a chapter headed `Open and effective competition'. It states that the Department acknowledges that effective competition requires timely and adequate information, independent action, absence of bias or favouritism and ease of market entry for new and small sellers. It continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The degree of available appropriate competition will vary with each purchase. The Government accepts that negotiated offers may be required, for example, where market factors limit the value of competitive bidding. </PARA>
<PARA> Negotiations may also be desirable in some cases within the framework of the competitive process. </PARA>
<PARA> A balance also needs to be struck between costs which may reasonably be incurred in promoting competition and the benefits to be obtained. </PARA>
<PARA> Sound judgment is required to determine the purchasing strategy which best takes account of competition principle while safeguarding the value of money objective. </PARA>
<PARA>In addressing this issue, can the Minister account for the requirements of regional and remote areas of Australia and the impact that this will have in many areas of business if various Aboriginal communities and charitable and other government agencies can benefit from the proposal? Will any organisation which receives Commonwealth funding now be eligible to join onto the Purchasing Reform Group's new Commonwealth procurement policy?</PARA>

<PARA> I ask Senator Ray to take up this matter with the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, Mr Barry Jones. I am sure that the Government is playing with dynamite as far as the small business community is concerned. I do not say this with any sense of ungraciousness, but many people on the other side of the Parliament do not understand small business. This will have a devastating impact on communities in Queensland. A government instrumentality, funded by taxpayers' money, is being set up to compete with people who have to pay all types of taxes such as sales tax and pay as you earn tax and make superannuation payments. I ask the Government to review this policy before it causes immense problems in the small business community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My comments relate to the Trade Practices Commission and I understand that Senator Bolkus is responsible for it. As he is not in the chamber he may care to take up my comments at another time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since June 1988 the Trade Practices Commission has been studying the petroleum industry with a view to introducing a system of rack pricing. The Commission's brief was to formulate an industry code of conduct along with price discrimination guidelines. The statements were due for release in the middle of 1989. However, on 20 June this year, the Minister for Consumer Affairs issued a press release stating that he wished the Prices Surveillance Authority to investigate the pricing of petroleum products. That press release effectively prevented the Trade Practices Commission from releasing its report. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment, the petroleum retail industry has a form of rack pricing which was put down by the six major oil companies with no guidelines from the Trade Practices Commission. The result is that there is great concern in the market. Some people would even say there is chaos in the market. Some would say that the system is working slightly better than the retail pricing system that existed before the rack pricing system came into effect. Other people say that it is worse. There is great concern in the petrol retailing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> On 13 November, the industry put down a special code of conduct but the price discrimination guidelines cannot be released until the Prices Surveillance Authority has finished its inquiry into petroleum prices. It is crucial, particularly in my State of Queensland and I assume in every other State, that the guidelines be put down at the earliest opportunity. The guidelines were originally promised in July and it is now nearly 18 months since this urgent matter was referred to the Trade Practices Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The distributors, the lessees of service stations, are trading now in a marketplace that is disorganised and confused. A system of rack pricing has been introduced to create stability and that has not been the effect. On 14 November, the Motor Traders Association of Queensland passed a resolution to allocate $13,000 to commission an inquiry into the retail pricing structure. For the last three or four weeks, rack pricing has been stuck on the maximum price allowed by the Prices Surveillance Authority. I think it is 52.8c. A number of people are buying below that price. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the price at which a lessee dealer would buy. A small discount of 1c to 1 1/2c per litre is allowed to distributors who own their own service stations and distribute to farm outlets or industrial outlets. Many people claim that the 1 1/2c is not a sufficient discount for those people to survive and run a distributing business. Ironically, Postal Institute employees, because of strong market forces pulling together, can go into a service station and, by using a credit card, pay a retail price of 51.2c a litre for their petrol. The petrol companies pay the service station lessees 2 1/2c a litre for pumping the petrol into the tanks. If the 2.5c is deducted from the 51.2c a litre paid by the Postal Institute employees the result is 48.7c, which is less than the amount paid by a distributor who has to take the fuel out of tankers and supply it to trawlers, farms or industrial buildings. The distributors handle large volumes of petrol, even up to 15 million litres a year, yet the driver of a motor bike can purchase four to five litres of petrol for less per litre than a distributor who handles 15 million litres a year receives per litre. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that the Minister for Consumer Affairs has entered the chamber. I welcome his presence because I have discussed this matter privately with him and I know that he is concerned about it. I realise that he must have entered the chamber during my speech. I do not know how much of my speech he has heard. For his benefit I say again that, as the Minister for Consumer Affairs, it is imperative for him to use his influence to get the guidelines of the Trade Practices Commission out in the marketplace now so that the people in the petroleum industry will know what they are doing. The press release that he issued on 20 March has hindered that. I do not know that he did it intentionally; I assume that he did it with the best intentions in the world, but the effect of it is that he has confused the marketplace by not allowing those guidelines to be presented to the petroleum industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Boswell mentioned that the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) inquiry was approved on 20 June this year. That inquiry was initiated for a number of reasons. There had not been an inquiry into petrol pricing for about five years and there had been some quite significant changes in the market since 1984, both internationally and domestically, including changes by oil companies in the pricing policies for both dealers and distributors. The inquiry was sought by a number of organisations for a number of reasons, in view of that background. For instance, the major oil companies proposed a more open and predictable method of setting maximum wholesale prices for fuel by the PSA and the inquiry will be looking at the way that the Prices Surveillance Authority approaches its task and role in setting maximum wholesale prices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the other aspects of this inquiry is to ensure that the public also has a wider understanding, by the implementation of a more transparent price-setting mechanism, of how prices are set. It was generally recognised that there was a need for the Prices Surveillance Authority to have an inquiry into the industry and also to review the way in which the Authority approaches pricing policy in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Having tackled that part of Senator Boswell's question, the other part of his question related to the Trade Practices Commission and its guidelines. Senator Boswell is right in saying that that inquiry has been going on for some time. In respect of the Trade Practices Commission, it is fair to say that it is within the responsibility of the Attorney-General, and the concern that Senator Boswell has raised in respect of the Trade Practices Commission coming forward with its recommendations will be put to the Attorney-General in the context that, on the one hand, there is concern for this to happen quickly, as expressed by Senator Boswell, and, on the other hand, it is recognised that the Trade Practices Commission is very much an independent authority which is subject to very strict legal prerequisites and cannot be directed in any way as to how it should run or complete its inquiries. I will make sure that the relevant Minister is made aware of the point raised by Senator Boswell and that his views are passed on to the Trade Practices Commission to see whether it can expedite its processes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the sake of completeness, I indicate to Senator Boswell and the Committee that the point he makes about the concern and agitation in the community has been brought to my attention, particularly in Townsville by the local Federal member, Mr Ted Lindsay, through his representations to me. In fact, when I was in Townsville three months ago Mr Lindsay organised a meeting with local traders and small business people who were quite forceful in putting forward the views of the Queensland petrol industry and trading industry. They made sure that the Government understood that the industry there is probably composed of more independent traders than in the industry in other parts of Australia. Mr Lindsay has followed that up with me on a number of occasions. I say that in order to make the honourable senator aware that this point has been brought to our attention. Given the constraints of being unable to force an independent authority to complete an inquiry, and recognising that the Trade Practices Commission would be approaching this in a most comprehensive manner, as it always does, I will ensure that Senator Boswell's comments are also put to the Trade Practices Commission through the relevant Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), who is at the table, will probably be aware of why I am rising to speak on these estimates. I want to refer to a subject that was given a good deal of consideration at the Estimates Committee hearings when we were examining departmental officials. It was a subject on which I asked a question in this chamber on 24 October. The matter relates to the agreements that the Commonwealth has entered into with Victoria and Queensland in relation to the future administration of companies and securities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The state of play is that I requested that both agreements be tabled and made public because of their very great significance and importance. On 23 October the agreement between the Commonwealth and Victoria, together with some other relevant documents, was tabled, for which I thank the Minister. However, the agreement with Queensland was not tabled, although a statement by the Queensland Minister for Justice was made available. For some reason the Queensland Government did not want the agreement itself tabled. At that stage I indicated that I would expect that agreement to be made available to the Committee before these estimates for the Attorney-General's Department were passed. I inquire of Senator Tate whether that Queensland agreement is available and, if so, whether he will now table it. I would like the opportunity of seeing the document before we complete this debate. Perhaps the Minister could indicate whether it is available yet. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not available. When the agreement was entered into the Queensland Government asked for confidentiality in respect of the document. The honourable senator will be aware that under the Appropriation Bill that is before the Committee at the moment there are no funds sought to meet the Commonwealth's commitment to return a share of the revenue to Queensland under the terms of the agreement. That will not arise until 1 July 1990. Therefore, in a very strict sense, the question of the relevance of the document to these appropriations does not arise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, that is not a sufficient answer and I am informed that yesterday the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) approved that Mr Skehill-an officer who appeared before the Estimates Committee-should write to the Queensland Government asking it once again to reconsider its request for confidentiality and whether it would permit the tabling of the agreement as requested by Senator Durack. We believe that the Queensland Government ought to reconsider that matter and a letter will be written to the Queensland Government to seek its concurrence in that matter. I think that request for confidentiality is something we would wish to respect. Certainly when appropriation funds are sought next year, but earlier if possible, I think we should seek to get Queensland to agree to release the document. I am certainly not trying to hide anything; it is just that that was the mutual understanding of the Ministers when they came to this agreement, and the Attorney-General does not want to breach that mutual understanding. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very disturbed indeed by the Minister's answer, although I am sure he is doing his best to assist in this matter. I believe we are dealing here with very serious questions about the division of Commonwealth revenues between the Commonwealth and the States. The scheme the Commonwealth is seeking to follow is to get the States to refer their residual powers in relation to companies and securities to the Commonwealth so that there can be a watertight national scheme, as it is called. The very generous settlement in relation to that division of profits is really a carving up of fees that will, presumably, in due course be imposed under the national scheme by legislation. The Minister can take the technical point that these regulations are not before the Parliament and that there are not any appropriations specifically on the matter, but the fact is that the Commonwealth has persuaded two States, namely Victoria and Queensland, to withdraw their constitutional challenge to the legislation. I hope Senator Boswell is taking note of the fact that Queensland has withdrawn its challenge. This is a matter of very great public interest and concern, and I am outraged to learn that the Commonwealth has entered into a secret agreement with Queensland. That is what it amounts to: the Commonwealth has agreed to secrecy on the Queensland agreement and, apparently, has now to get the permission of the Queensland Government before it can make public the financial rewards that Queensland will get from having welshed on the arrangements it had already made with the other States to challenge the Commonwealth legislation in the High Court. The agreement is based on the fact that Queensland has withdrawn a challenge it had been mounting with other States for some considerable time. The Commonwealth has bought off Queensland by an agreement which it has agreed shall be secret. I think this is outrageous and I hope that the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) when he writes to Queensland will point out some of the facts of this matter in no uncertain terms.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the honourable senator passes to a new topic, I just want to emphasise that confidentiality was sought by the Queensland Minister at this stage-I think that was the way he more or less put it. We know what that stage is. I would imagine that within a couple of weeks he will be more amenable to making the matter public. But I do not want to allow the impression to be given that the secret deal is at great variance with that which we already know is the general structure of the Queensland agreement. In fact, I think in the written answer given to the honourable senator it is noted that, whilst in some respects the agreement with Queensland is couched in different terms from the Victorian agreement, it does not embody any matter different in principle from the matters agreed with Victoria. I know that the honourable senator's quite proper reply would be, `Well, I would like to see it and verify that for myself'. For example, in relation to the distribution of funds, the idea that 95 per cent of the profit should be distributed amongst the participating jurisdictions in relation to the number of registered companies within their jurisdictions obtains for Queensland, as it does for the Victorian agreement. That gives some idea of the sort of return they might get. It is, as I say, because of the current set of circumstances that the confidentiality was requested by the Queensland Minister. I think that that will be resolved. Certainly, as soon as a copy is agreed to be released by the Queensland Government, I will ensure that it is tabled in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I again thank the Minister for his attempt to be as helpful as he can in the very unsatisfactory circumstances with which he is faced. I propose now to turn to the Victorian agreement. I might say that one of the first concerns we have about the Victorian agreement is the fact that at the Senate Estimates Committee in the first place we were given information about the Victorian agreement which was then not borne out when the agreement was finally tabled. So the mere fact that we are told that there is not much difference between the agreements is not very comforting, particularly when we know that we did not get the right information about the Victorian agreement in the first place when questions were asked about it in the Estimates Committee on 5 October.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now propose to deal with this question. We had already heard from public statements that had been reported that a nice cosy deal had been entered into between the Commonwealth and Victoria about senior positions in the new Australian Securities Commission and the takeover panel that were going to be given virtually on the nomination of Victoria. So questions were asked early in the piece under this item. I am pleased we had present Mr Hartnell, the new Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission. Questions were asked by both Senator Short and me. On page E140 of Hansard Mr Hartnell is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government of today has entered into an agreement with the State of Victoria. It has the effect that the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman reciprocate between New South Wales and Victoria. They do not rotate; it depends on where the particular incumbents are to be located. But it is impossible to run a commission with a chairman located in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA>There was some further discussion about that matter. Some further concern was expressed about what was meant by the rotation of the position between Victoria and New South Wales, and on page E141 I said:</PARA>
<PARA> You mentioned the agreement with Victoria . . . On this point of the alternation, roughly, between Sydney and Melbourne for the chairman, I hope that it is only confined to the fact that the position of chairman is going to be virtually equally divided as to location between Sydney and Melbourne, not that a Victorian or a New South Welshman will alternate the chairmanship. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hartnell said:</PARA>
<PARA> That is correct. Your statement of the situation is my understanding. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether or not Mr Hartnell had seen the agreement, but that could be a relevant fact in relation to what was told to the Senate Committee. Subsequently, on page E143, after more questions along those lines as to the situation between Sydney and Melbourne, Senator Tate stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not a rotation, it is a reciprocation. I think that was the term that you used earlier, a reciprocity. So, if the best person selected to succeed Mr Hartnell-</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hartnell has lived in Sydney for some years-</PARA>
<PARA>chooses to live in Sydney or chooses to live in Melbourne-and he may be from Perth or Brisbane or Launceston-then once having made that choice, the deputy goes to the other major commercial capital. </PARA>
<PARA>After a great deal of questioning, the answers given did not really clarify the matter, but at the end of the hearing the general situation appeared to be that the positions of Chairman and Deputy Chairman would have to be located in Sydney and Melbourne, being the two major commercial centres in Australia. I do not think that that is an unreasonable proposition, particularly as Mr Hartnell explained that there would not really be one head office or central location in either Sydney or Melbourne but, rather, it would operate as a sort of dual setup where the Chairman would be located in one city and the Deputy Chairman in the other. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators can see from my own remarks I was immediately concerned. As I come from Western Australia, I suppose that my concern was a little sharper than others. I am aware of the cosy arrangements that are made in the legal world in many instances between Sydney and Melbourne. No Western Australian was appointed to the High Court of Australia for 79 years, until Mr Justice Wilson was appointed-and so on. So I am somewhat sensitive about this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators can also see, I stated that I hoped it did not mean that a Victorian or New South Welshman would share these very attractive spoils of chairman and deputy chairman, but, rather, it would relate only to location, and Mr Hartnell agreed with my understanding, which was confirmed by Senator Tate. </PARA>
<PARA> A couple of weeks later the agreement was tabled. I seek leave to have that agreement incorporated in Hansard so as to make my speech a little clearer. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>BASIS ON WHICH VICTORIA WOULD AGREE TO SETTLE WITH COMMONWEALTH</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Victoria to refer full power over companies securities and futures legislation to Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Victoria will not participate in any constitutional challenge. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Victoria will hand over all CAV databases and software owned by Victoria to the ASC and on all other matters of administration will co-operate with the ASC in establishing its operation. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. Subject to identification of suitable available appointees, Commonwealth to appoint suitable Victorians to the following positions:-(a) Chairperson or Deputy Chairperson (b) Chairperson, Panel</PARA>
<PARA>Such appointees to have their principal office in Melbourne. Other appointees to the ASC, the Advisory Committee and the Panel will be for the Commonwealth to decide on merit, but Victoria will have the opportunity to suggest suitable available appointees. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. Financial Arrangements:</PARA>
<PARA>Commonwealth to pay to Victoria on an ongoing basis 28% of 95% of profit arising from matters subject to reference of power. Such sums to be paid quarterly on basis to be agreed. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. If the Commonwealth enters into a proportionately (to the percentage of Australian companies incorporated in a State/Territory) more favourable profit sharing arrangement with another State/Territory, the financial arrangement outlined in paragraph 5 above will be amended accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. Payments to Victoria under this Agreement would not be used to the prejudice of Victoria in Loans Council and Premiers' Conference negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. CAV staff required by the ASC shall become Commonwealth Public Servants at the changeover date. Victoria will be liable for all staff costs, including accrued costs, up to the changeover date and the ASC will be liable thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. All staff arrangements to be subject to negotiations with relevant staff associations and staff. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Committee. To my astonishment, particularly in light of the discussions in the Estimates Committee, I discovered what a great settlement the Commonwealth got, because Victoria agreed to refer full power for companies, securities and futures legislation to the Commonwealth. The agreement states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Victoria will not participate in any constitutional challenge. </PARA>
<PARA>That sounds all very fine, but what is the price? The price is contained in paragraph 4 which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Subject to identification of suitable available appointees, Commonwealth to appoint suitable Victorians to the following positions:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Chairperson or Deputy Chairperson,</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Chairperson, Panel. </PARA>
<PARA> Such appointees to have their principal office in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA>Some other nuggets-not crumbs-are thrown to Victoria in that paragraph, but that is irrelevant for the moment. Apart from the phrase `subject to identification of suitable available appointees'-and I will come to what that means in a moment-Victorians, and not people based in Victoria, are to be appointed to these positions of not only deputy chairperson but also chairperson of the Takeover Panel, which is a very important part of the administration. I do not think we were told at the previous hearing that Victoria was to receive that additional benefit. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that Senator Tate recognises this problem, because he has already said that it did not mean that an appointee could not come from Launceston or, heaven forbid, Perth. But there might be a suitable person in Perth, Launceston, Adelaide, or Canberra. If there is a suitable Victorian-and there will always be a suitable Victorian, because Victoria is one of the major commercial centres and has numerous practitioners in this field, as does Sydney, and in answer to a later question Senator Tate has already acknowledged that there is likely to be a suitable Victorian-under this agreement, the Victorian gets the two jobs. We are told that this is a national companies scheme, but preferences are given to Victoria and New South Wales. There is no agreement with New South Wales, but the appointment speaks for itself. The first chairperson comes from Sydney. In future, the positions will alternate between Sydney and Melbourne.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have no problem with location but, in case there is any suggestion that this agreement does not means what it says-and some people believe that often legal documents do not say what they mean-the Victorian Attorney-General issued a statement dated 12 September as to the meaning of the document. The agreement is undated; it is not limited in relation to time. If a national scheme exists, the agreement applies. However, on 12 September the Victorian Attorney-General, Mr Andrew McCutcheon, made a statement which indicated he was very pleased with himself-and he had every reason to be so. He had already conned the Commonwealth in no uncertain terms. Among other matters, Mr McCutcheon's statement states:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr McCutcheon said that in return-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, in return for the reference of powers-</PARA>
<PARA>the Commonwealth had agreed to appoint a suitable Chairperson of the Companies and Securities panel and a Victorian as Deputy Chairperson of the ASC. Mr McCutcheon said these appointees would be based in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA>So it is not talking about these positions being based in Melbourne. He would not say that they would be based in Melbourne. He was making the distinction between being a Victorian and being based in Melbourne. The agreement also makes the distinction because it says that the appointees of the principal office will be in Melbourne. So it is making the distinction between a person just being based in Melbourne and a Victorian. Of course, Victoria wants to get a Victorian. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Harradine for his intervention and support. I was getting very close to the end of my remarks, but in order to complete the record I want to refer to a question which I asked Senator Tate in Question Time on 24 October. After this agreement had been tabled at the Estimates Committee hearing on 23 October, I asked Senator Tate a question in the Senate along the lines on which I have been speaking. I was concerned, as I still am, about two matters. In my view, the Senate Estimates Committee was clearly misled by the statements made by both the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) and Mr Hartnell. In fairness to Mr Hartnell, he may not have seen the agreement. He did say that my statement of the situation was his understanding of the position. Nevertheless, it is a very serious matter. As far as I can see, no attempt has been made by the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) or the Government to correct the statements that were made. The questions I asked Senator Tate about this matter appear on pages 2064 and 2065 of Hansard of 24 October. Senator Tate pointed to clause 4. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . I think the preceding part to clause 4 of the Victorian agreement that was tabled indicated that the first duty was to look for a suitable possible appointee. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, it is subject to identification of suitable available appointees. The Commonwealth has to appoint suitable Victorians. So it is clear that the Commonwealth may look around Australia to find the most suitable person, but it has got to appoint a suitable Victorian, even though there may be better suited people around Australia. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>It may be that that canvassing of possible appointees could lead us to say that there was not a suitable Victorian-</PARA>
<PARA>maybe-</PARA>
<PARA>and possibly that somebody from Perth, Launceston, or wherever was suitable. That is a preliminary hurdle that has to be jumped in terms of clause 4 of the agreement that was tabled. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tate was agreeing that that is all clause 4 does. Whether clause 4 was intended to do that is another matter. In view of what Senator Tate had said, I asked him a supplementary question:</PARA>
<PARA>Is it not highly probable that people resident in Victoria would be suitable for either position? In that event, does that agreement not virtually guarantee that there will be a Victorian in one of these top positions?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tate answered:</PARA>
<PARA>It is likely that there will be a Victorian who qualifies for that appointment, in which case the terms of the agreement are very clear. I am simply saying that there is no automatic assumption that that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say what seemed to be rather odd things, but I agree with them. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is essential to go for the best possible short list of available candidates and not to be restricted in an extremely hidebound way. I concede that one would hope to find within the Victorian business and commercial world a person of sufficient eminence to qualify. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether he has to be eminent to qualify, because all he has to be is suitable. My point is that the Commonwealth, by this agreement, has greatly restricted in practice the appointments it can make to this most important new organ of government in Australia. The appointees are going to be at the very top of the administration of our corporate, companies and securities laws. Heaven knows how important that is. Problems of great magnitude arise constantly in this area which concern the Australian economy and a great many shareholders in Australian companies. We have had instances only in the last week of the enormous tasks and responsibilities that are imposed upon the people in charge of this scheme; and here at the apex of the scheme we have the three most important positions and the Government has limited its choice of who are the best and most eminent people in this field to those whom the Government can persuade to take on this job. It may be a difficult job to take on. Certainly the last thing that the Government should do, quite apart from equity and equal opportunity around Australia-and I emphasise that this is a national scheme; anybody would think that this was a Victoria-New South Wales scheme-is be greatly restricted in this agreement. It should get the best people it can get for these jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> The position is not just unsatisfactory; it is really quite alarming. I have already mentioned that there is no time limit on this agreement. It has been confirmed by the further questioning at the Estimates Committee that there is no time limit on this agreement. The Commonwealth has entered into another agreement with Queensland, but from what we know of that agreement Queensland has been pretty short sold. I do not know whether Queensland knew what the deal with Victoria was, but from the States rights sentiments that we hear so often from the Queensland Government perhaps it is so embarrassed that it would not want to admit, with the election going on there at the moment, how it had been dealt with by the Commonwealth, because it has well and truly been outsmarted by the Victorians in this deal with the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> So, if I may say in passing, it is a pretty sorry old comment on the Queensland Government. How could the Queensland Government have got a deal such as Victoria got? The three plum jobs had been given to New South Wales and Victoria. There was not very much left for Queensland, but it too was conned into withdrawing its challenge under an agreement the terms of which we do not really know, although we are told that they were similar. They may have been similar on financial matters, but we do not know. I am not interested in the financial matters at the moment; I am interested in the best possible administration of this new scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has made a sorry start in the new national scheme which for so long it has been vaunting as so vital. The Victorians have withdrawn their constitutional challenge and have agreed to refer their powers to the Commonwealth, thus allowing Victoria to have control over the Commonwealth for as long as the scheme lasts. It is no good saying, `We can renegotiate this scheme. This does not mean what it says. If the very best person for the job happens to be in Brisbane we will be able to say to the Victorians that we have given them a fair crack of the whip because they have already had two of the three top jobs for a few years and now we want a change'-the usual things that the Commonwealth does when dealing with the States. On this occasion it will not be able to get away with it because Victoria will also have a whip handle; it will have the reference of powers. It will not matter if the High Court finds totally in favour of the Commonwealth; there will always be some residual State powers. In order to have a proper national scheme, the Commonwealth will have to have reference of powers from the States. Even Sir Maurice Byers admitted that in the opinion he gave the Commonwealth. The Victorians will also have the Commonwealth over a barrel because they can withdraw the reference of powers. If the Commonwealth does not abide by this agreement, the Victorians can withdraw their powers. The Commonwealth will come to heel pretty smartly because it will be very reliant on that reference of powers from Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has created in this very cosy deal-as I call it-with Victoria a very serious and deplorable situation. All members of the States House of the Commonwealth should be outraged that the Commonwealth has taken such an attitude to its national responsibilities. With this whole new national scheme the Commonwealth has got off to the worst possible start by hamstringing its power of appointment to the top jobs in the way it has under this agreement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Apparently Senator Durack regards the setting up of the Australian Securities Commission and the persons to whom it is intended should be appointed to the top jobs as having got off to a very sorry start. He seeks to portray the situation as if New South Welshmen and Victorians had a guaranteed access to the top jobs. Tony Hartnell was appointed as Chairperson of the Australian Securities Commission purely because of his eminence and expertise, and no doubt because of his very extensive contacts through both the government and non-government sectors-the commercial and trading securities world of Australia. The premier commercial and trading securities capitals of Australia are to be found in Melbourne or Sydney. But we are not talking about locations; we are talking about persons. It is not true to say either that Tony Hartnell was appointed because he is a New South Welshman or that a New South Welshmen is guaranteed one of the top jobs. There is no agreement with New South Wales. There is no guarantee that a New South Welshperson will ever be appointed to the top three jobs which Senator Durack has mentioned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to whether a Victorian might fill one of those top jobs, I was realistic in my answer-I was not trying to be half smart, although I suppose I could have been utterly artificial, legalistic and abstract-when I said that one would expect to find in Victoria somebody who was, as I put it, well qualified. When Senator Durack asked the question on 24 October I said:</PARA>
<PARA>I concede that one would hope to find within the Victorian business and commercial world a person of sufficient eminence to qualify. </PARA>
<PARA>But that person must qualify in terms of clause 4 of the agreement with Victoria, which is preceded by that hurdle. The agreement would be very different if that first hurdle were not in the agreement and, therefore, did not have to be jumped. The agreement states:</PARA>
<PARA> Subject to identification of suitable available appointees, Commonwealth to appoint suitable Victorians to the following positions:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Chairperson or Deputy Chairperson</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Chairperson, Panel</PARA>
<PARA>That preliminary hurdle, that condition precedent, has meaning and it protects the Commonwealth from having foisted upon it a mediocre person who might be a Victorian but might not be able to serve best the interests which Senator Durack properly pointed to-namely, the Australian Securities Commission, being so important, should have the very best personnel in those top jobs. It was, I am informed, a constant part of the negotiations that the Commonwealth would not guarantee Victoria access to those top jobs in an absolute sense. That is why that preliminary part of the clause was put in. That is why the condition precedent is there. If it turns out to be the case that, in the judgment of the Commonwealth, a suitable Victorian cannot be found, I can assure the Committee that there will be no appointment of a Victorian to one of those jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Going back to the hearings of Estimates Committee E, I think that Senator Durack used the term `secret protocol'. He was worried that a secret deal had carved up the jobs and so on. The agreement has been put on the table. I think that it indicates openly the sort of deal that was done. I use those terms because I do not deny that a political deal was done between Victoria and the Commonwealth. But the terms of the agreement have been exposed and tabled in this chamber. I believe that the points which Senator Durack has raised are not valid when he put it so strongly as a deal being done to ensure that New South Welshpersons and Victorians have an absolute precedence and an absolute guarantee of access to those jobs. That is not the case with regard to New South Wales and, as I have said, a very high hurdle, I believe, has to be jumped before a Victorian would qualify. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not accept that this agreement will disable the Australian Securities Commission at the start from having access to the most highly qualified of personnel to undertake the very onerous duties and statutory duties that will be placed upon them. Given the fact that we know that it is going ahead, I am sure that Senator Durack will join with me in hoping that those who hold the positions will discharge their responsibilities in a way which gives great satisfaction to the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tate is still falling back on the phrase `subject to identification of suitable available appointees'. But the clause goes on to say `Commonwealth to appoint suitable Victorians'. It does not say `subject to the identification of more suitable or available eminent people', but `appoint suitable Victorians'. The Attorney-General of Victoria is in no doubt-I have already quoted what he said-that the Commonwealth agreed to appoint a suitable Victorian as chairperson of the panel and a Victorian as deputy chairperson. There is no question about that. The Commonwealth can argue until the cows come home that there is an overriding intention to get the most eminent person, as did Senator Tate. I am glad that he thinks that is the appropriate course, but as I pointed out Victoria has them over a barrel. The Victorians are in no doubt about what it means and about what they intended. Mr McCutcheon has made it quite clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Justice is ignoring the political realities that will occur because the Victorians can point out to the Commonwealth that it made a deal with them. They are perfectly entitled to interpret it in that way because that is also how I interpret it. When I first saw the agreement during the Estimates Committee hearing, I nearly fell off my chair. I could not believe it. Then I saw that Mr McCutcheon takes exactly the same view as I do. He is the man who will call the shots here; make no bones about it. His successors as Victorian Attorney-General will take exactly the same view. Let there be no doubt about it: they have the Commonwealth over a barrel and they will insist on their pound of flesh as to what the agreement means. The Commonwealth has given Victoria an enormous advantage and there is no doubt that Victoria will use it to its full extent in the appointments that are coming up and in all future appointments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter I wish to raise today is one of grave importance. It involves the national security of this nation; it quite possibly involves the very lives of certain people; it involves the reputation of a member of this Parliament. It is obvious, therefore, that I am taking this action of speaking in the Senate today only after the most deliberative, serious soul-searching consideration. Before reaching this decision to speak today I have taken considerable advice and counsel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter to which I refer is the activities of the Yugoslav secret police in Australia. The Yugoslav secret police is commonly known as the SDB and I will refer to it as such in my following remarks. However, as I shall reiterate in my remarks, my concerns are not only with the SDB but as well with the allegations of an upsurge in recent times of the activities of the secret police forces of several foreign powers to monitor the activities of their emigre communities. These allegations have been made not only about Yugoslavia but also about several other countries, including, in particular, Vietnam. The Senate will recall that on 29 August of this year I asked Senator Tate, in his capacity as Minister for Justice and as Minister representing to the Attorney-General, whether he was aware of a recent series of articles and reports in the Australian newspaper concerning the activities of the SDB. In particular I referred to an article of 29 July this year alleging that the SDB `has formed close ties with a Federal member of Parliament'. That report stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a source in the Yugoslav Department of Foreign Affairs in Belgrade . . . said information that may have originated from the MP, a Labor Party backbencher, has shown up in the dossiers of Croatian exiles in Australia, held at UDBA-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the SDB-</PARA>
<PARA>headquarters in the Yugoslav capital. </PARA>
<PARA>I asked Senator Tate:</PARA>
<PARA>Has the Australian Government investigated these allegations, particularly the allegation that the UDBA is operating in Australia? If not, why not, and will it now establish an official inquiry into the allegations? If the Government finds that there are UDBA or other agents provocateurs operating here, is it the Government's policy to expel them? Finally, can the Minister assure the Senate that there is no known connection between any Australian Labor Party member of Federal Parliament and the Yugoslav secret police?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tate took that question on notice. Three days later, on Friday, 1 September, he responded:</PARA>
<PARA>I am aware of the articles and the various allegations made in them. I follow the practice of successive Commonwealth governments in not commenting on matters concerning national security. </PARA>
<PARA>I have learned subsequently that other members of this Parliament, including the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Peacock, and the Labor member for Corio, Mr Scholes, received similar responses from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, to similar questions that they had put to him in writing. In a statement released later that day following receipt of Senator Tate's answer I said that in my view it was not permissible for the Government to be allowed this time to fall back on the excuse of national security. I pointed out that what is involved are allegations, firstly, that a foreign government-in this case Yugoslavia's-is conducting clandestine secret police operations of a terrorist nature in Australia; secondly, that certain Australian citizens are the victims of these clandestine operations; and, thirdly, that a Labor member of Federal Parliament is alleged to be aiding and abetting these clandestine operations against Australian citizens. I said in that statement that the Australian electorate has a basic right to information about these allegations and that at the very least the electorate has a basic right to know whether one of its own elected representatives is deliberately engaged in activities designed to damage Australian citizens. </PARA>

In an adjournment speech in this chamber on 7 September I referred to reports that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, ASIO, suspected that Yugoslav secret service agents had links with a number of senior Australian public servants. Following my question in the Senate my colleague in the House of Representatives, Mr Aldred, also raised the activities of the SDB in Australia. Amongst other things Mr Aldred discussed allegations that in Belgrade there are dossiers of information which has originated in Australia, from the SDB. Mr Aldred said:</PARA></TALK.START>

In 1959 he changed his name by deed poll from his Yugoslav name, Lajco Kapolnai, to Lewis Kent.

It is quite clear that using a general sentence about a member of the Parliament and a link with the Yugoslav secret police and immediately preceding that by reference to Mr Lewis Kent can have no other purpose than to leave in the mind of the listener an identification of the unnamed member, in one sense, as being Mr Lewis Kent. The link is being made for the purpose of the whole argument or the whole speech that Senator Short is trying to develop. You cannot take each sentence, in my submission, separately.

What I am concerned to see is that it does not improperly vilify a member of the House of Representatives. Senator Short, I ruled earlier that to name a member of the House of Representatives and suggest that he was a foreign agent would be a gross reflection on him, and that cannot be done in this forum in this form. You may move a motion which could enable that, but not under this system. I take it that you have accepted that ruling that the discussion you are developing has no direct and intended linking with the particular individual-the honourable member for Hotham.

I said that the inquiry should be public, without advocating any one form of inquiry over another. In response to my speech in the Senate on 7 September Senator Evans tried to denigrate my call for an inquiry. At the same time he refused my request specifically, using the time worn excuse, and in this instance I believe totally inadequate excuse, that governments do not comment on operational matters affecting security and intelligence agencies. I want to say to the Government today that that excuse is no longer acceptable, if indeed it ever was.

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like also to develop briefly just one aspect of the whole issue of banking which I have been addressing for almost 18 months now in this place. I have attempted to put before the Senate sufficient evidence to justify an inquiry into banking. On two occasions now the Senate has chosen not to support the proposition of a major inquiry into banking. I will return to that proposition as time goes on. However, I would like to explain simply, in a couple of moments, one of the techniques of the banking sector. Those in dispute with banks or financiers in this country often find themselves confronted with a particular technique which is virtually impossible for them to counter. I cite the case of a Michael Bourke. I have tabled affidavits from Michael Bourke and other documents in relation to his circumstances previously. Michael Bourke is a businessman from the Newcastle area who now finds himself in dispute with a bank in three courts: the New South Wales Supreme Court; the Federal Court; and he is listed to carry one of his disputes into the High Court of Australia. In short, Michael Bourke is a man determined to pursue his grievance with this particular bank. Quite obviously, the bank with which he is in dispute-or one of those banks with which he is in dispute-is anxious that this should not happen and that these matters should not get into court. In fact in recent days it has done everything in its power to bring the man into bankruptcy in order to terminate his access to one of the courts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The technique that the banks have used is an interesting one and one which I draw to the attention of honourable senators. Michael Bourke was the owner of 80 acres of heavy industry land in the Rutherford area in Maitland and at the time that he bought this property it was valued, independently, at approximately $400,000. He then secured an advance, a loan, from the Beneficial Finance Corporation Ltd-which is the financial wing of the South Australian State Bank-with this 80 acres of industrial land as security. At the time that that loan was made, there was an independent valuation of $500,000 on this plot of industrial land. Subsequently, down the line, the bank has chosen to foreclose, for its own reasons. It has foreclosed on that loan and in fact has sold the property, the 80 acres of heavy industrial land, in an attempt to recoup its advance. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time of reselling that property, the bank had a second independent valuation done and that valuation was $350,000. So we have had three valuations-one of $500,000, one of $400,000 and one of $350,000. But the bank actually sold that land for $45,000. In fact, it sold the land for 15 per cent of the average of three independent valuations. This meant, of course, that Mr Bourke, who had the bank before the court, was placed into a position of technically becoming bankrupt, and by virtue of technically becoming bankrupt he does not have access to the courts. The Bourke case is legally acknowledged in previous judgments of the Supreme Court of New South Wales as being a critical case. It is progressing its way to the High Court of Australia, and is listed in the High Court for February of next year. </PARA>
<PARA> What do ordinary business people do? I do not regard Michael Bourke as being an ordinary business person; the nature of the projects which he enters into suggest that he is a fairly extraordinary and very succesful business person who happens to have fallen foul of his financiers for reasons that he believes are unreasonable and which he is challenging in the courts of the land. This technique of foreclosing and selling at fire sale prices is a common technique. In the 300 cases which I have before me, including in excess of 60 cases that I have tabled, supported by sworn affidavits or other sworn statements, there have been numerous examples of banks foreclosing on assets and selling them promptly at prices which are in the vicinity of 10 or 15 or 20 per cent of their value. The implications of course are horrendous for the individuals involved, and it flies in the face of all of the procedures that are applied in anticipation of people being declared bankrupt. In fact it makes a mockery of the processes that come before courts in this land. I cite this extreme case that has been brought to me by Michael Bourke, and I have described it to the Senate as being typical of what is occurring out there in and outside our courts in relation to banking in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, Mr Acting Deputy President, it is my intention to do three things: to continue to table evidence for the consideration of honourable senators; to continue to push subsequently for an appropriate inquiry into these sorts of processes, and into banking generally in Australia; and to carry these matters, including the cases that I have tabled here in the Senate, before the Australian Bank Council and put them before the bank ombudsman early in the new year when it is anticipated that such a person will be appointed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of members of this Parliament belong to the Parliamentary UNICEF Group because of an interest we have in the welfare and hopes of the world's children. We receive regular briefings but I have a briefing here today which I do not think has gone to the UNICEF Group. Nevertheless, it should be of interest to the Parliament. Honourable senators will recall that in 1984-85 there were great crop failures in Ethiopia which led to an enormous number of deaths and to the need for international intervention. I have received yesterday a note from the National Director of UNICEF Australia, Mr Robert Nestdale, concerning a new emergency situation now arising in Ethiopia. It had with it a United Nations Children's Fund assessment of the Ethiopian situation which in a moment I will seek to incorporate. I have already checked it with Senator Evans, who was here earlier. This emergency and drought, according to the assessments made, will be worse than the 1984-85 drought in terms of crop failures. One part of the report says-and I will not read much of it:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This drought-according to the results of assessments of the main harvest planting by UN agencies, including UNICEF, and by the government of Ethiopia-will be worse than in 1984-85 in terms of crop failure. </PARA>
<PARA> In Eritrea the crop failure is estimated to be 90 to 100 per cent, while in Tigray it reaches 40 per cent. At least 242,000 metric tonnes of food assistance is needed according to WFP-</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is the World Food Program-</PARA>
<PARA>to meet the needs of 1.85 million people. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to set out in some detail the extent of the drought and the extent of its impact. UNICEF is now launching a special appeal to respond to this new emergency. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the document entitled The Emergency Information Note that has been forwarded to UNICEF Australia, so that honourable senators can have a chance to be aware of the full scale of this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>EIN/45/89</PARA>
<PARA>13 November 1989</PARA>
<PARA>ETHIOPIA 4</PARA>
<PARA>As anticipated in Emergency Information Note Ethiopia 3, dated 4 October 1989, UNICEF is now launching an appeal for Emergency assistance to the population affected by the drought in Ethiopia's northern regions of Eritrea and Tigray. </PARA>
<PARA> This drought-according to the results of assessments of the main harvest planting made by UN agencies, including UNICEF, and by the government of Ethiopia-will be worse than in 1984-85 in terms of crop failure. </PARA>
<PARA> In Eritrea the crop failure is estimated to be 90 to 100%, while in Tigray it reaches 40%. At least 242,000 MT of food assistance is needed according to WFP, to meet the needs of 1.5 million people. The Relief and Rehabilitation Commission in its official appeal estimates the needs at 333,000 MT of grain for 1.85 million people. </PARA>
<PARA> UNICEF appeal for US$ 9.05 million focuses on non-food emergency assistance to the 1.2 million Eritreans who are directly affected by the drought, and to another 300,000 people who are expected to walk in search of food from Tigray into Eritrea during the next 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> UNICEF in responding to an emergency appeal launched by the Government of Ethiopia on 26 October 1989. UNICEF appeal closely follows on the appeals launched by other agencies such as the World Food Program, and the Ethiopian Red Cross Society. It has been co-ordinated with other UN agencies in Addis Ababa most of which will concentrate on food aid. </PARA>
<PARA>Background</PARA>
<PARA>For the third time in less than 10 years, Ethiopia is confronted with a drought of catastrophic proportions. In 1984-85 up to one million people starved to death in the northern regions of the country; in 1987-88 a similar tragedy could be averted thanks to the early appeals of the Government of Ethiopia and to a prompt reaction by the international community. </PARA>
<PARA> This time the situation is considered worse than in 1984-85, mainly for two reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> 1) A nearly total crop failure is being reported in the whole Eritrean region as Meher rains-the long rains of mid-June which determine food availability during the following year-started late in July and ended too early in September. In Tigray the crop failure is estimated to be 40%. Furthermore, these two regions are afflicted by civil wars respectively 28 and 15 years old, which restrict movements of goods and people and limit the access of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> 2) For the first time since 1984, the food pipeline is virtually empty. Ironically, this is a result of the extensive good rains of 1988 which gave Ethiopia a satisfactory food availability for 1989. Because of the good harvests and of substantial carry over from 1988 emergency food aid, there has been no request of assistance from the Government of Ethiopia since November 1987. Consequently the food pipeline which had been kept continuously supplied by successive appeals to donors from the Ethiopian Relief and Rehabilitation Commission was not replenished and is now at its lowest level. As of September 1989 wheat stocks were estimated at some 47,000 MT. These stocks will be exhausted very early in 1990 if additional food assistance is not provided immediately. </PARA>
<PARA>Up to 2 million people affected</PARA>
<PARA>Approximately 1.5 million people are estimated to be directly affected by the drought, 300,000 of which are expected to arrive in Eritrea from affected areas in Tigray which are currently inaccessible. But this number could reach up to 2 million as famine conditions develop in 1990. The first signs of famine have already been reported not only in the border towns of Eritrea where influxes of displaced people are on the increase, but also in other areas, in particular in Akele Guzay district where farmers are selling their livestock at only one third of the normal price. Livestock disposal at very low prices is one of early warning indicators that a drought situation is becoming alarming. </PARA>
<PARA> Staff members from UNICEF Asmara visited the drought-stricken areas of Eritrea from 18 to 28 October 1989 to fully assess the extent of the current emergency. In all the 25 distribution centres which they visited they noticed a severe shortfall in food stocks, in many cases warehouses were empty. Water and health services were much below adequate levels, many facilities had no supply of drugs or medicines and needed vehicles to provide health services to the population. However, UNICEF team observed that water points can be reactivated within three to six months with the appropriate supply of equipment and reservoirs. </PARA>
<PARA>UNICEF APPEAL FOR EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE 1989-90</PARA>
<PARA>Focus of UNICEF Assistance</PARA>
<PARA>UNICEF will concentrate on assistance to displaced women and children in the areas of supplementary feeding, health, water, shelter relief, and general organizational support to the emergency effort, e.g. warehousing, transport, manpower and management/coordination. </PARA>
<PARA> It will first address relief operations in the immediate period, and then move on to rehabilitation once the peak of the crisis passed. The duration of UNICEF assistance will cover approximately 12 to 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA> UNICEF's intervention will take two approaches: geographic, i.e. focusing on definite locations where displaced persons will seek food and non-food assistance; and functional, i.e. working in partnership with governments and non-government agencies which run emergency programmes in Eritrea. The majority of these agencies have worked with UNICEF during the previous drought emergencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The projects in the appeal have been grouped therefore by implementing agencies, and not by sectors, as it was found that the same agencies in Eritrea work in a variety of emergency projects. </PARA>
<PARA> Geographical `pressure points', i.e. locations of potential concentration of people seeking food and non-food assistance during the next 12 months, have been identified. The main pressure points are district and sub-district capitals, especially those close to the war fronts. The Relief and Rehabilitation Commissions has listed 25 food distribution centres which correspond to the main pressure points. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of these points are already seeing large influxes of refugees. For instance, Keren/Hagas, in Keren district, has doubled its population in the last 7 months to 90,000, half being displaced people living in self-built temporary shelters with water in very short supply. </PARA>
<PARA> The participating agencies which UNICEF will be working in partnership are: The Relief and Rehabilitation Commission/Eritrea Regional Office (RRC), the Ethiopian Water Works Construction Authority (EWWCA); the Water and Sanitation Agency (WSA); the Ministry of Health/Eritrea Region (MOH); the Asmara City Council Health Services Department (CITY); the Ethiopian Catholic Secretariat/Joint Relief Partners (ECS/JRP); the Evangelist Church of Eritrea (ECE); the Social Welfare Centre/Vicariate of Asmara (SWC); and the Capuchin Fathers/Eritrea (CFE). </PARA>
<PARA> Project N. 1: RRC Relief Operations-Estimated budget: US$2,250,000. As the government agency concerned with disasters, the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission is in charge of the big task of meeting the food and non-food needs of the 1.2 million people in Eritrea who will be directly affected by the drought. As the drought progresses, some 200,000 to 300,000 people from the neighbouring region of Tigray are expected to seek assistance at RRC distribution centres in the border areas in the south, and people from the north are expected to converge into Keren. 200,000 people have already taken refuge in Eritrea's towns and in shelters after having fled the areas of conflict. The RRC plans to open 25 food distribution centres to meet the influx of people which is estimated by UN agencies to grow from about 750,000 by end 1989 to about 1.5 million by mid 1990 for Eritrea alone. UNICEF will assist the RRC in the supply of supplementary food in the form of locally produced faffa, high protein biscuits, and purchases of local pulses. UNICEF will also assist with the transport, providing support vehicles and water truck tankers, with field support materials and equipment, and manpower costs. Shelter relief materials (such as blankets, soap, water containers, cooking and feeding kits, tents, grinding mills and temporary storage, will be also supplied for displaced families, and school materials such as exercise books and pencils, will be provided for the displaced children. </PARA>
<PARA> Project N. 2: Ethiopian Catholic Secretariat-Estimated budget: US$1,850,000. The Ethiopian Churches, Catholic, Orthodox and Protestants, have banded together in 1984-85 into the Joint Relief Partners (JRP) with the Ethiopian Catholic Secretariat as its coordinating body in Eritrea. </PARA>
<PARA> The ECS has built 34 health and food distribution centres, including water points with reservoirs, all over Eritrea, it also maintains 20 health clinics in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> UNICEF assistance will cover both ECS relief and rehabilitation assistance. Relief assistance will be in the form of shelter relief items, supplementary food, drugs and medicines, medical supplies and equipment, clothing and blankets. ECS capability to build and improve its water points will be strengthened in the form of pumps, pipes and fittings, and water reservoirs and truck water tankers. Its 20 health clinics and outreach health programmes will also be strengthened through the provision of drugs and medicines, ORS, medical supplies and equipment, and support vehicles. Moreover, assistance will be given to ECS projects of soil and water conservation, reforestation and small irrigation as a measure of disaster preparedness. </PARA>
<PARA> Project N. 3: Asmara City Council-Estimated budget: US$850,000: Asmara City Council has requested UNICEF assistance to increase its health and sanitation support systems in view of the influx of some 200,000 people from the surrounding countryside. </PARA>
<PARA> UNICEF will provide assistance in the form of equipment and supplies for health promotion and education, of cold-chain equipment for increased immunization, supply of vaccines, ORS, pesticides/rodenticides, drugs and medicines, and in the form of construction of additional water points and provision of handpumps, construction of improved latrines, procurement of sludge tank collectors, mounted garbage disposal units, and water truck tankers. Operations and monitoring systems as well as transport equipment for supervision will also be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> Project N. 4: Ethiopian Water Works Authority-Estimated budget: US$550,000. The EWWCA is expected to increase water capacity in some of the 25 distribution centres which will be opened by the RRC. This project will consist of forming three water rehabilitation teams to quicken the pace of water scheme rehabilitation. It will require the provision of pipes, reservoirs, truck water tankers, vehicles, workshop tools, monolift and handpumps, temporary warehouses, field rescue tents and equipment, and field work support to maintain water teams on the field for stretches of 30-days work. </PARA>
<PARA> Project N. 5: Social Welfare Centre-Estimated budget: US$650,000. The Vicariate of Asmara founded a centre for displaced children and women and mothers as a result of the 1984-85 drought and of the internal conflict which has been plaguing Eritrea for 28 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Aside from its network of urban child care, it maintains outreach stations in ten locations in Eritrea. In the city of Asmara, it also feeds 6500 children from Tigraean displaced families daily, and maintains centres for street children, abandoned mothers and other destitute people. The Social Welfare Centre supports a paediatric ward in the Asmara hospital for abandoned babies.</PARA>
<PARA> In the coming drought the Centre expects its operations to increase four-fold. Already, UNICEF has provided one vehicle for managing the Centre's many facilities, and supplied blankets, soaps, medicines and feeding kits. Additional supply of the above items and supplementary food will be needed, as well as support for the Centre's immunization programmes implemented in its 15 clinics, provision of ORS, of equipment to strengthen the Centre's soup kitchens as well as of light trucks, water tankers and light vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA> Project N. 6: Water and Sanitation Agency-Estimated budget: US$750,000. The WSA is a newly created agency for local water management in urban centres. Much of the Ethiopian Water Works Authority projects have been turned over to this new agency. UNICEF will provide assistance in the form of pumps, pipes and fittings, diesel engine prime movers, water reservoirs, rips and vehicles for service and supervision. WSA projects will be addressed to the outlying towns of Eritrea. </PARA>
<PARA> Project N. 7: Ethiopian Red Cross Society-Estimated budget: US$250,000. The ERCS is the national organization of the Red Cross and is affiliated with the League of International Red Cross. In the last 6 months ERCS has been assisting 300,000 people in Eritrea and more recently 10,000 people in Dahlak Islands half of which were displaced fishermen from Bore peninsula. The ERCS took over the relief operations of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) when this was asked to leave northern Ethiopia in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The ERCS has launched its own appeal for the current emergency. UNICEF assistance was requested in supporting their water trunk tanker fleet in terms of fuel, operations and maintenance, as well as in providing technical assistance and training in the field of Primary Health Care. </PARA>
<PARA> Project N. 8: Capuchin Fathers/Eritrea-Estimated budget: US$950,000. The Capuchin Fathers have been assisting the displaced population, with UNICEF support, since the 1987-88 drought. They are now planning to expand their service to the 200,000 displaced currently in Eritrea and to the expected displaced families which will arrive from Tigray and from the countryside in the next months. </PARA>
<PARA> UNICEF will provide blankets, clothing, soap, supplementary food, drugs and medicines, water reservoirs, jerry cans for families, cooking and feeding utensils, grinding mills, exercise books for school children, and transport equipment including mounted water tankers. </PARA>
<PARA> Project N. 9: Evangelical Church of Eritrea-Estimated budget: US$1,200,000. Since the 1984-85 drought, the Evangelical Church has specialized its assistance to drought affected people in the construction of micro-dams as a form of drought mitigation and as a concrete measure of disaster preparedness. To date, the ECE has built 16 micro-dams; each micro-dam costs US$ 125,000 in terms of heavy equipment and food for work labour intensive construction. In any dam project 2000 to 3000 people are provided with food for work. ECE estimates that its 16 dams are now servicing some 300,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA> UNICEF will assist ECE to continue its dam construction programme by providing pipes, handpumps, monolift pumps, water reservoirs, construction equipment, surveying equipment and technical consultancy in irrigation methods. UNICEF will also supply drugs and medicines, medical equipment, as well as exercise books, pencils and blackboards for ECE's health and education projects. Vehicles for construction and general programme management have also been requested. </PARA>
<PARA> Project N. 10: Support to Local Government/UNICEF Sub-Office-Estimated budget: US$750,000. Together with UNICEF sub-office in Asmara, local officials are expected to assist the regional government in coordinating and managing the activities related to the displacement of people and the provision of relief. </PARA>
<PARA> UNICEF assistance is requested in the form of temporary warehouses for the storage of relief materials in the major transport/port locations, of cargo handling equipment, grinding mills, cash assistance for manpower support, clearing of cargo from the ports, and transport of relief materials. Support to district authorities office and field organizations, to increase their administrative capacity, has also been requested. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(1.14)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Honourable senators will recall that last year the nation voted on four referenda questions, which were defeated. Certainly as part of the campaign that led to that defeat there was a great deal of propaganda pushed by the Right, urging a No vote. Prominent amongst those groups were the Australian League of Rights and the Logos Foundation. The polemic tone of the literature published by such groups adds, unfortunately, to the reservoir of hate which is infecting the political debate in this country. At the moment in Queensland there is an election campaign being waged, and there has been an intervention in that campaign by the Logos Foundation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is important to highlight the exercise by which the Logos Foundation deals with a variety of matters. One of the most significant understandings which this type of religious fundamentalism has of itself and the world is that its followers are, in fact, a holy people of God surrounded by the enemy. This enemy is to be identified and, if possible, eliminated. In other words, what we are looking at is, as it were, the establishment of a Christian ayatollahism. The view that the Logos Foundation in Queensland in the last few weeks has lent on can be analysed. There are four main steps in that tactic of creating fear and establishing the enemy. The first one, of course, is the identification of the enemy, and the enemy is seen as someone who would overthrow the Christian way of life. This identification is designed to play on latent prejudices against minority groups and to reinforce a fortress mentality. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think the exercise in Queensland needs to be detailed in full, but the second tactic after the identification is vilification of the enemy. This is to suggest that that particular enemy is less than human, or if it is human that it is so evil that it should be regarded as less than human and certainly less than `our people who would never stoop to these types of activities'. The third tactic, of course, is brutalisation. Having created this climate of fear, they create a climate in which people within our community feel free not only to identify and vilify but also to move to physical abuse and maltreatment. Hence, we have seen, for example, that in Queensland many minority groups have been subjected to physical attack and beatings. The exercise is one which I think those who have ever bothered to study any history would know very well. </PARA>
<PARA> The last element, of course, having arrived at such a circumstance, is to move to the political strategy of the elimination of the enemy. Once that enemy has been seen as non-human, as evil, and as a diseased cancer, then a surgical removal is suggested. Indeed, the Logos Foundation wants to go to the ready-made surgical removal exercise, and that is the reintroduction of the death penalty. If I can quote from a broadsheet put out by that organisation on this one, I think the various points they have raised so far will be clear. It says this:</PARA>
<PARA> The divinely-ordained purpose of the State is the upholding of social order and the restraint of evil, not the reformation of the criminal. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless there is an ultimate sanction-capital punishment-in the restraint of evil, the criminal has no reason not to commit the most reprehensible of crimes. </PARA>
<PARA> The opponents of capital punishment are undermining the common good by siding with evil, and are showing more regard for the criminal than the victim of the crime, and are . . . encouraging murder. </PARA>
<PARA>I think honourable senators will agree that such exercises within our community do not sit with either our historical or democratic traditions. We have a vigorous and healthy political system in this country that can well do without the exercise of creating evil enemies that end up having very little rights, if any, to exist within our community. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this is all fed by a world network, in terms of the New Right and publications, but mainly, of course, support comes from the United States where the type of money that is necessary for the publication of books and articles and the production of videos and other material seems to be readily available, despite the fact that some of their reasonable proponents have been locked up for 30- or 40-odd years. The exercise of what I would call this politics of resentment and hate of course is designed to appeal to strong leadership. If only a leader will come forward to take control and offer simple solutions, those who feel alienated from the political process are quite happy to follow, even at the cost of democratic freedoms. One commentator, in his book Thunder on the Right, says this:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a vast conspiracy, indeed, that thwarts the will of the people, so the New Right rationale goes. So vast, in fact, that everyone is a member except the tiny minority of the New Right ideologues and their constituents. The society, indeed the age, is the conspiracy. </PARA>
<PARA>In assessing the part played by fundamentalist religion in reinforcing this politics of resentment one has to look at the reliance on resources and literature coming from the United States. Most Australian leaders of the religious Right are in fact in agreement, but it is interesting that in the Queensland context the leaders of the mainstream churches have issued very strong statements disassociating themselves from this lunatic fringe, disassociating themselves from this politics of hate and resentment, and have sought rather to focus on issues that they believe and that I believe are the fundamental types of issues that certainly the Christian churches have always propounded. In the Logos Foundation appeal called `Shareholders in the Nation of Australia', there is this:</PARA>
<PARA> We are witnessing a deliberate and specific attempt in Australia to change our value systems: in classrooms, on television programmes, in the newspapers and throughout the social fabric of our nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Our moral values, family values, business ethics, judicial principles . . . are all undergoing change. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue is not a political one, in the sense of a socialist or conservative government. It is a question of which value system will undergird our nation and its institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The central issue is, which value system do you wish to base our society on-a Christian one, or a non-biblical, humanistic one?</PARA>
<PARA>Leaving aside the rather dubious claim that Australia was ever established on Christian values, the above is fairly typical of the type of material put out by the Logos Foundation in which there is a projection of this threatened conspiracy. I think it is time that Australians saw through this constant and destructive projection of enemies as a tactic to win support. I think this rejection is essential to support for our democratic institutions. Where such views are presented as Christian, I believe the Australian church, all the mainstream churches, ought to have the courage-as they have had-to expose the strategy for what it is; that is, a perversion of the Christian gospel. I think that those people, in all of the churches, who have worked in Australia for the poor, the needy, the oppressed and the sick would find this type of equating of Christianity with hatred to be the utter perversion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I get to the matter I want to talk on I will make a comment on the previous two speakers. First of all, I congratulate Senator Macklin on his excellent contribution exposing the Logos Association in Queensland for what it is. But I would also like to support the remarks of Senator Peter Baume about the situation occurring in Ethiopia. I have already, in the last couple of months, taken up with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) the need to prepare to provide additional aid to Ethiopia, Eritrea and the Horn of Africa because there is every evidence that there could be a calamitous drought in that area over the next few months, putting at risk more lives than were at risk in the dreadful drought of 1984-85.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I want to speak on today in this matters of public interest debate is something that may be considered similar to what Senator Macklin talked about, but in a different area. It concerns the activities of a fringe political group that is masquerading as something that it is not. I was quite surprised that two weeks ago I received on my desk a press release announcing that the Democratic Socialist Party had been formed in Australia. It was dated 11 a.m., 1 November. In the opening paragraph the press release said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Socialist Workers Party announced today that it has changed its name to Democratic Socialist Party. The name change was approved by a recent meeting of the SWP National Committee following a referendum of the membership which supported the change by a margin of six to one. </PARA>
<PARA>At the bottom of the press release it says:</PARA>
<PARA>For further information or interviews phone DSP National Secretary Jim Percy . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It then gives the telephone number. I must say that anybody who has shown any interest in the ideology of the fringe parties of the Left would recognise that this statement is an absolute fraud. There is no way that the Socialist Workers Party, after what it has been doing politically in Australia over the last decade, could now just suddenly call itself the Democratic Socialist Party and make itself out to be something quite different-particularly when one sees the influence and involvement of Mr Jim Percy, now calling himself National Secretary. I am sure that Senator Vallentine would recognise Jim Percy's name very rapidly because Mr Percy was the person who organised the infiltration of the Nuclear Disarmament Party at the time of the 1984 election which forced Senator Vallentine and other well-known people such as Mr Peter Garrett to resign. He made it quite clear that the Nuclear Disarmament Party had been infiltrated and taken over by supporters of the Socialist Workers Party and it was a classic Trotskyite policy of entryism. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that Mr Percy has realised that the Socialist Workers Party has absolutely no future in Australia-it has been identified for what it is-but is now looking at establishing a new party, or renaming the party to try to attract support on the basis of misleading people as to what the real function of his party is. In the full press statement Mr Percy talks about calling a conference next year, in January, the theme being `For a Green, Democratic and Socialist World'. The party will consider a new draft program and a revised constitution. The press release goes on to talk about the extraordinary events going on in eastern Europe, suggesting that bureaucratic socialism is coming to an end and therefore it is most appropriate for the Democratic Socialist Party to come into existence. </PARA>
<PARA> I just want to put it on record that I do not believe that anybody in Australia should be in any way misled. The Democratic Socialist Party name is an absolute fraud for Mr Percy's use. What I find particularly objectionable about the use of the democratic socialism philosophy is that in the opening sentence of the principles of the Australian Labor Party-and I am a member of that party-we declare ourselves to be a democratic socialist party. That has been our philosophical basis for 90-odd years. As a result of that philosophical basis we have been granted membership of the Socialist International, made up of all three democratic socialist, Labor and social democrat parties around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that Mr Percy hopes to attract some support by renaming the SWP as the Democratic Socialist Party. I think he has recognised that in the coming months, if not years, with the decline of bureaucratic socialism, of Stalinist communism in eastern Europe, many of those people who are demonstrating for democracy are saying that they do not want to go to full capitalism. They are using the phrase `democratic socialism', and I suspect that Mr Percy is trying to jump on the bandwagon and run with a name that I think will become increasingly popular in ideological terms in western Europe. Even in western Europe it was announced the other day that the Italian Communist Party will drop the `Communist' from its name, and it has applied to seek affiliation to the Socialist International. That is an historic announcement by the Italian Communist Party. It recognises that its survival in a western democratic system will mean that it is going to have to change some of its philosophies. But it is doing that quite openly and without the subterfuge of this very small minority that Mr Percy represents. I must say, when he says the name change was carried by a margin of 6 to 1, I suspect only seven people voted in the proverbial telephone box to get that result. </PARA>

<PARA>PRESS RELEASE</PARA>
<PARA>Democratic Socialist Party Announced</PARA>
<PARA>11am, November 1</PARA>
<PARA> The Socialist Workers Party announced today that it has changed its name to Democratic Socialist Party. The name change was approved by a recent meeting of the SWP National Committee following a referendum of the membership which supported the change by a margin of six to one. </PARA>
<PARA> The name change is only one aspect of a comprehensive renovation process that will culminate in an effective relaunching of the party at a national conference in January. </PARA>
<PARA> The theme of the January conference will be For a Green, Democratic and Socialist World and it will consider a new draft program and a revised constitution for the DSP. </PARA>
<PARA> It will also consider new policy documents on environmental protection and other pressing concerns. The environmental document, titled Socialism and Human Survival, will offer a detailed analysis of the environmental crisis and the relevance of socialist solutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The national secretary of the Democratic Socialist Party, Jim Percy, said today:</PARA>
<PARA> ``The renovation process we are undertaking is motivated by both international and domestic considerations. On one level there is the need for urgent global action to prevent a nuclear holocaust or an environmental catastrophe. </PARA>
<PARA> ``Secondly we see the need to defend and extend the democratic rights of people in this country against the continuing trend towards monopolisation of political and economic power. </PARA>
<PARA> ``And thirdly, we are convinced socialism offers the only secure and lasting solution to nuclear and environmental threats and to desperate problems of social injustice that plague the capitalist world.''</PARA>
<PARA> Percy said the DSP's concern for the environment and democratic rights is widely shared, but its ongoing commitment to socialism may not be so well understood:</PARA>
<PARA> ``Some recent developments in the socialist world-in countries like Poland, Hungary, East Germany and China-have led many to believe that socialism is about to make its exit from the historical stage. We reject that view. In fact, we are very excited about the worldwide renovation of socialism that is taking its cue from the introduction of perestroika and glasnost in the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> ``There is a crisis of bureaucratic socialism and a firm rejection of the approach that has led to things like the crimes of Stalin and this year's massacre in Beijing. The DSP identifies fully with the reform movement initiated by the Gorbachev leadership in the Soviet Union and we now see similar movements spreading throughout Eastern Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> ``Our view is that we are witnessing the emergence of a new, more democratic form of socialism and our name change is aimed at reinforcing our identification with this trend.''</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I want to inform the Senate of my experience in what has been a most disturbing performance by the Headmistresses Association of the Independent Girls Schools in Victoria. Nearly 50 years ago the headmistresses were given a very valuable property, Invergowrie, which is now possibly worth $10m although the value is difficult to estimate accurately in the present confused market. The headmistresses were given the property by the McPherson family, who have been remarkable benefactors of education in Victoria. They gave the Emily McPherson College of domestic economy, the Engineering School at Swinburne Institute of Technology and, in a different field, the Jessie McPherson wing of the Queen Victoria Hospital.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My particular concern is what is happening to the donation the family made of their family home, Invergowrie, an historic building in the inner Melbourne suburb of Hawthorn, to the Headmistresses Association of the Independent Girls Schools. This gift was made nearly 50 years ago, partly so the headmistresses could run a homecraft hostel designed to fill a large gap in the education system as it then was, that is teaching girls how to run homes economically, but more importantly, to preserve the historic Invergowrie homestead. The house itself was built in 1846 and is by any standards one of the most important historic buildings in Victoria. It was, for instance, the site of the signing of the Deed of Separation of Victoria from New South Wales. Even more important, it has almost three acres of parklike surroundings, including a tree which is a remarkable Aboriginal relic. In this tree one can see clearly where the Aborigines have carved out a canoe. By any standards, the preservation of this historic building and its surroundings should be of great importance to the entire Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> Here, Mr Acting Deputy President, I should reveal a personal interest. My wife was a McPherson, the daughter of one of the donors of Invergowrie. This has, of course, the advantage that I am well informed of what went on and what the family intentions were. It must be accepted that the concept of a homecraft hostel, teaching girls how to run homes, is no longer viable. Girls who until the 1970s would have attended Invergowrie now go to university. Whether or not they learn there how to run homes efficiently could be a matter of dispute. Whatever the facts are about that, the fact is now that people are no longer going to come to a homecraft hostel to be taught how to run a home. </PARA>
<PARA> But that is not the end of the matter. This building and its surroundings were given to the headmistresses, as far as the donors were concerned, in trust to preserve it for the community. Now it is to be sold without any covenants at all. I do not want now to go through the saga of the court case, of whether it was or was not a trust, or what financial benefits would flow to the headmistresses from the sale, but I will have more to say on this matter if the sale actually goes through. The good news is that the headmistresses are apparently seriously considering an innovative use for this property rather than its sale. The suggestion is that it should become a centre concerned with research, administration and special training resources for the pursuit of excellence in the field of serious music. Its aims could perhaps be likened to those of the Australian Institute of Sport, which works alongside already established bodies in its field. The project is the brainchild of Mr Max Cooke, reader at the Faculty of Music at Melbourne University. I have seen the costings for this project and they seem realistic and feasible. If this project could be brought off it would achieve the twin objectives of preserving the historic Invergowrie Homestead, for which the headmistresses have a moral duty, and at the same time making a notable contribution to culture in Australia. The matter is urgent. The sale of this property is scheduled for next Tuesday. I hope the headmistresses will be able to see their way, and their duty, clearly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports the Judicial and Statutory Officers Remuneration Legislation Amendment Bill. Its purpose is to increase the salaries of Federal Court judges in accordance with the Remuneration Tribunal's decision of June 1989. Those changes would apply retrospectively to 1 March 1989. It provides for some increases in travel allowances, enables Family Court judges to receive the same remuneration as Federal Court judges, as per the Government's decision of 13 July 1989, and amends the Remuneration Tribunal Act to give the Tribunal the power to determine rather than recommend judicial salaries subject to parliamentary disallowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I indicated, we support this increase of Federal Court judges' salaries. We are concerned when Federal judges' salaries fall significantly below those of State judges. We understand that, particularly in relation to Queensland, there is considerable disparity. We recognise that salaries must be such to attract hopefully the best from within practice. Although it might be difficult to provide strictly competing salaries, they must not be such as to deter good people seeking to contribute to a national well-being on the Bench. We have been concerned in the past, and I think I spoke on the equivalent of this Bill a year or two ago, about this problem which had been raised in a number of legal conferences by very senior members of the legal profession. So we support the fact that salaries are being updated somewhat. The other changes we also support, particularly the change regarding the Remuneration Tribunal so that it makes a determination. It seems to us to be a further step towards depoliticising those decisions, and that is in the best interests of the whole system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Hill for his contribution to the debate. As he has indicated, the Judicial and Statutory Officers Remuneration Legislation Amendment Bill implements increases in remuneration for members of the Federal judiciary. The Government was unable to accept the substantial salary increase recommended for the judiciary in the Remuneration Tribunal's 1988 review. Members of the Tribunal were asked by the Government to prepare a special report on appropriate remuneration of the judiciary in the current wage fixing context. Their report recommended that an inequity of remuneration between Federal and State court judges be rectified by the granting of a 16 per cent increase. Also, the Tribunal recommended that the August 1988 national wage case increase of 3 per cent and $10 a week be applied and the expense of office allowance be absorbed into salaries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Tribunal will in future be empowered to determine judicial remuneration rather than make recommendations as at present in respect of judges and judicial office holders. This will bring the setting of judicial remuneration into line with the setting of remuneration for all other officers within the Tribunal's jurisdiction except Ministers. As is the case for these other officers, determinations will be subject to disallowance by either House of Parliament. A further examination of judicial salaries will be undertaken by the Tribunal in light of the August 1989 national wage case decision. The review will also assess the appropriateness of the relativities of remuneration between Federal Court judges and a number of statutory office holders.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims Bill amends the Navigation Act of 1912 and the Admiralty Act of 1988. The Navigation Act of 1912 implements the 1957 International Convention relating to the Limitation of the Liability of Owners of Seagoing Ships. This convention was agreed to in Brussels many decades ago. The 1957 convention replaced rules which were initiated in 1924. The Bill before the Senate today will enable Australia to become a party to the updated 1976 convention, known as the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims. This convention came into force internationally in December 1986.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the years there has been considerable debate about the need for a limitation of damages. It is considered that a limitation is necessary because of the potential economic effect of just a single accident involving a number of deaths. That concern is, of course, demonstrated by the Herald of Free Enterprise disaster in Belgium where tragically 193 persons lost their lives. The decision to accede to this 1976 convention was made at the 75th meeting of the Australian Transport Advisory Council in 1987. Acceding to the convention, Australia joins the United Kingdom, France, Japan, the Federal Republic of Germany, Liberia and the Scandinavian countries. The convention is contained in schedule 1 of this Bill. Notably, this convention will not apply to ships of the armed forces of a foreign power, according to clause 7. </PARA>
<PARA> I would just like to take a few minutes to look at the differences between the two conventions. Firstly, there is a difference in the amount available for compensation. This convention makes available $6.1m for personal claims, $2.7m for property claims and, if applicable, $29m for passenger claims for an accident involving a ship of 10,000 tonnes gross. Under the current or 1957 convention the total amount available would be only $3.22m. In addition, this convention does not permit State parties to exclude damage to harbour works, bases and waterways and aids to navigation from liability. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a considerable difference in the two conventions as to the behaviour or conduct which will bar a shipowner from the right to limit his liability. There is a change to the associated burden of proof provisions. Currently, the burden of proof lies with the person seeking to establish the right to limit liability. Under the 1976 convention, which this Bill seeks to have Australia become a party to, this burden is on the claimant. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to look briefly at the main provisions of the convention. Article 1 of the convention allows shipowners to limit their liability. Article 2 covers the claims that will be covered by the convention-personal injury, death, property damage, delay, breach of contract or the removal of a wreck or cargo. Article 3 states the exceptions. It states that claims in respect of salvage, oil pollution or nuclear damage will not be covered. Article 4 provides that a person will not be able to take advantage of the limit if the loss results from an act or omission committed with the intent to cause the loss knowing that such loss would probably result. Chapter 2 deals with the limits of liability based on weight of the ship and categories of claims, chapter 3 provides for the establishment of limitation of funds, and chapter 4 covers the application of the convention. Article 19 allows for the renunciation of the convention a year after it has entered into force, by the lodgment of an instrument to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, the Opposition supports the Bill. Before closing, I would just like to reiterate the comments of my colleagues in another place-that the situation of regularising claims with respect to the aviation industry still lags behind. We would hope that this Government will move soon to bring this situation more up to date-if it has time before losing the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I have a supplementary question. With reference to the latter part of the Minister's answer, which referred to the Government's expectation that the situation would improve in the second half of the financial year, is the Minister saying that in fact the Budget forecast is on track? Given the level of the figures so far, does this not indicate that the Government is expecting a severe economic slowdown to help bring about the sort of monthly current account deficits that would be required to meet the estimate? In other words, as month by month-and we are now in the fourth month-these very large figures come out, if the Government is saying that its estimate is still on track, that suggests a very severe downturn next year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 6 November I announced that the Government had decided to appoint a team to evaluate the national energy research, development and demonstration program. I have now appointed a consortium consisting of the Centre for Technology and Social Change at the University of Wollongong, Energy Policy and Analysis Pty Ltd of Canberra and the science policy research centre of Griffith University to undertake the review for me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators will know that the national energy research, development and demonstration program was set up in 1978 to meet the Commonwealth's energy policy objectives through selective support of energy research, development and demonstration projects. The purpose of the review is to report on the extent to which the key objectives of the program have been achieved and what steps can be taken to overcome any deficiencies that might be identified. In particular, the team will look at the processes used to effect better program delivery and the development of cost competitive technologies within reasonable time frames-and by that I mean to look at the conversion of liquefied natural gas to a transport fuel, at the prospects for coal liquefaction, at the prospects for shale oil in Australia, at wind, solar, tidal, biomass and geothermal renewable energy technologies to see whether we are meeting our objectives across all of those frontiers.</PARA>
<PARA> The survey will also look at the transfer of technology to prospective users. By that I mean the marketability of technologies that might be discovered or developed, what their market applications might be, and how one would popularise alternative energy forms in ordinary community consumption of energy. It will also evaluate the effectiveness of the current program. My angle there is to make sure that taxpayers' money spent on this program is efficiently targeted.</PARA>
<PARA> Today I announced new research grants totalling $18.3m to 94 projects. The biggest beneficiary was the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, which obtained a grant of $3.36m for research on and analysis of energy. That brings to $250m the total amount allocated by the Government since the program commenced. The 1989 annual report of the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council noted that the program received a high level of collaboration, so the $250m I have referred to is only the Government component. Often that constitutes but a third of the total expenditure. Some $57.9m was committed to the program from all sources, with $30m, or 52 per cent, coming from private enterprise and $14.5m, or 25 per cent, being appropriately directed by the Commonwealth.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of questions have been asked by Senator Stone. I will try to deal with them one by one. The fact that Mr Miyamoto has made that statement of Nomura's intentions and the advice which it may be giving clients is not relevant in itself. Any substantial financial house anywhere in the world, particularly in Japan, may well do that in respect of countries such as the United States, Australia and a number of European countries. Lest there be any special Queensland-type concern expressed in Senator Stone's question about levels of Japanese investment, let me say that Japan is not, in aggregate terms, in any way the largest investor in Australia. The United Kingdom remains, in aggregate terms, the largest investor in Australia. The United States remains the second largest investor; Japan remains the third. It is not in the least surprising: Japan currently being, I think it is fair to say, the richest country in the world and the country with the most available investment funds in the world; a country which has been able to buy banks in the United States, the Rockefeller Centre and Warner Bros-all the symbols of the more successful period of America's past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact that Nomura intends to buy assets of the kind described by Senator Stone is in some ways encouraging. I would have thought that Senator Stone would have been aware of the pattern of Japanese investment in Australia in the last few years. It has been highly directed towards the tourist industry, for very logical reasons, as predictions of Japanese tourists coming to Australia are very high as are predictions of tourism from North Asia generally. That is a natural and sensible investment for Japanese. They have made the same sorts of investments in Hawaii but to a much greater extent. I would welcome some further Japanese investment in parts of the Australian manufacturing sector for reasons which Senator Stone might know about, and, if I do not get in first, interject about. Up until now that investment in a number of industries has not been forthcoming. The fact that Nomura Securities says that it will now be investing is an encouraging sign about structural change in Australia. Senator Stone used the somewhat emotive expression `Australian assets held by foreigners'.</PARA>

I have never heard him objecting in this place to British investment in Australia or making the suggestion that there is something wrong with British investment in this country. He now makes the point about particular countries that he mentions. As to Nomura Securities' statement of intention and advice to its clients possibly putting upward pressure on the Australian dollar, I do not think that anything will happen with precipitate haste as a result of an article appearing on the front page of the Australian quoting Mr Miyamoto about these matters. Of course, if it does cause upward pressure on the Australian dollar, that would be cause for concern. But I do not think one can draw those conclusions from the statement made by Mr Miyamoto on behalf of his company.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce for his most informative answer. First, I refer to his reference to what he called the `special Queensland-type concern'. I took it from that that he was referring to the fact that the question was based upon a press statement by a representative of the largest Japanese securities firm. Will the Minister convey his lack of concern on that matter to the Leader of the Opposition and, indeed, the Australian Labor Party in Queensland, Mr Goss, who has recently been uttering the most inflammatory statements on that subject during the course of the Queensland election campaign? Indeed, he has taken out public advertisements indicating that he would forbid and ban such investments if we were to have the signally unfortunate instance of him being elected on Saturday week. Secondly, during the course of the Minister's remarks he made a rather deliberate misrepresentation of my question by referring to the phrase `assets held by foreigners'. He implied that I was referring to the fact that these assets are to be held by Japanese. Will the Minister confirm that the question contained no such suggestion and that any such suggestion has been derived only from his vivid imagination?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that all honourable senators will join me in deploring the brutal assassination of President Muawad in Beirut overnight. I take this opportunity, as the Prime Minister has just done in the House of Representatives, to extend Australia's deepest sympathy to the wife and family of the late President and of the others killed in this appalling and barbaric act. Mr Muawad was elected President at a session of the Lebanese Parliament on 5 November, which also ratified the Ta'if agreement. Australia welcomed that agreement as a breakthrough in the search for a peaceful and negotiated solution to the situation in Lebanon. Mr Muawad was elected to the Lebanese Parliament in 1957 and served in three governments between 1960 and 1982. Throughout his time in public office, Mr Muawad was a firm advocate of Christian and Muslim detente and of Lebanese sovereignty. President Muawad, whose election attracted widespread international support, did not underestimate the enormous task that lay ahead of him. In his inaugural address he called on Lebanese to join the peace and reconciliation process under the umbrella of equal opportunities, justice and equality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a very sad irony that President Muawad was assassinated on Lebanon's national day. The Governor-General of Australia had sent a message of congratulations to the President in which he expressed the hope that his election and ratification of the Ta'if agreement would prove to be historic steps in the return of peace and prosperity for Lebanon.</PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, the death of President Muawad is a tragic blow to the recent efforts of the Arab League and the Lebanese Parliament to secure political reforms and end the years of senseless fighting in Lebanon. Our immediate concern is that the ceasefire may end and that this will lead to a further round of intercommunal violence and result in yet more suffering for the Lebanese people. So, yet again, we call on all parties in Lebanon to refrain from such violent responses and to avoid any actions which will raise further tensions in Lebanon, and in particular any action which will see a resumption of fighting with the attendant horrifying loss of life and destruction of property which has plagued Lebanon for the last 14 years.</PARA>
<PARA> About the only encouragement to be derived in this depressing and distressing situation in Lebanon comes from reports that members of the Lebanese Parliament have been called to meet to elect a new President. We simply hope that that will occur and that some normality can be restored to the situation. Finally, we urge all parties to support a continuation of the process agreed to at Ta'if and to cooperate with the new President in achieving the objective of national reconciliation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I point out for the benefit of Senator Hill that the matter raised by Senator Colston in his question has been of concern to the Government. Judging by the jovial look on Senator Hill's face, he probably has not thought about this problem that people in the community have in terms of barriers to participation in and access to government programs and, particularly in this case, social security programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The recent press reports to which Senator Colston referred concern a study conducted by the Department of Social Security into ways in which that Department can better communicate with people who have literacy difficulties. The study has been addressing those problems. The main aim of the study is to fit in very much with the policy objectives of the Department and the Government in addressing this question of barriers to participation, in this case poor literacy skills as well as barriers because of language skills.</PARA>
<PARA> The two questions that the Government is addressing are, first, to find out whether many people are missing out on their entitlements because of poor literacy skills and, secondly, how the Government can address and redress that barrier. One approach adopted by the Government is investigation of the development of symbols to help people with literacy problems to find their way through the social security system. As I said, this matter is under examination and this study is part of that examination.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has recognised that literacy and language problems can be a barrier and, to that extent, over recent years we have implemented programs to try to address these particular problems. Basically there has been a five-pronged response by the Government which is geared towards eradicating barriers because of literacy and language based problems.</PARA>
<PARA> In the first instance, staff training packages relating to both client contact and client awareness include issues associated with clients who do have literacy problems. Second, a major area that the Government has addressed is those who have poor English language skills and, to that extent, the telephone interpreter program which was introduced in January this year has already assisted 40,000 Australians by way of direct contact with them and helping them through the social security system. The third aspect is to use new technology. The Government has used this technology to simplify and improve access and to address communications in plain English language. The fourth part is the special awareness programs that have been conducted from time to time. A recent one which has been quite successful was the program geared towards family allowance supplements and particularly the television campaign to ensure that people have access to their rights and benefits. Lastly, special attention has been given to Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders who have been assisted through a special interpreter service in their parts of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is concerned that literacy and language barriers do not stop people from having access to government services. The study to which Senator Colston referred is geared towards building on, first, the recognition of the problem and, second, our actions so far, and it is very much part of the Government's intention to address questions of barriers to participation in the community.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have now obtained for myself a copy of the peace plan for the south-east forests and I say at the outset that I welcome any contribution by any group to work constructively to try to resolve what is clearly a matter of community controversy in the south-east. In that light I am pleased to look at the peace plan. I should say, though, that officially I have not received a copy and no letter has been written to me enclosing the plan. I was not consulted about it prior to its being drawn up. No request has been made of me to meet and discuss it, and no forum has been suggested to thrash out a peace settlement because of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That being said, I did obtain a copy through one of my staff and I can say of the plan that, if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then to a large extent the Government is flattered by the content of this plan. Many of the proposals in the plan go to how better to utilise the existing forest resource, how to add to the forest resource by the use of commercially viable plantations, how to add value to the product of the forest as well and how to offer long and enduring employment for people employed in the timber industry in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA> Those objectives mesh with the studies that I have commissioned into the flora and fauna properties of the south-east forest, the flitchmill study that I referred to yesterday to extract maximum sawmillable material from logs, no matter what the condition of those logs, the study on the better use of small and round wood-wood that is normally regarded as waste material in the forest-the study on the value added to the sawmill product that comes out of sawmills and the plantation study that I announced yesterday. Many of the aspects of the report deal with those elements. Therefore, I find nothing at all offensive and a lot to compliment the report about because of the objectives it expresses in that sense.</PARA>
<PARA> However, one of the problems that I apprehend about the peace plan is that it argues for an effective cessation of cutting in National Estate areas and I do not believe it would be possible to obtain a balanced outcome in the south-east forest if that condition were implemented. I say that for the reason that the Australian Heritage Commission makes decisions on what forest is to be regarded as National Estate and what is not, and it does so on heritage properties of the forest and not on economic criteria. I do not wish to interfere with the heritage evaluation of the Australian Heritage Commission, but simply because a forest is declared as one for the National Estate, does not mean to say-when one balances objectively the competing demands for that forest-that the heritage value-if there are no prudent and feasible alternatives to finding other resources-ought to be the predominant value. Those questions are to be examined exhaustively.</PARA>
<PARA> The final point I make is that of recent days, in a form of shuttle diplomacy between conservation and industry groups, I have been endeavouring to put in place the missing last piece of the jigsaw, a community consultative group in which unions, industry, conservation groups and the community in the south-east forest area can sit together and try to work through what are admittedly thorny difficulties about resolving conflict there and to do so in such a way as to reach some agreement that is enduring. I find that I have now been mired down in definitional questions of what the terms of reference of a group might be and, therefore, I will now be embarking upon a proposal that I will discuss with various interest groups by simply calling a meeting of all of them and putting on the agenda for that meeting for discussion, not a terms of reference issue at all, but the reports from various consultancies that I have commissioned and the interim report of the flora and fauna study which is due on 11 December. I would add to that list-if it is the wish of the conservation movement-the proposed peace plan and invite industry, unions or the community to include any proposals that they wish to put forward to include them. Without terms of reference we could simply embark upon a seriatim discussion of those issues.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator REYNOLDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to Senator Child's question, I would have to say that it is local government's responsibility to determine what is appropriate use of resources. The circumstances will vary from place to place. Councils are being encouraged to develop more effective management skills and techniques for assessing the most efficient arrangements for the management of their human and capital resources. Councils are getting involved in a range of entrepreneurial activities. They are also getting involved in using means such as tendering for contracts in areas such as land development, construction material haulage, hiring out under-utilised resources or pooling of resources, services and equipment between councils; others are taking on entrepreneurial activities such as the construction of office buildings. They are adding valuable revenue to their operations. Councils that get involved in such activities should ensure that they have the best possible advice. Through our local government development program we have funded a number of projects to ensure that local councils are familiar with the pitfalls that could come about from moving into an entrepreneurial area where they do not have the necessary expertise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To come to the specific area of Senator Childs's question, the press article stated that Bankstown City Council was considering a unique plan to hire out idle plant and equipment and staff to maximise the use of these resources and so increase revenue. I comment that it really is not a unique proposal. Councils have been involved in this type of activity for some time, particularly in the more remote areas of Australia. For instance, the Hay shire is sharing resources in the road construction and maintenance area, which has led to significant savings. Bombala Shire Council operates a number of quarries supplying aggregate and other road-base materials to users such as other councils and road construction authorities. In addition, the council also hires out plant and equipment on a fee-for-service basis.</PARA>
<PARA> In Tasmania, the Bruny Island municipality is actually an agent for the State Government. I know that Senator Bjelke-Petersen and others will be familiar with the fact that, similarly, that occurs in Queensland, as I am sure it does in a number of other States. One has to remember that in many parts of Australia councils are the only bodies that have, in particular, the capital resources for undertaking some of the specialised work under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> So I think my answer to Senator Childs would be yes, it is appropriate, but it is important that councils get the best possible advice and learn from those councils that have already been involved in entrepreneurial activities so that they undertake such entry in a way that is appropriate and does not become a misuse of ratepayers' dollars.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I refer the Minister to reports early last month that two loads of Californian strawberries imported into Australia in August were infected with exotic virus-carrying insects and escaped quarantine detection and that the insects were not detected until routine testing for pesticides by a Queensland Department of Primary Industries entomologist, who discovered that they were rife with live thrips, bugs and mites. As the thrip, if unchecked, is capable of causing immense viral damage, not only to Australia's $280m tomato industry but also to potatoes, eggplants and other similar crops, what action has the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service taken to ensure that insects in the next such shipment from the United States, due in May, do not go undetected and survive fumigation? What guarantees can the inspection service give the rural community that its ability to protect horticultural producers from potential disasters is not in doubt?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can inform Senator Bjelke-Petersen that the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service is very efficient in guaranteeing that the importation of produce into Australia is done at minimum risk to the Australian farming, agricultural and, in this case, horticultural communities. I might say I am becoming somewhat agitated at the fact that there is developing in this country a debate which is really about the fact that Australia is advocating free trade in the world and is setting itself up as an example of free trade. There is a debate from some producers who fear the impact of competition on their particular commodity because of an opening in the Australian market and who are using argument about the effectiveness of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to mask their real concern. Thus, they are attacking the efficiency and standards of the inspection service when their real beef is facing a wider degree of competition than they would normally face domestically.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, I can go to the question of Californian strawberries. During August of this year two lots of Californian strawberries were purchased by the Queensland strawberry growers at Flemington markets after they had been released from quarantine. Some insects-a maximum of three per fruit-were found under sepals, which are the leafy petals at the base of the fruit, and included western flower thrips, which have not been recorded in Australia before. As a consequence, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service suspended imports of strawberries from all sources on 13 October and reviewed the inspection and treatment procedures. Since then approval has been given to import strawberries from New Zealand, subject to stringent inspection and treatment requirements. Insects are thought to have survived because not enough fumigant penetrated to insects under the sepals. However, these insects may have died before completing their development.</PARA>
<PARA> Industry and the press have suggested that, because of the damage it can cause and because of its ability to transmit viral diseases, there would be significant economic consequences to horticulture if western flower thrip became established. Their claims can be considered as sensationalist and, in most instances, erroneous. Thrips are plant pests but they are not as devastating as has been suggested. There are already species of thrips present in Australia attacking crops that western flower thrips might infest. Consequently, there may be little additional cost associated with control. Although present in New Zealand, this species is not considered a serious pest of any cultivated crop and has never been found infesting strawberries. Western flower thrip is a vector of tomato spotted wilt virus, which is distributed widely in Australia and transmitted by thrips that are established here. No new strains of the virus are likely to be imported with introduced thrips.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Resources. Is the Minister aware of the British Government's attempt to privatise the Central Electricity Generating Board of Great Britain? Is he aware that the Government has been unable to sell Britain's nuclear power stations because banks and financial institutions have judged that the cost of decommissioning nuclear power stations will exceed their lifetime economic benefit? Is he aware that the present Energy Secretary of the United Kingdom Government, Mr John Wakeham, has admitted that past administrations had made false claims regarding the economic viability of nuclear electricity? Do these recent revelations alter his perception. or that of his Government, of Australia's role as a supplier of uranium to the nuclear industry? Do they not cast doubt on the viability of uranium mining in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3169" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="RESOURCES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of that debate. In February this year I met with the then United Kingdom Secretary of State for Energy, Cecil Parkinson, and discussed with him at some length the details of the proposed privatisation of the Central Electricity Generating Board in the United Kingdom. I note that since that time he has been replaced by John Wakeham.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the second part of the honourable senator's question, it may be the case that financial institutions or banks have had something to do with the British Government's decision to withhold from privatisation the nuclear facilities, but I understood that the primary reason was that the magnox series of nuclear power generator had come to the end of its commissioned life cycle and the cost of decommissioning was considerably higher than anticipated. In fact, it had not yet been quantified. For that reason, the British Government-and, as I say, the banks may have had an influential role in this matter, but I am not aware of it-decided not to privatise its nuclear power generating facilities.</PARA>
<PARA> The third part of the honourable senator's question related to the current Secretary of State for Energy, John Wakeham, and various false claims. The debate about privatisation of energy provision in the United Kingdom has been a very hot debate which, in terms of the assessments made, depends on different variables from time to time, such as the level of interest rates and costs. Various estimates have been associated with things of that nature. It seems that, on recent evidence, there is some credibility to suggestions that the cost of nuclear power generation is three times the cost of coal fired power generation, if one includes in the equation the likely decommissioning costs of the existing nuclear power generators. For that reason, these considerations must be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA> Having said that of the British nuclear power generating capacity, I should also say that it appears-and I do not have absolute figures on this point, but it is as a result of information and evidence-that the French, Japanese and German nuclear power generating facilities are more efficient than those of the British and the cost equation that applies in Britain in relation to nuclear versus coal probably does not apply in those other countries. I think that the honourable senator's question raises an interesting point which Senator Richardson has placed on the agenda for debate in Australia; that is, if it is true that nuclear power generating is more costly, in a greenhouse conscious world is that a cost the community would be prepared to pay for the prevention of emission of greenhouse gases through coal fired power generation? I think that in the past Senator Richardson has had something to say about this matter and, in terms of an environmental question, it is a moot point and one that deserves debate.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the final part of the honourable senator's question about Australian uranium, we are a cost efficient and low cost supplier of uranium. It is for individual countries to make up their mind as to their energy mix and we should not editorialise to them on this matter. I believe that the market will decide whether the Australian mining industry is viable. That matter should not be decided by Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Will the Minister investigate my implicit assertion that it is the case that the British Government has failed to sell its nuclear power stations because the banks and financial institutions have simply refused to provide financial assistance to those companies that might have bought those nuclear power stations and, indeed, that, as a consequence, the British Government has had to recreate an electricity generating facility which will be totally government owned and will own the nuclear power stations? Finally, if it is true that that is the position with respect to the economic efficiency of nuclear power, does the Minister not consider that the Australian Government should play a role in determining whether we do or do not open further nuclear facilities, particularly uranium mines, in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is also directed to Senator Evans in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications. Is the Minister aware of yet another exploding crisis in the broadcasting arena, namely, the fact that Imparja Television Pty Ltd, the Central Australian remote commercial television service, has not made any payments on its own account in respect of leasing costs for its Aussat transponder since June last year? Is it a fact that similar 30-watt transponders are available internationally for about $500,000 and the Indonesian Palapa satellite is currently available for $700,000, yet Aussat's going rate is $4.2m per year, due entirely to its crippling debt burden, which is a direct result of the Government's refusal to allow Aussat to earn a decent living in competition with Telecom Australia's massive monopoly? Is the Government aware that more than four months ago Mr Willis said on an Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio program that the Government had received an auditor's report on Imparja and that it would be necessary to make a decision `in the very near future'? In view of the fact that the South Australian Government continues to welsh on its firm commitment to make funds available because it is allegedly waiting for Mr Willis to do something, can the Minister explain how much longer this latest intolerable example of ministerial incompetence will be allowed to continue?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3171" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is fully conscious of and is sympathetic to the economic difficulties which are currently faced by remote commercial television service (RCTS) operators, including the particular circumstances of Imparja. To describe those circumstances and difficulties as constituting an exploding financial crisis, however, is a bit of vulgar rhetorical overkill of the kind that we have come to expect from Senator Alston. The Minister, Mr Willis, met with Imparja representatives this morning. He had wide-ranging discussions on the future options for Imparja and its financial position. The options for providing additional commercial television services to the Northern Territory, South Australia and those parts of New South Wales and Victoria not included in the present equalisation plan were discussed, including a possible role for Imparja in this respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A departmental discussion paper reviewing RCTS is expected to be released shortly for public comment. The governments in Queensland, Western Australia, the Northern Territory and South Australia will be consulted. The Northern Territory Government, with which I would have thought the Opposition might have had some affinity, is known to be very strongly supportive of Imparja's continuance in this respect. The Government will address Imparja's situation generally in the context of the RCTS review, which is scheduled to take place early next year. The Hawke Government is, of course, responsible for establishing the RCTS services. It was a major initiative to give remote people their first commercial television services. I remind Senator Alston and the Senate that the Government was also responsible for giving Australian Broadcasting Corporation television and radio to remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA> It is the case that providing remote broadcasting services is economically difficult due to the high cost of satellite transponders and small fragmented populations. That is an endemic phenomenon of which we are all aware. It is not a new discovery of Senator Alston's. The Government is committed to doing everything possible to meet the communications needs of remote communities. We commend Imparja for the very high quality service it provides for Central Australia, and all available options to deal with this situation will be considered to ensure the continuation of the remote broadcasting services.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This morning we had the opportunity in the consideration of appropriations to look at the programs relating to the purchasing and sales policies of the Government as administered by the Department of Administrative Services. As I pointed out in the debate this morning, the expansion of the Commonwealth Government into the field of retail sales should cause major concern to everyone, particularly those people living in remote and regional parts of Australia. This policy document which has been tabled today entitled Commonwealth Procurement Policy also has the words at the top of the first page `Better Buying', `Purchasing Reform Group' and `Service is Our Business'. Obviously, the `perestroikaing' of the Hawke Labor Government is now choosing to move into so many other areas of activity that are normally the prerogative of small business. This Government has been well known for so long as one that seeks to interfere and centralise all its activities. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking briefly at the various headings within this report relating to the purchasing principles, one sees the headings `Open and Effective Competition'; `Ethical Behaviour and Fair Dealing'; `Planning Procurement'; `Professionalism'; `Common-use Purchasing Arrangements'; `Other Centralised Purchasing Arrangements'; and `Related Government Policies'. There is then a series of headings relating to `National Preference Agreement'; `Offsets'; `Partnerships for Development'; `Consideration of Community Groups'; and `Administrative Responsibilities'. </PARA>
<PARA> The point concerning me is that the Commonwealth Government is choosing to use its period contract for purchasing and expanding not only these facilities to various government departments, et cetera, but is now basically providing a facility for any agency which receives Commonwealth Government funding, in effect, to get onto the Government nipple of government purchasing contracts. This is going to have a very significant impact and import in regional and remote parts of Australia. It is not just going to result in better prices for organisations, but because of the additional surcharges and the range in which it will impact, particularly in the small communities of outback Australia, there will be serious consequences to small business and to so many areas of traditional operation. </PARA>
<PARA> In a letter from the Department of Administrative Services to various agencies of the Commonwealth-and I use that word `agencies' in the very broad sense-it is interesting to note that the Department is touting for business in the areas of vehicles of all types, office furniture and equipment, personal computers, domestic furniture, refrigerators, washing machines, room air- conditioners, office requisites and fresh, frozen and tinned foodstuffs. So it is quite easy to see that the Commonwealth Government is now seeking not just to be a provider of services that are so traditional but also to enter the open marketplace with what is already being adequately and properly provided by many important pioneering businesses throughout the remote and regional parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The major changes to government purchasing were certainly flagged in a press release from the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr West, on 23 November 1988. It is only recently that the Department has chosen to become aggressive in this particular area. As I mentioned, certainly in the Northern Territory, it has come to my attention that traders are now beginning to feel and see the consequences of these financial changes. Whether it is the supply of spare parts in the motor vehicle industry or in office supplies and other areas, business is certainly going to be affected. I know that the Northern Territory Confederation of Industry, the Small Business Association and the Motor Traders Association of the Northern Territory have all expressed major concern, and certainly they have been given fobbed-off answers by the Federal member for the Northern Territory, Mr Warren Snowdon. This report has major consequences for small business throughout Australia, particularly if the Northern Territory is an example. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I would like to make some comments regarding the paper entitled Commonwealth Procurement Policy: Better Buying. It was by chance that this morning I heard my colleague Senator Tambling mention this particular issue during the appropriations debate. When I heard him I felt that he must have had it wrong. I did not believe that anyone in his right senses could actually do to small business what this Government is trying to do with this Commonwealth procurement policy. In essence, what this policy will do is close many country and regional towns down. It will be devastating to small business. It shows no thought whatsoever and shows that this Government has no understanding of or feeling for small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the letter that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) has put out, he points out that more than 3,000 government employees work in purchasing and related activities to get the best prices. Three thousand public servants, funded by the taxpayers of Australia, have set out to compete against private enterprise in Australia, using $8 billion of purchasing power against the individual traders of this nation. This is a most serious and devastating policy. It is going to have the most serious consequences for small business. This Government has got to withdraw this policy and examine what in effect will happen if people can purchase cars, hardware and food from a central office controlled by government paid public servants, bypassing the retail traders, the chains of distribution set up throughout this nation. It is now feasible for any government funded or semi-government department, local government or any organisation funded by any government department to bypass the petrol stations, service stations, food industry distribution points and motor vehicle distribution points and buy from a centrally located place in Brisbane, Melbourne or Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has to understand what will happen to those small towns. The Red Cross, the Blue Nursing Service, kindergartens, schools, local government departments, boy scouts and so on would be able to avoid purchasing through the normal points of sale. I challenge Mr Barry Jones, the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, to stand up for small business and to re-examine the Commonwealth procurement policy and the effects that it will have on all small business people in Australia. If Mr Jones is not prepared to re-examine this policy and take it back to Cabinet, he does not deserve to represent the small business people of Australia. Small business people pay about 60 per cent of the tax paid by this nation and they provide most of the jobs. The policy is another example of the Government's absolute lack of understanding of what the small business community provides for this nation and it is just not good enough. The policy has to be re-examined. I challenge Mr Jones to take it back to Cabinet and make a special representation on behalf of the small business community of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>Looking at the Affirmative Action Agency's annual report for 1988-89, one should recognise first of all that this is the mechanism whereby private enterprise reports annually to the Agency on its implementation of affirmative action provisions. This was the first year of reporting for firms which employ 500 to 999 staff. One of the interesting points in the report concerned the difficulties which the Agency has had in identifying those firms which fall within that category. Obviously that area will require greater attention. </PARA>
<PARA> I was also interested to note the surprise that the Agency showed as to the low compliance level of the consultation requirement with the trade union movement. I would have thought that the Agency would have realised by now that there is very low trade union movement coverage in private enterprise firms. As a result, it is not at all surprising that many firms answered that the requirement was not applicable to them. Certainly this will become more evident as more and more people in the public sector are covered by unions and more and more people in the private sector drop out, for quite obvious reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that disturb me in the report is the fact that a number of firms appear to have difficulty recognising that the purpose of the legislation is not only to deal with direct discrimination but also to deal with indirect discrimination. It appears that the reporting firms have a lack of understanding as to what exactly they should be looking for and dealing with in trying to prevent indirect discrimination, such as the requirement of so many people that in order to get a job people must have experience. But in order to get experience they have to be eligible for jobs along the way. In the defence forces, which do not come under this legislation, women often cannot get experience in a job. They are denied the opportunity for the prerequisite which goes to promotion later on. The same thing happens in private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad to see that the Agency has had some extra staff and will get a few more this financial year. One of our continuing concerns in the Opposition is that the Agency is not fulfilling the role which we believe was its main purpose-that is, to evaluate the mechanisms which have been put in place in the private enterprise world for removing all forms of discrimination. Currently it has developed an evaluation plan, but it has not yet moved beyond a numerical evaluation into a qualitative one. That is very important. At present the Agency is doing a compliance audit, which is a desk audit. Its second strategy is process evaluations, which is pretty vaguely worded. The third strategy on page 48 entitled `Evaluation Projects' reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . affirmative action programs will be evaluated to provide better information about the factors which help or inhibit the development of effective programs. </PARA>
<PARA>They have not started yet. The effectiveness review, which is the fourth strategy, will not take place until 1992. So that also is down the track. We are looking at a body which is still in the process of getting established after three years. I would have hoped that we would have been getting more evaluation by now. We in the Opposition support the principle of affirmative action and we have been watching the Agency's progress with interest. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it curious that, in an organisation of 18 people of whom 15 are described as women, it says that it has to appoint a sexual harassment contact officer and is having a policy on sexual harassment distributed to all staff. I presume that the three members who are not described by sex must be male. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to rise to support Senator Newman's comments on the Affirmative Action Agency's annual report for 1988-89. My concerns with the report arise from some of the things written and they are based on the experience that I had when I represented the Opposition on the working party that sought to establish some of the mechanisms before the appropriate legislation was passed. The view I took then on behalf of the Opposition was that, if we were to have the legislation and the Opposition had a view on it, it might as well work. We fought for and obtained certain provisions, including the provision of appropriate and not too onerous sanctions for those companies which did not comply with the provisions of the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note that the higher education sector has complied, although a large part of that sector was late in reporting. I also note that more than half the companies that were due to report both in band 1 and in band 2-depending on the size of the company-reported late. Further, I note the concern of the Agency that a number of companies seem not to understand the provisions of the legislation. Since it is merit-based, it is very important that adequate information be given to employers to enable them to understand what the legislation is about. Senator Newman has indicated some of her concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the actions taken by the Agency, pursuant to the provisions of the legislation, to follow up the backsliders-the companies that were not reporting-we find that between 14 and 16 August the Director of Affirmative Action sent a letter to 40 employers, 21 from band 1 and 19 from band 2, who had still not lodged a report which, at that stage, was quite late. She advised them of her intention to name them if a report was not forthcoming. At the end of the day, after companies had done various things-some had responded; some had demonstrated that their employee numbers were not in excess of 500, so they were not covered, which is possible; one indicated that it had already reported under a different name, probably as part of a group, and that was all right; five companies subsequently provided sufficient information as to cause the Director to exercise her discretion not to name them-eight companies were required under the law to report and although they were invited by the Director to submit one they did not do so. They were then warned by the Director that she would name them but they still did not report. One has to ask: Why is this? The fact is that I may not like all the laws which operate in this country but if there is a law and it affects my operation I believe that I, as a member of a party that believes in the rule of law, have to comply with that legislation. I note the names of the eight companies. I hope that we will not see those names again next year, but I note that one of the companies has now been named in the Parliament for the second time. </PARA>

<PARA> I am concerned that the Director should now take action to contact each of those eight companies to find out what is going on.

Is it that the companies do not understand, or that they believe that the provisions are onerous, that they need more explanation about the merit basis of the legislation? The 40 companies that were late in complying with the legislation all provide a prime target for quite pro-active intervention now by the Director on behalf of the Agency. I will look very carefully at next year's report; I hope that I will not see there the names of those same eight companies. In any event, I would like the directors to tell in due course why their names are there and why they have refused to do their part in responding to their obligations under the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too address some remarks to the annual report of the Affirmative Action Agency and welcome that report. I commend the Director, Valerie Pratt, and the media for reports which have come out subsequent to yesterday's tabling in the other place. Picking up the point on which Senator Peter Baume concluded, the Australian Democrats believe and have believed since the outset of the affirmative action legislation and during the time of its drafting that the sanction issue is one which we have not yet met squarely. It is a difficult one, as Senator Baume outlined, and perhaps it is underlined by the fact that Suttons Investments Pty Ltd has now been mentioned a second time. For the information of Senator Baume and other people, Suttons is an investment company but also a car dealer and is in Sydney. I specify that here because, as many of the media reports have suggested, there may very well be further sanctions beyond its being named in Parliament. Other such sanctions include what have been termed boycotts, but what might more relevantly be called `girlcotts'. They also include other public expressions of dissatisfaction with non-compliance with the legislation. That is the type of sanction which can be carried out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not up to just the Director of the Agency to pursue those companies. It is up to people in the community to express their concern. I for one will not be buying my Christmas presents at Tandy this year, whereas I might very well have done so, given that I have two young teenage boys who can hardly tear themselves away from Tandy whenever we go shopping. I will certainly discourage them and my purse will not be opened there, and so on down the line. It raises the question of the attitudes of the business sector to the Agency, to this legislation, when we see one company named two years in a row; when we see the extraordinary proportion-more than half, as Senator Baume said-of band 1 and 2 companies which have been late with reports; the lengths to which the Agency has had to go to pursue reports; and perhaps even the nature of some of the companies which have not complied in the end. Unfortunately, there is still a lot of evidence that in the business sector attitudes to women's employment and to women in general are still not good. I refer to a Bulletin article some time ago which addressed the question of women's representation on the boards of management of companies. The Bulletin did a phone-around. When it asked someone at Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd whether it had any women on its board, the answer was, `God, no!'. When Telecom was asked the same question, the answer was, `What? Do you mean the switchboard?'. Those sorts of attitudes still prevail in the corporate world. It is a big challenge for the Affirmative Action Agency and for all of us to change those attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA> South Terrace Real Estate Pty Ltd has been named. That company operates the Jewel food stores. A press report points out that the Chairman of South Terrace said that over half the staff were women and that women were employed in all areas, including management, buying and security. He claimed that the company had conformed, but that the Agency had required the information from the parent company and that it had not complied because it was a only a small company which had only two employees and therefore did not bother. It is that hairy-chested attitude that we see in business that is thumbing its nose at this Agency. I call upon women and others concerned for genuine equal opportunity in this country to take the sanctions beyond the Parliament. I remind the Senate too that affirmative action is not quotas. I point to the glossary of the report which points out that we have also had affirmative action for men; land grants for returned servicemen is the example given. It is not a quota system and we should not ever have to hear any more of that sort of garbage in this place in relation to the legislation. I wish the Agency well; I do not wish the eight companies named a particularly good year this year. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I take the opportunity to comment on the annual report of the Australian Manufacturing Council. Its major project is the industry development project which is known under the title, `The Global Challenge: Australian Manufacturing in the 1990s'. The aim of the project is to develop a vision for the manufacturing industry for the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> Speaking recently at an Australian Manufacturing Council in Melbourne, Professor Bruce Scott from Harvard University categorised economies into three groups. The first group comprised outward looking economies which ideally have a realistic exchange rate, open markets with export subsidies and open or uncontrolled factor markets. Secondly, there are the producer-oriented economies which exhibit an undervalued currency and protected markets for their products with heavy emphasis on the promotion of manufacturing and subsidisation of producers by consumers. Professor Scott placed Japan and Korea in these categories. </PARA>
<PARA> The third category, the one in which Australia was grouped, was made up of inward looking economies. Typically, inward looking economies exhibit an overvalued currency and protect and control their factor markets. Factor markets include such items as labour, prices, interest rates and the like. Also typical of inward looking economies is their tendency to be resource dependent. However, the Australian Manufacturing Council suggests that our resource dependency could provide the answer to Australia's current record current account problems. While resources dominate our export trade, the bulk are exported in a raw state. This applies not only to our minerals, but also to wool, hides, cotton and woodchips. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia enjoys a comparative advantage with regard to these items. Therefore, the scope for boosting export revenue by the downstream processing of these resources is enormous. For example, in aluminium alone, exports are worth $5 billion, but this could be $15 billion if all bauxite and alumina were transformed to metal. Similarly, wood processed into pulp would earn four times more export revenue than it does as woodchips. Going the next step, wood processed into pulp would earn 10 times that revenue. Australian manufacturers need a vision, something to strive towards, a sign of hope, particularly in these bleak economic times. Therefore, I commend the work of the Australian Manufacturing Council, particularly in relation to global challenge projects. </PARA>
<PARA> Manufacturing in this country is facing enormous problems, especially in a regime of high interest rates. In those industries those companies that are highly geared are facing almost extinction. I would like to draw the Senate's attention to the current rumours that are circulating particularly in the textile, clothing and allied industries to the effect that 2,000 jobs are to be lost in the next four to six weeks, following a severe downturn in the industry because of the monetary policy pursued by this Government and the very high interest rates that are prevailing. I conclude by saying that high interest rates are killing industry, particularly manufacturing industry in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! I table the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and Hungary from 18 June to 11 July 1989. I had the honour to lead the delegation that recently visited eastern Europe. I think it is significant that this report should be presented at a time when historic events are taking place throughout eastern Europe. The delegation was fortunate to have had the opportunity to visit eastern Europe at the time of the onset of the most significant political events in the region since the Second World War.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The delegation's report contains a number of interesting insights that we gained into the sources and nature of the pressures for political and economic reform in Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. The delegation met with heads of state, government Ministers and many senior officials of the Communist Party in each country. We also met with members of dissident and opposition groups. While the pressure for change was evident while we were there I am sure that none of us would have believed that within a few months the Berlin Wall would have been opened or that a quarter of a million people would be demonstrating in the streets of Prague. I do not believe that anyone anticipated the pace with which political reforms would sweep through eastern Europe.</PARA>
<PARA> It will now be important for the international community to provide practical support to those countries during the extremely difficult times ahead in adjusting to the new political and economic environment. When members of the delegation asked about the type of assistance that would be required, the Hungarian Minister for Trade told us, `We don't want fish; we want the net to catch the fish'. In that vein I was pleased to hear the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) announce on 15 October that a significant package of Australian assistance to Poland and Hungary will include not only food aid but also measures to assist those countries to improve their economic performance.</PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to pay tribute to all members of the delegation who worked tirelessly throughout a long and demanding program. I also wish to thank the many people who were responsible for the organisation of the visit. I particularly acknowledge the assistance I received from the ambassadors of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and Hungary in arranging the itinerary for the visit. I also take the opportunity to thank both the Usher of the Black Rod, Rob Alison, who was secretary to the delegation, and my former Principal Private Secretary, Rob Walsh, for their assistance during the delegation's visit. The task of the secretary to the delegation was particularly demanding, given the tight schedule. Mr Alison carried out his duties in a most admirable way.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>I would just like to add some remarks to those that you, Mr President, have made in tabling the report of the delegation of which we were members and of which you were leader, to eastern Europe in June-July of this year. On a personal level I would like to congratulate you, Mr President, on the splendid job that you did in leading the delegation and in keeping it down to business at all times and for maintaining a very high level of morale throughout the whole of a very busy-I hesitate to say exacting because we enjoyed the visit so much-and useful trip. I also pay my respects and regards to the Usher of the Black Rod, Mr Alison, for the efforts that he had to make to keep the delegation members on time and in order. When we were in Europe we never lost anything, as far as I am aware. It was a very pleasant, informative and rewarding experience. </PARA>
<PARA> I rise because I want to refer particularly to Czechoslovakia. The report covers the visit to four countries-those mentioned in the report as well as Austria. We also had a useful time in that country. I want to refer to Czechoslovakia for several reasons. One is that I have had a special interest in Czechoslovakia since I first visited that country in 1950 when I was an observer to a student conference in Prague which was held just a bit over two years after the communist coup d'etat in February 1948. It was a matter of great interest to see the state of affairs in Czechoslovakia 40 years later, in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Another reason I want to refer to Czechoslovakia is that events have moved even more rapidly there than they have in the other countries we visited-perhaps not more rapidly than those in East Germany and Poland-since we were there. But, as the President has said, there have been very great developments just in the few months since our visit. In Czechoslovakia those developments are more striking than those in any of the other countries we visited. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to mention one or two other matters that are not suitably mentioned in an official report but which I think might be of interest to the Senate. Firstly, I refer to the changes in Czechoslovakia that I was able to observe after nearly 40 years since I was there. There certainly had been an improvement in the general state of the economy and in the morale of the people. In 1950, two years after the coup d'etat, the people of Prague were still in a state of shock and despair. Prague was almost a ghost city. There was hardly any movement of traffic or of people around in the grand Wenceslas Square and other parts of what I think is probably the finest city in Europe. It was paralleled by the tragic atmosphere of the student conference, which spent a great deal of time passing resolutions praising Stalin and chanting his name, to the horror of the few of us from the West. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly Prague had changed for the better on the physical level. There was a liveliness about the city. A great many tourists from the West were there and great improvements had been made to the city itself, particularly in the preservation of the old medieval city, which is still a very large part of Prague. The Government, much as we may be critical of it generally, certainly has done a very good job in preserving and improving the environment generally of the magnificent medieval city that Prague still is. So it was a very much greater pleasure to be able to move around the city and feel the improvement in the quality of life for people there. Clearly Czechoslovakia's food production had improved and, generally speaking, the economic circumstances in Czechoslovakia were better than in the other countries of eastern Europe, as far as we could see. I think that may be one reason why Czechoslovakia has not moved as quickly on reforms as Poland or Hungary. </PARA>
<PARA> As to changes that have occurred since we have been there and the sorts of protests that have occurred in Prague in recent weeks, I do not think any of us expected such rapid movement for change. Certainly the old guard, so to speak, of the Communist Party was firmly in control. Most of the people that we met at our appointments, as described in the report, were of a great age-even older than myself! They seemed to have been there forever and looked as if they would try to stay there in Brezhnev style. It was clear that something would give before long; things could not last much longer. But I certainly did not anticipate the protest against this regime, which had obviously run completely out of steam and which was maintaining a great deal of oppression of people even though its members might have been reasonable managers of the economy. I do not want to praise them too much but they had done a reasonable job according to their own doctrines so that people had a reasonable standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA> But one got the impression of a ramshackle government. The sort of people in government and the doctrinaire approach they had to their task, their country and their people is nowhere better expressed than in the two paragraphs on page 20 of the report, which records discussions we had with the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Obzina. The thing that sticks in my memory-which I am pleased is included in the report-is that when Mr Obzina was asked about the restriction on the church, on freedom of religion and the ability of the cardinal archbishop to communicate with his flock in pastoral letters, the Deputy Prime Minister said, `We have got a shortage of paper in Czechoslovakia and that is why he has got to be restricted, the same as Rude pravo has to be restricted'. Funnily enough, Mr Obzina was perhaps of a slightly younger generation than most of the other leaders in Czechoslovakia, but he certainly was as hidebound, doctrinaire and intractable as the rest of them in relation to any reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> There were some very interesting indications of reform. There had already been some protest. A movement known as Charter 77 had been able to broadcast on Western European radio about its members' desire for democratic reforms in Czechoslovakia. Certainly the church was standing firm for its own rights, although they were being suppressed to a great extent. Priests had to be licensed by the Government and publications by the church and so on were censored. But there were signs of resistance. It was suggested that at the next conference of the Communist Party some changes would certainly be proposed and that some of those may well be supported. But, by comparison with what had already occurred in the Soviet Union and Poland and what we were to find in Hungary, there was, as recently as the end of June this year, little indication of the great events which have occurred in Czechoslovakia. </PARA>
<PARA> All of us greatly welcome the events which have occurred and the pressures that are now being placed upon the old, tired, doctrinaire Government to accord some reforms, to increase the freedoms of Czechs and to do something to improve the economy. The Czechoslovakian economy has a basic strength because it was part of the industrial powerhouse of Europe up until the takeover by the communists in 1948. It has a fundamental strength, and if it had been allowed to perform properly over the last 40 years, the standard of living in Czechoslovakia would possibly be as high as in parts of Western Europe. Political reforms are not the only reforms that are needed. Despite what I have said about the economy and standard of living, there is certainly room for great reforms on the economic front. There was some recognition of that in the discussions we had with officials. </PARA>
<PARA> But there was suppression of freedom of thought, expression, assembly and religion. One case which we took up with the Deputy Prime Minister, which was mentioned in the report, involved a publisher who had been arrested and had had all his materials and archives confiscated because he was publishing a periodical of some kind that displeased the Government. We took up his case but it made no difference. We have since learned that an appeal against his conviction has been dismissed. With the new developments that have occurred in Czechoslovakia, many cases of that kind, hopefully, will be rectified, and the people involved will be set free. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to mention the opportunity we had in Czechoslovakia to meet Cardinal Tomasek, who is the Catholic primate of Czechoslovakia. This was not an official visit by the delegation but arrangements were made by our Ambassador, Mr Herron, for those of us who wished to meet the cardinal. Several of us had a very long and interesting session with him when he told us about his problems with the regime and about maintaining freedom of religion. We took up many of those matters with the Deputy Prime Minister and we received the incredible replies which are included in the report. I am very grateful to Mr Herron for having organised that. He also organised for us-again, it was an unofficial matter; it was not part of the delegation, but a number of us took advantage of it-a meeting with a small group of dissidents one evening in a restaurant. Actually, several of those invited did not turn up because they had been called in for questioning an hour or two before the dinner was to begin. This was another indication of the oppressive nature of the regime. However, we had an interesting discussion with those who did attend. </PARA>
<PARA> I express one disappointment about our visit, and that is that we did not have a meeting with Mr Dubcek. This matter was raised with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade before we left Australia. Unfortunately, Foreign Affairs apparently took the view that it would be counterproductive for an Australian government to even seek a delegation meeting with Mr Dubcek. To some extent I can understand it forming that view. I have described the representatives of the Czechoslovakian Government. Nevertheless, it is not really acceptable for an Australian government to be too over-diplomatic and over-cautious in standing up for rights of people in this way. The delegation would have been very interested to meet Mr Dubcek, but it was felt more diplomatic not to even seek to do so. However, no steps were taken to prevent the unofficial meetings with the cardinal and other dissidents which I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot help feeling that if the matter had been left in the hands of our Ambassador or his staff, it may have been possible to arrange, without any hindrance from the Government, a meeting with Mr Dubcek. His actions in 1968 have now been amply justified. His leadership in 1968, the Prague Spring, will be an inspiration to so many of the oppressed people of Czechoslovakia. His great standing even after 20 years, has been retained in many people's minds. He was demoted to a menial job which he has had to have for 20 years. Obviously, he will in due course be restored. Whether he will be in a leadership position is another matter but there will certainly be proper recognition of his tremendous contribution to the freedom of Czechoslovakia and, indeed, the whole of eastern and central Europe from the communist yoke. It would have been interesting to have met him. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that the imminent changes in Czechoslovakia are very welcome. The spirit of Czechoslovakia has clearly not been broken, as many people may have thought, by the way their Prague Spring was repressed in 1968. It is clear from the delegation's discussions with many people that the Soviets-and we know this from Mr Gorbachev himself-have a very different policy today and that tanks will not be sent in to stop these movements of reform. People in eastern Europe do not expect that to happen again. So there seems to be every reason to believe that the movement in Czechoslovakia which is already apparent will proceed down the road pioneered by Poland, Hungary and East Germany. It is a most welcome movement. I sincerely hope that it will proceed apace in Czechoslovakia as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was my privilege-and I underline the word `privilege'-to be a member of the Parliamentary Delegation to Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. It was quite an extraordinary delegation in that we had the opportunity to be in this exciting part of the world a mere few weeks ago. I join with Senator Durack in extending my congratulations to the President of the Senate, who led the delegation in a most competent manner. It was a very hard working delegation with high morale. It was quite an extraordinary experience. The President's leadership of the delegation contributed greatly to that. I also extend my thanks and congratulations to the staff of the delegation, particularly to the Usher of the Black Rod, who was the secretary to the delegation and who did everything in his power to ensure that nothing untoward happened to anything other than my luggage, a bag of which is now somewhere in space, never to be recovered. The administration of the delegation was quite superb. It was a tireless effort on behalf of those people who administered it on our behalf.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is happening in central Europe is really quite historic and extraordinary. I was fortunate enough to have been in the Soviet Union last year in the two weeks prior to the major conference in which Mr Gorbachev finally put into place perestroika and glasnost. At that time it was apparent that a great deal was in the wind. I do not think anybody anticipated that the spillover would have been as fast and as dramatic as it has been into the remainder of eastern Europe and the communist bloc. I was therefore very fortunate in being able to follow my visit to the Soviet Union only a few months later by being in Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and Hungary at this extremely exciting time. </PARA>
<PARA> I will share with honourable senators some of the highlights, as did Senator Durack. He cited two of the highlights that I certainly would regard as very insightful. One was our discussion with Cardinal Tomasek a few days before his ninetieth birthday. He is seen as being the focal person in Czechoslovakia. He was the focal person for the dissidents. His ageing heart must be much cheered by what has happened in the last two months. From his comments to us, he would not have envisaged that things could move as dramatically and as rapidly as they have in the last four months since we spoke with him; nor would the seven dissidents with whom we were more or less surreptitiously to meet in a restaurant in Prague, four of whom were detained and could not join us. It must be an incredibly buoyant experience to now see literally hundreds of thousands of their countrymen and women in the streets of Prague asserting themselves upon the repressive regime which they, as a handful of individuals, have been attempting to stir against, literally for decades. </PARA>
<PARA> It is indeed democracy on the move. That was particularly apparent at the time when we were in Hungary when we had the good fortune of meeting with the leaders of the emerging opposition parties. The Government in Hungary was voluntarily introducing political reform. The architect of Hungary's political reform was the Special Minister of State, Mr Imre Pozsgay. I very clearly recall his words when we spoke to him. I quote from page 35 of the report. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>We have a general social, economic and political crisis. We can no longer draw on the existing model. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, he was referring there to the Marxist communist model and he continued:</PARA>
<PARA>All its components have to be changed. It is a non-Hungarian model. </PARA>
<PARA>He was simply saying that the Marxist model, as it had been implemented particularly in the hands of Stalin, was bereft, had not delivered to those who had embraced it and the time had come when it needed to be dramatically overhauled. He embodied the spirit of reform in Hungary and, of course, that spirit of reform was born out of perestroika and glasnost and spilled over dramatically into Poland and now, progressively, is spreading throughout eastern and central Europe. It is summarised well in a cartoon in one of this morning's newspapers. It showed a series of dominoes falling over and the former leaders of these nations were running forward and saying, `It seems to us that we have heard about these dominoes before'. Democracy on the move in central Europe is a demonstration to the rest of the globe that the spirit of democracy is alive and well. President Bush, in his recent comments, perhaps encapsulated the hopes of all of us in the Western world when he hopefully predicted that the 1990s would indeed prove to be the decade of democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion may I say that it was a privilege to be a part of this delegation. It was exciting for both myself and my wife Nola. I thank those who led, planned and administered this very fruitful and exciting delegation on our behalf. </PARA>

<PARA>In December 1987 the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade asked that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade inquire into appropriate Australian policy responses to the present international trade and financial situation including debt and, in particular, measures that Australia could take to improve its own balance of trade in goods and services. Given the broad nature of the reference, the Committee has divided its inquiry into two parts, the first being the subject of this report, Third World debt. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considers that, for many developing countries, debt problems have been severe and chronic since the beginning of this decade; and in particular it recognises the desperate plight of many poor people in developing countries. Increasing public attention has been focused on the debt problem in recent years. The debt crisis has been crippling national economies and adversely affecting social fabric particularly among the poor. Developing debtor countries have suffered sharp declines in standard of living, large increases in unemployment, nutritional problems and rising infant mortality rates. Increasing risk spawned the spectre of loan repayment default, and a number of major banks were highly exposed. Although the risk of bank collapse has receded recently, nervousness about high risk over-exposure has led the commercial banking sector virtually to turn off the tap for new funds to developing countries. The debt crisis is a real crisis, will not go away quickly, and requires reforms by the world's governments, international bodies and the private business sector. The recommendations urge a more active Australian presence in international bodies such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and in particular urge Australian support for debt and debt service reduction proposals such as the Brady proposals. Other actions are recommended to relieve the world debt problem and to revitalise the economies of those countries so that they can grow out of debt. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee received 40 written submissions for the report and heard evidence from 17 witnesses. As a member of the trade subcommittee I wish to record our thanks to those people who gave evidence to the inquiry and also to those who made submissions; their interest and effort were useful and are appreciated. I would also like to express my appreciation of the efforts of those of my subcommittee colleagues who, between them, spent hundreds of hours working on this inquiry. The subcommittee wishes to acknowledge the contribution made by our staff, in particular our secretary Mr John Pulley and parliamentary officer, Mrs Lesley Cowan. We are also indebted to the main Committee, its Chairman, the honourable member for Kingston, Mr Gordon Bilney, and the secretary, Mr Peter Gibson. The recommendations in this report are, I believe, positive and practical and if implemented should solve some of the severe economic problems confronting the Third World. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is a significant development in the Government's continued commitment to the financial and management independence of the Federal Court, the Family Court and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Bill will ensure that the courts and the tribunal are independent from day to day control by the Attorney-General's Department and will provide them with the capacity to make decisions which they believe will best enhance their efficient and effective operation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is not, however, about judicial independence in so far as that expression relates to the independence of judges and members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in the exercise of their judicial or adjudicative responsibilities. An essential element of justice in this country has been the real separation of the powers of the judiciary from the powers of the government. All in this Parliament would agree that it is essential that this independence be maintained. It is unfortunate that some have suggested that the question of administrative and management independence is the same as judicial independence. To reiterate that they are different issues in no way diminishes the importance of enabling courts and tribunals to operate separately from the mainstream of Government administration. </PARA>
<PARA> But in providing a statutory basis for independent administration and management it does not follow that the courts or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will or should be free of the need to account for their operations. It is the Parliament which appropriates the funds to these bodies and it is to the Parliament that they will be answerable. Courts and Tribunals, no less than other areas of public administration, must be accountable for efficiency in the management of their affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Ultimately, of course, the courts must be accountable to the public. Within the resources provided by the Parliament the judicial system must ensure that it provides to all who use the courts impartial adjudication of issues which come before it without undue delay. </PARA>
<PARA> Public accountability is essential for without public confidence the judiciary may well come under threat. The provisions of this Bill will place with the courts and the tribunal responsibility for their own administration and provide them with the capacity to operate as they see fit within the resources provided by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Some have suggested that the level of judicial salaries in some way directly affects the degree of independence exercised by the judiciary. Such a proposition is offensive because it suggests that judges will be influenced in the decisions they make because of the level of remuneration. What is important is that the constitutional guarantee that remuneration cannot be reduced during judicial office is supported. The Judicial and Statutory Officers Remuneration Legislation Amendment Bill enhances that constitutional guarantee by placing the ultimate responsibility for the determination of the level of judicial salaries in this parliament. That is not to say that the level of salaries is unimportant. Quite the contrary. Because without adequate remuneration capable individuals will not make themselves available to serve in our courts. </PARA>
<PARA> For some time the Government has been conscious of the need to move in the direction of enabling the Federal and Family courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to manage their own affairs. The High Court has enjoyed such administrative independence for some years. The situation with the other courts and the Tribunal is that they have operated under the administrative umbrella of the Attorney-General's Department with the Secretary of that Department exercising the powers of a departmental secretary of the Public Service in relation to the staff of those courts and the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> As a first step towards self-management, from the beginning of this financial year, the Federal Court, the Family Court and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal received separate appropriations in the supply bills. This placed them, in this respect, on an equal footing with the High Court. The purpose behind this move was to place the courts and the Tribunal in a position where their funding allocation would be controlled by themselves and they will now be able to negotiate direct with the government concerning the appropriate level of future funding. </PARA>
<PARA> As an additional step towards increased administrative independence, a number of the departmental secretary's powers were delegated to the chief administrative officer of each court and of the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill now provides a statutory basis to fully implement the self-management of the courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The effect of this Bill is to transfer from the Attorney-General's Department to the courts and the Tribunal responsibility for the supervision of their own financial management and practices and the courts and the Tribunal also take control over the management of their other administrative affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Self-management will mean that the courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will be free to make their own decisions in human and financial resource management. This will maximise the flexibility of the courts and the tribunal to cope with changing pressures and priorities throughout each year. This move is welcomed by the chief justices of the Federal and Family courts and the President of the Tribunal. It is also consistent with initiatives they have taken and, no doubt, will be taking in relation to their case management procedures and in the reduction of delays. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also mean that these bodies will be given an administrative independence similar to that enjoyed by the High Court. There are two differences of substance between the arrangements in this Bill and the position of the High Court. First, unlike the High Court, the Federal and Family courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal are not given power to acquire interests in land. The accommodation needs of these bodies are, of course, significantly greater than those of the High Court. Because of the geographic diversity of their operations, the Federal and Family courts and the Tribunal require facilities across Australia and the acquisition of those facilities is enhanced if they can have the opportunity to work under the umbrella of Government purchasing and building arrangements. This is also a more efficient arrangement, in particular, where accommodation might be shared by these bodies in purpose-built accommodation. The other difference is that, unlike the High Court which operates its own bank accounts, the Federal and Family courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will operate on the Commonwealth Public Account under arrangements with which they are familiar and which they have agreed should be retained. Use of the Commonwealth Public Account will not subject them to the control of the Attorney-General's Department as they will operate as separate departments. </PARA>
<PARA> To facilitate the proposed increased administrative responsibilities of the courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Bill creates a new executive management position in each body to carry out the new management functions under the overall direction and control of the chief judge of each court and the President of the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike the Federal Court and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Family Court has two separate mainstreams of personnel-those concerned with the delivery of court counselling services and those concerned with the legal aspects of the proceedings before the court. In recognition of this fact (and noting, of course, that the Family Court is the largest and most diverse court in Australia), the Bill creates a new statutory office of chief executive officer in that court. In the Federal Court and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal the responsibilities of the registrars have been altered to incorporate the responsibilities in respect of the courts and tribunal administration previously conferred on the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department. Both positions of registrar will cease to be public service positions and both registrars and the chief executive officer will hold appointments from the Governor-General. In relation to the other officers and staff of the courts and the tribunal the new office holders will be given the powers of departmental secretaries. The existing position of the principal registrar of the Family Court will remain as at present and that officer will continue to exercise the functions of the principal registrar and the supervision of the officers of the court carrying out ``legal'' functions. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the provisions of the Bill are standard provisions and consequential amendments which are necessary for the creation of these new statutory offices. The remaining provisions in parts 2, 4 and 5 of the Bill cover the new administrative duties and responsibilities which are to be taken on by the courts and the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment to subsection 78 (3) of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Act is also a consequential amendment arising from the change in the position of the Registrar of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal from a public service position to a statutory office-holder. Currently, the registrar of the Tribunal is also the registrar of the Security Appeals Tribunal established by the ASIO Act. This is because the workload of the Security Appeals Tribunal is such that it does not justify full time registry appointments. The amendment will mean that the Registrar of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal would still be eligible to be the Registrar of the Security Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendments made by this Bill relate to the setting of fees in the High Court. Currently these fees are set by the judges of the High Court in the High Court Rules. After consultation with the High Court, it has been agreed to transfer this fee-setting power so that in future it can be dealt with by regulation. This brings the position in regard to the High Court fees into line with the position in regard to fees in other courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Bill amends the relevant sections of the Judiciary Act to give effect to this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is a major reform by the Government in the area of judicial administration. However, in presentating this reform, I must say that the Government is conscious that it could not have reached this point had it not been for the support and commitment of the Chief Justices of the Federal and Family Courts and the President of the Tribunal. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is an omnibus Bill amending 16 Acts administered within the Transport and Communications portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> The most significant amendments are to the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987 to put in place part of the shipping industry reform package announced by the Government on 1 June 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Other significant amendments are made to the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989 to provide for customs clearance of imported vehicles and to enable the determination of testing and record keeping practices for manufacturers or importers of vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendments are mainly of a minor policy nature or correct deficiencies or errors in current legislation. I will now deal with the amendments in detail. </PARA>
<PARA>Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987</PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987 are to put in place the legislative elements of the Government's contribution to the shipping industry reform package announced on 1 June 1989. The amendments extend the availability of the fiscal benefits under the Act to 30 June 1997 for new ships and make grants payable for modifications to existing ships completed by 30 June 1992 which enable reductions in crew levels. </PARA>
<PARA> The extension of the fiscal benefits to 1997 will provide Australian shipowners with a stable fiscal environment in which to invest in new tonnage. Already 25 ships with MIDC type crews have been introduced or ordered for the Australian fleet. This represents one third of the fleet of major trading ships. The extension of the Act will encourage other shipowners or potential shipowners to invest in more modern tonnage, crewed at levels comparable with those applying on ships of OECD nations using national crews. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments are also to safeguard against excessive grant payments possible under ship financing schemes which inflate the purchase price of ships by including financing costs. These changes were announced on 7 September 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The amendments proposed to the Motor Vehicle Standards Act demonstrate the continuing commitment by the Government to maintaining that a high level of safety is met by all road vehicles supplied to the Australian market for the first time. </PARA>
<PARA> The major amendment provides for a proper link between the Act and the Customs Act to ensure that vehicles are not allowed to enter Australia unless they meet the requirements of the Motor Vehicle Standards Act. It ensures that vehicles subject to the Motor Vehicle Standards Act will not be allowed to enter Australia without the specific approval of the Minister administering the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition the amendments provide that determinations relating to the testing of motor vehicles be disallowable instruments, thus providing for proper parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains a number of minor amendments that clarify certain provisions and facilitate administration of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Air Navigation Act 1920</PARA>
<PARA> There have been some doubts expressed that the regulation making power of the Air Navigation Act does not extend to aviation security. These doubts arose following the enactment of the Civil Aviation Act 1988 which provides that the Civil Aviation Authority has responsibility for aviation safety but not for aviation security. Prior to the enactment of the Civil Aviation Act, aviation security was considered to fall within the term aviation safety. The amendment to the Air Navigation Act will remove the doubt that regulations relating to aviation security may be made under that Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Broadcasting Act</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendment to section 125d of the Broadcasting Act provides for the introduction of charges for the investigation of interference with the reception of radio and television programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Under current legislation, the Minister for Transport and Communications has an obligation to investigate and make arrangements to correct interference to broadcasting services. This obligation is currently discharged as a free service by officers of my department who investigate complaints of reception difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> The requirement was initially introduced because knowledge and understanding of interference effects were seen to have an important input to the service planning process. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of technological development, the provision of broadcasting services is now much more scientific and predictable and the planning information obtained from investigations is negligible. Also, the service industry is now better educated in ways of overcoming reception problems. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, in recent years, there has been a growing tendency for members of the public to rely on this free service. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the reception problems have been attributed to easily detectable factors such as: deficiencies in the receiving installation, for example an inadequate antenna or television receiver; people trying to tune to stations where they are well outside the station's service area; or unintended radio frequency emissions from the local electricity authority's reticulation system. These complaints are investigated by departmental officers whereas they could, and should, be handled by complainants themselves, TV repair services and electricity authorities. Because departmental officers are not in a position to fix these reception problems, this activity represents a waste of highly skilled technical resources. </PARA>
<PARA> This unnecessary demand is not only diverting valuable technical resources away from other important spectrum management and broadcasting planning functions, but it is also inhibiting the Department's ability to provide timely assistance to people with cases of genuine interference. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed through appropriate consumer education to encourage the public to make their own assessment of any interference problem before calling on the Department for assistance. To assist people to understand what is involved and to know what action is appropriate, a comprehensive information booklet and questionnaire will be sent free to each complainant. Provision will be made for the public to submit, at no charge, the questionnaire without requesting an investigation of their own receiving equipment. By this means the Department will be able to detect and deal with genuine cases of interference, such as those affecting a local community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department will also provide an improved telephone advisory service to help residents deal with general queries and any difficulties that the local repair services or electricity authority cannot resolve. </PARA>
<PARA> A call-out charge will only apply where a departmental officer pays a visit in response to a specific request. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to emphasise that it is not proposed to terminate the Department's interference investigation service. On the contrary Departmental officers will continue to investigate all cases of interference to radiocommunications services, as well as genuine interference problems involving broadcasting services. </PARA>
<PARA> This initiative is in accordance with current Government policy to encourage a more efficient and effective public service and will result in a quicker and better service to all users of the radio frequency spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA>Interstate Road Transport Act 1985</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also amends the Interstate Road Transport Act 1985 in three respects. Firstly, to allow State and Territory Regulatory Authorities to link the prescribed fees that are payable to the Consumer Price Index. These fees are payable to State or Territory Regulatory Authorities where they perform a registration function on behalf of the Commonwealth. Secondly another amendment will strengthen the prosecution provision of the Act by ensuring that corporations, and their directors, agents and employees are subject to adequate sanctions where an offence is committed under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, further amendment will allow on-the-spot fines for mass limit (overloading) offences as an alternative to prosecution to reduce the administrative burden placed on the court system. </PARA>
<PARA>Navigation Act</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will make several amendments to the Navigation Act 1912. </PARA>
<PARA> Two of the amendments implement changes agreed with the States and the Northern Territory on jurisdiction over maritime matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The first will allow a trading ship under State/Territory jurisdiction to be brought under Federal jurisdiction should its owner wish it. (This will be of particular value to the owner of a ship that operates a mixture of intra-state and inter-state voyages-the ship will not have to move backwards and forwards between jurisdictions according to the particular voyage it is on. The procedure already works well with offshore industry support vessels.)</PARA>
<PARA> The second will implement revised, more flexible, arrangements on jurisdiction for enforcement of collision regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Marine Council is empowered to determine that the character or conduct of a person is such that the person is unsuitable for engagement as a seafarer. Such a determination is subject to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal but as the Act currently stands the lodgment of an appeal automatically defers operation of the determination. This automatic deferral is to be removed and deferral to be left in the hands of the Tribunal according to the facts of the individual case. </PARA>
<PARA> The current provisions relating to Courts of Marine Inquiry are to be replaced by a more modern and flexible system of casualty investigation. The Bill will provide for the necessary power for this to be done in the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the various statutory committees provided for in the Navigation Act are to be rationalised by combining the various functions, such as that carried out by the Crew Accommodation Committee, into the Marine Council. </PARA>
<PARA>Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill corrects a drafting deficiency relating to the discharge of garbage from ships in the vicinity of offshore platforms and will enable Australian ratification of Annex V of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). </PARA>
<PARA>Telecommunications and Postal Legislation</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill makes minor amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1989 and miscellaneous telecommunications and postal legislation to correct drafting errors. The most significant of these amendments will ensure OTC is able to continue to supply basic telecommunications services between external territories and other places within Australia. This amendment does not preclude Telecom from continuing to supply these same services. Another amendment will extend an existing provision preventing the sale without notice of equipment for which there is no permit to the supply of such equipment otherwise than by sale, such as by lease. </PARA>
<PARA>Other Portfolio Legislation</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also makes minor technical amendments to the Australian Airlines (Conversion to Public Company) Act 1988, the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Act 1988 and the Navigation Amendment Act 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> All amendments are revenue-neutral except the amendments to the Broadcasting Act 1942 and the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the amendments of the Broadcasting Act 1942, the estimated cost of setting up a charging scheme for the investigation of interference to the reception of radio and television programs is $100,000. The estimated net savings in the financial year  1989/90 will be approximately $350,000. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the amendments to the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987, the extension of the grants scheme to 1997 is expected to involve a net cost to revenue of $52m. Savings in the form of increased industry efficiency of $80m will accrue to industry over the three years from 1989 and annual savings of $50m are expected thereafter. The cost to revenue of the grants for modification is expected to be about $2.4m. The savings from the amendment to prevent excessive claims is estimated at $13m. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to lunch I had referred the Minister to a response provided by Mr Dickie to questions I asked in Estimates Committee E. I prefaced my question by noting that the unanimous view of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material was that videos with the R classification should not be displayed with other videos, that is to say, videos rated G, PG and M, and that, if they were to be displayed at all, they should not be displayed in a place other than a place to which access by persons under the age of 18 years is prohibited. I asked Mr Dickie what had taken place in respect of that and he gave me a response which is recorded on page E146 of the Estimates Hansard. I was very well aware that in a number of States, including my own, a person can walk into a video shop and see the most horrific, violent R-rated videos side by side with PG-rated videos. It is a matter about which the Joint Select Committee was most concerned. I asked the Chief Film Censor a question and I repeat it here: what is to prevent the Commonwealth from enacting legislation which would require that to be done? I asked this because, as I understand it, a number of people take advice from the Chief Censor and he is present at various ministerial meetings. I really expected a response from him. He responded:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The decision of the Standing Committee of Ministers was to take no action on it in the end. </PARA>
<PARA>The questioning continued:</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but that was not my question. What is to prevent the Commonwealth from taking that action?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Dickie-The Commonwealth on its own does not have that power. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has it not? Can you not make that a condition of registration of videos?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Dickie-I do not think so, Senator. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could you consider that and give another reply?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The reply that has come back is not a reply to the question as to whether the Commonwealth has the power to enact legislation requiring R-rated videos not to be displayed in the same place where PG and M videos are displayed. The response by the Chief Censor is that the Customs (Cinematograph Films) Regulations relate only to films and videotapes imported for public exhibition and not to videotapes for sale or hire, which are regulated by State and Territory laws. Under State and Territory law throughout Australia the Chief Censor does not have any power to impose conditions on the approval of videotapes for sale and hire, except perhaps in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> That response was given to me through the Estimates Committee secretariat in a letter dated 24 October 1989, but that is not the question I asked. What he says is that under State and Territory law throughout the Commonwealth the Chief Censor does not have any power to impose conditions on the approval of videos for sale or hire, except perhaps in Queensland. That was not my question. My question was clearly this: does the Commonwealth have the power to enact legislation which would require such videos that are classified R not to be displayed? I would like the Minister to respond, if he would not mind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this examination of the appropriations Senator Harradine has again raised the question of whether it could be made a condition of registration of R-certified videos that they be separately displayed at point of sale or hire. Obviously he is not content-and I am not saying that in any pejorative way-with the decision by the Standing Committee of Censorship Ministers on 1 December 1988 that the question of whether R-classified videotapes should be separately displayed in stores was appropriately one for determination by State or Territory governments. That is certainly the position of that ministerial council and, to that extent, I suppose it is certainly the current political position which obviously has the support of various governments around Australia. The manner in which these particular videos might be displayed in a video store, particularly the question of their separation, ought to be a matter for those governments to legislate for or regulate in accordance with the various pressures, requests or lobbying put forward from within their own electorate and jurisdiction, rather than making an Australia-wide attempt to regulate this particular matter of display by way of Commonwealth law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nevertheless, Senator Harradine raises the very proper question of whether, if that were not the case and the Commonwealth were minded to do it, it could legislate to make that separation in display a requirement. The short answer to the honourable senator's question is yes, it is possible in a limited and fragmented way. One could try to rely on a number of heads of constitutional power. Conceivably, one could try to base the legislation in part on the interstate trade and commerce power or, perhaps, the corporations power. No doubt there are others, but it would be fragmented. For example-I think it is fairly obvious-if it were based on the interstate trade and commerce power, Commonwealth legislation would not apply to sale or hire occurring totally within a State. That is the advice that has been received over the lunch hour since the honourable senator made known to officials his misgivings in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally, if it were based on the corporations power, it would not apply to sale or hire by individuals or non-trading or non-financial corporations. I myself have not had time to consider the matter and I am not necessarily saying that the heads of power identified and the particular scope in the answer I am giving are comprehensive or totally answering in the sense of a proper legal opinion, which I am not really offering. I am simply indicating that there would need to be a combination of various heads of power, none of which would comprehensively cover the various instances where the objective sought to be achieved by Senator Harradine could be guaranteed. There would be ways around the heads of power that the Commonwealth might use. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only repeat my view that, whilst the Commonwealth would have certain heads of power available to it, it would be a fragmented attempt. To be successful, it would have to be done in collaboration with the States, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. In that situation there would need to be the support of the ministerial council of censorship Ministers. When that body last considered the matter, on 1 December 1988, it regarded it as one which should be properly left to each individual State or Territory to legislate or regulate in accordance with its accountability to its own electorate. </PARA>

To be fair to Mr Dickie, he said that he did not think so. However, I am advised that there are a great number of ways in which Commonwealth powers could be utilised for this purpose. Presumably Mr Dickie was at this ministerial council; the question clearly arises as to whether the possibility of Commonwealth legislation in this area was suggested to it by Mr Dickie. We were talking about some uniform laws in this regard, and I would have thought that that was one of the things that Mr Dickie, or the Attorney-General's Department, could have advised the ministerial council about. Clearly that has not been done because the Department was not sure whether this could be done.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I think that is the matter that I am emphasising. I believe there is some constitutional base but it is fragmented through various heads of power and, to be effective, would require the concurrence of the various Ministers at the ministerial council. I feel sure they would have been aware of the partial scope of the Commonwealth's power and I am sure the Federal Attorney, who is the Commonwealth Minister responsible for censorship, and most other Ministers responsible for censorship, who are probably Ministers for Justice or Attorneys, although not all of them are, would have been aware of this constitutional base. However, as I say, at the moment it is a matter for determination by State or Territory governments. </PARA>

I am coming very shortly to another more glaring example in the Department when it comes to Mr Burdekin, but I will not have public servants, members of commissions and so forth trying to fob me off.

Of course, the sale and hire of those tapes are regulated by State and Territory laws, but could the Minister comment on the first part of that response, that is, that the Customs (Cinematograph Films) Regulations relate only to films and videotapes imported for public exhibition?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be obliged if I could have an elaboration, either from the Chief Censor or from the Minister, at a later stage. I return to the $350,000 mentioned on page 64 of the explanatory notes to the estimates for the Attorney-General's Department. An amount of $350,000 was earmarked for a public education awareness program in relation to video materials in Australia. That is quite a substantial amount and during the Estimates Committee hearings I attempted to ascertain what was proposed in that public education awareness campaign and whether it was adequate. I think that is an appropriate question to be asked both in the Estimates Committee and in the Committee of the Whole. I asked Mr Dickie the following question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Is it not a fact that at present if you walked out into the street you would find only one in about 10,000 people who would know that?</PARA>
<PARA>`That' related to this previous question:</PARA>
<PARA>Will that education program have an element in which the Office of Film and Literature Classification will be identified as the body to which the ordinary citizenry can make complaints or suggestions-for example, that a certain film should be in M rather than PG, or R rather than M?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Dickie replied:</PARA>
<PARA>Yes, I think that is true. </PARA>
<PARA>I then asked the following question:</PARA>
<PARA>Would it be then appropriate for the education campaign to include a feature where parents or people who view films and videos could make contact in order to express their views?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Dickie replied as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>I had hoped that we could make the office the central point. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to make the valid point that he wished to include various States. I would like to ascertain what follow-up, if any, has taken place. Will there be a readily identifiable telephone contact so that parents, for example, can phone and make their suggestions, comments or complaints? I am sure that all senators and members receive many letters and telephone calls on these issues. I had hoped that part of this public education awareness campaign, for which $350,000 has been earmarked, would contain a very clear element that would identify the contact point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that it would be a deficient campaign if it did not make clear some contact point for those who had been enlightened somewhat but who wanted some further clarification or advice. That contact point could be included on the poster, in the literature, in the video presentation or in whatever other medium that might be used, in order to attempt to convey more clearly the various categories and the responsibility of viewers and parents of potential viewers in relation to those categories.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the point that it should include a telephone number which is accessible to people throughout Australia-and I refer to a 008 number-Mr Dickie indicated that that suggestion by Senator Harradine would be taken back and looked at, no doubt in relation to the preparation of the estimates next year. However, I think he made the point that, in his experience, the 008 service can prove to be a very costly operation for the recipient of the phone calls. He indicated that he would have to look at that suggestion in the context of the best use of resources. I agree with Senator Harradine-and that view has been reinforced and will be further reinforced when the Chief Censor looks at the transcript of today's proceedings-that a contact for further clarification and advice in relation to these matters should be made clear to those who receive the benefits of the public education awareness program. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. I asked Mr Dickie a number of questions about the public education awareness program. At page 147 of the Estimates Committee Hansard I asked the following question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When dealing with informing the public about the nature of video material, what is proposed so far as the X category is concerned? How are you to describe that?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Dickie answered as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> In detail, I do not know. </PARA>
<PARA>He then cited the top 10 videos and how many of those were in each category. I then asked the following question:</PARA>
<PARA> In your classifications which came in on 1 May-this is the first time since they have come in that we have been able to question you about them-you have a classification `X: non-violent erotica'. Where did you get the words `non-violent erotica' from?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Dickie replied as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> That was a description of what we would consider would be in the X category. </PARA>
<PARA>I may be wrong, but from my further reading of the transcript of the Estimates Committee hearing, it seems that Mr Dickie is intent on continuing to describe X-rated videos as `non-violent erotica', although he has absolutely no legal basis for so doing. In fact, X-rated videos were described as `hard-core pornography' in the explanatory memorandum to the Classification of Publications Ordinance, which was tabled in this Parliament. That is the legal interpretation of X-rated videos. Mr Dickie does not have any legal basis for calling them `non-violent erotica'. The hard-core pornography industry has a vested interest in calling them `non-violent erotica'. The industry is prepared to pay big money to political parties and to others in order to push this line. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to know why a government official is prepared to make the statement that this material is non-violent erotica when legally it is described in the official documents tabled in this Parliament as `hard-core pornography'. That also flies in the face of the majority finding of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material. I would be ruled out of order if I described the type of material I was inquiring about; in fact, the threat was previously made in this chamber that, if somebody attempted to say what was contained in this material, he or she would be ruled out of order. Surely one would not be ruled out of order if one were talking about non-violent erotica of an artistic type. I then asked Mr Dickie:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . but in this X category you are talking about a non-violent erotica category. Do you describe anal sex as non-violent erotica?</PARA>
<PARA>The transcript confirms:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Dickie-Between consulting adults?</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You do?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Dickie-Yes. </PARA>
<PARA>This is very important because much of the X-rated video material is the promotion of acquired immune deficiency syndrome behaviour. I would like to hear from the Minister whether he agrees that the depiction of multiple anal sex in X-rated videos for a pornographic purpose is properly described as non-violent erotica. If he does not agree, then will the public be told the truth about X-rated videos? Will they be described, as they are legally described, as hard core pornography in this campaign that is being developed with the $350,000 that is currently under consideration?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I recall from the Estimate Committee hearing, Mr Dickie was making the point that the category `non-violent erotica' was used by him or his officials in a shorthand way to help with their classification duties. I recall him saying that it is not used by them as a label, for example, which goes into the store as a description of what is meant by X-rated videos. It has not got `X equals non-violent erotica per the view of the Chief Censor' on the label attached to the video. It will have `X' and whatever other words follow, but they would no doubt cover the fact that it dealt pretty comprehensively with sexual activity. I do not have the label, so I am not going to try to assume what it says. But Mr Dickie did make the point that `non-violent erotica' was not to be used on the label at the behest of the Chief Censor. They were not trying to peddle it as a term for parents or persons who go into video stores to get some sort of official categorisation from the censor to give some guidance as to whether they purchase or hire a video.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the sort of sexual activity that Senator Harradine mentioned-and I refrain from repeating it only because of the presence of very young children in the gallery-I would have thought that if the activity concerned did not involve violence-was not of a coercive kind, in other words-and people were not compelled, then it would fall properly within the X category. As I understand it, it is where coercion or violence is concerned that the censor applies the categories and says that that violence or coercion would take it outside the X-rated category. If there is violence or coercion, it does not qualify. Apart from anything else, if there is simple-in other words, apparently consensual-sexual activity of the kind Senator Harradine described, then it can properly be labelled X. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened carefully to what the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) has said. I am not going to press him for his opinion as to whether X-rated videos of the type I mentioned can be described as non-violent erotica (NVE). Clearly, he is not prepared to say that. He has given a strict statement as to the material falling within the X category and obviously is not prepared to go along with what the Chief Censor says in respect of this material being non-violent erotica.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The publicist for the X-rated video industry, the hard core pornography industry, said today on Radio 2CN that the Chief Censor himself has called this material non-violent erotica. So there has been the campaign by the hard core pornography merchants and Mr Dickie, the Chief Censor, has described X-rated videos as non-violent erotica without any legislative base. Then there is the full circle of the publicist for the hard core pornography industry stating today on 2CN that the Chief Censor himself has called them NVE. In the document that comes from the Office of Film and Literature Classification, they are described as NVE videos. I do not think that is appropriate. We can have an argument about the appropriateness or otherwise of that description, but let the officials of the Government stick to a legislative base for what they do or do not do. Particularly in an education campaign with the $350,000 for which we are voting now, let not those videos be described as NVE or non-violent erotica. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to another point that I raised with Mr Dickie, and it was raised by Senator Reid yesterday. It will be recalled that last October or November, when the Government caved in to the hard core pornography lobby and refused to implement the majority recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material, the Government said, `No, we are setting up a working party of the Caucus and that working party will have two purposes'. One purpose was to ensure that the guidelines on violence were tightened and the other was to ensure that the public was made aware of the difference between the X and R classifications. In regard to the first point, I make it perfectly clear that those of us in the majority on the Joint Select Committee have sometimes quite unfairly been accused of being soft on violence. Quite the contrary: if one looks at our report and at the minority report, one can see that the majority made a specific recommendation to amend the classifications in order to get rid of some types of violence. The minority did not make that recommendation. I was pleased to see that subsequently the Film Censorship Board adopted that recommendation and implemented it. </PARA>
<PARA> I asked Mr Dickie, the Chief Censor, whether the Caucus committee had been in touch with him. I gained the distinct impression that he did not know about the Caucus committee. It was interesting to hear Senator Reid ask the Minister yesterday what that Caucus committee has done. I would like to know whether it has done anything. Does the Government intend to do anything about this question of violence, for example? When will the committee meet? Will it make recommendations to the Joint Select Committee? Does the Minister think that it is entirely appropriate for such a committee to be established and to seek to have the guidelines tightened?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that the concept of a Caucus committee has been superseded by events. Since my answer to Senator Reid yesterday and from further inquiries I made after Question Time, it now appears that the committee will not convene in order to carry out these functions which have been largely overtaken by the education campaign, which we now know is to be undertaken. That is recorded in the Hansard of the Estimates Committee. Although Caucus has not formally rescinded the motion to establish a committee, which it passed at the time the matters were under consideration, it would now take the view that a special Caucus committee has no further role in this matter, although the legal and administrative committee of Caucus has a continuing oversight of matters within the portfolio generally.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, at last we have got it! We always knew that the Caucus committee proposal was an absolute fraud. The news media swallowed it. The day after the decision was made by the Government to refuse to accept the recommendations of the majority of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material that X-rated videos be refused classification, the headlines read `Caucus establishes a committee'. That committee was established for two purposes. One was to view the level of violence in videos and to seek to have the classifications tightened. The second was to educate the public as to the nature and content of the difference between X-rated and R-rated videos. The Minister has finally buried that committee-that committee which never had life. At that time I wrote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Federal Government's decision to establish a Caucus working party on videos was a public relations exercise to disguise its continued legislative support for the hard-core pornography industry. In effect it rejected the unanimous wish of all of the States. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us not forget those words: `the unanimous wish of all of the States'. Senator Tate has said that we must listen to what the States say. When I talked about the need to protect children from being exposed to the violence of R-rated videos which were alongside PG-rated videos he said, `We can't do anything about it because the States don't agree with it'. In this case the States did ask the Commonwealth to refuse classifications for X-rated videos, but what did it do? It came down on the side of the hard-core pornographers who have paid money into its coffers. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick has asked which committee will take over from the Caucus committee, which of course never existed. Will we see in the press tomorrow a little notice from the Government saying that we were all misled, or an erratum or an apology? Of course not. It was a farce! It was just an attempt to disguise the Government's continued legislative support for the hard-core porn industry. Indeed, the ball is back in the Commonwealth Government's court. Contrary to what has been indicated by the Federal Government in recent months, it still has power over classification of materials for the purpose of censorship. In fact, it is clear that the Film Censorship Board must have a watchdog over it. Clearly, the Government will not do that-even in relation to violent videos it will not do it-in relation to hard-core pornography because it has sold out on that. It now appears that the Government is not going to do it with respect to violent videos. Who is going to do it? A public relations campaign for which we will pay $350,000 to the Film Censorship Board is absolutely worthless unless the Film Censorship Board accepts its responsibility in respect of the issue of classification and unless the Federal Government of the day and the various State governments give the Board an indication of what they want. They have given that indication in some areas but it has not been followed. I believe that it is worthwhile for this Parliament to continue examining this. Senator Walters's Bill should be proceeded with and a test should be taken on this matter. I am straying a little at the moment from the actual expenditure that is before us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Another aspect of the Attorney-General's Department to which I wish to refer was raised in Estimates Committee E hearings. Because the Human Rights Commissioner was not there I asked my questions of an officer of the Human Rights Commission. It relates to the rights of the child. I do not have the Hansard report of the Committee with me, but the Minister will know what I am talking about. It is relevant because earlier this week the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Television coverage highlighted symbolic scenes of young children occupying the national seats in the General Assembly Council. Whilst our natural reaction is to support anything which may advance the general well-being and welfare of children, we need to examine the role of the Human Rights Commission. I attempted to do that in the Estimates Committee. The Attorney-General's Department, in the explanatory notes, made a big thing about the Human Rights Commissioner being very much involved in this particular matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Each of us should examine the text of the Convention very carefully to see what may have been lost in the transformation from a declaration to a convention as the new Convention is intended to replace the 1959 Declaration on the Rights of the Child. The 1959 Declaration is very much relevant to the operation of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, that is, the Commission whose estimates we have under review at the moment. The declaration is reproduced as a schedule to the Act which governs the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Commission appeared before Estimates Committee E on 5 October, I directed a number of questions to its representatives. Despite the identification by the Commission of `work on the Convention' as one of its major activities in 1988-89, the Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Brian Burdekin, was not present at the Estimates Committee hearing and the Commission representative was not able to answer adequately my question about the Commission's work on the Convention. The Minister covered that well. He invited me to pursue the questions by letter, which invitation I accepted. The Minister subsequently forwarded answers prepared by the Commission. The answers to those questions were inadequate. I would use a stronger term if I were used to using such terms. I want to make the point and show why the answers were inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> My principal question was:</PARA>
<PARA> What attempts were made by the Commissioner to ensure that the recognition of the unborn child, contained in the Preamble and Principle 4 of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child were repeated with equivalent force and status in the Draft Convention?</PARA>
<PARA>I asked the questions very deliberately and used words with which the Human Rights Commission would have been familiar. I should have got direct answers to those questions. I did not. </PARA>
<PARA> I have in my hand the terms of schedule 3 of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission legislation. My first question to the Commissioner was:</PARA>
<PARA>It is stated in the Departmental Explanatory Notes that `work of the Convention on the Rights of the Child' was one of the major activities and performance results for the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in 1988-89. It is also stated in the HREOC Publication ``Questions'' and Answers that Australia `has taken a very active role in negotiating the terms of the Convention' and that these negotiations included the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA>I then asked:</PARA>
<PARA>What attempts were made by the Commissioner to ensure that the recognition of the unborn child contained in the Preamble and Principle 4 of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child were repeated with equivalent force and status in the Draft Convention. </PARA>
<PARA>The preamble of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the child, by reason of his physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The key point is that Principle 4, which is in the body of the Declaration, in reference to the child, states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . shall be entitled to grow and develop in health; to this end, special care and protection shall be provided both to him and his mother, including adequate pre-natal and post-natal care . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I asked the question:</PARA>
<PARA>Did the Human Rights Commissioner or any other Australian Representative make any statements about this recognition to the UN Committees or working parties which examined the draft Convention? When were these made? What they were?</PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioner's reply was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The relevant part of the Preamble of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child is in fact referred to and precisely reproduced in the Preamble of the Draft Convention on the Rights of the Child. Questions as to any `attempts' made to this end therefore do not arise. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> It is considered that the subject matter of Principle 4 of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child is fully covered by the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, including the preambular provisions already referred to and the following substantive articles: . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioner would have known that to use the words `including the preambular provisions already referred to' evaded the question because the preambular provisions already referred to are not part of the actual treaty text, the binding part of the treaty. Whereas the preambular provisions are in the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, there is another provision, provision 4 which I read out before, which when read together with the preambular provisions indicates that the child should be protected before as well as after birth. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless I am misunderstanding what Mr Burdekin has said, that is my concern. Perhaps Mr Burdekin has said something in the succeeding statements about which I would like clarification from the Minister. In referring to Principle 4 of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, which I remind the Committee referred to the child's entitlement to grow and to develop in health and to have adequate prenatal and postnatal care, Mr Burdekin says that that is covered by Article 3 (2) of the new Convention, where it says:</PARA>
<PARA>States Parties shall undertake to ensure the child such protection and care as is necessary for his or her well being . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Does that mean the unborn child? Mr Burdekin then goes on to say that it is also covered in Article 6 (2). He says:</PARA>
<PARA>States Parties shall ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child. </PARA>
<PARA>Does that mean the survival of the unborn child? Mr Burdekin goes on to refer to Article 24 (1), which says:</PARA>
<PARA>States Parties recognises the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He refers also to Article 24 (2), which says:</PARA>
<PARA>States Parties shall pursue full implementation of this right and, in particular, shall take appropriate measures: (a) To diminish infant and child mortality . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Does that mortality relate to the unborn child? If it does not, why did the Minister try to snow me? If we are talking about Principle 4 of the Declaration, which refers specifically to the entitlement of the child to grow and to develop in health and to have adequate prenatal and postnatal care, I would like to hear from the Minister as to what is meant by these responses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine asked that questions be put to the Human Rights Commissioner and, indeed, they were. The first question set out in his letter included:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What attempts were made by the Commissioner to ensure that the recognition of the unborn child contained in the Preamble and Principle 4 of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child were repeated with equivalent force and status in the Draft Convention?</PARA>
<PARA>As I understand the response, it refers to paragraph 3 of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Whereas the child, by reason of his physical or mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is carried into paragraph 9 of the preamble to the Convention. Quite clearly, we have an equivalence of force and status. They are both in paragraphs preceding the document. Of course, should the Convention be ratified and come into force then it will have a greater status and more force than is the case with the Declaration because the Convention will be binding in international fora on those state parties which are parties to it. In fact, to a certain extent, whilst it is true that they both formally are bound within the preamble, the preamble would have a certain greater status in harmony with the greater status of the Convention compared with the Declaration. </PARA>
<PARA> But preambles are preambles. I think Senator Harradine made the point that they do not have the same obligatory effect as do the articles. I think it is true to say that when the working party in 1988, I think it was, during its final session, considered this matter and amendments were made and forwarded by the Federal Republic of Germany and the Holy See, Ireland, Malta and the Philippines, seeking the inclusion of that phrase `before as well as after birth', the idea was to carry it into the preamble of the Convention-at least this was the outcome-in the terms that we have before us. It is not exactly equivalent to the words in the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. The preamble says:</PARA>
<PARA> Bearing in mind that as indicated in the Declaration of the Rights of the Child adopted by the General Assembly of the UN on 20 November 1959 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Then the words in quotes are an exact replication. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nevertheless, there they are. Both points are in the preamble. I believe that there is an equivalence in that sense. That obviously satisfied the working group and the Human Rights Commission which considered the report of the working group. I believe that we can see the origins of paragraph 9 in the preamble to the Convention and we can see the equivalence with paragraph 3 of the preamble to the Declaration of the Rights of the Child.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Principle 4 in the Declaration of the Rights of the Child is not reproduced in the Convention in the same terms. As I understand it, Mr Burdekin is making the claim that, if one looks at various other substantive articles and at their overall impact and effect, one will find that the matters of concern in Principle 4 are covered in the various articles which he outlines. For example, it is said within Principle 4 of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child that the child-and I paraphrase-is entitled to adequate pre-natal and post-natal care. Obviously that is an important matter which goes somewhat to the question which Senator Harradine is concerned about. Article 24 (1), which is included in Mr Burdekin's response which I have forwarded to Senator Harradine, states:</PARA>
<PARA>States parties recognise the right of the child to enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Article 24 (2) states:</PARA>
<PARA> States Parties shall pursue full implementation of this right and, in particular, shall take appropriate measures:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) To diminish infant and child mortality</PARA>
<PARA> (b) To ensure the provision of necessary medical assistance and health care to all children . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (c) To ensure appropriate health care for expectant mothers. </PARA>
<PARA>I imagine that if one provides appropriate health care for expectant mothers there is a recognition that the child to be borne and carried within the womb of the expectant mother is quite clearly as much the beneficiary of that prenatal care as is the mother herself. In other words, the appropriate health care for expectant mothers is by definition appropriate health care also for the child she is expecting to bring into the world. </PARA>
<PARA> In these various ways-whether it is article 24, article 6 or article 3, as mentioned in Mr Burdekin's response-Mr Burdekin believes that the types of concerns which prompted Principle 4 have been sufficiently carried into the Convention. I understand that to be his particular claim and I think it obviously has persuasive influence. I do not know precisely whether the working party and the Commission saw it in exactly the same way but quite clearly one would imagine that the working party and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission would not wish to give up the objectives which were sought to be obtained by adherence to Principle 4 and would want to see those carried into the Convention. Mr Burdekin has pointed to those articles which he believes carry those objectives through to the Convention stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel like leaving the matter there because, if what Senator Tate considers has happened has in fact happened, it would appear that he feels that the Convention on the Rights of the Child gives protection to the unborn child. But I then go to what the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission itself has said in its annual report entitled Human Rights Australia. I asked a question about that in the Estimates Committee when I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the document . . . `What does the convention say about abortion laws in Australia' says that the Convention does not change the situation in any country concerning whether or not an embryo is a human being and it was a deliberate decision of the nations that drafted this Convention to leave this issue to each country's own laws. </PARA>
<PARA>I asked, quite appropriately I thought, a question of Mr Burdekin about that deliberate decision. In the letter that I sent to the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate), I asked:</PARA>
<PARA>When was that `deliberate decision' made? What are the terms of that decision? What does it mean? What is meant by the words `an embryo is a human being'?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer is contained on page 2 of the response by Mr Burdekin. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>The decision to leave the definition of the point at which an embryo or foetus is legally regarded as a human being to the legal system of each country was not one made by a formal vote. It was the consensus of the Working Group that no definitive solution to this issue could achieve universal or widespread acceptance. </PARA>
<PARA>That was not really what I asked. The Commission said that it was a deliberate decision. I do not have an answer and I want an answer to the question of when that deliberate decision was made. That is a perfectly simple question: when was the decision made? I also asked what the terms of that decision were and what it means? These are simple questions which Mr Burdekin should have responded to but has not. I would like to have a response in respect of those matters and some of the other questions of fact that are contained in this letter which are not responded to. I refer to the group of questions on page 2 at point No. 3 of my letter. I referred to the statement made to Estimates Committee E that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission was a special adviser to the working party. Mr Burdekin's response was a real fob-off. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Human Rights Commission was not in fact a special advisor to the Working Group . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I did not ask that question. I asked the question following a statement about the working party by an officer of the Human Rights Commission. Mr Burdekin went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . but was a special advisor to the Australian delegation to the Working Group. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say what the working group was. I wanted to know who comprised the working party referred to by the officer of the Human Rights Commission, what that working party was and what advice the Human Rights Commissioner gave to the working party and/or officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in recognition of the rights of the unborn child. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA>When and where was such advice given and with what result? Did the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade take this advice? If not what were the reasons given to HREOC by DFAT?</PARA>
<PARA>They are simple questions. In order to understand all of the questions that have come to mind I think it is fair enough that one should have a response. It is appropriate that one should get a response from Mr Burdekin. I do not want to belabour the point. I know that Mr Burdekin did not know that I would be covering that particular Committee. In fairness to the Minister for Justice, I know that other senior people from the Department which he represents were there. I only thought of doing this on the run about two days beforehand. I do not want to hold up the Committee, Madam Chair but if I could have a guarantee that I could get some answers in respect of that, I think my duty at this stage would be satisfied. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can do better than that; I will try to answer some of those questions. The preamble and, in particular, paragraph 9 have to be read in conjunction with article 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child which says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>For the purposes of the present Convention a child means every human being below the age of 18 years unless, under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier. </PARA>
<PARA>It can quite readily be seen there that a maximum age is set for the Convention's applicability to a human being under the label, title or usage `child'. But a minimum is not set. Therefore it is open to the various states parties to the Convention to have the ability within their own jurisdictions and according to their own laws to indicate what shall count as a human being-and therefore child in the sense of not being adult-for the purposes of the laws within each jurisdiction. As I understand it, the various parties to the working group and to the Commission were concerned to acknowledge the force of carrying through the words of the third paragraph of the declaration; that is that a child, by reason of his physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth. But, as I am advised, when one looks at the history of the final session of the working group and the outcome of the negotiations, one sees that the parties did not want that minimum time at which the existence of a human being comes into being to be determined by that preambular paragraph. I refer Senator Harradine to an interpretive statement, which was placed in what is known as the traveaux preparatories, on behalf of the entire working group, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> In adopting this preambular paragraph the working group does not intend to prejudice the interpretation of article 1 or any other provision of the Convention by state parties. </PARA>
<PARA>We have there an indication that it was the understanding of the working group and of the Commission on Human Rights, which adopted the final report of that working group in March 1989, that whilst accepting the amendment, which I think is a very good one, proposed by the Federal Republic of Germany, the Holy See, Malta, the Philippines and Ireland, and carrying through that important paragraph from the Declaration, it was not understood to govern the interpretation of article 1. In other words, it leaves it to the states parties themselves, in accordance with their own laws and in response to their own norms, both ethical and political, which govern their law-making authorities, to determine when a human being comes into existence. That fills out a little more what is contained in the advice to Senator Harradine in answer to his fourth question. I think it is the correct answer and I think I have given Senator Harradine a little more substance undergirding the answer. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the final point as to whether Mr Burdekin was an adviser to the working party, the Hansard record, in a discussion between Senator Harradine, Mr Chapman and me, states:</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Chapman" NAMEID="FF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Mr Chapman</NAME></TALKER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that these delegations are, in fact, Foreign Affairs delegations to which the Human Rights Commissioner, or a member of the Commission, is invited as an aide to the Foreign Affairs delegation to that international conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I think that is the way in which it works. This has been the common practice for some years. It is perhaps a better way of putting it. It seems to be in harmony with the answer given that the Human Rights Commissioner was a special adviser to the Australian delegation to the working group. I hope I have clarified the further points raised by Senator Harradine. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From what the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) has said, no protection is given in the document to the unborn child. That is what it means. There is no protection in the document, as distinct from the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. That is the point I was attempting to make. Mr Burdekin should be answerable to this Parliament about this. When the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act was enacted, I, as well as others, were present in the chamber. There was a deliberate decision to include the Declaration of the Rights of the Child as schedule 3 to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission legislation. Certain rights of the unborn child-although this is only a declaration, without the force of a convention-were clearly recognised in that document. They were recognised in the preamble and in principle 4. Of course, principle 4 is to be read in conjunction with the preamble in respect of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Surely, it was the responsibility of the Human Rights Commissioner to attempt, because he is governed by this Act of Parliament, to have those provisions placed in the Convention with equal status and force. I am not talking about the status of a declaration as compared with a convention; everybody knows that. I am talking about the schedule of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act and I am talking about the responsibility of the Human Rights Commissioner to ensure that the provisions therein are inserted with equal force and status in the new Convention which replaces the Declaration, and they have not been. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said, `Yes, there is in the preamble to the new Convention a reference to the Declaration and the words of that Declaration'. The Convention does not even contain those words. The Convention states, in effect, `having in mind the words contained in the Declaration of the Rights of the Child'. That is not good enough. But even taking that into consideration, the Minister now says that there is a statement in the traveaux preparatoires. I know that. I asked what action was taken by the Human Rights Commissioner to ensure that the clauses in the Declaration of the Rights of the Child-the preambular clause and the operative clause-which related to the child's entitlement to grow, et cetera and the child's entitlement to adequate prenatal and post-natal care, were included in the Convention. The Minister has come back with this gobbledegook about the states parties ensuring to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the question: Does that mean the survival and development of the unborn child? Is that what Mr Burdekin is saying? If it is not what he is saying, why did he not give a straightforward answer? I want an answer to my question: what advice did the Human Rights Commissioner give to the working party and officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the recognition of the rights of the unborn child? Of course I know what happens in these commissions of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. But it was not me who said that the Commissioner was the person who was advised; it was the representative of the Commission itself who said at the Committee that it was a human, and made a big thing about the Human Rights Commissioner being very active in this area. What I want to know and what the Parliament and people are entitled to know is what advice the Human Rights Commissioner gave to the working party on the recognition of the rights of the unborn child. I want to know when and where that advice was given and with what results. Those questions have not been answered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know that I can expect an answer to the question in the terms that Senator Harradine has posed it. I think he is correct in pointing out that the proper role of the Commissioner is related to the legislation of this Parliament and therefore to the appendices, including the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, and his particular role is to seek to ensure that the statutory charter that he has is observed, certainly within Australia. When it comes to international conferences, which are designed to achieve a new expression of international sentiment concerning the rights of children, quite clearly he would be properly able to indicate to the Australian delegation the ways in which the Declaration, in other words the statutory charter, operated and was to be interpreted, and how that might relate to any proposals that were up for the consideration of the Australian delegation. Obviously, he is only one of many people who are concerned in the discussions that would take place. I do not suppose they would all be confined to a formal record; they would be taking place no doubt as amendments were circulated, as apparently they were at the final session of the working group which led to the restoration of the reference to paragraph 3 of the preamble of the declaration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It may or may not be that some recall of advice to that delegation is possible. Quite clearly, the final position of the Australian Government is a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, as put to the international conference concerned-the Commission in this case-the working group, then the Commission and then the United Nations by the delegation concerned, and it is a Foreign Affairs delegation quite clearly. Whether it is able to disclose the sort of advice which it might receive from time to time from its advisers will be a question to which I will seek to find an answer for Senator Harradine. In looking at the Hansard of this afternoon's proceedings, we will see whether any further advice may be forwarded to him in relation to his questions as to the precise role of the Human Rights Commissioner. </PARA>

<PARA> We all know that this is a very complex area. I have tried to convey the understanding of the states involved in the working group, including the Holy See and the Commission, and no doubt it was conscious of those sorts of understandings and reservations that would have been available to those various nations which signified or consented to the adoption of the Convention in the United Nations General Assembly two or three nights ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a couple of questions in the business and consumer affairs areas of the Department. First of all, I want to say something about the Trade Practices Commission (TPC) although I am not sure that the Minister would wish to respond. It seems to me that there may be changes in the direction in which the Commission is going. This causes me some concern if only in the sense that the changes appear to be taking place without necessarily ministerial guidance and direction and certainly without the involvement of this Parliament. I congratulate the Trade Practices Commission on its achievements in the past year. It has done a considerable amount of work. It has had several very large inquiries in terms of the use of market power. It has looked at the many merger proposals. It has looked at the resale price maintenance area, unconscionable conduct, unsolicited advertising, and other aspects of fair trading. All that work is to be commended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, as I said at the outset, I am concerned about the impression that I have that the Trade Practices Commission is being diverted from what I would have regarded as its real job, and I will come to that a little later. That is not to say that the matters to which I have just referred are not part of the Commission's real job. The evidence and discussion that we had in the Estimates Committee hearings showed that more and more of the Commission's staff, time and resources are being spent on issues and in areas which the Commission does not have the necessary expertise to consider, analyse and make judgments about, and it is a moot point as to whether it has the legislative backing. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the encroachment of this new unofficial role on the Trade Practices Commission's work is that there are increasing criticisms-and certainly I get them from industry-that it is stifling the ability of Australian businesses to operate in a free, open and competitive market environment and produce the quality and variety of goods that Australian consumers so rightly expect. Over the last 12 months in particular I have received many representations from individuals both inside and outside industry which raised this concern and it is because of those representations that I raise them here. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a perception-accurate or not-in some quarters at least that the Trade Practices Commission seems to be getting involved in anything and everything. In other words, it has been put to me that the Commission is reinterpreting its charter on its own initiative, certainly without the knowledge and involvement of Parliament. This raises the real question of whether the Minister responsible is running the show or whether it is being run by others. I had planned to raise this issue in the Senate Estimates hearings, but at that time, after a couple of questions, it was clear in my view that the Commission was not as broadly represented at the Estimates hearings as it might have been. As a result, it seemed futile to pursue some of the questions that I would have otherwise asked, despite the fact that I had advised the Department of my intentions well in advance. The Minister and I did have some discussions on this matter during the Estimates hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation governing the activities of the Trade Practices Commission, namely the Trade Practices Act 1974, is quite clear about its role. Primarily, the role of the Commission is to administer the Act, which in turn is designed to ensure that competition operates in the marketplace. It is to assess practices in terms of competition issues and, as I understand it, the underlying philosophy of the Act is that if the market is able to work properly and fairly, that will cause consumers' interests to be best served. It is certainly not that anything that is of interest to consumers should necessarily fall within the ambit of the Trade Practices Commission. Essentially, the Commission is meant to be a market competition agency rather than a consumer agency. In more recent years the Commission has become involved in areas which it either does not have the expertise to consider, analyse and make judgments about or in which it possibly lacks legislative backing. </PARA>
<PARA> Also it is the case that the Commission is increasingly adopting what I would call elsewhere an anti-consumer consumerist approach, which involves more government regulations and interference, and a greater role for self-appointed consumerist activists, rather than consumers per se. There is a significant difference between the two. The recent inquiry into substitute breast milk has involved a large cost in terms of both money and staff time. There is a question mark over this matter and I would like the Minister to comment, if he is able to do so, as to just where the initiative came from for the Trade Practices Commission-as distinct from the Department of Health-to get involved in that substitute breast milk project. Was it generated from within the Commission, or was it something that was given to the Commission from other sources?</PARA>
<PARA> The recent smokeless tobacco judgment is another instance of the TPC getting into areas where it has no experience to adjudicate and again pursuing the anti-consumer consumerist approach. In the smokeless tobacco case I am advised that the Trade Practices Commission's own analysis of the scientific data proved to be inconsistent with its final recommendations. I do not know whether the Minister has any advisers with him or whether he is in a position to comment on that, but that was the advice that I received. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission is also promoting a new form of industry regulation away from self-regulation towards what it describes as co-regulation. I have just received answers to questions that I put during the Estimates hearings, which were not available whilst the hearings were continuing, on exactly what proportion of the Commission's time is spent on this broad area. Last year the figure was 14.8 per cent which, as I understand it, is a significant increase on earlier figures and quite a significant use of the resources of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the traditional self-regulation system, industry and government work together to devise codes under which the industry will operate. The Trade Practices Commission is the arm of government that assists in that process but, under the new system of co-regulation that is being advocated by both the Commission and some of the consumerist groups, in particular the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations (AFCO) and the Australian Consumers Association, there is an extra element, that is, more groups, particularly some of those consumerist groups, will be involved in the setting up of the codes. My main problem with that-and I would certainly welcome a comment from the Minister-is whether these organisations are really representative of the consumers to which the operations of the code are directed. These groups, particularly AFCO and the Australian Consumers Association, receive virtually all their money from taxpayers. I will not be ungenerous to them, but their approach is essentially an anti-business approach and I really wonder how closely relevant their views and actions are to the real interests of Australian consumers. They are some matters that have concerned me. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that at the present time, and for some time, morale at the Trade Practices Commission has been pretty low. At the Senate Estimates hearings we were told that over the past 12 months the staff turnover has been `something like 50 per cent' and that this is occurring at `all levels'. It is not clear as to the reason for this very high staff turnover and the reason why morale at the Commission is low. I have heard some suggestions that it could be importantly related to this change in direction that the Commission seems to be taking and, if that is the case, they are matters that this Parliament ought, if not be concerned about, at least know just what the background is and what the facts are so that we can be in a position to make considered and reasonable judgments on these matters. Of course, consumer competition policy and practice in Australia is absolutely fundamental not just to the interests of the Australian consumer but also to the future well-being and economic development of the nation, and the Trade Practices Commission has a very important role to play in all of this. I would be very concerned if in fact there was a drift away from its operations which do improve consumer interests and which do improve and increase our competitiveness in an increasingly competitive world. I guess I am making that as a bit of a statement, but I would welcome any response that the Minister can make. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems unfortunate that Senator Short has not gone back to the Estimates Committee Hansard of 23 October 1989, which deals with a couple of matters that I have heard him mention, apart from his general speech, to which he obviously does not expect a response. On page E329 I find the answers to his questions. In fact, one of the answers is at variance with his assertion as to what occurred. For example, on that page the following appears:</PARA></TALK.START>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it was either at the last Estimates hearing or this time last year that we discussed the question of morale within the Commission. I think at that stage, from memory, there was a feeling that morale could do with a bit of a boost. What is the morale situation like in the Commission now?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Spier-I think the morale is generally high. We have a very activist chairman. We, having been given extra functions, some extra resources, basically think the Commission's morale is good. Staff are generally busy, which certainly helps morale. There are always some problems. Staff turnover does not help because work falls back upon others whilst new staff are being trained, but basically I think morale is good. </PARA>
<PARA>Certainly that was the evidence put before the Committee. Senator Short asked where certain interests and projects of the Trade Practices Commission originated. I think he mentioned, for example, the question of breast milk substitutes. I notice that, just by accident, on the same page of the Hansard the following appears:</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So the Department of Health made the request on the breast milk substitutes, rather than any initiative at all coming from the TPC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Spier-That is certainly my understanding, yes. </PARA>
<PARA>So there is an answer to one of the honourable senator's questions. Other questions raised were about cosmetics, bar coding and so on, as well as breast milk substitutes. They are in an area which I suppose is a consumer issue and a trade practices issue. The Commission is trying to deal with certain marketplace problems; it is trying to encourage people to engage in a form of regulation in relation to these matters and is trying to help them put together guidelines which will govern activity in relation to those matters. </PARA>
<PARA> What I cannot let pass is Senator Short's continued assertion that he made a request about his interest in Trade Practices Commission matters which was passed on to the Department. From the discussion during the Estimates Committee hearing and from a letter that I forwarded to the Estimates Committee on 25 October after that meeting, when we went back and looked through the files, as I said at that meeting, it was found that the original facsimile message received from Estimates Committee E contained questions on notice asked by Senator Short. It also noted on the attached copy that the documents did not contain the letter sent by Senator Short to the Committee secretary. In other words, Senator Short's letter was never forwarded to the Department. I do not in any way seek to apportion blame, but it is quite clear that the Committee secretariat did not pass on that particular letter. I made that clear at the time and it was made clear again in written form, and I just wish to put it on the record. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the attendance of Mr Spier, he has attended on previous occasions and been found to be adequate to the concerns of honourable senators. I believe he is certainly sufficiently highly placed to represent the Commission in regard to most matters. If Senator Short wishes Professor Baxt to appear next time, I will certainly be happy to try to arrange that. </PARA>

From different sources there are views that morale at the Commission is not as good as it might be. That is a matter upon which we might have to agree to disagree, but I think, in my understanding, it would be wrong to assume that morale in the Commission by and large is necessarily as good as sometimes we might think.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want also to make a couple of points about the National Consumer Affairs Advisory Council, which falls into this area as well. I note that there was some discussion of this at the Estimates Committee hearing, but I did want to draw the attention of the Committee to the report for the period 1987-89 of the National Consumer Affairs Advisory Council, which spans the two years of the term of the Chairman, Justice Paul Stein. I want to comment on only one particular part of the report of the Council. I think the report as a whole is important and covers a wide range of important issues, but the section that I did want to address is the Council's comments and views on the operation of the national prices network. Those views are expressed on pages 27 and 28 of the Council's report. There has been debate on the national prices network in this and other places on more than one occasion in the last couple of years. We on this side of the Chamber have said consistently, and maintain the view, that the national prices network has been a Labor Party propaganda exercise. I found it very interesting to read on page 28 of the report of the National Consumer Affairs Advisory Council that it also appears to believe that that impression could be held. Page 28 states:</PARA>
<PARA> After monitoring the activities of the Price Watch Network, Council advised the Minister in April 1988 of its concern at the apparent inability of the National Price Watch Co-ordinating Committee to overcome community confusion resulting from a lack of cooperation between the Federal Government's program and those of the States. Council observed that this matter, plus the still apparent community perception that the Price Watch Network is an ALP exercise and not a government initiative, helped to undermine its credibility. </PARA>
<PARA>The Council also alludes to the fact that the funding for the national prices network was coming from various sources. The Department of Administrative Services, Treasury and Consumer Affairs all seem to have played a role. </PARA>
<PARA> There is obviously confusion, as described in the report, over who actually has responsibility for the NPN. The Department of Administrative Services says that the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) has the responsibility but, as I understand it, the Minister does not necessarily share that view. Page 28 of the Consumer Affairs Advisory Council report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Council accordingly recommended that the National Price Watch Co-ordinating Committee be brought directly under the control of the Minister for Consumer Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister advised Council that . . . this arrangement gave the Network more credibility than it might have were it attached to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>When one takes into account all the costs from the various sources, the annual total cost of the national prices network is about $250,000. I would like to hear from the Minister whether he believes that the problems alluded to in the Consumer Affairs Advisory Council's report have been dealt with and, if he believes they have been dealt with, whether the perception to which the Council alluded, namely, that the national prices network is an Australian Labor Party exercise and not a Government initiative, is a matter of concern to the Government. </PARA>

I must say that I am not really in a position to give an adequate answer to the honourable senator.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One other issue with which I would like to deal briefly relates to the evidence that was given and the discussion in the Estimates Committee in relation to the Australian Securities Commission (ASC). It seemed to me that the proposals for the operation of the ASC, which Mr Hartnell outlined in his remarks, took the cost of the ASC, on his estimates, to a much higher figure than had ever been contemplated in this Parliament in the very long debates we had leading up to the passage of the legislation. Senator Durack has mentioned today some of these matters in relation to the ASC and its location but, in terms of the number of resources and the actual cost, it seemed that there was a great degree of uncertainty as to just how much the final cost would be in the course of the next year or so. The figures seem to be higher than those contemplated by Parliament when this matter was debated. I realise that an important part of the figures and the total amounts we discussed in the Estimates Committee related to the cost of the corporate affairs commissions in the various States and they would be included in the total.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments on whether Mr Hartnell's views about the operation and the costing of the exercise are in line with the Government's expectations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I may not be doing justice to the full discussion at the time, but at page E137 Mr Hartnell indicated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first year which will have substantial capital costs will be next year. On a broad brush basis we estimate that next year it would be about $130m. </PARA>
<PARA>I am advised that that $130m was an indication of the estimated cost of running it during the first year, the up-front initial capital costs and so on. Further discussion took place, and then at page E138 Mr Hartnell pointed out that the funding for the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission in the year ended 30 June 1988 was just under $30m. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The total funding around Australia in the year ended 1988 for all corporate affairs commissions and the NCSC was-and this is off the top of my head-in excess of $80m. </PARA>
<PARA>He also stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in addition to the continuing role, what we are doing is adding some things that have never existed before such as national service, because the Commonwealth cannot deliver a national companies and securities scheme unless in every location in Australia you can get national service; and that is a big ticket item. That has never existed before. That requires a staff commitment and we are currently budgeting for around 250 staff in addition to what exists today. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Short asked:</PARA>
<PARA>By national service you mean a national information-type service?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hartnell replied:</PARA>
<PARA>Yes. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that evidence provides some indication of how a broad figure, I suppose a guesstimate to some extent, has been arrived at by Mr Hartnell and by Mr Skehill, who also gave us the benefit of his best guesses at page E137. That evidence indicates the broad parameters. At page E139 Senator Durack asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Could we have the details of that-just the tables?</PARA>
<PARA>I think he was referring to the staff allocation around Australia. Mr Hartnell replied:</PARA>
<PARA>I do not want to appear next year and be told I got it wrong; these are our best guesses from the dizzy heights of a little office that I am currently maintaining. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hartnell then provided estimates of employment in various regions. I believe that Senator Short is correct when the says that there is not a great degree of precision. There is some indication of the reasons why the expenditure is greater than that of the National Companies and Securities Commission and the various corporate affairs bodies around Australia. But I believe that we will be in a better position as the year goes on. No doubt, as the year goes on and before Estimates committees resume, we can try to get some further details as matters become clearer. </PARA>

I raise the matter again because I have been back to my office and have found that what Senator Tate said in response to one of my questions is not entirely accurate. I pointed out that the title `non-violent erotica' for X-rated videos was being pushed by the hard core pornography trade and had been adopted by Mr Dickie, the Chief Censor. I asked Senator Tate why the title had been adopted, because it had no legislative base and was not a factual representation of the material in X-rated videos. Senator Tate said that it was only an internal matter within the film censorship board and that the film censorship board classifies this material as X.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In a debate on an Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio station today the publicist for the Adult Video Industry Association, Robbie Swan, in defence of the hard core pornographers who use the title `non-violent erotica' on X-rated video slicks, said that the Chief Censor uses that term in the official publication of the Office of Film and Literature Classification, a title which I think is used without legislative foundation. So it is not an internal thing. They are using it officially on their material without any legislative base. I was careful to note the deliberate refusal of the Minister for Justice to agree with what Mr Dickie said in the Estimates Committee about the use of the phrase `non-violent erotica' to describe certain X-rated videos. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise this with the Committee now so that the Minister can ensure that the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) is aware of this, so that the Attorney-General, in turn, can ensure that during this publicity campaign the Office of Film and Literature Classification and the Chief Censor do not use that term `non-violent erotica' to describe X-rated videos and desist from using that term in the official publications. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In giving my answer earlier, I was relying on pages E148 and E149 of the transcript of evidence where Mr Dickie, in response to Senator Harradine asking about the use of the term `non-violent erotica', said this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>These are guidelines which I suppose depict in shorthand form what we consider the material is in each category. The non-violent erotica is a shorthand way of saying what we would regard as material which is an X, which we use as a descriptive . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Further on, on page E149, Mr Dickie said this:</PARA>
<PARA>Could I just clarify something. We classify material as X. We do not use `non-violent erotica' on the label. If it goes out it has an X category label on it which says, `Completely concerned with sex, not available to people under the age of 18' or whatever it is. `Non-violent erotica' is a shorthand description that we have used ourselves. It does not appear on the labels, or on our classification. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the distinction I was trying to convey to the Committee of the Whole earlier. I do not know whether it appears in any other official publication of the Film Board of Review.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 7 November, about 2 1/2 weeks ago, I visited two Aboriginal communities-the Baryulgil and Malabugilmah communities-in north-eastern New South Wales at the request of members of those communities. I must admit that I was stunned by what I found there even though I had had previous discussions with the members of those two unique Aboriginal communities in Australia. I will discuss their uniqueness in a moment. The experience of 7 November was a fairly profound one for me. I witnessed what I believe is a national and international disgrace in terms of the circumstances in which these people find themselves, the history of those circumstances and the response of government bureaucracies and the Australian community at large to those circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most honourable senators will be aware that Baryulgil is an Aboriginal community with between 100 and 150 permanent residents. It has become notable by virtue of the fact that it provided essentially a labour pool for James Hardies asbestos mine located nearby-a mine which began operation in 1942 and operated continuously until 1979-with significant and very grave consequences for those who provided the labour pool in support of that multinational company. For most of that period the members of the community who lived nearby and provided the labour pool were not aware that they were engaging in what is now known to be the extremely hazardous occupation of asbestos mining. Progressively, as they and the authorities have become aware of this, the issue has become increasingly complicated. The Baryulgil community is living with the consequences of having been a labour pool servicing an extremely hazardous occupation. </PARA>
<PARA> The other community, Malabugilmah, is a relatively new community which was developed in an attempt to relocate those from Baryulgil. That sincere and genuine attempt to resolve a difficult situation unfortunately has failed and has somewhat compounded the difficulties confronting the 200 or so people who live permanently in the area a little north-west of Grafton, a little south-west of Lismore and in the foothills of the Washpool State Forest-for the benefit of those who are not sure of the geography of those communities. They are isolated Aboriginal communities. Traditionally, they see this as their place but they have been subjected to the arrival of pastoralists, foresters and miners, and they have accommodated the impact of all those influences upon their traditional lifestyle. </PARA>
<PARA> I am being quite sincere when I say that this is truly a national and international tragedy because I believe that what has unfolded in that community, particularly during the 1960s and 1970s, was tantamount to slavery. We had people servicing the needs of a multinational company which was mining similar substances in other countries, including South Africa. I have it on reasonable advice that the conditions which prevailed in the mines in this community in the 1960s and 1970s were inferior to those which prevailed in other mines, for instance, those in South Africa. I do not believe that we can shy away from the social and economic realities that existed at that time; nor can we shy away from the subsequent implications as a result of what those people experienced. The results are: a debilitated community in terms of health; a community which has attempted genuinely to resolve its problems, which has found itself interfacing with a wide range of government departments, both Federal and State, but has not had its problems resolved satisfactorily; a community in which many are ill; a community which is divided in terms of its location; a community that is living in a hazardous environment; a community that is disillusioned; a community that is frustrated; and a community that is increasingly angry. </PARA>
<PARA> My purpose in introducing this matter in the context of the appropriations is that there could not be a more appropriate context in which to pose the following series of questions: What is the Government doing about this problem? What resources are being directed towards it? If no resources are being allocated, why not? If they are, what is their magnitude, and what is the expected outcome from their expenditure? That is a series of legitimate questions to put in the context of the appropriations debate. I do not intend to cut the question short; I intend to extend the discussion. Members of the Baryulgil community have come here to listen to it. I have deliberately primed the community to hear the outcome of this discussion because I believe the time has come-it has a lot to do with time because time is the essence in this whole process-for some effective action. There has been a lot of talk but very little outcome. I do not doubt the sincerity of the words and the endeavours; I am just citing the fact that there has been very little effective action to address the very real problems confronting the people of these two communities. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said, by way of background, that the mine was established in 1942 and continued to operate until 1979. The James Hardie company operated the mine for most of that time and employed in excess of 400 people. The community that provided and serviced that labour requirement has been located somewhat less than a kilometre away from the site of the now disused mine. It is, on the judgment of all those who have been there, an environmental hazard and will remain so until effective measures and steps are taken to rectify it. </PARA>
<PARA> So serious was the problem that a House of Representatives committee looked into it and tabled a report in October 1984. The title of the report was The Effects of Asbestos Mining on the Baryulgil Community. The committee was chaired by Mr Gerry Hand who was then a backbencher but is now the Minister responsible. He obviously has an intimate knowledge of the difficulties of this community. Mr Hand has told me that he had a personal commitment to the community. I do not doubt that. The realities are that nothing is happening. It may well be a function of the lack of resources-a lack of the dollars that we are talking about here tonight-or a function of numerous other things. There is no doubt that none of the 10 recommendations which are in the first two pages of the preliminary section of this report has been effectively implemented. They raise a whole series of difficulties. The first recommendation touches upon a very real dimension of the problem. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>That the Attorneys-General of the Commonwealth and NSW consider ways and means whereby the technical difficulties presented by Aboriginality in seeking compensation may be removed. </PARA>
<PARA>I cite the words `difficulties presented by Aboriginality'. There is an acknowledgment in the first recommendation that these people are in a unique situation. In the first recommendation the uniqueness of their situation focuses on the question of achieving compensation. I believe that the uniqueness of being Aboriginal in this country pervades everything that has flowed from the circumstances in Baryulgil. The second recommendation-which is at the end of a lot of documented, thorough evidence-is:</PARA>
<PARA>That the Commonwealth establish an Aboriginal Medical Service based in Grafton to cater for the general health needs of the local Aboriginal communities and having expertise in the diagnosis and management of asbestos-related diseases.</PARA>
<PARA>That has not happened. There is no health service there after five years. I know there are reasons why there is no health service. I ask whether there is any allocation in the $493m under this heading in appropriations to establish the health service in Grafton? If so, how many dollars? What health service is envisaged? When is it envisaged that it will be on the ground? I will continue to ask questions about all aspects of the provision of the health service. The report then goes into a series of recommendations which compound the whole issue, and many of them are similar. It involves the Commonwealth Minister for Aboriginal Affairs recommending to the New South Wales Government the passing of legislation. It is extraordinary that a community should find itself dependent upon the recommendation of a Commonwealth Minister to a State Government. The fourth recommendation attempts to resolve the problem of what is called Baryulgil Square and its leasing. It is a matter of whether the Aborigines have the right to consider it theirs, under what conditions, for what period of time and how many of them would have the right. The third and fourth recommendations involve the Commonwealth Minister for Aboriginal Affairs recommending to the New South Wales Government that it offer a lease to certain Aborigines; in other words, that they deal with the Square problem. The fifth recommendation is:</PARA>
<PARA>That the Commonwealth Department of Aboriginal Affairs continue to use every effort to persuade the residents of Baryulgil Square to move . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Encouraging people to move to another location simply compounded the whole issue. If such a move were not done voluntarily and effectively, it would create a series of difficult spin-offs. I put to the Minister the first of a series of questions. It focuses on the second recommendation for an Aboriginal health service. Does any appropriation focus on the establishment of an Aboriginal health service in Grafton? If so, what is the amount of the appropriation; in what time frame will it be expended; and what will be delivered at the end of that expenditure?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand it, a health worker is employed at Baryulgil Square to improve community access to general health services. That has been in place for some two years at a cost of $59,300. I am surprised that Senator McLean does not appear to know that. As I understand it, there is an appropriation for that to continue during the course of this financial year. The health worker services that community. Quite clearly, the question of health services is a very difficult but important one. Senator McLean will know that over a three-year period some $36,000 was spent on a survey. That comprehensive medical survey final report was made available in September 1988. It recommended the establishment of a service, although earlier reports had noted that many community members were happy with the general public health facilities available, provided that transport to these facilities could be improved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note as a supplementary matter that in response to representations the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs approached the State Health Minister when it was suggested that the Bonalbo Hospital might close. That hospital is the closest facility to many of the communities in that area and it was agreed that the hospital should remain open. At the moment final proposals are under consideration although a view has developed that the proposed medical service might best be based at Bonalbo Hospital rather than Grafton. It is also important to note that the State Government has established a dedicated Aboriginal health team working from the Grafton hospital to service communities in the valley. The position in regard to the honourable senator's more specific question is that there is funding to allow the employment of a health worker and that health worker conducts a service for the community at Baryulgil Square. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The community at Baryulgil is not convinced that the process of establishing an effective health service is under way, even after five years. Some 600-plus people would be involved if a survey was made of the state of health of that community. Approximately 400-odd people worked in the mines; in addition, there were those who lived in the environment and those who now live in it. I understand that health officers have carried out a partial survey and that 84 people have been medically examined to varying degrees. Of those 84 people, 14 have been diagnosed as having complaints which could reasonably be described as asbestos related. It has been argued to me outside this place that that is a sufficient sample to arrive at a conclusion about the health state of that community. I am not prepared to accept that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been asked, for instance, to put up evidence about the health state of that community. The real evidence is literally buried in the cemetery at Baryulgil. The report mentions that 100 people may have died as a result of diseases contracted from working in the mines, but none of us will ever know the realities. It has been suggested that because I cannot cite a series of autopsies, I cannot provide the sort of hard evidence required. A number of autopsies have been done, but only recently. The culture of the Aboriginal people does not readily accept that practice. Perhaps I cannot provide hard evidence, but there is sufficient evidence around to establish clearly a relationship between exposure to asbestos, whether blue or white, and the occurrence of diseases, particularly diseases of the lungs. The authorities have been constantly revising the figures about levels of safe exposure. Constantly, for 30 years, the figures have been revised downwards as to what is considered to be a safe level of exposure. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I4">Senator McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Okay, the Government has acknowledged the health risk and it has indicated the need to undertake a health service. I am really saying that the health service is not being satisfactorily established. I am being told that the first step is to establish the need by survey. I am being told that the survey has been, or is being, done. I do not think that the survey has produced valid answers as yet and may never do so. Nor do I believe that an effective health service has been established.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have taken a count from a list of the names and have come up with approximately 418 persons who have lived or worked in the environment. I think that this list was compiled by the people to whom the Minister has referred but I am not sure. However, I think that this list is the outcome. Of those 418 people, my rough calculation is that 80 per cent have never been medically examined and approximately 20 per cent have. The final calculation may be a slight variation on that. </PARA>
<PARA> My simple point is that the surveying that has been done to date is inadequate. It has not impacted upon the community at large to establish what its needs are. It certainly has not convinced the community at large that its risks are being acknowledged seriously and taken seriously. Nor has it given rise to a health centre at Grafton which is proposed in recommendation 2. That health centre does not exist at the relocated community at Malabugilmah, even though it is shown on the grand plan for Malabugilmah. It is not there. People visiting Malabugilmah will see that it is a disaster. The plans did not happen. Virtually none of the things that were proposed for the relocated centre has happened. So these people are frustrated about the health centre. The Minister has quoted a figure of $56,000 expended so far on employing people to do a survey which I suggest has not produced the realities and it will not produce them at that pace in the next three years. It will not give rise to an effective health centre possibly within the next five years. </PARA>
<PARA> Time is of the essence. For some of these people time is ticking away and it is valuable and precious because they have advancing diseases. We do not know the dimension of the medical problem within the community. Frankly, I am not convinced by the Minister's response to this first dimension which is the dimension of health. I have been to the community. I believe that the people are living in a disastrous environment. A person can literally pick up handfuls of asbestos dust. I did so two weeks ago. The preschool, in fact the whole village, is built on what is appropriately called shivers. It is a chilling expression. The reality is that the Square was filled with asbestos waste. The preschool is built on it. The residences are built on it. The roads are made out of it. It leaches off the mine site into the water supply. </PARA>
<PARA> These people are assured, of course, that their water supply is not contaminated and that they will not suffer any ill effect by the leaching off the mine site into the creek which supplies them with water. Twenty years ago when it was being established that asbestos was a dangerous substance these people were told that white asbestos did not affect Aborigines. They are very reluctant to accept this statement that their water supply will not be contaminated. They are very reluctant to accept the statement that the site has been adequately rehabilitated. They are very reluctant to accept the assurances that, provided the kids do not disturb the school yard, which has been covered with about two inches of topsoil, with their shoes, bare feet, fingers or sticks or whatever else or dig down to the actual asbestos dust beneath it, they are not at risk. They are very reluctant to accept these assurances because they were told that white asbestos does not affect Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that whole dimensions are operating within this community which are not adequately being addressed by statistics or bureaucratic regulation. They cannot be addressed by those things. I am suggesting that a whole new psyche needs to be applied to resolve this problem if we are to come to grips with what we actually have in Baryulgil and relocated communities. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to move onto a further recommendation. Recommendation 5 states:</PARA>
<PARA>That the Commonwealth Department of Aboriginal Affairs continue to use every effort to persuade the residents of Baryulgil Square to move to another site removed from any risk to health from the Baryulgil mine site. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the solution to the problem is for the people to move. That flies in the face of the very culture of these people and the way that they think about place and location. It shows a total lack of sensitivity. I accept the recommendation as being a very rational suggestion in some respects. But how do we apply every effort to get the people to relocate. The suggestion was that a new community would be built away from the school, away from the shops, away from the things that are required. </PARA>
<PARA> A plan was produced which had a swimming pool, a playing field, a sports centre, a health centre, a preschool and housing but those things were never delivered. They were never put on the ground. Otherwise the people might have actually moved. I was at Baryulgil Square two weeks ago speaking to the senior member of that community-a 79-year-old woman-who said, `When I was asked to move I had to make a decision'. She said, `I either have got the disease now or I have not got it. If I have it, I will not get up to move from my place to another place'. So she chose, like many of the others, not to move. Surely that was a predictable reaction. This woman told me, and I accept it, that she was told that if she did not leave her social security benefits would be terminated. I suppose that that could be seen reasonably to be the Commonwealth Department of Aboriginal Affairs continuing to use every effort to persuade. That is what this woman told me. She said, `Take my social security benefits if you have to. I have done without them for a part of my life and I can do without them again for the latter part of my life'. These sorts of methods of persuasion did not have effect. My understanding is that in excess of $1m-I cannot see it on the ground and I have been there-was spent on relocating this community. </PARA>
<PARA> There are 17 houses in that relocated situation but none of the other amenities. The 17 houses are so badly constructed that they were the subject of a question and an answer in the Estimates Committee hearings which I will return to later. The houses are actually falling apart. I am not talking about the criticism that is often made of the people who occupy these dwellings. It has nothing to do with that; it does have something to do with the actual construction of the buildings. The buildings are literally falling apart. That was acknowledged in the responses to the Estimates Committee. The people who have gone there are now saying, `What on earth are we doing in this hell?'. Honourable senators should see it. It is an appalling situation. The people want to go back to their place, and so the community is divided about even where it wants to live. These are the realities. </PARA>
<PARA> My next question is: How many dollars are in these appropriations to rebuild the buildings that are at Malabugilmah? How many dollars are in the appropriations to proceed to the stage of making Malabugilmah a community that they will identify with? How many dollars are in these appropriations to resolve the problems of the Baryulgil Square? If the dollars are not there, why are they not there? The strategy flowing from recommendations 4 and 5 of this report has failed tragically. There are now 17 disintegrating homes in Malabugilmah. The place is littered with stripped cars that are in the middle of the roads. People cannot drive on the formed roads but have to drive off the road onto the footpath to get around the wrecked cars. We are talking about a community that has 100 per cent unemployment. The tactic used to try to get the people to relocate was, I am told by the senior member of that community-and I must accept it-to threaten to withdraw the one lifeline the people have. I know what views are out there in the Australian community about those lifelines, but that is beside the point. It is another issue again. The second dimension of this tragedy is the attempt to relocate. My second group of questions concerns redressing or addressing the problem of relocation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question of relocation is obviously an extremely difficult one. If it were merely a matter of dollars, I suppose governments might have solved it prior to this date. As I understand it, when Senator Peter Baume, in good faith, devised the idea of this alternative living site at Malabugilmah, some residents chose to move but a core group decided to remain. I know that Senator Peter Baume has said in this Parliament before that, whilst he has gone down and pleaded and tried to point out that a move would be in the best health interests of the persons concerned, obviously all he can do, all a government can do, is point out the fact that an alternative site is available. The rights of those who wish to continue to live at Baryulgil Square cannot be simply overridden. I suppose the houses could not be bulldozed out, as might have happened in Romania, where the villages were bulldozed in the name of socialist reconstruction. Hungarian villages in particular were bulldozed and people moved into what were judged by the authorities to be better living conditions. I understand that core members of the Aboriginal community at Baryulgil still hold very strongly a wish to stay there. To a certain extent, although I do not in any sense mean it as a matter of blame, the provision of infrastructure upgrading at the Square further encourages people to stay rather than letting it absolutely deteriorate. It is a very difficult question. The more we help to improve living conditions at the Square, the less likely it is that people will wish to move. I do not know exactly how we can overcome that particular problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are difficulties at Malabugilmah. I understand that now many of the residences and other buildings are proving to have been built in a way which is structurally unsound, with unsound foundations or on land which is giving way. The Government has provided funds for engineering surveys to be undertaken in order that a reconstruction program, if required, is based on the best possible advice rather than a piecemeal attempt to shore up every structural defect which manifests itself. The situation obviously requires a more comprehensive approach, and the engineering survey is being funded. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, the question of the water supply has also been a worry to the residents, who fear a health hazard created by the existing water supply, the take-off point for which is below the mine site. I am advised that no technical evidence exists to support that claim. However, to ensure the safety and peace of mind of the residents of Malabugilmah, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs has agreed to move the water take-off point to a position above the mine site. Work on relocation of the water take-off point will commence this financial year and the Department has set aside $100,000 for these works and for the installation of filtration equipment. That is a positive attempt to deal with what must be a very real worry if people think that a water supply, which obviously is fundamental and crucial to any community, might be contaminated. Those steps are being taken. </PARA>
<PARA> To go back to some earlier remarks Senator McLean repeated about the health service, a series of community meetings have been held concerning the provision of an Aboriginal controlled health service. We have encouraged these sorts of meetings to be held. Funds of $6,000 were provided to engage the Biripi Aboriginal Medical Service on behalf of the Aboriginal communities to prepare a detailed plan and costings for the establishment of a service and those other proposals which are presently under consideration. As I say, some people have developed the view that Bonalbo hospital, rather than Grafton, might be the best base for such a medical service. At the moment, as I say, a dedicated Aboriginal health team working from the Grafton hospital services communities in the valley. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot is happening, but the fundamental difficulty of requiring people to move is one which governments approach with some trepidation for some of the reasons which Senator McLean mentioned. The idea that social security benefits might be withdrawn from a person at the behest of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs if he or she did not move is something which the officers here find to be anathema and it is not within the jurisdiction of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to make a determination as to social security benefit and entitlement to it. With my present responsibilities in this chamber, there is no knowledge of such an inducement or threat being held over a person in relation to whether he or she chooses to move from the Square. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean is not the first to raise these matters in the chamber. In May this year Senator Peter Baume engaged in a fairly lengthy exposition-as well he might, because he would be more aware than most of the problems at Baryulgil, given the solutions he tried to find when he was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I am not trying to say that we do not need to do more. Quite clearly the health problems are such that much is required to be done. But in relation to the asbestos health risks and the damage which has been suffered by persons who were either engaged in the mines or living in the village nearby, the Government has attempted to aid those persons in their various litigation attempts to sheet home responsibility for the death and disease which may have been occasioned by the asbestos to which they were exposed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Aboriginal Legal Service of New South Wales has provided very substantial funds-$677,134 at last count-to allow for these particular claims against those who are responsible to be processed. As I understand it, it is handling 11 cases. The first cases have advanced through the technical hurdle of the statutory limitations period. Recent New South Wales legislation now requires cases to be presented to the Dust Diseases Tribunal. I believe that the sum of money outlined indicates that there is a very real commitment by the Aboriginal Legal Service to try to help these people to obtain compensation where it is their due for the diseases they may have contracted as a result of exposure to asbestos. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many facets to this problem. Expenditure is being made in the way that Senator McLean appears to desire, namely, to make Malabugilmah a more attractive place and to provide it with clean water. A program is under way with engineering consultants to ensure that there is a comprehensive response to the deterioration of the structure of that community. It cannot be said that the Federal Government is indifferent to the fate of this community. It is not simply a responsibility of the Federal Government, nor is it entirely within its power to resolve. There is the Federal Government, there is the State Government, there are the employers, the owners and the people who are working at the mine, and of course there is the community itself. Many factors have to be taken into account and many human beings and organisations need to cooperate to help remedy this situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with the Minister. I raised this matter in the Senate on 26 May. What I said is to be found on page 2824 of the Hansard. I will not repeat the facts I set out there. I drew attention then, as Senator McLean is drawing attention now, to the 1984 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and, like Senator McLean, I asked questions about when those recommendations would be put into effect, given that they would have an effect. I was the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs at the time that the village was moved. If Senator McLean wishes to criticise the decision, as I think he has done, by saying that it may have been an imposed decision and that we did not understand the people's desire not to move away from their place, I will take the criticism. If he wants to say that the place was badly built during the time I was Minister, I will accept that criticism. I will not patronise any honourable senator here and I do not expect to be patronised, either.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was the Minister at that time. The decision was taken by me as Minister that Malabugilmah should be developed so that the people of Baryulgil Square could move. That decision was taken because the people there asked me to do this. Senator McLean should understand that I was responding to a request made by people who lived at Baryulgil Square. They took me down the road to Malabugilmah and said, `This is where we want the village'. Let us at least acknowledge that what was done was in response to Aboriginal wishes. If the site was wrong, then it was a decision taken by a Minister responding to an Aboriginal community and, quite properly, as Senator McLean says, to a disgraceful situation of which the Woodsreef people and Hardies really should be ashamed. I agree with him. The village was then built. I went to the opening of that village. It was a great gala occasion. I inspected the houses. There was no complaint then about the quality of the construction. That obviously would have developed and emerged. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember that as Minister I transferred the housing function from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, which I administered, to the Aboriginal Development Commission. I cannot remember whether it was in 1981 or 1982, but I did it during that period, as functions could be transferred. The function was subsequently exercised by the Aboriginal Development Commission. If blame is to be apportioned, some of it would be departmental, but those officers sitting in the advisers box tonight are good officers, and the Department they administered was a good Department. I will not be part of any criticism which indirectly applies to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLean has asked why people stayed on at the Square. It is a perfectly proper question. It was not just a question of Aboriginal affinity with the land. The whole story is a disaster. The original mine tailings were used to level out the Square and shacks were built there. I share Senator McLean's concern about that. But why did people stay there? First, we could not force them off the land. We were not in the business of telling people they had to go. Secondly, the accommodation provided at Malabugilmah was all taken up-every place was taken up. There was not enough to re-house all the people from the Square. The proposal was that there be a progressive construction scheme. I do not argue with the honourable senator, who said that construction did not continue. But people moved into the houses that had been vacated in the Square. They moved in from Tabulam and surrounding villages where there was an Aboriginal population. If we made one gross error it was that we did not come in with tractors and push the shacks over as each family moved out. We made an error, because they were occupied by other Aboriginals who moved in from other places who could not get housing. That new people moved back in is part of the picture of the tragedy of Baryulgil Square. </PARA>
<PARA> There is some legitimate criticism that that should have been possible, but there was another reason why people stayed on at the Square. The Baryulgil Square Cooperative had legal advice from a solicitor whose name I believe, from memory, was Ms Vivienne Abraham. What the Committee may wish to recall-Senator McLean has quite correctly drawn attention to the Washpool Forest and to the area-is that further up the Clarence River there is a property called Columm Columm Station, which was owned by the Baryulgil Square Cooperative. The question was: To whom would the title pass? The legal advice being given was that the Baryulgil Square Cooperative should remain because the title to Columm Columm Station, the jewel, was in question. I was not going to interfere with that advice. There was a major question as to who owned this property and we had to try to sort it out. Again, it was a matter between the Aboriginal Development Commission, the Baryulgil Square Cooperative, the Malabugilmah people and the Department. It was a very complex matter. I believe that before it was finalised-I cannot recall now-I may have left the portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with the major thrust of Senator McLean's contribution that for 40 or 50 years the whole operation was a disgrace. The fact that there were children in a school which was having asbestos fibre blown in every day, that people were living in shacks built on asbestos tailings and that the company involved has done as little as it could for as long as it could, is disgraceful. Senator McLean's concern for the people is absolutely correct. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot understand why the Government has not responded more adequately to the 1984 report-this is what I brought up in May-since Mr Hand himself was involved in the production of that report; in fact, I think he was the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. If the recommendations were ones in which he believed when he produced the report, then they were recommendations to which he could give effect when he became the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that Senator Jenkins also spoke on this matter on 25 May. She was wrong on one small point. During her speech she said that a particular complication, pleural mesothelioma, was a complication of asbestos. She is quite correct. She said that it was first reported in South Africa. She then said:</PARA>
<PARA> In 1962 the first case of pleural mesothelioma was diagnosed outside South Africa, in an ex-Wittenoom mill worker, as reported by Dr McNulty. </PARA>
<PARA>Just for the record, I also used to write for the medical journals in those days and my case report was in 1960, I believe, so the honourable senator is wrong on that. We had reported. We knew what pleural mesothelioma was then. We understood the relation to asbestos exposure and that is why, when I became Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the first major ministerial initiative I took was to go to Baryulgil and, in response to the wish of the residents there, arrange to have the Malabugilmah village built where they indicated that they wanted it built. That events have been protracted and that some of the outcomes have been negative should distress us all. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to Senator McLean that the history is more complicated, more complex and more interwoven than I think he understood. However, that does not take away from his concern now that the recommendations of that House of Representatives Committee should be put into effect. I have no doubt that Aboriginal people will be dying as a result of their asbestos exposure. All the rules of justice and all our ideas of fairness should demand that they be promptly, generously and effectively compensated: if necessary, we should be overgenerous. We should not even fight on this matter. It is a matter which is so disgraceful that the amounts of money involved are almost insignificant. I have to say that when I spoke on 26 May Mr Hand was on the phone five minutes later asking me to have a cup of tea and talk it over. If he is listening now, I just say to him, `No cups of tea tonight, please. Let us just get some action on the 1984 House of Representatives Committee report'. On that I am arm in arm with Senator McLean. Something has to be done and it is long overdue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to respond to a number of points made by the Minister and by Senator Peter Baume. Let me take Senator Peter Baume's points first. I read his presentation to the Senate in the Hansard of 26 May and I noted and discussed with him one sentence, which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Many honourable senators collect trophies and the one of which I am proudest is a photo in my office of the tree under which we negotiated with the Aboriginal community the agreement which led to the establishment of Malabugilmah village. </PARA>
<PARA>I accept the pride which would be associated with having arrived at that agreement with the community. What I am really challenging-and I said this to Senator Peter Baume earlier in discussion this evening-is that if he went back to that village now, as I did two weeks ago, he would still feel that way. I am afraid that that pride would be considerably dented. I do not deny the integrity and the sincerity of the officers. I am not wishing to cast aspersions on the officers or on the Ministers involved, but I still say that if the officers of the Department went to Baryulgil and Malabugilmah today I do not believe they would be proud of what is on the ground there and what has been achieved by their Department. Good, committed and devoted as those officers are, I do not believe that they would feel pride. We simply have to face the realities. It is not something to be proud of. In fact, as Senator Peter Baume has just said, it is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not really believe that the strategy to relocate was a wrong strategy; I think Senator Baume misunderstood me when I said that. I do not believe that it was a wrong strategy at all; it just was not carried through to fruition. What the people were really saying was, `We accept the concept of an adequate alternative site'. They were promised an adequate alternative site but they have got a grossly inadequate alternative site. I had dinner this evening with members of the community and I put this question directly to them: Would Malabugilmah be an acceptable alternative if it were an adequately prepared alternative? The answer was, `Of course it is'. But it is not adequate in its present disgraceful condition. It is utterly disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA> A question suggested by Senator Baume-thank heavens!-and posed by Senator Tambling on his behalf to the Estimates Committee actually concerned the present state of the buildings in this alternative home-this place that was offered to the community. As I said earlier, the realities are that the buildings are a disgrace. They are falling down and we are now involved in a legal argument as to who is responsible for this disaster. Legal advice is being sought and given left, right and centre as to who are the culprits. We cannot even get an answer to the question of what the average cost of the 17 buildings was. It has been suggested that when they were built eight years ago the average cost might have been in the vicinity of $125,000 each. Somebody was on a damn good lurk if that was the figure eight years ago in the backblocks of north-eastern New South Wales. The figures I have been quoted are somewhere between $85,000 and $125,000 per unit cost. Even if it cost $85,000 eight years ago to construct buildings that are now a disgrace-we cannot even legally establish who was responsible for the disgrace in response to questions from Senator Peter Baume, through Senator Tambling, to the Estimates Committee a few days ago-that in itself warrants our attention and only compounds the frustration of the people who were seeking, agreeing to and hoping for an adequate alternative site in which they could recover from what was nothing short of an environmental and social disaster for them. </PARA>
<PARA> My point simply is that that strategy has not worked and I am asking: What dollars have been appropriated to rectify that failed strategy? I am asking whether that strategy will actually be continued. It may not be an unreasonable thing to recover from where the community is now. In fact, I think I would agree with Senator Peter Baume that that probably is the best of the options, but it will cost a lot of dollars to pursue it if it is the best of the options. What I am really asking is this: are those dollars in this appropriation? Are the dollars there to reconstruct the 17 buildings, to provide the other things that were on the plan eight years ago for the adequate alternative site?</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, people are now returning to Baryulgil Square. They are returning not only from Malabugilmah, a few kilometres away, but also from places such as Redfern. These people assemble in families and at various stages of their lives they move around, reassemble, regroup and re-relate to one another. It is their culture. The Mundine family's place is in Baryulgil Square and they are reassembling there. The problem is being compounded even more. I really do have a perception of the history of the problem and the complexities of the problem. I say to Senator Peter Baume that I do not accept that criticism. Albeit only recently, I have done quite a bit of reading, looking, listening and talking. I think I have a sense of the complexities of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to some of the observations made by the Minister concerning the medical service. The medical service has gone into a closed loop; it is not happening. The nature of this closed loop is very frustrating to members of the Baryulgil community. They are now being told that, if by establishing a steering committee they decide where this medical centre is going to be located, then it will happen. The recommendation of the 1984 report was that it happen in Grafton. That was very specific and very clear and it did not happen. That steering committee has now been landed with supposedly responsible decisions based on supposedly adequate surveys which I would question anyway. If it decided tomorrow that it wanted the medical centre in Grafton or in Malabugilmah, are the dollars available in this appropriation to put it there? If not, why not? That is a reasonable question. </PARA>
<PARA> This proposal has been on the books for five years. One would imagine that it has been a proposal in the appropriations for five years. If it is not in this year's appropriations, these people reasonably ask: why not? They believe it is because they are being conned. The expression used to me by members of that community is that they are out of sight and out of mind. They personally question whether there is any serious intention to deliver the recommendations of this report in the foreseeable future. Therefore on their behalf I pose the question: where are the dollars for this promised medical service? Where are the dollars in these appropriations for this promised adequate alternative site? I put that question bluntly now and ask for an answer before we move on to the other recommendations of the 1984 report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not going to be bludgeoned by Senator McLean into answering questions that he wants to put bluntly. I will answer a series of matters that he raised. He does not seem to want to listen. He talks about the derelict buildings and the structural deficiencies and asks why we are not building houses. It would be stupid to go in with a building program before we had the result of the engineering survey which I said we are undertaking at the moment with our dollars in order to understand those structural defects and to ensure that we do not go ahead with some piecemeal solution which does not address what must obviously be an underlying problem. When that engineers' report is received and assessed, then quite obviously steps will be taken. That is one point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator McLean does not seem to want to acknowledge the other matter of the expenditure of $100,000 to relocate the existing water supply to reduce the fear of contamination of that very important and crucial part of community life. It should have access to a water supply in which it has confidence. In relation to the housing, it is not true that they are all eight years old. As Senator Peter Baume said, as Minister he transferred responsibility for the provision of housing from the Department to the Aboriginal Development Commission. I am advised that in 1982-83 it spent $330,000 on five houses and in 1984 it spent $251,000 on four houses. I think that, just roughly, that works out to something like $60,000 or a little more for each house. I do not know where Senator McLean got his original figures from. Did he get them from a record or are they just speculation? If they are as large as he mentioned, it might be that the cost includes initial engineering works. I just do not know. But they are the costs of the houses that were constructed in 1982-83 and 1984. There is no current funding available for housing. As I said, it would be extraordinarily foolish to undertake that at the moment before we get the structural engineer's report. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the question of health services, the community has been asked-I am glad Senator Mclean has acknowledged it at last; I mentioned it in my remarks-to give its considered view on this matter. It has been asked to deliberate on the matter rather than to have an imposed solution, even one which commended itself to a committee of the House of Representatives. I think I said during my remarks that there was something of a view developing that perhaps the proposed medical service might be best based at Bonalbo hospital rather than Grafton. If the community would state its position and if there were agreement, I am quite sure that would be something governments would listen to. In the meantime, despite Senator McLean's remarks, I believe that there is a health service being provided, although not as was envisaged and not as the community is trying to work towards. We fund the health worker. Pressure has been put on the Government of New South Wales to keep open the Bonalbo hospital, which I understand provides many facilities to the communities there. These are matters which have been undertaken by this Government, as has been the engagement of the Biripi Aboriginal Medical Service, to assist the local community in coming to a detailed plan and costings for the establishment of the service. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a lot happening. This is not to say that we have in any way reached a satisfactory resolution of the matter. I thank Senator Peter Baume for his extremely interesting historical survey of the problems of the establishment of the alternative living area, the alternative village. It throws further light on the difficulty we have in a society such as ours when these people, for reasons however strong, speak of family ties, the regrouping of the Square and so on. Nevertheless, there is a danger in their being there which is a factor that has to be balanced against their cultural or familial ties. It just shows the complexity and extreme difficulty of this whole situation which is not uncommon in many fields of human life. When we tell people about the danger of smoking tobacco cigarettes they nevertheless continue to smoke or take up the habit of smoking. It is extremely difficult to deal with human beings individually or as communities, and this is a classic instance of that.</PARA>
<PARA> The final solution is to try to listen to the community. It has been asked to make a recommendation as to the Aboriginal controlled health service that might be provided. When that is done, no doubt there will be a proper consideration of the moneys that might be made available. Whether they should be totally made available from the Federal Government or the State government is a matter which I have not considered. Quite clearly, if the matter is put to governments by a cohesive community, then governments will respond. The provision of such a health service is obviously a matter of absolute priority.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must confess at the outset that I have not been to Baryulgil; so I have not inspected the site. However, I have worked in occupational health for a number of years and I am well aware that in a number of instances private companies and government departments have been quite disrespectful of the health of the people who work for them. Perhaps the most extreme example of this lack of concern about workers' health is seen in the asbestos industry, not only here but in other parts of the world. I think fellow senators will have seen the Four Corners program several weeks ago which dealt not with this particular mine site but with several other mine sites and specifically with the operations of James Hardie Industries Ltd. Of course, the occupational problems of asbestos relate not only to the mining of it but also to the milling and processing of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose one could start by making the general statement that parliaments and governments do have a responsibility to care for the health and welfare of their people and also the welfare of their environment. In the case of asbestos that simply has not happened, and has not happened over a very long period. If one looks at the experience overseas, one finds abundant evidence from early in the century that asbestos was capable of causing chronic respiratory disease. Indeed, I think it is fair to say that until about the end of the First World War none of those exposed to asbestos in an occupational capacity survived long enough to develop cancer because the level of exposures was so high. It is perhaps ironic that we only learned about the links between asbestos and cancer when the exposure of workers fell to such a level that enough workers survived long enough to develop cancers. </PARA>
<PARA> When I spoke on this issue in May I pointed out that, to my knowledge, the first case for worker's compensation in relation to asbestos exposure was heard in the United States in, I think, 1906. So the claim which has been made by the owners of the mines and, indeed, sustained to a large extent by governments and government departments that the links between asbestos and ill-health are not proven is simply not founded and smacks of the same sort of doublespeak that one hears from the tobacco industry in relation to lung cancer and smoking. </PARA>

The point of relevance is that we are dealing with the appropriations and the motion that is in fact before the Committee.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To develop this point, it is necessary to say something-and that is the point I was getting to-about the nature of the diseases from which people who are exposed to asbestos suffer. I want very briefly to deal with several of the figures which come out of a much better reference study-that is, the study of the people who worked at Wittenoom. There were 6,502 males and 410 females in that study. There have already been 94 cases of malignant mesothelioma, 141 cases of lung cancer and 356 successful compensation claims for asbestosis. However, the point I want to make is that it says in this medical study from which I am reading that it is expected that there will be a total of 692 cases between 1987 and the year 2020.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The nature of the disease is such that one cannot predict beforehand which people exposed to asbestos will eventually go on and develop one of these malignant conditions. Moreover, there is a very long interval, sometimes as long as 40 years or so, between the time of the exposure and the time at which those diseases will manifest themselves. I refer specifically here to the first of the House of Representatives Committee's recommendations in 1984-that the Attorneys-General of the Commonwealth and New South Wales consider ways and means whereby the technical difficulties presented by aboriginality in seeking compensation may be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult enough for a well-educated European person who understands these things to face the courts and go through a process of proving that his or her particular disease is related to this exposure which occurred a long time in the past. It is extremely more difficult for an Aboriginal person to go down that difficult road. Indeed, if one refers back to the length of time of the hearings in relation to the Wittenoom workers, one finds that there was enormous procrastination. The first case ran in court for 132 days, the second case for 52 days and another one for 30 days. Surely, it is far more desirable for the Government to recognise, and get James Hardie to recognise, that there is a clear link between the exposure to asbestos and the eventual onset of these diseases for a proportion of the population, even though individuals in that proportion cannot at this stage be recognised, and to deal with this as a community problem, provide enough money for that community to address that problem, and not expect individual Aboriginal people who were exposed to go through this very lengthy court process. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister in his earlier reply said that $600,000 had been provided for legal aid. I would suggest that that is a waste of money. It is far better to recognise that a significant proportion of these people-a proportion which can probably now be determined to some extent-will eventually suffer these diseases, and provide, and ensure that James Hardie provides, enough money so that compensation can be addressed now without having to go through that very lengthy and damaging legal process. Therefore, I ask the Minister, in relation to recommendation No. 1, whether he accepts that that would be a better and cheaper solution, and that brings me squarely back to the appropriations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If a settlement could be reached between the owners of the mine-the employers of the Aboriginals-and the Aboriginals, and their families who might also have been affected because they were living close by, encouraged by governments and, no doubt, by recent decisions of the courts, that, of course, would be an ideal solution. But, as I have already mentioned, these matters fall primarily within State law, whether it be the ordinary rules as to compensation for negligent behaviour which is injurious to a person or, more particularly now, the legislation in New South Wales which requires these matters to be taken through a particular process. I am not familiar with that legislation, but I believe that that is now the case. The Dust Diseases Tribunal in New South Wales is now the forum which recent New South Wales legislation requires to be the proper body to determine these sorts of claims.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a difficult matter. It is not entirely within Federal jurisdiction or responsibility. The primary responsibility, in the legal sense, lies within the legal system devised under common law or under the aegis of the State Parliament.

<PARA> Senator Coulter is not quite making that point. As I understand it, he is making the point that, rather than individual settlements being made with those who claim to have been adversely affected, a more general compensation package, perhaps worked out on a statistical basis but nevertheless available to all members of the community who were present at the relevant time, should be made available. In that regard perhaps a copy of the Hansard record could be made available not only to the New South Wales Government but also to the owners of the mine-or those who now have legal responsibility for such cases as may be pursued. I will undertake to make the Hansard record available to those other bodies to consider and, of course, it is available to the Federal Government to consider also. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to raise another area of difficulty on the theme of the pursuit of compensation. I think it is generally conceded in this report and by what the Minister has said in his answers that the pursuit of compensation is seen to be a legitimate course that the community should undertake. Indeed, the first recommendation of the 1984 report cites the pursuit of compensation as being legitimate, and cites problems associated with aboriginality in relation to that quest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Minister will be aware, the pursuit of compensation is, right now, a very vexed question in the community. Minister Hand has taken the absolute position that, if these people are to be subsidised in the pursuit of compensation, that subsidy will be through the Aboriginal Legal Service (ALS). Having spoken with members of the community, I know they do not have confidence in the Aboriginal Legal Service to address this type of litigation, which is civil/commercial and is not its area of speciality. The community has said to the Minister, `We don't believe that the Aboriginal Legal Service can deliver the goods to us in terms of representation and hence in terms of outcomes and compensation'. However, they have said that if the dollars are going to be spent, they should be spent on obtaining the assistance of experts in this specific area of litigation. I understand that the Minister has said that is unacceptable to him and there is a stand-off position. That is our starting point in addressing this problem now. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt in the minds of the people of the Baryulgil community that pursuing compensation is something they have to do. In a question to members of that community tonight I asked: `Do you prefer an action line which pursues individual compensation, or an action line which perhaps pursues collective compensation to establish a trust to generate ongoing income and address the problem?'. The answer was, `Both'. That is the reality in the community now. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the record of James Hardie in responding to these sorts of legal actions? My understanding is-and I am repeating what was said by Chris Masters on the Four Corners program on 13 November-that Hardies had settled 320 compensation cases, all out of court and all with non-disclosure clauses. If I were a member of the Baryulgil community that would suggest to me that Hardies is very sensitive to its history and the manner in which it has handled this whole problem. If one wants to see how sensitive that company is, one has only to look at the report and see some of its responses in giving evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> The compensation question will not go away. It will be pursued by this community for quite some time and I think that it will be resisted by Hardies. Hardies' negating strategy has been very effective. Given the attitude of the community about the ALS and its pursuit of a dual compensation strategy, given the record of James Hardie in relation to out of court settlements, the difficulty in getting the matter to court and reaching a settlement, and given its attitude about disclosing what it sees as the realities, I ask the Minister what resources will be allocated next year for the pursuit of compensation. This very important question is acknowledged in the first recommendation of the 1984 report. Its special dimensions-in other words, the problems of the Aboriginal community in the pursuit of compensation-relate specifically to the appropriations. What resources are available now to pursue that aspect of the problem? Is it envisaged that those resources will be conduited through the ALS or is the Minister now sufficiently flexible to allow them to find their way to the appropriate place through another conduit?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Jenkins handed me a piece of paper the last line of which reads `NSW Dust Diseases Board in respect of possible workers compensation claims'. Senator Jenkins is not in the chamber. Her note suggests that the Dust Diseases Tribunal's jurisdiction may be confined to claims by those who were miners or workers on the site. As I indicated to the honourable senator, I will try to get an analysis of the legislation for her.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) takes the view that the Aboriginal Legal Service (ALS) is the body which, over a period, has built up a considerable expertise in the area. The delays in progressing this claim have been due to the delays that bedevil all Supreme Court lists in New South Wales. I am informed that recently the ALS received an approach from Hardies offering an out of court settlement. I understood that that is being considered and deliberated on. The honourable senator asked what moneys are appropriated at the moment. The Aboriginal Legal Service throughout Australia gets some $15m from the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio. It is up to that body in its various jurisdictions to make decisions as to those cases which fall within the criteria and those for which it chooses to make funds available. One would not expect to find a specific amount in these appropriations dedicated to the provision of legal advice and representation to this community. That would be for the Aboriginal Legal Service to decide. Given its previous history of funding, which is to the extent of almost $700,000, one could expect it to continue to make that sort of allocation of funds. </PARA>
<PARA> There appears to be a new factor, namely, the offering of an out of court settlement by Hardies. Obviously I do not know the extent of that offer: I am not privy to it. It is something which the ALS is considering on behalf of those persons who have indicated that they wish their matters to be processed through the Aboriginal Legal Service. If persons choose not to utilise the Aboriginal Legal Service, which after all is the body through which the Commonwealth funds these matters, it is their right to do so; but, having exercised their choice, they would have to find alternative methods of pressing their claim. That may be through the New South Wales Dust Diseases Tribunal and it may be through an arrangement with lawyers, if they are able to do it within the New South Wales jurisdiction, on a no win no pay basis. I do not know whether that is possible in New South Wales. The Minister intends that any Commonwealth dollars that are provided for legal advice and representation in this matter should be provided through the Aboriginal Legal Service. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am somewhat disappointed that Minister Hand does not accept the fact that, in the view of this community, the Aboriginal Legal Service (ALS) does not have the expertise to represent it. I am not doubting the fact that over a period of years the ALS-using the Minister's phrase-has developed considerable expertise, but it is not expertise in relation to this type of litigation. I hear directly from the community and from legal experts that the ALS does not have such expertise and therefore the community does not have confidence in that service. To create a situation where an Aboriginal community must pursue, argue and publicise its lack of confidence in its own funded legal service is very unfortunate, to my way of thinking. We are likely to have not only an unproductive outcome but also a very destructive process en route in terms of the relationship between at least this Aboriginal community and its local regional legal service. With respect, the decision lacks wisdom and it is not the way we should be going.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently I heard, and only informally, that James Hardie has offered an out of court settlement. My understanding is that the offer is in the vicinity of between $10,000 and $80,000 for 10 per cent to 80 per cent incapacity per individual. In other words, if a person was assessed-presumably he will be assessed by the tribunal to which Senator Tate has referred-as being 80 per cent incapacitated, he would receive compensation of about $80,000. By any civil standards these days that scale of compensation for such a degree of incapacity is simply absurd. It reflects the attitude that the company has shown all along while it was remunerating these people. </PARA>
<PARA> Early on I made the fairly emotive statement that what prevailed in the community servicing the labour needs of the Baryulgil asbestos mine was tantamount to slavery. I believe that is true in terms of the conditions under which people-they worked barefoot, barelegged and barechested-mined one of the most dangerous substances on earth. They worked for 40 hours a week. I am told that their fortnightly pay-the only hard evidence I have of the rate of pay was for 1965-was #12.6d, which equates to about $24.00. I have attempted to draw a comparison between what James Hardie was paying its labourers in situ with the basic wage. At that stage throughout the Commonwealth the basic wage was the equivalent of $30.80. James Hardie was paying its workers considerably less than the basic wage. It had a non-unionised situation on its hands. People worked as much overtime as the company required without any additional pay. I am attempting to make comparisons between the rates of pay paid by James Hardie to these labourers in situ and the rates of pay that were earned by people working in coalmines in New South Wales at the time and in goldmines in Western Australia and uranium mines in Rum Jungle. I am trying to obtain those figures; I would be very surprised if they were not extremely unfavourable. </PARA>
<PARA> The conditions under which these people were required to work were equally unfavourable, not to mention the fact that when they eventually twigged to the fact that they were mining one of the most dangerous substances on the earth they were told that the substance did not affect Aborigines. In addition, a couple of hundred kilometres away in Barraba, where there was another asbestos mine, a highly unionised white labour force was paid almost twice the rate of pay of those working at Baryulgil and it was compulsory for workers at Barraba to wear protective clothing and masks while they mined the same substance. That shows the value set of the company that employed this labour at Baryulgil and which is now attempting to arrive at out of court settlements that are totally inadequate. My understanding of it is quite informal; I do not know whether it is true or how reliable my sources are. However, I am told that the suggested scale of compensation is $10,000 to $80,000 for 10 per cent to 80 per cent proven incapacity. Such scales of compensation are offensive. They simply reflect the mentality of this company and its attitude towards this community and these people who serviced its needs for four decades. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that the need for compensation-which is an acknowledged, primary need in Mr Hand's report-is being adequately addressed by the Government or that it can be adequately serviced by the Aboriginal Legal Service. The need for compensation will in no way be adequately addressed by James Hardie in out of court settlements. If we are to be honest and just about this axis of it, we have to be more realistic. I do not believe that anything is occurring on the axis of health, let alone on the axis of relocation or that of compensation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will reply to some of the compensation matters because I do not know why Senator McLean is making a plea to me as though I were the judge, tribunal and jury able to award compensation to these poor people who have been badly affected by the inhalation of asbestos while working for this company which apparently showed a callous indifference to its workers in various situations. That has been documented and was admitted by the company in various out of court settlements which apparently it has reached.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The frustration being experience by the Aboriginal community at Baryulgil Square is precisely the same frustration that has been experienced for decades by many other communities around Australia as they have tried to pursue their legal rights to compensation in regard to the diseases and injuries which they have suffered as a result of their exposure to asbestos. It is not as though this particular community has been singled out or discriminated against. Unfortunately, it has been the common experience, as has been well rehearsed on other occasions in this chamber, of many communities of Australians, both white and black. It is quite unfair of Senator McLean to give the appearance of saying that somehow the Aboriginal Legal Service (ALS) is particularly derelict, deficient or inadequate in its handling of the matter because it has taken so long to resolve. That has been the common experience of legal aid services and individual lawyers of great eminence over a period of decades. </PARA>
<PARA> These matters are now being resolved and James Hardie is making offers. If those offers are of the order suggested by Senator McLean-I have no knowledge of it-they should not be accepted. A settlement is a two-way process. Quite clearly they should not be accepted if they are as derisory and as ill-founded as the honourable senator suggests. In 1986-87, the Commonwealth Government paid for an independent study. I think counsel of some eminence in the field of compensation was engaged to see whether the approach being adopted by the ALS was effective. The cost of engaging that counsel was $2,750. The sorts of questions Senator McLean asks are valid ones. They occurred to the Commonwealth. The counsel was engaged to make an assessment of the ALS approach and it was found to be as adequate as could be expected in all these circumstances which have bedevilled many other claims, as Senator McLean will no doubt acknowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a very difficult situation, one that I face all the time as the Minister in charge of the non-Aboriginal legal aid services throughout Australia. We fund legal aid through the legal aid commissions throughout the States and the Australian Legal Aid Office in Tasmania and the Northern Territory. Some people are dissatisfied that that is the way in which the Commonwealth distributes the legal aid dollar. They might like us to do it some other way and to have absolute freedom to move to whom they wish in order to obtain advice and be paid in relation to it. It is reasonable, given that assessment made in 1986-87 on the process and progress of litigation, that the matter continue to be funded through the ALS. I believe that an assessment of any settlement offer that has been made by Hardies will be made in a way which will not disadvantage the Aboriginal people who themselves will make the decision on whether to accept. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a general point that the Aboriginal people have been incredibly disadvantaged because of their exposure to asbestos and they will bear the health effects. It is clear that the employer in this and a number of instances, as the Minister said, has been negligent and, therefore, is perfectly challengeable for compensation. It is worth pointing out that asbestos went into a whole variety of very cheap products such as asbestos cement sheets, pipes, gutters, fencing and all sorts of things which advantaged Australia over a very long period of time. Asbestos provided an extremely cheap building material. Every one of us has probably borne some of the benefit of that cheap building material. It is appropriate, therefore, that the community pick up a considerable proportion of the cost by way of compensation because the community at large has benefited. It is the Aboriginal people and others who will suffer with the diseases. It is worth stressing to the Minister that the amount of money that the Government-or, should I say, the general taxpayer-has been prepared to put in through Government allocations does not bear any relationship to the advantages which the community has experienced through having this cheap building material over many decades.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to move the discussion on the appropriations to another area. Not only are the people of Baryulgil community dissatisfied with the state of their health and the provisions being made for it; not only are they anxious to pursue compensation for the abuses of the past, for which they are seeking dollars; but they are also asking that their immediate environment be rendered safer and healthier, and they are seeking dollars for that. Let us look at the relevant recommendations in the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs entitled Effects of Asbestos Mining on the Baryulgil Community. I believe that it is a valid approach to take these recommendations because they are the recommendations to and from the Government concerning these problems. They are still in the hands of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand), who, as the honourable member for Melbourne, chaired the Committee. They are now not being reflected in the dollars being appropriated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recommendations 6, 7 and 10 relate to the rehabilitation of the mining site. It is a question of who bears the responsibility. In recommendations 6 and 7, it is suggested that the responsibility for the rehabilitation of the site lies not with the Commonwealth Government but with State authorities such as the State Pollution Control Commission, the Department of Mineral Resources, et cetera. The interesting thing is that in recommendation 10 in the final analysis the Committee states:</PARA>
<PARA>That the Commonwealth Minister for Aboriginal Affairs request the New South Wales Government to direct the Department of Mineral Resources to require the lessees of the site of the Baryulgil mine and mill to carry out a complete rehabilitation of the area,-</PARA>
<PARA>and this is the rub-</PARA>
<PARA>and, in the event of the lessee failing to comply,-</PARA>
<PARA>in other words, if James Hardie says, `You can all go and jump'; if that is the attitude of James Hardie-</PARA>
<PARA>to direct the Department of Mineral Resources to carry out such rehabilitation work itself. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Commonwealth Minister has said, `Tell these various statutory authorities to establish certain things about the safety of the environment'-I will come to that in detail in a moment-`tell the statutory authorities to rehabilitate the site; tell the mining company to rehabilitate the site; but if it does not do it, do it at the taxpayers' expense'. It strikes me that there is an inherent contradiction in the principle of how the Government will resolve this problem. The essential principle suggested is to direct the appropriate authorities to do certain things if that does not happen, then to direct the mining company to do certain things and, if that does not happen, the taxpayer picks up the bill and the statutory authority actually does it. </PARA>
<PARA> But none of this questions the fundamental requirement to rehabilitate the site. It is irrefutable. If a person goes to the site of the old mine, which is a few hundred metres from the Baryulgil Square, that person will see that it requires rehabilitation. We are told by the authorities that they have done the necessary things to rehabilitate the area. I can assure honourable senators that they have not. I have in my own home-I meant to bring them here tonight to table-lumps of raw asbestos that I just picked up off the ground. I can assure honourable senators that the tailings are lying in mounds which a person can kick and pick up like cow pats and break into asbestos fibre which is blown in the wind and is leached into the water. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that an environmental disaster exists within a few hundred metres of the Baryulgil Square, which is itself an environmental disaster. This is acknowledged in all of these recommendations but there are no dollars and cents appropriated to solve the problems. I ask the Minister to clarify the situation, assuming that the site has not been adequately rehabilitated and in view of the fact that the State statutory authorities have not done what they were told to do. For instance, let us look at recommendation 7, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>That the Commonwealth Minister for Aboriginal Affairs request the New South Wales Government to direct the State Pollution Control Commission to continue to monitor the health risks from asbestos tailings at Baryulgil Square and to take whatever remedial measures may become necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>So the Minister is asking the Government to direct a statutory authority to do certain things. Let me read first the reply of a senior officer of the State Pollution Control Commission. Let me read the reply of a senior officer of the Department of Mineral Resources about monitoring the safety of the site and how much it is prepared to put into the rehabilitation and spend and then I will come to the question of how much the Federal Government is prepared to spend on it in this set of appropriations because this formula is broken down. In an interview with Sharon Davis in a program which went to air on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) on 20 November 1988 entitled There's No Place Like Baryulgil, A Town Built on Asbestos, Mr John Cook from the Department of Mineral Resources in reply to recommendation 7 that the process be constantly monitored said:</PARA>
<PARA>The department hasn't tested the air-</PARA>
<PARA>that is in the five years since it was theoretically directed to do so-</PARA>
<PARA>because there's no need to . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Talk about a circular argument. I ask honourable senators to listen to this closed logic:</PARA>
<PARA>The department hasn't tested the air because there's no need to . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Presumably, the intention of testing the air was to see whether there was a need to. It is an interesting contradiction. Mr Cook continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there's no evidence of any dust-</PARA>
<PARA>of course there is not, because the Department has not tested to see whether there is any evidence-</PARA>
<PARA>even on a windy day. </PARA>
<PARA>The Department has not tested the air on windy days. It has admitted that it has not tested it. It has admitted that it is presupposing the answer to the question. This is absolute rubbish. By anybody's logic it is rubbish. So Mr Cook said that the Department had not tested the air. This is five years after recommendation 7 was made. Mr Cook continued:</PARA>
<PARA>The water, we haven't tested either, because most of the erosion which has been taking place appears to remain in the paddock, the eroded material appears to remain--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 20 November 1988, in a program broadcast on the ABC under the title of There's No Place Like Baryulgil, A Town Built on Asbestos. It is in response to questions from Sharon Davis. They are real responses. I was on air with Andrew Olle last Monday when he played them back to me. We discussed them. Other officers were also on air during that debate. But let us go on. Mr Cook continued:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The water, we haven't tested either, because most of the erosion which has been taking place appears to remain in the paddock, the eroded material appears to remain in the paddock just downsteam of the mine. </PARA>
<PARA>Presumably the whole objective of testing the water would be to see whether those appearances are real or not and to move from the arena of appearances to reality. Mr Cook's closing sentence states:</PARA>
<PARA>Usually we carry out certain testing of the waters around a mine site after rehabilitation, there's not much use doing it before the rehabilitation is satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA>How can a person tell, for heaven's sake, whether the rehabilitation has been satisfactory if the Department does not carry out these tests which it says it usually does but in this case it did not? These are the responses of the Department that theoretically is called upon by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to carry out tests as the Commonwealth Government's agent. Mr Peter Standon, who is the Director of the State Pollution Control Commission in New South Wales-the other authority that the Minister was citing as the one which would be appropriate-in the same program said:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, you obviously have an advantage over me in that you have seen it very recently. </PARA>
<PARA>He is talking about the old mine site. He is saying that he has not seen it recently. In the interview he continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the situation there is as you probably would have also noticed, that the tailing tends to crust over fairly firmly and my understanding-</PARA>
<PARA>this is an understanding, he not having been there-</PARA>
<PARA>and the advice I've received on that situation, is that it is a fairly stable surface. </PARA>
<PARA>I can tell him that it is not a stable surface, that it is badly eroded, that I can kick holes in it and that the kids slide down it and break it open with their feet. The Director of the State Pollution Control Commission continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if there has been erosion and some of those materials have been washed into the streams, there could be the potential for some contamination. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet another scientific officer said that they do not test the water and they have not tested the water in this particular situation. So there could be some potential for contamination. What about the experience so far? The Director of the State Pollution Control Commission continued:</PARA>
<PARA>I can only say that our experience so far has been that it is not likely to cause a problem, notwithstanding the visual situation that you refer to. But you know, I'm more than happy to double check that and in fact, have someone go up to satisfy myself that there isn't any problem, in view of the observations you make. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a convoluted gobbledegook response by the Director of the State Pollution Control Commission, supported by another internally contradictory response by an officer of the Department of Minerals and Energy in response to recommendation No. 7. I live on another planet if that is a satisfactory response by those that the Commonwealth Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is going to call upon. I know that sometimes it is considered to be infra dig to be critical of professional officers but I cannot help but be critical of the logic quoted on a program broadcast nationally, in response to recommendations of a parliamentary report. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the strategy recommended by this report was to pass the buck downwards, assuming certain things were happening. I believe that the evidence clearly is that those things which were recommended have not happened. By the admission of John Cook, they have not happened in terms of monitoring air and water. The strategy has failed and therefore we are now stuck with the strategy outlined in recommendation No. 10, which says, `If the company does not take the necessary measures we will pick up the tab and do it ourselves because we have an obligation to the community'. </PARA>
<PARA> Are there any dollars in the appropriation actually to rehabilitate this site to a more satisfactory state of rehabilitation than I saw 12 or 14 days ago? There is a clear requirement and an acknowledgment on the part of the Commonwealth Minister that rehabilitation of the site is a primary area of need. It has not happened; it must happen. I am asking where the dollars and cents are for it to happen, when it will happen and who will do it. That question is directed specifically to this appropriation. </PARA>

Nick Greiner, responded to a request from the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, to have a new survey undertaken to check the safety of the residents in regard to this continuing problem of the dangers of asbestos. The Premier requested the State Pollution Control Commission to undertake that survey. Apparently, that report was made available to the State Government in July and a copy of the report has, I have been informed, just been made available to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in Canberra. The report sets out a proposed program of monitoring to assess the present levels of asbestos contamination, together with cost estimates for remedial works should they be required. My understanding is that the Premier has asked the relevant State agencies to examine the proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister, Gerry Hand, is obviously pressing the Premier in order to ensure that that monitoring program and any required remedial action be undertaken expeditiously. I am sure that that correspondence or contact and pressure between the two levels of government will continue in order to see that what further remedial action is indicated is in fact undertaken without delay. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether those remedial actions can be 100 per cent effective. This discussion has been going on for over 2 1/2 hours. In many ways we come back to the point which Senator Peter Baume made-that it may come down to a question of people living on Baryulgil Square taking decisions to remove themselves from the area of contamination. If they fear that the health hazards cannot be sufficiently remedied, allayed or made less dangerous, they will have to face even more drastically the question of removing themselves to another living site. The discussion this evening brings us back to the dilemma which we know has bedevilled this matter for many years, but there is an indication that the Premier of New South Wales at least has taken up the necessity for his State agencies to, first of all, identify the problem and then suggest strategies to overcome it. That is the state of the game at the moment. I believe that in our federal system that is the correct strategy to adopt and that is where the responsibility lies. </PARA>

I do not believe they will be convinced that the funds are in this appropriation, or will go to the right place, to pursue compensation effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to move on to the last requirement which I will put before the Minister. It is a fairly recent one. It is apart from the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. It was a request that was made in a recent submission to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to appoint a project officer from and to the community-in other words, one of their own-to help coordinate health research and other aspects of this process in situ. This submission was put to Minister Hand in December 1988 and was responded to in March 1989. The refusal was revisited by the executive officers of the ex-miners association. I supported its re-submission I think around June or July of this year. In fact, I had a conversation with the Minister probably about August or September this year in which he said he would reconsider his original decision not to fund a project officer. If that reconsideration received a positive response, it would presumably be acknowledged in these appropriations. </PARA>
<PARA> The need, request and submission of the community was to appoint a project officer and the necessary administrative dollars to support that person in situ to coordinate on their behalf everything that was necessary for them to proceed to an effective medical service and to positive outcomes in terms of compensation claims. I had a personal assurance from the Minister some weeks ago that he would reconsider that. I am now wondering whether Minister Tate is able to give us an indication as to whether the Minister has reconsidered it and whether his reconsideration is favourable. If it is favourable, is it reflected in the appropriations and in terms of how many dollars would be available to fund such a project officer?</PARA>

It is just ludicrous to ask a question to which he knows the answer for a rhetorical point. There is no appropriation for that matter in these estimates. Senator McLean could not expect to find it in these estimates.

He knows that these were settled and printed well before he made the renewal of the request. If the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs were to decide that money could be made available for this request, no doubt there is a general fund within the appropriations that could be used. But he will not find anything spelt out in these appropriations in regard to that particular renewed request, it having been knocked back in March this year, which would have been taken into account when the estimates were written up. If it were to be made available, then it may be recorded in an additional Estimates process if it cannot be found to be funded out of some current larger amount of money. That is the point I was making. I do not know whether the Minister, in his reconsideration, has come to a decision different from that which commended itself in March.</PARA></TALK.START>

This debate has now gone on for five years.

In the final analysis, they are the only terms of any real consequence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been a failure on the part of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and on the part of the Government to acknowledge in these appropriations that real needs for action exist. That failure has gone on for five years. The buck has been passed in all sorts of directions. The Government has a very frustrated community on its hands, which is simply appealing to us to apply the necessary pressure to ensure that eventually the necessary dollars are appropriated. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that this is the correct context in which to raise those issues. The resource document of the report was the correct base from which to argue our case.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must finally say, in response to that, that it did not require almost 2 1/2 hours of exposition by Senator McLean to bring to the attention of the Senate or the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, the proper response that should be made to the plight of those who have been exposed to asbestos at Baryulgil Square. Indeed, Senator McLean's exposition has been deficient both in its understanding of the history of the matter, which was well supplemented and spoken to by Senator Peter Baume, and in his allocation of responsibility, which seems to be single-mindedly obsessed with sheeting home responsibility to the Federal Government for funding those courses of action and strategies which may be required to remedy the present living situation and to ensure compensation for those whose health has suffered as a result of their exposure. It is much more complex than that. On the responsibility side, the company is involved, the State Government is involved and the Federal Government is involved. I believe that the Premier of New South Wales and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs have come to an understanding as to how these responsibilities might be best undertaken and met. I believe that is the appropriate course to be undertaken.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the very serious nature of the issue raised by Senator McLean that has had to be addressed tonight on behalf of the Baryulgil community. At the same time, I feel that the processes of this Senate have, to a very large extent, been misused by the Australian Democrats. Almost 2 1/2 hours of Committee debate has had to be dedicated to this important issue when the Australian Democrats have had available to them the appropriate forum of the Estimates committees to more properly pursue this avenue of questioning. That is the line that should have been taken. They have had available to them the opportunity to put questions on notice in the Parliament; questions could have been well lodged to ascertain a lot of this information. Of course, they could have used many other debating forums in the past few weeks. They have used almost 2 1/2 hours of the appropriation debate on this issue--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I want to deal with a smorgasbord of issues covering considerations in the Aboriginal affairs portfolio. I assure the Committee that I will not be taking anything like two hours to cover a whole range of issues. It is important that we look carefully at the issues that have been raised in detail in the report of Estimates Committee E. This chamber will be well aware that yesterday, the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Michael Beahan, put forward a motion, which was accepted by this chamber, that carried various recommendations that in effect referred other important and priority issues to standing committees of the Senate. Of course, Senator Beahan's motion picked up those very important things that once again highlight that the Senate and many other forums need to look very carefully at the Aboriginal affairs portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that I have taken a very close interest in this matter since the Estimates Committee hearings of October 1988. Since that time a plethora of reports, inquiries and recommendations have had to be adopted and looked at. Some of them have been in this place; others have been by committees of the House of Representatives; and other inquiries have been properly commissioned by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) into a range of areas across the entire portfolio. Of course, many of the reports that have been tabled have been actioned. I commend officers of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC), who have given due regard to the various reports, inquiries and scrutinies that have been in place for the last 18 months or so. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate that this problem has been compounded by the political agenda of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand. In that period the Minister has doggedly proceeded to follow an agenda which resulted recently in the passage through this Parliament of legislation to create the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). That legislation was probably the most amended piece of legislation ever to have passed this Parliament. It certainly required very close attention by Government Ministers in this place and by other senators. The fact that there were some 122 amendments to the ATSIC legislation only highlighted the very fundamental flaws that were inherent in it when the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, brought it forward, guillotined it and ramrodded it through the House of Representatives. Similarly, since October 1988 Estimates Committee E has given very serious consideration to the scrutinies and inquiries that have had to be in place in regard to this portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> I make no apology for the number of questions I have placed on notice since October 1988, earlier this year and more recently. In fact, the numbers of questions I placed on notice for the current round of hearings were in excess of 600 and they are well documented in the additional information volumes that have been tabled. I commend them to anyone who wants to have a thorough understanding of this area. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to remember that the total expenditure by Commonwealth departments on special programs for Aboriginals this year is well in excess of the $915m set out in the table on page 50 of the additional information that has been tabled. Of course, in the department by department break-up that table omits several important amounts that are shown in the administrative votes of the Department of Employment, Education and Training. It also omits, because obviously the information was not available to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs at the time the table was put together, the vote from the arts, sport, the environment, tourism and territories portfolio through the appropriations of the Australia Council. So the expenditure this year on special Commonwealth programs for Aboriginals is probably in the vicinity of $950m. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Hawke Government appointed Mr Hand as the Minister in July 1987 there has been a phenomenal increase in that vote. In the last 18 months Estimates Committee E has ascertained that there has been expenditure of a voluminous amount of cash that can only be described as waste and duplication in such an important area of this portfolio. So often we see the Minister throwing cash at problems rather than seeking to solve them with a proper commitment to Aboriginal affairs and to ordering priorities in an accountable and efficient manner. That has always been my priority and the agenda that I have pursued in taking such a close interest in this area. Of course, coming from the Northern Territory it is very easy to identify with the total program in this area because it is such a significant social and economic parameter in the Northern Territory. Well in excess of 25 per cent of the people who live in the Northern Territory are of Aboriginal descent and the concerns they have-political, community, economic and social-are so very important that they need to be carefully addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate that, in the time available to me this evening, I will not be able to cover the issues that I will want to take up tomorrow. They relate to the very important considerations of the Australian Audit Office and the special correspondence it has addressed so often and on which it has had to take such a strong stance in reviewing this portfolio. Arising from the many inquiries of the last year or so are consequential areas that need to be looked at most carefully. In my opinion, a number of issues have not been properly addressed or answered by the Minister, and it is interesting to note that at all times when we have felt frustrated it is not the information flow from the public servants, the officers of the ADC or the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, that has frustrated our efforts; it has been the information flow from the office of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also interesting to note that, going back to 4 August this year, a number of questions I have on notice that relate to important financial implications have not yet been answered. Yesterday I drew to the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs those questions that are outside the 30-day rule and therefore need to be quickly and carefully addressed. However, I will pursue tomorrow the more specific issues, as will several other senators, including areas where we believe that, unfortunately, further and more detailed inquiries will also be necessary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two matters which I wish to raise on the adjournment this evening. The first relates to a matter which my colleague Senator Vanstone has raised on a number of previous occasions and which I have also raised. That is the question of the change of policy undertaken by Australia Post as it relates to discounts for publications printed in Australia with a retail price of over $5. For many years magazine format publications printed in Australia have been posted under a registered publication classification with discounts in what are called category A and category B. Category A covers religious publications and outlying or rural publications, and category B covers general interest publications. Discounts are applied on the basis of weight scales with the proviso that the editions are presorted into decreed postcode categories and bundled into decreed maximums as determined by the administration of Australia Post.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1989 a new criterion was introduced by Australia Post before its incorporation in July but that criterion was to apply after that time and progressively from October 1989 in a way which totally eliminates registered publication discounts for publications with a retail cover price of $5 or more. That means, in effect, that a subscription previously serviced for 47c now increases to $1.65 or more, depending on destination-an increase in one step of 400 per cent and up to 500 per cent in some cases. Australia Post, in the typical arrogant, pig-headed and ignorant fashion in which it often proceeds, did not consult with any of the publishers directly affected by this decision. Particularly for publishers and publications which relate to my own area of shadow ministerial responsibility, namely those in the arts and cultural area, this came as a bolt out of the blue. A simplistic and naive assumption was made that publications with a cover price over $5, by virtue of their price alone, could inherently afford such radical and unforecast cost increases. This demonstrates the ignorance of Australia Post. It indicates the extent to which that mammoth irresponsible organisation frankly does not give a fig for questions of cultural identity or cultural integrity in Australia. Nobody but an Australian Post philistine could have made this sort of intrusion into the cultural and intellectual life of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision itself is anomalous on several grounds. A monthly magazine such as Ita at $5 retail can be posted for 47c. A quarterly such as Habitat with a cover price of $5.50 will, however, cost between $1.65 and $2.15 to post. Another quarterly-again this affects my other shadow portfolio, the environment-Australian Wild, which has held its cover price at $4.95 for two years, cannot viably plan an increase because it would add $2 to subscription postal costs per unit. </PARA>
<PARA> The rationale for this radical and discriminatory price increase is that Australia Post has allocated a $20m notional loss calculation to its servicing of registered publications. Should this assessment be the case, then it is the more frequently posted subscriptions which contribute most to the loss. However, the majority of the over $5 publications affected are bimonthly or quarterly. In the case of some poetry journals, for example, they may be even less frequent than that. They may come out only when there is sufficient material for an issue to be printed and a sufficient level of subscriptions available for people to be prepared to undertake the publication. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the above calculation does not include the category of periodical publications which are newsprint quality publications posted at even cheaper rates than registered publications, even though many are similar in weight. It also excludes high volume publications such as Readers Digest, which has an annual distribution in Australia of five million copies, the National Roads and Motorists Association's Open Road, which posts nine million copies a year to people in New South Wales alone, or excellent publications such as Dick Smith's Australian Geographic, which has a circulation in the order of 700,000, and, because of the nature of Australian publishing, is printed in Japan. These and other publications are posted at specially negotiated rates. Moreover, those rates are secret. That is to say, the rates are not on the public record, as are registered publication discounts. However, the specially negotiated rates are known to people in the industry to be considerably less than their equivalent category. When calculating the supposed loss the largest part of Australia Post's servicing of subscription publications is excluded. </PARA>
<PARA> While there may be some economies of scale associated with volume handling, the fact is that all subscription journals are presorted by the publisher, bundled to specification laid down by Australia Post, and then handled by the same sorting houses, carried by the same trucks and delivered by the same postmen. Variations of hundreds of per cent are simply not viable or supportable. </PARA>
<PARA> If eligibility for discount is to be assessed on ability to pay, then the whole economic equation of publishing should be taken into account. Some publishers fulfil a marketing niche on the basis of high advertising ratio, less editorial content and more often cheaper quality paper which allows lower price points in the market niche for literary reader-oriented publications by which policy has a higher editorial ratio, lower advertising content and high quality paper. Some may choose to carry no advertising at all so that the reader bears the total cost of the reading matter without commercial influence. Publishers in the commercial context have to balance the factors of advertising revenue, circulation revenue and quality of production to stay viable. The reality is that most of the high quality locally printed publications with cover prices over $5 are highly specialised with the emphasis on editorial content, more costly design, and printing with only marginal profitability compared to the mass media publishers such as Packer, Murdoch, Fairfax and the others. They also tend to be less frequent than the disposable magazines. </PARA>
<PARA> If it is deemed appropriate by Australia Post to recover losses from a specific category of customers, I put to the Senate that the rate surely should not be an increase applying across the board by criteria which directly reflect Australia Post's costs, that is to say, weight and possibly size. If volume attracts further discount, then should not this reflect real economies of scale which are unlikely to be to the degree of 100 per cent to 500 per cent or more? Publishers who choose to operate by economies of service to produce less frequently-that is, bimonthly or quarterly-should not be penalised by the inherently lower volumes per annum this creates when, in fact, they are creating a lower impact on the postal system although they are offering the reader a similar annual amount of reading compared to smaller or less editorial content publications posted monthly or, indeed, weekly. </PARA>
<PARA> The potential impact of this decision has been particularly drawn to my attention by Barbara McGregor from the Australian Well Being magazine, a magazine which Senator Vanstone quoted from in some detail on the last occasion on which she spoke. She makes the point, quite rightly, that, given this sort of impost, many of these publications will cease altogether. Publishers of high quality editions may have no option but to print overseas. Presumably Australia Post will not lose a moment's sleep over that. Australia Post has never demonstrated the slightest commitment to Australian publishing. That in its own way will contribute to increasing further debt, with savings which would offset the radical increases in subscription postage. In fact, Australia Post is part of a system which, if this is pursued, will entrench the interests of major publishers to the disadvantage of smaller independent publishers. New enterprises and new publications will have a cost hurdle to overcome which would be virtually insurmountable were they to plan to compete with established high volume or highly commercial operators. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia Post is now in a position in which its decisions are virtually unreviewable except by its own board. Ministers, in the sort of gutless approach that we are used to from this Government, plead that they are unwilling or unable to intervene. All the high sounding rhetoric from the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) about how he wants to increase Australian cultural identity is set at naught when he then stands up and says, `Well, so literary magazines get squeezed out of existence, poetry journals disappear, magazines in the environment movement are going to be forced to close. That is Australia Post's decision. You can't expect me as a mere Minister in the Government actually to take some role in putting my money where my mouth is'. One would not expect him, in fact, to have the intestinal fortitude to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of making these decisions, Australia Post demonstrates no understanding of what it is that actually imposes the costs upon the Australia Post system or, indeed, what will be the effect of the decision in adding to the burden of those literary, cultural and environmental magazines which have previously enjoyed a degree of subsidy, that degree of subsidy being seen by the Parliament and by previous governments as a legitimate expenditure of public money in support of a particular activity. </PARA>
<PARA> Once the magazine is inside the envelope, Australia Post has no idea what the price on the cover actually is. If a magazine were simply to be printed without a cover price on it, how would Australia Post make the assessment that the cover price is one which should cause the subsidy to be forfeited? Everybody knows that when one buys a pair of shoes in Australia these days, whatever number of dollars one pays for a pair of shoes, one can bet one's life that the cent value will be 95 or 99 cents. It keeps it below the next dollar value. So anything that was published at $4.99 cover price would not attract this arbitrary impost by Australia Post but anything at $5 would. It may well be that the answer for the Australian publishers is to go through the farce of reducing to $4.99 everything which is now $5. That is the sort of idiocy one gets from an organisation such as Australia Post. </PARA>
<PARA> What ought to be the criteria are questions of weight, size, conformity with specifications such as packaging, pre-sorting, bundling, postcode arrangements, or whatever it happens to be. But Australia Post has cast itself now in the role of a de facto censor, a tax levier or, indeed, a price setting authority. It is contributing to a monopolisation of a particular field in which it specialises and has exclusive right to provide the service. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that Opposition policy will achieve is to challenge the monopoly position of Australia Post in many of these areas-and a good thing it will be too. Nevertheless, freedom of speech, equality of opportunity, and encouragement for the small value added and creative entrepreneurs, which we believe are fundamental to Australian society and its future, are jeopardised by this lunatic decision of Australia Post. Any action by a government body, whether it is supposed to be profit oriented or not, which defeats those overwhelming democratic and cultural imperatives in Australia is injurious to the nation and is something which, frankly, ought to be eliminated and in which government ought to be prepared to take a hand. </PARA>
<PARA> One other matter I propose to raise very briefly is the question of the public debate about the legalisation in Australia or otherwise of drugs such as heroin, which has proceeded with some renewed interest in the course of the last couple of months. My colleague Senator Peter Baume has spoken on the subject and Senator Tate, the Minister on duty at the moment, has put his view into the public arena. Whatever the outcome of that debate, all I can say is that I think there has been a healthier attempt to analyse the issues in the course of the last couple of months than has been evident in the past. There are strongly held views on either side of that particular debate. My colleague the honourable member for North Sydney, Mr John Spender, for example, has also recently published an article on this subject. The debate is clearly one which over the next couple of years is likely to occupy a fairly central place in the public debate about drug strategies, response to the acquired immune deficiency syndrome problem and, indeed, the efficacy of drug strategies and prohibitive versus more liberalised regimes. </PARA>
<PARA> On 17 August Mr Milton Luger presented a paper to the Law Society conference entitled Youth need heroes, not heroin, which was a major paper on that subject. In the same spirit, Dr Stephen Mugford has prepared a response to that paper entitled On heroes and heroin: A comment on Milton Luger's paper. Rather than go through the arguments presented, I simply seek leave to table those two papers and make them available for honourable senators and anybody else who would wish to examine them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have all heard a lot about the Government's non-decision of 5 October to postpone a decision on the mining of Coronation Hill. The general view of Kakadu stage 3 has certainly changed since Senator Gareth Evans, as Minister for Resources and Energy, said that it was clapped-out buffalo country. I notice with approval Mike Seccombe's misquotation from Fawlty Towers in the Sydney Morning Herald of 28 October:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . what did you expect, Senator Evans, herds of wildebeest, sweeping majestically across the plains?</PARA>
<PARA>Apparently, Senator Evans did see herds sweeping across the plain; but it must have been a trick of the light because I am informed that buffalo damage to stage 3 is quite minor-about one per cent-and that the eradication program has been quite successful. In fact, when I was up in Kakadu not so long ago I met some buffalo hunters and, while they were quite frightening looking creatures, like something out of Mad Max, they were clearly doing a very good job and also managing to earn a living out of it. </PARA>
<PARA> More recently, strong statements have been made by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, and a very confusing set of contradictory position statements from the Opposition. The latest from Senator Puplick suggests that a coalition government would allow mineral exploration in stage 2, a World Heritage area, but no mining, so that we will know what we are missing out on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Puplick can make a personal explanation tomorrow. It is unclear who will fund this expensive exploration effort purely for the satisfaction of Senator Puplick's curiosity. Reactions amongst conservationists have been mixed. It is hard to resist the temptation, when so many arguments on conservation have been lost, to applaud and offer approval to decisions which seem to be going in the right direction-and I stress the word `seem'. I am reminded of the well known lines on temptation in T. S. Eliot's poem Murder in the Cathedral:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The last temptation is the greatest treason,</PARA>
<PARA>To do the right deed for the wrong reason. </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, this is a temptation that our governments succumb to effortlessly. The distinction between the right and the wrong reasons is not just a moral quibble but a very practical discrimination. In this case we are keenly aware of the electoral motive for the Government's decision. We are also aware that this motive will no longer exist after the next election. This is the antithesis of the longterm planning this nation needs. We all know the reasons and excuses for this state of affairs, but the Australian people deserve better service from their governments than this cyclic obsession with grabbing power. </PARA>
<PARA> Kakadu National Park is one of the world's great wilderness areas. It is one of the few tropical reserves in a developed country and, despite our economic woes, we can afford to preserve it. In the long term, a decision not to preserve this rich natural asset will be seen as gross environmental and economic irresponsibility. Mining in areas of widely recognised significance such as those listed as World Heritage areas must be avoided. This is a remarkable area. Let me quote again from the remarks of the levelheaded Mr Seccombe:</PARA>
<PARA>You have to come here to fully appreciate the richness of it. There are at least 1,275 types of plants, 280 types of birds (one-third of the total Australian species), more than 100 different reptiles, more than 62 mammals and more than 77 fish species (three times as many as in the Murray-Darling system). And an estimated 10,000 types of insects. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, he says:</PARA>
<PARA>Kakadu is unique in the world in that it encompasses a complete wet/dry tropical river system-the Alligator river system. </PARA>
<PARA>Already, Kakadu National Park has been compromised by the presence of the Ranger uranium mine within its boundaries, although the mine has been garlanded by an excised portion of the park. It has been proposed that other uranium deposits such as Koongarra and Jabiluka within the general confines of Kakadu should also be allowed to proceed. This development would greatly increase any threat to Kakadu Park. Although Ranger uranium mine has not had a catastrophic accident affecting the park, there have been a number of minor incidents and the potential for a major disaster always lurks just below the surface. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been ongoing conflict between the Office of the Supervising Scientist and the Ranger uranium mine operators, who, would obviously like to weaken the tight controls on the Ranger operation. This history of conflict augurs ill for the effectiveness of less stringent controls like those likely to be imposed on the mine at Coronation Hill and any other mines in this region. The potential problems associated with the Ranger mine may be realised if the increased production suggested by the mine owners and Government Ministers is allowed to proceed. There have been a number of recommendations on the desirability of preserving vital elements of the Kakadu environment. The Fox Commission report-the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry-recommended as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>That if possible the national park include at least one large total river catchment; the South Alligator catchment is the most suitable. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the river that will be contaminated by accidents or carelessness. In 1985 the National Parks and Wildlife Service stated in a report on the national park value as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>These wetlands, (in stage I and II) representing the major part of stage 2 and significant areas of stage I and Goodparla, are vulnerable to changes in the quality of water from the upper reaches of the South Alligator. Unsympathetic land use practices upstream could seriously diminish these wetland values. </PARA>
<PARA>The current Government's response to the management of stage 3 has been initially to set 35 per cent of it aside for exploration in the perversely named `conservation zone' and place the remaining 65 per cent in stage 3 of the national park. This occurred in 1986. The precise boundaries of the conservation zone could never be agreed upon; so, for three years, the exploration program did not progress. Thus, there is still no detailed assessment of the mineral value of this area-the supposed justification for setting this area aside. </PARA>
<PARA> On 5 October 1989 the Government placed most of the conservation zone into stage 3 of Kakadu. However, it kept the highly prospective areas from El Sherana to Coronation Hill out of the park as an exploration zone, and will probably allow mining to proceed in these areas, although it will certainly not say that before the next election. The net result of this compromise is that the mineral potential of the area will not be assessed, but the most important area from a conservation point of view- the South Alligator River Valley-will probably still be mined, thus ensuring a continued threat to the World Heritage areas of Kakadu stages 1 and 2, and the potential World Heritage area of stage 3. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of future development has been referred to the Resource Assessment Commission, which will take 12 months to produce a report which will be `comparable in detail to an EIS'-yet another environmental impact statement. A major difficulty for the Government is that it clearly indicated to the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd and its partners in 1986 that the Coronation Hill mine would be able to go ahead if it met certain requirements. Now that BHP has met those requirements the Government has added yet another set of hurdles to delay the decision until after the election, rather than making real judgments on these important issues. I acknowledge that this is unfair to BHP, and it would be only just if the Government repaid the costs of the environmental impact statement (EIS) it demanded as a condition of development. It would also release members of Cabinet from any lingering feeling of obligation to BHP if they have the good fortune to meet again on this matter after the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, in its response to the EIS, gave the mine implicit approval to go ahead. In one of his famous casuistical bets-hedging statements, in the Australian Financial Review of 22 September 1989 Senator Richardson said that if Coronation Hill `was a one-off development, I would not recommend against it as a result of the assessment report'. I understand by that that he would approve it, although I recognise the logic of his argument that, after the approval for the first mine, his Government would find it impossible to refuse subsequent applications. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this Government and the private sector have hoped for too much from tourism. It has been another quick fix for our economic problems, but tourism is important to the economy of Australia and especially the Northern Territory. Kakadu National Park is one of the major attractions of the region. In 1987 approximately 200,000 tourists visited Kakadu National Park. Since 1987 the number of tourists has continued to increase, with current levels in excess of a quarter of a million. This compares with 180,000 visitors to the Katherine Gorge and 250,000 to Uluru and the Olgas. In addition, the average visitor to Kakadu stays four to five days rather than the 1.5 days and two days for Uluru and Katherine Gorge respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> Kakadu must be considered as a valuable economic resource both now and in the future. Australia has an unfortunate record in the destruction of its national assets. Fresh in my mind is the pungent example of Sydney's beaches, which I referred to in my second reading speech supporting my Bill to amend the Australian Heritage Commission Act. I have not calculated the cost to our tourist industry of our once famous but now notoriously befouled beaches-I think it would be considerable-but I have sought information giving a rough calculation of the cost of a partial degradation of Kakadu. Let us be conservative and calculate the cost to the region and Australia if there was only a 10 per cent reduction in overseas visitors, a 5 per cent reduction in domestic visitors and another 5 per cent reducing their stay by 50 per cent. The loss to Australia in these circumstances would be approximately $6.75m per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> One of our major problems is our willingness to use our non-renewable resources to generate short term emergency cash without considering future generations or the planet as a whole. This `dig it up now' mentality threatens the long term sustainable future of Australia, and we must begin now to restructure the use of our resources. If we do this, mining may well continue to be an important element of our economy, but it should be the cream, not the major component-nearly 50 per cent-of our exports. If we can be less dependent upon our mineral exports we will be less often the victim of our powerful customers in a buyers' market. </PARA>
<PARA> The Coronation Hill deposit does not rank among the top few deposits. It is predominantly a gold deposit with the production of platinum group metals only a relatively small component. Thus, arguments for a go-ahead because of the strategic value of the platinum group metals are not particularly convincing. It could be argued that investment in other properties in areas of lesser environmental significance would be in the best longer term interests of Australia. It can also be argued that, although Coronation Hill itself is not a dramatically large deposit, the region from El Sherana to Coronation Hill may well be a world class mineral province. However, there has been no study of the impact of mining on the entire region, and until this is done the potential damage of large scale mining operations can only be guessed at. It is very hard to imagine that substantial adjacent mineral developments, all in the South Alligator River valley, would not eventually lead to considerable environmental problems. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also likely that the ore from other mines, such as El Sherana, would most probably be processed in the Coronation Hill plant. This will require either the disposal of considerably more waste rock and water in the Coronation Hill area, which could greatly increase the stress on the area and pose tremendous problems for long term safe storage-primarily because of the bioaccumulating heavy metals in the tailings piles-or the transport of the waste to another site for disposal. This would result in considerably more traffic in the region and, as crossings of the South Alligator River may well be involved, the risk of damage to the river system and its delicate ecosystem as well as the wetlands downstream in the remainder of Kakadu National Park. There has been much mention of cyanide in discussions about ecological risks, but cyanide would probably only be a problem in the immediate vicinity of the mine. The minerals released by extensive disturbance of soil in the region could well be much more of a problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Stage 3 of Kakadu is an important area for flora and fauna and is particularly rich in a wide range of animals. It is a major breeding area for both the pig-nosed turtle and the hooded parrot. Many plants and animals are unique to stage 3 of Kakadu and widespread mining and exploration activity may well threaten their survival. In 1985 the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The case for the incorporation of Gimbat and Goodparla in the Kakadu National park is largely based on the following factors:</PARA>
<PARA>(i) inclusion of a total large river catchment i.e. South Alligator River; (ii) geological, geomorphological and other physical values; (iii) biological values; (iv) presence of rare or threatened species and their habitats; (v) Aboriginal values; (vi) recreational and educational values. </PARA>
<PARA>In all of these categories Kakadu stage 3 is exceptional. The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service also stated:</PARA>
<PARA>In accepting the nomination of Kakadu National Park for World Heritage List, the World Heritage Committee noted the Australian Government's intention to proclaim additional areas as part of Kakadu and recommended that such areas be included on the World Heritage List. </PARA>
<PARA>This should be done. Full protection of the entire South Alligator River is essential to the long term health of all stages of Kakadu. </PARA>
<PARA> The area, including Coronation Hill, is of vital cultural importance to the Aboriginal Jawoyn people. It is known as the `sickness country' and is an area with many connected sites sacred to the creation god Bula and, according to the Jawoyn belief, is still occupied by this god. They believe that sickness and death will befall them as custodians of the sickness country if mining is allowed to proceed. They also claim that sickness and death was associated with the extremely limited mining activity in the 1950s and the 1960s and that the large scale mines now envisaged would be devastating. In their submission on the Coronation Hill environmental impact statement the Jawoyn people stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Jawoyn and non-Jawoyn Aboriginal people believe that any disturbance of Bula will mean disaster for everyone in the world, not just for Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA>The speculation that the traditional Jawoyn `sickness' designation of this area might have arisen from the poisonous heavy metal concentrations in this area and other speculations about the genesis of the creation story in this dramatic landscape, while interesting, are irrelevant to the beliefs of the local inhabitants. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not my practice to denigrate anyone's belief and the Jawoyn beliefs sound no more implausible to me than many hawked door to door or sonorously declaimed from pulpits-or, for that matter, declared on the floor of this chamber. The fact is, although we live in a secular society, freedom of religious belief is a vital traditional freedom that I, and I believe other senators, would vigorously defend. Most of our treasured freedoms have a price; civil rights can protect the guilty as well as the innocent, and freedom of religious belief can at times impose considerable costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the beliefs of the Jawoyn are tied to a geographical area, any recognition of the right of the Jawoyn people to hold these beliefs means at least some circumspection in any plans for the use of that land. We must also remember that we are dealing with a fragile culture, a culture under considerable pressure from the modern world. As a nation we have declared our concern to protect these indigenous cultures and we have a difficult task trying to do this without imposing our own blueprints of stasus, synthesis or progressive assimilation. The best policy is clearly `hands off', leaving indigenous peoples with as much cultural self-determination as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> During the debate on the Coronation Hill joint venture a variety of views have been offered on the strength of local beliefs in the `sickness country' and other traditional concepts. This is scarcely surprising. Since Heisenberg we have become more aware of the intrusive role of the observer and we have many examples of anthropologists imposing their own views or fantasies on other cultures while attempting to be objective. Investigators and negotiators with a strong motive to sweep aside traditional beliefs-so that they can start mining-are likely to emphasise views in the community that are in harmony with their own. There is also some evidence of genuine misunderstanding, where politeness has been mistaken for acquiescence. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not an easy area in which to strike the right balance and I would not suggest that the traditional religious beliefs of any group should always take priority over the interests of the rest of the community. However, there is plenty of evidence of the various damaging effects of the intrusion of mining development into local Aboriginal communities and, in this case, there is the associated assault upon traditional beliefs. This weighs heavily against any decision to allow mining projects in this area to go ahead. I think that the seriousness of this aspect of the debate has been undervalued and that, together with the potential environmental losses associated with the possible future mining developments in this areas, combines to make a strong case for a firm `No' to any mining at Coronation Hill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A man of great integrity and vision passed away in the Northern Territory today. Toby Gangali, who was 59 years of age, will be remembered for his outstanding contribution to the financial and cultural autonomy of the Gagudju people. A modest and unassuming man, Toby, along with Mick Alderton and the late Nipper Kaparigi, shaped the operation of their people's own royalty association. Back in the early days Toby worked as a buffalo shooter at Munmalary station and was regarded as a crack shot and a superb horseman. Toby played a key role in the Fox Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry and was the main witness in the Alligator River stage 2 land claim. He became instrumental in the establishment of the Kakadu National Park plan of management and, with Nipper Kaparigi, helped the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service record and map sacred sites, dreaming trails and seasonal camps throughout the area as well as the mythological significance of the country. Toby also involved himself in all aspects of the park's operation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A member of the Mirrakundjeyimi clan, Toby was the chief custodian of a number of sites of significance and, as a traditional owner of an area encompassing Ranger, Mudginberri and Pan-Continental, he aspired for the self-sufficiency of his people. Today his association spends its royalty resources on a range of activities normally funded by the government. </PARA>
<PARA> Toby, who lived at Nourlangie, steered the Gagudju Association from its inception in 1980. It is significant to note that payments to individuals were limited and that traditional owners resolved that decisions about the distribution of the Association's income had to be decided by a unanimous vote of Association members, not merely by members of its committee. Such an approach has given the Gagudju Association the freedom to provide its members with services tailored to meet their specific needs, such as the development of outstations and services, the provision of schooling and health services, and the establishment of a children's trust. </PARA>
<PARA> Not surprisingly, sometimes there were strained relations between Toby Gangali's Gagudju Association and the more ambitious, insensitive and political Northern Land Council. The Gagudju Association pursues a policy of investing in local business and, as a result, owns the Cooinda Hotel, the Crocodile Motel at Jabiru, the Border Store at Cahill's Crossing and property in Darwin. It also services various contracts in Jabiru. Toby Gangali is survived by his wife Ruby and his four daughters and three sons. He was described by a former executive officer of the Gagudju Association, Gerry Thomas, in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>That man was Kakadu. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take the opportunity that the adjournment debate affords me to raise an issue concerning air traffic control at Darwin Airport. Yesterday, during the Committee's consideration of the estimates for the Department of Transport and Communications, I had the task of eliciting from Senator Evans an answer to a question that I had asked on notice some seven weeks previously-through the courtesy of Senator Brownhill-at a Senate Estimates committee hearing. The Department of Transport and Communications seemed most reluctant to provide the answers requested. It was only after a veiled threat yesterday that we would postpone consideration of the Department's Budget provision until the answer was forthcoming that I was finally provided with an answer. </PARA>
<PARA> Five questions were asked relating to decisions concerning air traffic controller operations, and their implications for staffing, costings, safety and the consultation process. I was given a reasonably comprehensive answer. As a result of that and other information that came forward during the debate yesterday on the Federal Airports Corporation and Darwin Airport, I issued a press release yesterday in which I pointed out that Darwin's air traffic control faces cutbacks. As a result of the media comment on that press release, I received representations today from the Northern Territory councillor, a Mr Jim Bramich, of the Civil Air Operations Officers Association of Australia, in effect, the body that looks after the interests of the air traffic controllers at Darwin Airport. The information from Mr Bramich pointed out very succinctly that it would appear that within the Department of Transport and Communications the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday in the Senate the Minister provided me with a detailed and comprehensive answer setting out information of the Government's intentions with regard to the reductions in staffing and cost savings that were to be effected at Darwin Airport. It would appear that Mr Bramich, on behalf of the Civil Air Operations Officers Association, has also been engaged in discussions and consultations with other members of the Department of Transport and Communications who have, in effect, advised him that there were not to be any such changes or consolidations in the staffing arrangements at Darwin Airport. Time will tell whether the Minister in the information he provided to me yesterday is right or whether other officers of the Department who have assured a union that there were not to be those same cuts and changes are right. It is important for the record of this issue that I seek to have incorporated in Hansard the question and answer, my media release and the correspondence my office received from the CAOOAA. </PARA>

<PARA>QUESTION FROM SENATOR TAMBLING</PARA>
<PARA>TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS-PROGRAM 1: AVIATION</PARA>
<PARA>Subject: Sub-program 1.7: Civil Aviation Authority</PARA>
<PARA>Question</PARA>
<PARA>1. What decisions have been made to reduce air traffic controller operations from the Northern Territory?</PARA>
<PARA>2. What are the staffing implications?</PARA>
<PARA>3. What are the costing implications?</PARA>
<PARA>4. What are the safety implications?</PARA>
<PARA>5. What consultations have been engaged in with the Northern Territory Government?</PARA>
<PARA>Answer</PARA>
<PARA>1. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) airways investment program provides for air traffic services at remote locations to be consolidated to major centres. The consolidation program provides for continuing provision of the pilot briefing activities and approach control services from Darwin, with the other air traffic services to be relocated to Adelaide and Perth in January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>2. With provision of briefing and approach control services from Darwin, staff members in Darwin will halve from 40 to 20. If SAR services are also retained, an additional 5 staff will remain in Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA>3. Cost savings of about $344,000 pa will be achieved by location briefing and approach control functions only in Darwin. If SAR services are also retained in Darwin these savings will reduce considerably. </PARA>
<PARA>4. Safety will not be compromised. The use of modern technology offers the opportunity to improve productivity without any deterioration in the quality of the services provided. The CAA will ensure that the arrangements finally agreed under the consolidation program will maintain a safe airways system to the satisfaction of the Government and the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>5. The NT Minister for Transport and Works has been briefed and officers of the CAA and the NT Department of Transport and Works have discussed the program on a number of occasions. </PARA>

<PARA>DARWIN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL FACES CUTBACKS</PARA>
<PARA> A plan to slash air traffic control operations at Darwin Airport cast doubt over the future of the entire airport redevelopment program, Northern Territory Senator Grant Tambling said today. </PARA>
<PARA> The CLP senator revealed that the Civil Aviation Authority intended halving its staff in Darwin and relocating important air traffic services interstate. </PARA>
<PARA> ``The Federal Transport and Communications Department confirmed that, under the proposal, 20 out of 40 staff would lose their Darwin jobs and important air traffic services would be relocated to Adelaide and Perth by January 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> ``The downgrading of air traffic control operations at Darwin Airport casts a shadow over claims by Labor Senator Bob Collins and Labor Federal Member, Warren Snowdon, that the Hawke Labor Government is still committed to the redevelopment of the airport. </PARA>
<PARA> ``I will believe it when I see it.''</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tambling said information provided by the Civil Aviation Authority showed that a combination of staff cuts and a relocation of air traffic services would save $344,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA> ``I find it hypocritical that the Hawke Labor Government talks loudly about pouring millions of dollars into the redevelopment of Darwin Airport and, at the same time, plans to move the staff and services of a major aviation authority interstate. </PARA>
<PARA> ``I challenge Labor's mouthpieces in the Northern Territory, Senator Collins and Mr Snowdon, to reaffirm the Federal Government's commitment to the present design and construction timetables of Darwin Airport.''</PARA>

<PARA>ATTN: TIZ ZERONI</PARA>
<PARA>RE: PROPOSED CONSOLIDATION DARWIN AIR TRAFFIC SERVICES</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Tiz,</PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for the fax of Senator Tambling's media release and the response to his questions. </PARA>
<PARA> This fax is in response to our discussion of this morning regarding the Senator's press release concerning Darwin Air Traffic Control cutbacks. </PARA>
<PARA> CAOOAA is the professional body which represents Air Traffic Controllers within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> CAOOAA's NT Division, which I represent on our Association's Central Council, is, and has always been opposed to any consolidation of Air Traffic Control Services from Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the main reasons for opposing consolidation is that CAA have failed to adequately demonstrate that the cutbacks will be cost effective (i.e. save money) and be of a benefit to the aviation industry. </PARA>
<PARA> CAA have already carried out two consolidations of Air Traffic Control Services under their consolidation plan for the NT. </PARA>
<PARA> The first of these involved the transfer of enroute control (sector control) from Alice Springs Tower to Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA> This move was generated by a proposal to cut the hours of Alice Springs Control Tower. It was proposed that instead of providing a 24 hour service, Alice Tower would close overnight, thereby permitting a saving in staff numbers required to man the Tower together with of course a saving in salaries. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to achieve this saving it was necessary to transfer the enroute control functions of Alice Springs Tower (a 24 hour service) to Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA> To take over this traffic in Adelaide, it was necessary to create at least three new ATC positions in the Adelaide Area Approach Control Centre, at a cost I would suggest exceeding $150,000 per annum. This figure is for salaries alone, it does not take into account any engineering costs, nor does it take into account leave relief for these three additional controllers in Adelaide. There was no staff reduction at Alice Springs. </PARA>
<PARA> Shortly after Adelaide took over the enroute control function from Alice Springs Tower it was decided, due to public and aviation industry pressure, not to close the Tower at night. </PARA>
<PARA> The net result of this exercise was the creation of 3 additional ATC positions in Adelaide, no reduction in Alice Springs staff, but yearly additional costs to CAA, and ultimately the aviation industry, of at least $150,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The other consolidation is that of transferring Operational Control/Search and Rescue functions from Alice Springs to Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA> I have attached copy of a letter from Mr Brian Miller, the Assistant General Manager, Air Traffic Services, SA/NT Field Office CAA which details the supposed cost savings resulting from this exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe Mr Miller's figures to be inaccurate in that they do not take into account the following:</PARA>
<PARA>- there was a net gain in Darwin staff of three, not two controllers in Darwin as stated by Mr Miller. This means that $53,000 should be added to his Darwin salaries. This also means an additional family leave fare of $2652. </PARA>
<PARA>- there was an upgrade of one Darwin class 3 controller to class 4 which would have cost approximately $5000. </PARA>
<PARA>In the agreement for the transfer is contained an agreement for two familiarisation trips for Darwin Search and Rescue staff to Alice Springs per year. This would be something of the order of four staff a year at something of the order of $1500 per person for a total of $6000. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, under the Darwin costs given in Mr Miller's letter should read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 3 X ATC 4 salaries... </PARA>
<PARA>$159,000</PARA>
<PARA> 1 X upgrade ATC 3 to ATC 4... </PARA>
<PARA>5,000</PARA>
<PARA> 1 1/2 transfers/year... </PARA>
<PARA>20,000</PARA>
<PARA> 3 family leave fares... </PARA>
<PARA>7,956</PARA>
<PARA> 4 X familiarisation trips... </PARA>
<PARA>6,000</PARA>
<PARA> Total... </PARA>
<PARA>$197,956</PARA>
<PARA>This therefore gives a net annual cost of $4,380. That is the consolidation, which was done to save costs, has in fact cost over $4,000 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA>The above figures are only ongoing costs, and do not take into account capital costs. In order for the transfer to take place, it was necessary to upgrade the Darwin Operational Control Centre. This took the form of new consoles, additional satellite intercoms, a new telephone system etc, and would probably have cost something of the order of $100,000. The building in which this upgrade took place is scheduled to be handed over to the RAAF in the next three or four years, and so the figure of $100,000 must be amortised over this period. I have requested costings for this upgrade, and other engineering works associated with the consolidation, but as yet have not received them. </PARA>
<PARA>There were also seven familiarisation trips for Search and Rescue staff to Alice Springs, together with two trips by the Darwin check controller, prior to the Alice Springs closure, for a total cost of about $13,500. </PARA>
<PARA>Additionally, should a Search and Rescue action take place in the Alice Springs area, it will now be necessary to fly in Search and Rescue staff thereby generating additional costs. </PARA>
<PARA>Apart from appearing to cost more money to provide, the Operational Control and Search and Rescue service for Alice Springs, now provided from Darwin, must be of a lesser quality due to the distance involved, lack of local knowledge time taken to get staff to the area etc. </PARA>
<PARA>Another consolidation which has taken place in the last couple of years was that of Townsville Operational Control and Search and Rescue to Brisbane. CAA has not provided any costings for this consolidation, but it would also appear that there has been little if any cost savings. </PARA>
<PARA>I would suggest that if Senator Tambling were to obtain the costings for the above consolidations from the appropriate Minister that they should make interesting reading. </PARA>
<PARA>As mentioned to you on the telephone earlier today, Mr Miller advised a meeting of CAA's NT Consultative Council, which took place on the 14th of November, that he had placed a freeze on CAA's NT consolidation plans pending the outcome of a review. He advised that he was concerned with the timetable, and the level of service which would be provided post consolidation. </PARA>
<PARA>This is at variance with the answer to question 1 which you faxed to me. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Miller also said that following a review done to determine the effectiveness of providing a Search and Rescue (SAR) Service from a remote locality as opposed to Darwin, it had been decided that a SAR presence should remain in Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA>The above comments will be recorded in the minutes of the meeting. As yet these minutes have not been distributed. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope the above is of some use to Senator Tambling. Should yourself or the Senator have any queries now, or in the future, do not hesitate to contact me.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to discuss this evening a program known as LETS. The acronym stands for local employment trading system. It is a barter system under which people exchange local goods and services without the need of Australian currency through creating a local currency of their own under their own control. It is quite a novel idea, but one which is gaining a lot of popularity. Certainly in Western Australia LETS groups are mushrooming all over Perth and have been operating in Margaret River. They are now also operating in the other country centres of Bunbury, Albany and Cunderdin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> LETS is a system under which no interest is charged. People cannot use a LETS currency to make more money, so there is no value in hoarding. It is a system in which there is no possibility of theft because the currency is not carried from place to place and so cannot be stolen. There is no borrowing or lending and therefore no repayment schedules, no debt collectors, and no tight squeezes to cover loans. It is important to understand that money creates many problems for many people, the main one being that most of us simply think we do not have enough of it most of the time. However, when Australian dollars are scarce our local economy dries up for lack of money. Unemployment rises at the same time as people are unable to meet even basic needs of food, clothing and shelter. Because money is scarce, people have to compete in order to obtain it and the costs of the security of money are rising. People who wish to cooperate are thought naive or get ripped off in the economic jungle. Money is used to make money, not to meet people's needs. It is outside local control and tends to flow into the hands of those who already have the most. Clean water and fresh air, on the other hand, which cannot be bought and be sold, are considered valueless, or `free' to pollute at no cost to the community until expensive cleaning up is required. Then everybody screams very loudly about the costs involved. Unless there is money to pay for local skills, they are undervalued or dismissed as worthless. There has to be a better alternative, particularly as we are approaching the post-industrial age when full employment is a thing of the past. </PARA>
<PARA> People trading in the LET system notify trustees set up by the local group of the agreed upon value of the energy transfer between them. This is recorded against an account held in each person's name. To get an account, a person joins the local system and makes a list of the various skills and services he or she has to offer other people. That is all put on to a computerised sheet and a person is able to see what goods and services other people in the community may have to offer in return. Everyone's account starts at zero and LETS currency is created every time two people decide to trade. Local currency, therefore, never dries up. It is always available and depends only on the time and energy individuals have to offer. Because it is valid only in the local community, it can never leave the local economy and helps people save Australian dollars to use for the goods and services not available locally. </PARA>
<PARA> Most LET systems are incorporated as non-profit associations run by their members who elect a board of advisers to appoint their own trustees. There is no obligation upon members to trade and no setting of prices for goods and services. The system began in Canada six years ago and spread rapidly to the west coast of Australia, but had its early life in this country on the east coast. It enables participants in communities to replace dollars and cents with any agreed local currency such as cowry shells, which one of the local Western Australian groups is using, to trade for goods and services among themselves. We see then a never ending supply of costly goods and services such as babysitting, gardening, hairdressing, language lessons, organically grown vegetables, car repairs, taxation returns, computer skills and the like being available under the scheme. It works this way. If person A, whom we will call Mike, needed a babysitter and decided to ask person B, whom we will call Mary, they would first agree on a price, say 20 cowry shells. Then one of the people would contact a LETS trustee and both accounts would be settled in the books. Mike would be 20 cowry shells in deficit and Mary would be 20 cowry shells in credit. If Mary later wanted her lawn mown and settled on a price of 15 cowry shells, her account would then go down from 20 to 5. To even one's account, one simply offers one's products or services to other people so as to build up more cowry shells against one's name. </PARA>
<PARA> I am indebted to Mr John Croft of the group in Western Australia and to Vivienne Elanta who organised one of the groups in my area in Western Australia, which is working particularly well. Mr Croft believes that particular groups within society will benefit greatly from LETS which he says could be used to increase the nation's wealth. It seems that a lot of the good side effects from the system are for people on low incomes, such as the elderly and disabled pensioners. These people can use a local currency to purchase local goods and services while their pensions are free for things that are not usually available to people in that income bracket. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators interjecting might be on the receiving end of some of these goods and services one day. It would pay them to listen to this with a little more interest than ridicule because it is something that is becoming very prevalent in the community as people are being increasingly squeezed by our monetary economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Up to now skills like childminding and dressmaking have been greatly undervalued. People with such skills now have the opportunity to profit from them. People in the lower income groups and women who choose to be at home in particular will benefit greatly. Although LETS has opened many amazing new doors and avenues, there can also be a few problems which LETS organisers are trying to overcome. Taxation is one of them. How do people declare something like this to the Australian Tax Office? The Australian Taxation Office has been asked this very question by Maxine Brown, a journalist with the Sunday Times in Perth. A spokesperson for the Australian Taxation Office in Perth, Mr Peter Kidbey, said that he was satisfied that the Government would not lose any revenue from LETS. He is quoted as having said:</PARA>
<PARA> The scheme is assessable given the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing illegal about it. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kidbey said that under the Act non-cash business benefits must be converted to a declarable dollars and cents profit. It remains to be seen just how well that will go. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia the scheme got going in the small southern Queensland town of Maleny. In the early 1980s a woman by the name of Jill Jordan was involved in the formation of the Maple Street Cooperative in Maleny and the Maleny District Community Credit Union flowed on from there. Jill Jordan believes in community development, regional autonomy, and personal empowerment; and local control of resources depends to a large extent on economic empowerment. The credit union was a logical and large step in this direction, yet it was still influenced to a large extent by forces outside the control of the local people. It is the old story: those who have get more, while those who have not pay interest to those who have for such basics as land, housing, food and transportation. </PARA>
<PARA> The next step was clearly a local economy independent of the fortunes of international currency that is often based on plundering and polluting the planet. Enter Permaculture founder Bill Mollison who met the LETS founder, Canadian Michael Linton, when they were both attending a Bio-Regional conference in the United States. He passed on information about the LET system in Canada to Jill Jordan who with the help of friends got LETS going at Maleny in Queensland. An association was formed there from a meeting of about 80 people and trading began. Although a little tentative at first, Maleny LETS had 100 members after three months and 160 members at the end of the first year. Maleny called its local currency bunyas after the nuts so beloved by local Aborigines and in the first year over 22,000 bunya units were traded. </PARA>
<PARA> Other LETS systems were springing up. In Rockhampton LETS members traded in loaves and fishes. In Taree the currency was called figs. Jill Jordan says that she is forever hearing of other groups in formation. She said, `We do not know how many LETS groups there are in Australia. They do not have to ask anyone's permission to start. They just call a public meeting and begin'. In Bellingen in New South Wales the LETS system started with over 100 members and the group is growing steadily. Every month members list all of their requirements and offers and the resultant computer printout is a wonderful catalogue of local resources. As the system grows the printed noticeboard will become the most effective advertising and information service in the area and, at a small charge in LETS dollars, easily the cheapest. </PARA>
<PARA> The LETS team initially worked long voluntary hours to establish the Bellingen system. But it is getting to the point where LETS administration will now be paid in the local currency. It has an office which it opens only a few hours a week for new memberships. Business is conducted directly between members by telephone and transactions are either mailed to the LETS office or details are left on the office telephone-answering machine. However, there is a small service charge for transactions because Telecom Australia, of course, needs to be paid in real Australian dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> The LETS system highlights the need to become more self-sufficient regionally and not so dependent on uncontrollable outside market forces. The system best suits small communities and works well with between 50 and 200 members. It is effective in country towns, suburban neighbourhoods and blocks of units-wherever people have shared interests. Artists and craftspeople are usually the first to suffer when real currency is in short supply. Ms Jill Jordan says, `If you are going hungry, you are not going to buy a painting'. Under LETS cottage industries flourish and it is not just the very wealthy who have the opportunity to own works of art. Participants in LET systems feel more generous making acknowledgments. There is scope to do quality work and ethical projects are not necessarily overlooked. The LET system frees up the way in which we think about money. As LETS currency has no value, there are no security problems with it. As it does not collect interest there is no sense in hoarding it. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, these are the advantages of the LETS system: it is a fantastic way to build up a personal support network which meets an individual's personal needs; it permits people who have ideas for starting up their own small businesses to try them out without risking Australian dollars; it allows age pensioners to continue to contribute their skills to the local community and to get recognition for their contribution without its affecting their pension; it is good for recompensing volunteers of community organisations who give selflessly of their time and effort; and, finally, LETS allows people to improve the quality of their lives and to enhance feelings of self-esteem and self-worth by gaining recognition for skills from the local community. It is certainly very good for building that sense of community spirit. I think that is something we need to encourage in this world where our young people in particular feel a great deal of alienation. In future when we cannot expect a return to full employment the LETS system will be increasingly valuable as people find new ways of ordering their lives creatively. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition deplores the assassination of Lebanese President Rene Muawad in Beirut last night. Like President-elect Beshir Gemayel some years ago, Rene Muawad was murdered by a car bomb in an explosion which also took the lives of 16 others in his party. We are appalled that a man of vision such as Rene Muawad, a courageous man who knew he was gambling with his life when he took office but was convinced that he had to in order that he might help to bring peace to his country, should be so tragically cut down. Rene Muawad was only 17 days into implementing a peace plan of which his election was part. His killing is testimony to the searing hatred that has torn Lebanon apart and kept it apart for 15 years since fighting broke out in Beirut in April 1975.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The city of Beirut has, since the war of liberation announced by Christian General Michel Aoun in March this year to expel Syrian troops, been under heavy and continuous shelling as General Aoun's and Syrian forces battle for control of the capital. The suffering has known no religious boundaries as both Christian and Moslem civilians, ordinary families, have been caught up in the civil war. The imperative in Lebanon was to stop the killing, to reconcile seemingly irreconcilable demands and interests. Hopefully the time bought by a period of peace could be used to establish trust that was not in evidence and is certainly not in evidence after the events of last night. </PARA>
<PARA> We want to use this occasion to recognise the efforts of the Arab League to bring peace to Lebanon, starting with the Arab summit in Morocco which in May this year formed a committee comprising members from Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Morocco and charged them with finding a way to resolve the crisis in Lebanon. Despite heavy odds, the Arab League was successful in arranging a cease-fire which came into effect on 23 September, ending six months of the most intensive battles in 14 years of continuous fighting. We in the Opposition were heartened by that. We were further heartened when on 30 September Moslem and Christian members of the Lebanese Parliament met in Saudi Arabia to discuss the Arab League's peace plan, a document for political reforms which we noted were supported by Syria. </PARA>
<PARA> We will never know the contribution that Rene Muawad could have made. We were certainly encouraged by his determination and optimism. In his first address to the Parliament on 5 November on the occasion of his swearing in, he described himself thus:</PARA>
<PARA>I am one of you and you know me as a man of reconciliation dedicated to the concept of unity, a man who has gambled his life in return for the reconciliation of all the Lebanese irrespective of their persuasion. </PARA>
<PARA>Pointing out that after 15 years of killing and destruction Lebanon was badly in need of a breathing space, he pledged:</PARA>
<PARA>We shall work towards forming a government of national reconciliation, to include all Lebanon's factions, which will reunite what has been disjointed. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I shall never rest . . . until the new republic is fully established . . . I shall never rest until we rebuild whatever has been destroyed, relocate the displaced and return those who left the country under the pressure of want and in pursuit of bread overseas, and lack of security. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, you, as one who I know has taken a particular interest in Lebanon, will realise how tragic it is that a man with such conviction and understanding of the problems of his country and of moderate views needed to be cut down in this awful way. He shall never have a chance to fulfil the pledge he made on taking office. However, we hope that his vision for peace has not died with him. We hope that a new leader will soon be elected to pursue these sensible and practical points contained in the Arab League's peace plan. </PARA>
<PARA> We use this occasion to remind ourselves of the principal provisions of that plan because we hope its ultimate implementation will be his legacy. Those provisions include that executive power be transferred from the President to a Cabinet with equal numbers of Moslem and Christian Ministers; Parliament to have an equal number of Moslems and Christians instead of a Christian majority; Syrian troops who were in control of two-thirds of the country to pull back to eastern Lebanon within two years; the presidency to be reserved for a Maronite Christian; the Prime Minister's post to be reserved for a Sunni Moslem; the Speaker's post to be reserved for a Shiite Moslem; and lesser posts no longer to be allocated on religious lines. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has long supported and I reaffirm our support for the path of negotiation and compromise as the only way to bring peace to Lebanon. We hope that the various parties in the Lebanese conflict will remember and respect President Muawad's desire for peace and national reconciliation. Above all, we hope that there will be no reprisal leading to renewal of the violence that has plagued Lebanon for so many years. I reiterate what I said in speaking to the motion of which I gave notice this morning, which I trust will be passed by the Senate tomorrow: it is the wish of the Opposition, and I hope this Parliament, to see commonsense prevail in Lebanon. I hope that efforts to find a durable peace in Lebanon will continue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to clarify a point that has been raised publicly by the Australian Democrats senator from Western Australia, Senator Jenkins. In a publication called Business World that is circulated in Western Australia she has claimed that `on this occasion the Democrats were joined by the coalition Opposition, which meant the changes had been temporarily stalled'. In the article she was actually referring to our initiatives-not those of the Democrats-to have stalled or reversed the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal (PBRT) decision to cut pharmacy income by 23 per cent. That was an initiative of ours. The National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits Revocation and Tribunal Membership) Amendment Bill, a private member's Bill of my colleague Senator Puplick, who is in the chamber at the moment, moved to disallow the PBRT decision. It was also our decision to move amendments to the National Health Amendment Bill, yet Senator Jenkins has gone public and used Business World for party political purposes to say that the Democrats had initiated this.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Opposition has quite clearly and unequivocally resisted the change in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal's decision, the deduction in margins that the pharmacists have incurred, and all the other decisions that have impinged upon the pharmacists' contribution to the community provision of health services throughout Australia. Yet here Senator Jenkins and her Party are masquerading as the people who initiated the measures to revoke the decisions of the PBRT.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Business World is quite a well renowned publication in Western Australia and is circulated very widely among the business community, where it has a very wide readership. I would not raise this issue on the adjournment tonight if I did not think it was important enough, because of the circulation that the publication has, to say that Senator Jenkins has simply misrepresented the actual fact that in this chamber the Democrats followed in the coalition's wake and were the ones that were forced to support our initiatives-and Senator Puplick's initiatives in particular. Senator Puplick put very clearly and succinctly to this chamber and to the public of Australia the case for why we should maintain pharmacy as it is and not see 37 per cent of Australian pharmacies going to the wall because of the decisions that have been made, as has been cited in the information that is supplied from the office of the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) and as has been supported by information from a statistician from the Australian Labor Party that was presented to its back bench Caucus committee on health but nonetheless was rejected as not being factual.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have stood in a position that has been absolutely non-negotiable-we will not see those pharmacies go out of business but will maintain pharmacy throughout Australia, maintain a fair remuneration system to pharmacies and maintain a fair margin to pharmacies. In other words, they can stay in business. The sad reality of what has been happening is that pharmacies-or any business for that matter-cannot stay in business without adequate margins. It is a great pity that Senator Jenkins seeks to make political mileage when the Democrats have not sought to take the initiatives taken by us in the Opposition and when she completely misrepresents the Hansard record of this place. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, it substantiates the fact that the Democrats do now know what they stand for; they purely and simply say that they will stand for anything that suits the purpose of the day, because they will never be in government, so they will never have to deliver any of their promises. We hear Senator Haines say that they stand for this and this and this in regard to taxation, immigration-or pharmacy, for that matter. They can stand for anything. The Australian public slowly but surely is starting to realise the fact that they can stand for anything because they will never be in government and be forced to deliver their promises in a way in which both the Opposition and the Australian Labor Party will have to do. Therefore, as I say, we have the situation where they promise everything and deliver nothing. Added to that, a staff member cum spouse publicity officer for the Australian Democrats does not even have a clue where Canberra is or where Western Australia is because suddenly Canberra has been moved to Western Australia-which we would not mind but Canberra, or Western Australia, might be a bit disturbed. </PARA>

<PARA>Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority (TCFDA)</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Total NIES grants by the TCFDA since its establishment in May 1988 were $1.045m in 1987-88, $1.883m in 1988-89 and $1.835m in 1989-90.</PARA>

<PARA>National Industry Extension Service-(NIES)</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Total grants by NIES to agencies in each year since its establishment were $6.63m in 1986-87, $4.268m in 1987-88 and $4.648m in 1988-89.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The grants provided by NIES to individual agencies are shown in Attachment 2. They were approved in the context of the Budget Appropriations except for the $350 000 payment to Standards Australia in 1988-89 which was approved on 16 June 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1986-87, its first year, NIES continued earlier arrangements that provided grants to agencies delivering a range of specialised services aimed at facilitating the accelerated adoption and diffusion of appropriate technology at the company level and, correspondingly, at fostering attitudes in management which were receptive to change. The services were in areas such as design, productivity improvement training, quality assurance, standardizations and technology transfer.</PARA>
<PARA> Financial support provided through the Department supplemented industry contributions to the agencies.</PARA>
<PARA> Grant arrangements other than those for the National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) and Standards Australia (SA) have been terminated. Payments to NATA and SA are now generally made in the context of Memorandums of Understanding with those organisations to assist them in fulfilling national interest activities and in meeting other provisions agreed with the Commonwealth. Any payments to the other agencies are now in exchange for specific services of a national interest nature, in the same way as other organisations can be contracted to perform specific services.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) A review by the Department of Administrative Services into the Potential for Using Recycled Paper and Paper Products has been completed. I released the Summary and Recommendations of the Review on 2 November. The Review was overseen by the Steering Committee consisting of a Deputy Secretary from my Department and senior officers from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. Conclusions have been reached about the use of 100 per cent recycled paper and other recycled paper products containing a mixture of recycled fibre and new fibre.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Members of Parliament who approached my Department about recycled paper were informed that provision of such paper to electorate offices would depend upon the outcome of the Recycled Paper Review.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Letterhead stationery is provided to Members of Parliament by the Parliamentary Departments. I am writing to the Presiding Officers seeking their support in making letterhead stationery available on recycled paper. Other stationery requirements such as scribble pads, plain paper and notebooks are supplied by the Department of Administrative Services. Prior to completion of the Recycled Paper Review, plain recycled paper had been provided to electorate offices in some States. Steps are being taken to acquire stocks in all States which can be drawn on when needed.</PARA>
