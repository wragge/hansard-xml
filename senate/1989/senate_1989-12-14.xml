<TITLE>The Last Temptation of Christ</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and Senators in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. That the film ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' portrays Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ in a blasphemous and offensive way and is calculated to outrage the feelings of Christians.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. That the decision of the Film Censorship Board to allow the importation of the film and to classify the Film with an ``R'' classification, rather than banning it, shows that the Film Censorship Board has failed in its statutory duty.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. That in failing to exercise his powers and ban the Film the Attorney General has, as with his failure to ban the Film Hail Mary in 1986, failed in his duty to the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will express its lack of confidence in the Attorney-General and the Film Censorship Board and pass laws which will ensure that no more blasphemous or offensive films will be permitted to be imported and/or screened in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, that:</PARA>
<PARA> At present all Australians, including those who conscientiously object to war and the preparation of war, are required by law for a portion of their income tax to be spent on military use.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray;</PARA>
<PARA> That you support the Peace Tax Trust Fund Bill 1989 which has been presented by Western Australian Independent Senator, Jo Vallentine.

<PARA> That we the undersigned strongly object to the Legislation which is being recommended by Professor Duncan Chappel, Department of Criminology, that parental rights to discipline our children by spanking (if necessary), being taken from us.</PARA>
<PARA> If we are not allowed to discipline our children at home, in love and according to God's Word we fear that we will have a nation of completely rebellious children on our hands. God's Word says, ``Spare the rod and spoil the child'' and also that ``Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of correction will drive it far from him''. We would therefore appreciate your consideration of our rights as parents to correctly and lovingly discipline our own children, and feel that if this right is taken from us we would lose the respect of our children.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws attention to the Senate of their concern regarding proposed changes to the laws governing credit reporting as suggested in the Bill ``The Privacy Amendment Bill 1989''.</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed reforms will:</PARA>
<PARA> Restrict the legitimate use of credit checking by businesses who sell/supply goods and/or services to their customers on credit terms.</PARA>
<PARA> The proposals/reforms will prevent businesses from determining the solvency of their customers and will increase the financial risk of credit providers, leading to an increase in company liquidations and individual bankruptcies.</PARA>
<PARA> Additional costs to business from bad debts due to the lack of adequate credit checking information will result in increased prices/charges and will result in credit providers refusing credit facilities.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that the Senate will call on the Government to refer these proposals restricting credit checking to a Senate Standing Committee for further consideration before proceeding with the matter.</PARA>

<PARA> The Government's attack upon the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has cast grave doubts over the future viability of our community pharmacies and their ability to provide much-needed service to the community, including particularly those in rural areas;</PARA>

<PARA> The Education Unit fulfilled an important role in increasing the knowledge, appreciation and enjoyment of Australia's plant heritage of visitors to the National Botanical Gardens, including many school children.</PARA>

<TITLE>Australian Maritime Safety Authority Headquarters</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia being employees of the Department of Transport and Communications showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's decision to base the, to be formed, Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) in the city of Newcastle is strongly opposed by employees of the Department.</PARA>
<PARA> The move to Newcastle is not based on any sound operational reason. It has been found that the reason for moving personnel from Melbourne, a maritime port, to Canberra in 1982 to be successful. Therefore there is no justification for a further move back to a Maritime port. Indeed the now Maritime Operations Division including the Sea Safety Centre, marine pollution, survey and marine navigation aid functions were moved to Canberra to be close to the Minister's office and those intra-departmental agencies with which they currently liaise. The operations of ships, including certification, is already handled by regional offices and not by Canberra personnel.</PARA>
<PARA> Intra-Departmental submissions recommended that the cheapest and most efficient option for basing the AMSA headquarters would be in Canberra. The move to Newcastle, estimated by the Government to be in the order of $5,000,000, but which is probably closer to $12,000,000, is to be funded from the present portfolio, resulting in a degradation in other projects such as roads, navigation aids and maritime safety.</PARA>
<PARA> Two hundred and five (205) personnel and their families will suffer an unwelcome upheaval. Spouse or partners career and employment will suffer; there will be a detrimental affect on children's education due to the differing standards of education in New South Wales as compared with the Australian Capital Territory; and the personal suffering, trauma and financial burden of moving from home, friends and environment will have a lasting effect on personnel and their families. Previous compulsory transfer has indicated that the government is not interested in redeploying personnel who, for personal or medical reasons, are unable to relocate.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's decision to move to Newcastle is an attempt at political point scoring to shore up the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping's electorate which is suffering from Newcastle's failed frigate building bid.</PARA>
<PARA> We submit that the headquarters of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority should remain in canberra.</PARA>

<PARA> The documents read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>MIGRATION REGULATIONS (AMENDMENT) STATUTORY RULES 1989 No. 267</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's concerns with this instrument related to a discretion given to the Minister to exempt a class of persons determined by the Minister from the payment of a fee for a temporary entry visa. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee always prefers that provisions for exemption from fees should be as objective and as precise as possible. In this case there were some categories where these criteria were met. The spouse or child of an applicant, for example, is exempt. The concerns of the Committee, however, related to this entirely open-ended power which has no criteria, either objective or subjective, to guide the Minister. In this case the power relates to a ``class'' of persons and is thus a classic legislative function, as it provides a mandatory rule for a group. The power is such that the Minister could in effect amend the Regulations themselves. In cases where an instrument of delegated legislation provides for determinations which are legislative in effect, the Committee believes that tabling and disallowance requirements are appropriate. If the power had been to exempt individuals from payment of the fee then the Committee would have been equally concerned. In such cases, however, the remedy should be review by the AAT of the merits of an adverse decision. </PARA>
<PARA> In this case the Minister advised that the defective provision was being repealed and replaced on 19 December 1989. These new provisions will include definitive lists of classes for the payment of visa fees and for exemptions, with no discretion to exempt. If this was not the case the Minister indicated that the Regulations would be amended to provide that the determinations are subject to tabling and disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee thanks the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator the Honourable Robert Ray, for his co-operation. </PARA>

<PARA>CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the Migration Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1989 No 267, considered by the Committee at its Meeting of 2 November 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted that new r.29BF(3) exempts refugees, applicants under a special humanitarian program, or the spouse or child of an applicant, from payment of the application fee for a temporary entry visa. The Committee raises no concerns relating to these objective categories. </PARA>
<PARA> Under new r.29BF(3) (d), however, the Minister may by determination in writing exempt a class of persons from payment of the fee. This power is open-ended, and is not limited in its exercise by any criteria, objective or otherwise. The power is in respect only of a ``Class'' and may therefore be categorised as essentially legislative in character, making as it does a rule for a common group of persons. The Committee believes that determinations of this type should be subject to tabling and disallowance in Parliament. The power given to the Minister under r.29BF(3) (d) is a power to alter the operation of the Regulations themselves. The Committee carefully examines any power to exempt a person or a class of persons from payment of a charge or fee. In cases where the power relates to exempting individuals then a right of review of the merits of any decision to refuse exemption will often be appropriate. In cases like the present, where the power is so sweeping that it may be used to nullify virtually the entire operation of the Regulations, tabling and disallowance is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee would also appreciate your advice whether it is possible for the Minister's power under r.29BF(3) (d) to be delegated. The Committee believes that arguments in favour of tabling and disallowance are much stronger in cases where the power may be delegated to a person whose actions are not personally answerable to the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Senator Collins</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter of 22 November 1989 in which you express your Committee's concern at the open-ended nature of the power in Regulation 29bf of the Migration Regulations which enables me to exempt a class of persons from payment of the temporary entry visa fee by determination in writing. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no objection to your Committee's suggestion that determinations of this type should be subject to tabling and disallowance in Parliament. The regulation could be amended to specify that determinations are subject to tabling and disallowance. If Regulation 29bf were not to be repealed and replaced on 19 December 1989 with other regulations that do not contain this defect, then I would make the regulation subject to the tabling and disallowance requirement you suggest. </PARA>
<PARA> You also sought my advice as to whether it is possible for the power in question to be delegated. The short answer is that the power has not been delegated and will not be delegated before its repeal. The regulations to commence on 19 December 1989 will provide a complete list of classes for payment of visa fees and exemptions. There will be no ministerial power to exempt classes of persons from payment of the fee. </PARA>
<PARA> Yours sincerely</PARA>

<PARA>QUARANTINE (ANIMALS) REGULATIONS (AMENDMENT) STATUTORY RULES 1989 No. 272</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's concerns related to the removal of apparently mandatory forms from the Regulations where they are, of course, subject to the scrutiny of Parliament and to the possible sanction of disallowance. This instrument provides that the forms not only will no longer be subject to the supervision or even the knowledge of Parliament, but that they will merely be required to satisfy the Director of Quarantine, a public official. The forms will not even be required to be placed before the Minister, who is subject to personal questioning in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The explanatory Statement gave no explanation for removing the forms from Parliamentary Scrutiny, apart from stating that the changes were desirable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee examines closely any legislative instrument which may dilute the existing powers of Parliament. All delegated legislation exists only because of the express authorisation of an Act of Parliament and the Committee is vigilant in safeguarding the rights of Parliament to control this legislation in appropriate ways. </PARA>
<PARA> In this case the Minister explained that amendment of the forms by an administrative rather than legislative action was more expedient and less costly. The Committee does not regard such advice as conclusive in itself, as its principles safeguarding personal liberties and parliamentary proprieties take precedence over such considerations in the absence of other compelling reasons. It will, however, be taken into account by the Committee in its deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister also advised that the type of information required by the forms was set out in the parent Quarantine Act 1908 and in the principal Regulations. Again this was not conclusive by itself but was considered by the Committee. The Committee examined the subject matter covered by the forms and considered that no outstanding issue of personal rights was involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Minister assured the Committee that the changes would assist the public and improve the services offered. Taking all the above matters into account the Committee decided to accept the Minister's explanations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee thanks the Minister for Resources, Senator the Honourable Peter Cook, for his co-operation. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the Quarantine (Animals) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1989 No. 272, considered by the Committee at its Meeting of 2 November 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the correction of a small drafting error, the Committee noted that the sole purpose of the Regulations is to remove quarantine forms from the Regulations and thus from the control, or even knowledge, of Parliament. Furthermore, the new Forms will not even be approved by the Minister but only by the Director, a public official. Thus not only is Parliament deprived of its former opportunity to scrutinise these instruments, the use of which appears to be mandatory, but the Minister, who is subject to personal scrutiny in the Parliament, need not even be informed of changes made. </PARA>
<PARA> The Explanatory Statement advised that ``There is now a need to update the forms to bring them into line with current forms design. To effect this and to facilitate any future changes which may become necessary, amendment . . . is desirable to enable a form to be revised without amendment of the Regulations''. There appears to be no other explanation provided for this important change. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee would appreciate your full advice as to why the forms cannot be updated by amendment of the Regulations and why it is desirable to enable a form to be revised without amendment to the Regulations. In particular, the Committee would be grateful if you could relate the question of desirability to the exclusion of Parliament from supervision of mandatory legislative instruments in favour not even of the Minister, who is answerable to personal examination of his or her actions in the Parliament itself, but to a public official. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Senator Collins</PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for your letter dated 22 November 1989 on behalf of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, concerning Quarantine (Animals) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1989 No. 272, which was considered by the Committee on 2 November 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee sought advice as to why quarantine forms cannot be updated by amendment of the Regulations and why it is desirable to enable a form to be revised without amendment to the Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no reason why forms cannot be updated by amendment of the Regulations. However, it is considered more expedient and less costly if forms may be updated without the need to amend the Regulations. The essential information to be provided by the public on these forms is and will continue to be, stipulated in the Quarantine Act 1908 or subordinate legislation and will only vary format in the way information is requested. For example, in respect of Form A, Regulation 7 provides and will continue to provide that-</PARA>
<PARA>`` . . . The Master of any vessel on which is any animal intended to be imported from any country (except New Zealand) from which animals of the particular kind are permitted to be imported shall, immediately on arrival at the port where that animal is to be landed, deliver to the Chief Quarantine Officer a notice and declaration in accordance . . .''. </PARA>
<PARA>It is expedient and good administrative practice that the actual format be subject to change in accordance with administrative procedure, at any time and for inclusion of data which will facilitate administration of the legislation, assist the public and improve the services offered. </PARA>
<PARA> Having considered the proposal and my subsequent approval on 13 September 1989 to delete reference to prescribed forms A, B, C, D and E from the Quarantine (Animals) Regulations, I am satisfied that the reasons as submitted to me, justify the changes. </PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for the opportunity to clarify the matter for the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA>INTERPRETATION ORDINANCE 1989</PARA>
<PARA>TERRITORY OF ASHMORE AND CARTIER ISLANDS ORDINANCE NO. 3 OF 1989</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's concerns related to the legislative policy which led to the form in which this Ordinance was made. The Committee is not, of course, concerned with the policy merits of delegated legislation which it scrutinises. This is one of the reasons for the effective operation of the Committee over 57 years, during which time the Senate has never failed to support one of its recommendations. Mere assertion of policy considerations, however, will not be sufficient to explain to the Committee an apparent breach of its principles. In such cases the Committee believes that the protection of individual rights and parliamentary proprieties takes precedence. </PARA>
<PARA> Assertions of policy may be one factor which the Committee takes into account and which will be given some weight if accompanied by other advice. In a recent case one Minister explained that a particular provision was prompted by high government policy. The Committee replied that this was not sufficient explanation by itself. The Committee will, however, give more weight to policy determined by say, Cabinet, than by a public official. This is because the originators of such policy are subject to personal scrutiny in the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> In this general context, the Committee raises concerns where legislative policy may impinge on its principles. In the present case the Committee's express concerns related to the legislative policy which resulted in this Ordinance being drafted by reference to provisions of other statutes which are cited by reference to numbers only, with no indication of content. The result is that at least six separate Acts, as amended up to the present date, from three separate jurisdictions external to the Territory, must be consulted to ascertain the state of the law. Some of the provisions of these statutes, cited only by number, are themselves amended by the Ordinance in a somewhat cryptic fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister replied with advice on the policy of the parent Act and the particular considerations which led in this case not to a discrete instrument, but to an ordinance based upon incorporation by reference. The Minister also pointed out the lack of resources to make a self-standing Ordinance expressly for the Territory, which has no permanent inhabitants. An explanation was furnished to the Committee with respect to incorporation from each relevant jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee thanks the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator the Hon. Graham Richardson, for his co-operation. </PARA>

<PARA> The Committee was confused by several definitions in s. 4 (2) ``Interpretation''. In a law of the Territory, unless the contrary intention appears, ``Consolidated Fund'' is defined as meaning the ``Consolidated Revenue Fund'', while the ``Consolidated Revenue Fund'' is defined as the ``Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Commonwealth''. ``Northern Territory Government Account'' means the ``Consolidated Revenue Fund'', which of course is defined as the ``Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Commonwealth''. Thus, unless the contrary intention appears, all four funds or accounts appear to be the same. The Committee seeks your assurance that the operation of the Ordinance will not result in confusion due to this inter-relationship of definitions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also has a broader concern with the legislative policy behind the making of the Ordinance. It appears to be difficult for anyone to ascertain the actual state of the law. The Ordinance incorporates provisions of the Ashmore and Cartier Islands Acceptance Act 1933, the A.C.T. Interpretation Act 1967, the A.C.T. Evidence (Laws and Instruments) Act 1989, the A.C.T. Subordinate Laws Act 1989, the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914, the Commonwealth Acts Interpretation Act 1901 and the Northern Territory Interpretation Act. The Ordinance also refers to other statutes. The incorporated provisions also include any amendments to those Acts which may be made in the future. The above references are in addition to applied Northern Territory law in force in the Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the incorporated provisions are extremely complex. Sections 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d, 4e, 4f, 4g, 4h, 4j, 4k, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19a, 20b, 21, 21b, and 21c of the Crimes Act 1914, for example, apply generally to laws of the Territory, apart from an applied Northern Territory Law, subject to changed references, the omission of a provision of subsection 4d (2) and the omission of a reference to words (second occurring) in s. 17 (1). There is no indication in the instrument of the content of any of these provisions, although the Explanatory Statement is of some assistance. The incorporation provisions in respect of the other Acts similarly merely refer to the numbers of individual sections. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, from the provisions of s. 13 of the Ordinance, it appears as if issues of the South Australian Government Gazette published before 1 January 1911 are relevant for the purposes of the Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is concerned at what considerations of legislative policy influenced the form of this Ordinance. The Committee appreciates that there may be special considerations relating to the Territory, which it understands has no permanent inhabitants. Nevertheless, the Committee believes that laws made by the executive through the authority of an Act of Parliament should be expressed as clearly as possible. This requirement is not met where an Ordinance incorporates some provisions, only by reference to section numbers, of at least six separate statutes from three different jurisdictions to apply to a fourth jurisdiction. The Committee asks whether it would not have been more appropriate to make a discrete Interpretation Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> Your advice would be appreciated. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Senator Collins</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter dated 22 November 1989 to Mr Holding outlining the concerns of the Committee in relation to the Interpretation Ordinance 1989 of the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands (ACI). </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make the following general remarks before addressing the specific points in your letter. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy of the Ashmore and Cartier Islands Acceptance Act 1933 is to apply Northern Territory law as far as possible to ACI. It is therefore appropriate to use the Interpretation Act of the Northern Territory to aid the interpretation of applied Northern Territory provisions. However, there are also specific laws that have been made for ACI (and may be made in future). To aid the interpretation of these laws, certain provisions of the interpretation legislation of the ACT have been incorporated in reference, because there were either no equivalent Northern Territory provisions, or the Northern Territory provisions were inappropriate. Examples of the application of the ACT interpretation legislation are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Sections 29a and 29b of the Interpretation Act 1967 of the ACT concern delegation powers. The Interpretation Act of the Northern Territory contains no similar provision. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Section 8b of the Interpretation Act 1967 of the ACT provides for the commencement of amending paragraphs or items in a Schedule to an Act amending another Act. The Interpretation Act of the Northern Territory does not contain separate commencement provisions for self-contained parts of an Act. </PARA>
<PARA> ACI requires a complete and technically accurate interpretation law covering both the Northern Territory-derived and non-Northern Territory-derived components of its legal regime. However, resources to produce such a law in a self-standing, territory-specific form, and in a reasonable time, for islands without permanent inhabitants, are not available. In my view, it is better to have the laws of other populated jurisdictions incorporated by reference from time to time, rather than to re-make virtually identical provisions in a detailed ACI Interpretation Ordinance that would require updating each time the model on which it is based is updated. </PARA>
<PARA> This has resulted in a complex Interpretation Ordinance for ACI. However, a judgment has been made, which I support, that it is better to have a complex up to date law (which seldom needs to be referred to) than an easy to read but lengthy law that may quickly become out of date. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now address the specific points raised in your letter. </PARA>
<PARA>Definition of Consolidated Revenue Fund</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the Committee's concerns regarding the definitions of ``Consolidated Fund''. ``Consolidated Revenue Fund'' and ``Northern Territory Government Account'', I would point out that as the definitions appear in the legislation of the Northern Territory and the ACT as applied to the Islands it was necessary to define each one separately. Although perhaps appearing confusing, the three in fact make clear that each term constitutes the one fund (ie the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Commonwealth). </PARA>
<PARA>Ashmore and Cartier Islands Acceptance Act 1933</PARA>
<PARA> Provisions from the head Act were ``adopted'' by the Ashmore and Cartier Islands Interpretation Ordinance to ensure that your Committee and the Commonwealth Parliament have full opportunity to review all subordinate legislation made specifically for ACI. </PARA>
<PARA>ACT Laws</PARA>
<PARA> The reason for the use of the ACT Interpretation Act 1967 is set out above. It is necessary to refer to three ACT laws because on the eve of ACT Self-Government, the ACT interpretation legislation was restructured and the ACI Ordinance, as a result, reflected the (perhaps more complicated) new ACT structure. </PARA>
<PARA>Crimes Act 1914 and Acts Interpretation Act 1901</PARA>
<PARA> Certain provisions of the Crimes Act were incorporated as ACI is a non self-governing Commonwealth territory and the sensitive area of criminal law should reflect current Commonwealth criminal law policy. For similar reasons, some provisions of the Northern Territory Criminal Code were excluded from applying in ACI by the Criminal Code Ordinance 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Sections 15aa and 15ab of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 apply to laws made specifically for ACI to ensure that in interpreting those laws, regard is had to the purpose of the laws and, if necessary, to certain extrinsic material. </PARA>
<PARA>Interpretation Act of the Northern Territory</PARA>
<PARA> As explained above, Northern Territory law is the fundamental source of ACI law and therefore it is appropriate to use Northern Territory legislation to aid in its interpretation. The process of incorporation by reference is complex, but as explained above is, in my view, the only way of ensuring both a system of law consistent with Commonwealth standards and a body of law that remains up to date in the absence of substantial resources to maintain a Territory-specific Ordinance. This is also reflected in the use of reference to section numbers rather than the re-making of each provision. </PARA>
<PARA>South Australian Government Gazette</PARA>
<PARA> Some South Australian pre-1911 law is still in force in ACI because it is in force in the Northern Territory. Therefore, for evidentiary purposes, it may be necessary at some future time to produce evidence, for example, of the gazettal of legislation made under such law. For this reason the Interpretation Ordinance for ACI contains a section providing for the proof in evidence of a South Australian Government Gazette. </PARA>
<PARA> I trust that this letter has addressed satisfactorily the concerns that the Committee has raised</PARA>
<PARA> Yours sincerely</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I table the explanatory memorandum and move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to introduce into the review process the power of the Minister to substitute a favourable decision after the first tier of review. These amendments augment section 64u in the Migration Legislation Amendment Act 1989-the Act. That provision allows the Minister to set aside a decision of the Immigration Review Tribunal and substitute a decision more favourable to the applicant if the Minister thinks it is in the public interest to do so. The Minister's power to substitute a more favourable decision can only occur if the Minister thinks it is in the public interest to do so. The term `public interest' is not limited solely to public issues. Consideration of the public interest could involve consideration of the circumstances of the particular case having regard to unusual, unforeseen or other features that are deserving of a more favourable response against the background of Australia being a compassionate and humane society. </PARA>
<PARA> Concern has been expressed at the time it will take for a case to proceed through each tier of review before the Minister can use the power contained in section 64u. The parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations raised this point specifically. These amendments will meet those concerns and enable such cases to be decided by the Minister at an earlier stage of the process. The exercise of the power will be subject to an obligation to report to Parliament twice each year within 15 sitting days of 1 January and 1 July. Where the Minister has exercised the power under the proposed provision, no review by the Immigration Review Tribunal will be available. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will keep under review those cases where the Minister's decision is more favourable than the first tier review decision, but not the most favourable, with a view to determining whether review by the Immigration Review Tribunal should be available in some circumstances. To remove confusion as to the operation of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 in relation to the Minister's powers after each tier of review, provisions have been inserted which provide that there is no duty on the Minister to exercise the power in individual cases. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that the Minister's powers cannot be exercised to grant an entry permit where the grant of a visa under S11D or the temporary entry permit under S11P is conditional upon the holder not being granted an entry permit while he or she remains in Australia. I am introducing these amendments as another Bill rather than as an amendment to the current Migration Legislation Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill for the reason that that Bill is already in the Senate and, if amended, would have to be returned to the House of Representatives for reconsideration. As the House will not sit until after 19 December and as the Migration Legislation Amendment Act commences on that date, this would be inappropriate. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill comes to the Senate at a time when the relevance of the trade union movement is being questioned by the Australian public. With a growing number of people choosing not to join trade unions and the courts being increasingly inclined to uphold appeals brought before them concerning the right to strike it is obvious that the time has come for the Parliament to confront this issue. </PARA>
<PARA>A Bill similar to the one that is before the Senate today was introduced by the Thatcher administration in 1985. I must stress to the Parliament that this is not a Bill that has been conceived in a political void but is responding to the growing unease and confusion that is being felt within the Australian community following the recent common law decisions on the right to strike. This Bill will provide the legislators with the opportunity to affirm their support for the right of every Australian to be able to withdraw their labour and by such affirmation bring Australia into line with other post-industrialised societies. </PARA>
<PARA>This legislation will move Australian industrial relations from a dependence on immunity in law to providing Australian workers, in 1990, with a positive statement on their right to strike. This legislation will allow Australia to develop an industrial relations system which is based on negotiation and consensus. </PARA>
<PARA>It is through this legislation that the Australian Democrats intend to confirm their support for the vital role that freedom of expression must continue to play in any future industrial relations system in Australia. Consequently, we ask the ALP and the coalition to clarify their position on the right to strike before the next Federal election. If they fail to do so then their industrial relations policies will continue to lack the broad social acceptance that is needed in today's industrial relations climate. </PARA>
<PARA>The possible legal implications of the recent decisions on the Mudginberry, Dollar Sweets and the airline pilots disputes means that the issue of the right to strike must be resolved by Australia's industrial, legal and political leaders otherwise it shall become accepted, through precedent, that if one or more people go on strike then they can be sued, under common law, for breach of contract. The Australian Democrats believe that as long as the industrial action taken by the individual or association is not designed to cause physical harm or property damage and is sanctioned by the Industrial Relations Commission then it is within the rights of the workers to withdraw their labour. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats believe that the right to strike is a device which must be used in only the most extreme circumstances and we have consistently criticised both major parties for their adversarial approach to industrial relations. Since 1981 the Australian Democrats have pursued a far sighted industrial relations policy which is designed to provide for greater employee participation in the work place, greater negotiation between employers and employees and a reduction in the level of industrial conflict. This Bill is an affirmation of this position and we wait to see if the ALP and the Coalition will continue to duck this issue in the lead up to the next election. </PARA>
<PARA>Just as the use of the right to strike should be seen as a last resort so access to tort action should be limited to those disputes that are not ratified by the Industrial Relations Commission or are designed to cause physical harm or result in property damage. This Bill is aimed at reducing the number of industrial disputes in Australia thus providing Australian industry with the opportunity to compete more effectively internationally as well as ensuring that Australian workers have the opportunity to seek out greater job satisfaction and financial reward. As has been shown by the recent airline pilots dispute the court action carried out by the airlines has failed to induce a return to work and has emphasised the fact that negotiation, not confrontation, is the only way to effectively resolve an industrial dispute. I commend this Bill to the Senate and call on the ALP and the coalition to meet the challenges that are raised by it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the adjournment last night I was addressing the Bounty (Photographic Film) Bill 1989 and allied Bills that are now before the Senate. I was talking about the final part of the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1989. I recounted the history in relation to tariff concessions, how up to 1983 there was an unsatisfactory system of by-laws operating which was implemented by the Australian Customs Service, and how in 1982 there had been an Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) investigation which had made some very radical recommendations which became incorporated in 1983 into section XVa of the Customs Act. I was talking about how the problem was overcome by precisely defining in legislative form a series of definitions of what goods could be allowed in duty free because there were no equivalent Australian manufactured goods on the market and how Australian industry benefited from the tariff concession orders. I said that the proposed legislation intended to modify the existing legislation by throwing out that system entirely and going back to the imprecise and unstable system of using guidelines that we had before. I had started to talk about the problems that would happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The argument put forward by Customs following the recent court cases is that, since legislation is being interpreted on a narrow base, it needs the extension to broad guidelines to talk about a class of goods instead of particular goods to give it the flexibility to grant tariff concession orders. I said that I found this utterly illogical. Part of the Customs argument in private is that somehow or other many of the tariff concession orders that have been granted will be rendered invalid unless this legislation is introduced. Again, I cannot see the logic of that argument. </PARA>
<PARA> When I originally read this Bill and the second reading speech I found them very persuasive. I was clearly of a mind to support the legislation because I thought it was logical and reasonable. But when I got the Customs Act and read the amendments that were proposed in the legislation, I started reflecting on what was involved and I came very rapidly to the conclusion that it was quite the wrong way to go. I believe that whoever wrote the Minister's second reading speech either did not know what he was talking about or set out to mislead the Minister and the Government on this. I do not know who wrote that speech, but I do think they were not in possession of the information that they should have been in possession of to make the statement they did in the Minister's second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that must be considered is that the present system works, and works reasonably well. It is not a matter of it being impossible to get tariff concession orders. They are not easy to get under the present system, but there are over 9,000 tariff concession orders at present operative, by the Customs own admission, and something like 150 applications a month are made. A legal opinion from one of Customs legal experts, a lawyer specialising in customs law, came to my notice yesterday. I would like to read part of it:</PARA>
<PARA>A reasonable person would have thought that there could be no more certainty than legislative definitions of particular terms to ensure uniformity of decision making in this area. The analysis and interpretation of such terms is the legitimate business of the courts. If the courts point to defects, then the legislation is usually amended to change them or to conform with the courts' interpretation. The other usual alternative is to make regulations which explain how the provisions of the Act are to be put into practice. In this instance, however, both accepted methods are to be abandoned and we may be witnessing the introduction of a regime which will very largely preclude the commercial community from any means of seeking review of departmental decisions, a backward step. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree with that completely. I think the present proposals do not follow the usual legislative practices. I also find them illogical. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other factors to be taken into consideration here is the fact that the Industry Commission (IC), which is the successor to the Industries Assistance Commission, has already been tasked with reviewing the whole of the tariff concession order field. It will report, after a very detailed examination, in 24 months' time. So the certainty is that the legislation is going to be changed again. Additionally, the formidable resources of the Law Reform Commission are looking at customs legislation. It is just about to move onto this section of the Act dealing with tariff concessions. Again, in the immediate future, we are going to have a very authoritative report brought down. The certainty we face is that there are going to be significant changes to this legislation, if it needs amending, in the next 24 months. We have to question why we are throwing out the baby with the bath water at this time when the industry is quite able and prepared to work with it. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some useful points in the changes proposed to section XVa, and the Opposition will be supporting those. We support the earlier starting date for the application of tariff concession orders. We support the transfer of the decision-making process, in the national interest, from the Comptroller-General to the Minister, because that function is a rarely exercised one and it quite properly should be exercised by the executive government of the day and not by public servants. We will oppose the rest of the changes to section XVa. </PARA>
<PARA> We will be proposing that there be granted a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, under this section of the Act, for those decisions made by the Comptroller-General. We have chosen those words with care. We do not believe that the Minister's decision in relation to the national interest should be subject to appeal and challenge. The very nature of that decision is such that it should be a prerogative of the executive government of the day. At the present time there is simply no effective way of challenging decisions that are made under the provisions of section XVa of this Act, unlike other sections of the Customs Act. The only resort is to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act-the ADJR Act-whereby the appeal must be based on a narrow interpretation of the law. That flies in the face of the fundamental finding of the IAC when it investigated the tariff concession field in 1982. It said that commercial reality must lie at the heart of the granting of tariff concession orders. If one is appealing only under the ADJR Act, it is impossible to bring commercial reality into it. There is no way that that judgment can be made, so we will move an amendment that provides for appeals, for those decisions made by the Comptroller-General, to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the present legislation works. It has a precision to it. It is incorporated in law. It is not left to the whims of public servants. It is free from variability of interpretation because the rules are in the Act. The Act means what it says. The Customs Service, with respect, seems to have difficulty reading Acts and knowing what they mean, as the judgment laid down in the Corinthian case makes clear. The proposed changes will introduce guidelines and will introduce a degree of instability and uncertainty. They are very much a retrograde step because of the imprecision that they will involve. The changes, in our judgment, are unnecessary, in view of the fact that the legislation works well at the present time and that the whole field is going to be subjected to the most intensive review by two responsible authorities, the IC and the Law Reform Commission, in the immediate future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this package of Bills before the Senate are the Bounty (Photographic Film) Bill 1989, the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping) Bill 1989, the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1989, the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1989, the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1989 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989. I rise to address the Bounty (Photographic Film) 1989, which is the Bill about which there has been a great deal of publicity because it provides for a subsidy of some $36m to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd by way of a bounty for photographic film. Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd is the only company which can at this stage receive this bounty, so it is directed specifically at it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first thing I want to say to the Senate is that I have nothing but the highest of praise for the Australian staff and employees of Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd. I would not want anything I say during the course of this debate in any way to be taken as any criticism at all of those people. Indeed, I have made two visits to them now. The first visit was long before this subsidy was proposed. I was most impressed by the executive management team I met there and by the staff that I met as I toured the factory. Since then I have gone around Australia singing their praises. This is a company which has 18 unions operating within its framework, and it has managed to persuade those 18 unions to agree to two 12-hour shifts operating each day. I think you, Mr Deputy President, would appreciate that that is certainly not a management feat to be sneezed at, and it is one for which the union representatives need high praise too for going along with that arrangement. The plant is operating 24 hours a day, and that is something else which needs to be praised in this country. There are not enough companies operating 24 hours a day. As I have said, the management has persuaded the employees to work shifts of 12 hours. </PARA>
<PARA> I was most impressed with this management team. Indeed, I might say that one of the chief executive officers, if he stays with the company, struck me as being the sort of Australian who would have the ability to ultimately end up as the Chief Executive Officer of the international company, Eastman Kodak. He certainly was most impressive. The whole team under Chief Executive Officer Mr Ed Woods is certainly most impressive. Mr Woods is also a most impressive Chief Executive Officer, thoroughly devoted to his company, to the products his company produces and to exporting Australian-made produce, and concerned about the effect that the international company's direction would have on his company and on Australia's exports. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian management team is not responsible for the need for the subsidy. Eastman Kodak in the United States, apparently concerned that it may be the subject of takeover because its performance in the United States has not been up to scratch, has determined to put a great deal of pressure on its international subsidiaries. One of the ways in which it could put on pressure was to demand from the Australian company that it withdraw from exporting to the Asian market to enable the Brazilian company, which was receiving a very substantial government subsidy, to enter that market. The Australian management, with a great deal of concern and expertise, faced that issue by flying to the United States, talking with the international managers about the problems, and coming back to Australia to work out means of overcoming them. It ultimately went to the Australian Government, pointing out the problems to it and seeking its assistance. As I say, I hold these people and the company in high esteem. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that Kodak (Australasia) needs a subsidy of $36m demonstrates publicly the Hawke Government's failure in relation to the economic problems facing the nation at present. The Government has had many opportunities and the support of the Opposition to introduce the reforms which are necessary to address the basic problems of our economy. There is in Australia a hostile environment for businesses and investment in business. Honourable senators should ask themselves what investor would invest $10m or $20m in a new manufacturing plant in Australia at present. If an investor had those sorts of funds, he would probably look at investing in some sort of real estate-a hotel or office block-where he would be assured of a reasonable return on his investment and the maintenance of his capital. Very few investors would look at opening a new manufacturing plant with their available funds. Those already in manufacturing are not disposed to invest further sums to extend their plant because of the hostile environment. </PARA>
<PARA> A manufacturing investor is faced with high interest rates, high inflation and, in particular, heavy business on-costs and regulations. Those regulations have meant that many of them have had to employ one or two additional clerks simply to fill in the forms required by local, State and Federal governments. Rigidities are built into the system and the burdens which parliament imposed on manufacturers at times when they were making substantial profits are still being imposed on them. At a time when we felt we could pay high wages, our wage structure was arranged so that wages could be increased substantially. At a time when we felt that manufacturers were making substantial profits, we imposed upon them a 17 3/4 per cent holiday loading so that when their staff go on holiday their wages increase. We have granted ourselves holidays for any reason we can think of and, whenever a holiday is on a Tuesday, we can bet our bottom dollar that many people will simply take the Monday off. In addition, our management personnel have developed a lazy way of thinking. Frequently one will discover that the management is not in the office on a Wednesday afternoon because that is the day the local yacht club has its yachting race or the golf club has its golf day. If they are not satisfied with taking a Wednesday afternoon off, they nearly always take a Friday afternoon off. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not live here either; I live in Port Fairy. The implication was that I live here, and that is not right. I have a house here, as do many other people. It will sit vacant from 22 December when the Government lets me go home until I come back some time in February. I also have a unit in Melbourne and a house at Port Fairy. I have to maintain those three residences because of the sort of job I have here, thanks to the Government keeping us here all days of the week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is undoubtedly a very hostile environment here for investors. Over a period, we have developed a `that'll do' attitude. Clearly, these problems have to be addressed. This Government has not addressed them. Until it does, there will continue to be a hostile environment for business. Few investors will be prepared to put their funds into business and businesses will continue to be uneconomical. That is the fundamental problem with Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd. Notwithstanding the fact that it has two shifts working 12 hours a day and the plant is operating 24 hours a day, because of the underlying problems in this country-interest rates, inflation, high wages, on-costs, and rigidities built into the system-its profitability and its ability to make a contribution to Eastman Kodak have not been as good as they should have been. This has resulted in pressure being applied by the multinational company, and it has ended up with this subsidy to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the 1987 election, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said that micro-economic reform was to be the centrepiece of this third term agenda. We use this jargon `micro-economic reform' and people wonder what it is. We are talking about addressing the fundamentals of the difficulties of this nation so as to reduce the problems and burdens imposed upon our productive sector. The Opposition praised this course of action proposed by the Prime Minister but, like many of his other promises, it has simply not been fulfilled. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been much talk by senior Ministers about achieving micro-economic reform, and indeed some of the first halting steps have been taken along that path. I refer in particular to the so-called corporatisation of government business enterprises, whereby the government business enterprises became public companies and so have been managed as if they were public companies although wholly owned by the Commonwealth of Australia, but at least operating under a public company structure. That was a step in the right direction. Of course, the Government knew that it should have taken the path towards privatisation, but the Labor Party back bench refused to allow the Government to go down that path. So the corporatisation has been the only step taken in relation to government business enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as the other areas of micro-economic reform are concerned, in particular coastal shipping, the waterfront and the problems of the transport and communications industry, nothing has been done. Certainly, nothing has been done since Minister Willis replaced Minister Evans. On 25 May 1988 the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, announced a program of phased reductions in tariffs. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Years of sheltering behind protective barriers had taken their toll on the productivity and dynamism of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to the protective barriers which had been created in the past. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to allow revitalisation and restructuring to take place. </PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>An important component is the phased reduction in Government support, particularly through reductions in tariffs, and greater concentration on the underlying determinants of competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Button then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Having put in place a consistent and phased approach to tariff reductions industry was better able to concentrate on areas vital to the building of long term international competitive advantage. These areas include quality, design, marketing, and research and development. There has been a fundamental change in industry approach away from Government assistance towards firms themselves addressing those factors so crucial to their success. </PARA>
<PARA>Fine words. At the same time, Senator Button's colleagues were excelling in their rhetoric about what should be done. But what was actually happening was that in some cases effective protection was in fact being increased. In the textiles, clothing and footwear area in particular, thanks to the problems in relation to the quota area, effective protection was increased very substantially. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button made that speech back in May 1988, and since then he has made many speeches about what he has done in this area. He keeps comparing what he has done in this area with what former Liberal-National Party governments have done. He even goes back to the time of Sir John McEwen and talks about protection under the Liberal-National Party Government then. Of course, that is a nonsense comparison. If he is going to talk about a comparison with Sir John McEwen's times, he should also be looking at what the Labor Party policies were at that time, and they would have been in favour of more protection than Sir John McEwen was providing. Senator Button needs to compare his and his Government's performance with what is happening with our international competitors, and with what the Liberal and National parties are calling upon this Government to do at present. </PARA>
<PARA> As recently as September this year, Senator Button was telling the Manufacturing Outlook Conference:</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps our greatest achievement has been to persuade the community that Government hand-outs and regulation are not the route to long term international competitiveness, and that change is essential. </PARA>
<PARA>Very fine words. They went down very well at that conference. I support those words. But at the time that he was uttering them, he was in fact taking to Cabinet this proposal to provide assistance to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd. He was saying, `Our greatest achievement has been to persuade the community that Government hand-outs and regulation are not the route to long term international competitiveness' but at the same time he was taking to Cabinet this proposal for a hand-out to Kodak. His explanation was that Kodak is the only company manufacturing what are called elaborately transformed goods. In other words, there is not some simple procedure involved in manufacturing, but a complicated manufacturing process, and Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd is the only company in Australia producing elaborately transformed goods which is not receiving a government hand-out. So the Government had to give it one. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been saying to Senator Button for a long time that the only way that manufacturers of elaborately transformed goods in Australia can continue under this Government is by being propped up through the taxpayers' pockets. They should not have to be propped up. The Government must turn its mind to the fundamental problems of the economy and do something about them. We do not want just words; we have heard the words. We want to see some action. That, of course, is what the Liberal and National parties' Economic Action Plan is all about-addressing these fundamental problems of the economy and so turning this nation away from this path whereby the only way that companies producing these sorts of goods can survive is by getting a subsidy from the taxpayers of Australia, and turning the manufacturers away from that path and bringing them to a stage where they will be able to stand on their own two feet without this sort of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> I see Senator Panizza in the chamber. This Government was prepared to take action to deregulate the domestic wheat market, as he would recall, but it was not prepared to take action to fix up the problems on the waterfront or with regard to coastal shipping. It was not prepared to take action where there might be some pain for the Australian Labor Party (ALP) because of the strength of the trade union movement in those areas. But it was prepared to take action in the farming community, where there are not so many votes for the Australian Labor Party and where the trade union movement is not as strong. As I said, Senator Button will come into this chamber in due course and try to defend his Government's actions by comparing its performance in this area with the performance of past Liberal-National governments, even going back to the era of Sir John McEwen. But that is an invalid comparison. </PARA>
<PARA> Where are the ALP policies to correct the problems of the economy? We know that the Hawke Government has already fallen down badly in this area, and I am sure that the 20:20 vision which hindsight gives us will in due course show how badly the Hawke Government has fallen down on the opportunities which it has had. Senator Button will complain about the era of former Liberal-National governments and, with the hindsight that 20:20 vision gives, say that the wrong thing was done in the 1950s and 1960s. We are saying that the wrong things have been done during the 1980s, and we believe that this will become more and more evident as we move into the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA> This bribe to Kodak shows the Government's complete contempt for the Parliament and the law. The Government's actions in negotiating the deal with Kodak were unlawful because they breached the provisions of the Industries Assistance Commission Act which require the Government, if it is going to provide this sort of assistance, to direct the Industries Assistance Commission to conduct an inquiry. When I challenged the Government on this matter, those on the Government side prevaricated until they realised that I was right, and then a decision was made, practically on the spot in the chamber, when Senator Button indicated to Senator Walsh that he would introduce a Bill into the Parliament. So this Bill comes before us in order to overcome the provisions of the Industries Assistance Commission Act, which says that governments are not allowed to do this sort of thing and come along at the last moment with this sort of government assistance without a proper inquiry into whether assistance should be given to the industry under the provisions of the Industries Assistance Commission Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, when the Industries Assistance Commission Act was introduced by Mr Gough Whitlam, he said precisely that governments ought not to be making these decisions on the run for political purposes. So the Whitlam Government introduced the Industries Assistance Commission Act to require these inquiries to be made in the first place, and the Government has overcome that requirement by introducing this Bill. The Government has a provision in the Industries Commission Act which would enable it in the future to consider a Bill without acting illegally. The Government has been paying lip service to all of these sentiments yet, at the same time, has been acting unlawfully, as it did in relation to the Industries Assistance Commission Act. </PARA>
<PARA> It sets a very bad precedent. Who is next? Why not the companies who had to go offshore because they were not receiving this protection? I think of Ansell International, a rubber company and subsidiary of Pacific Dunlop Ltd, which is an Australian company. The Government did not provide it with a subsidy to stay in Australia. It allowed it to take its operations offshore. The company had a very successful operation producing rubber products and exporting them all around Asia. That company has left Australia and is now manufacturing in Malaysia. I have mentioned other companies from time to time. As I say, it sets a bad precedent. It is such a bad precedent that the Opposition is not prepared to support the Bill. We say to the Government that this Bill is a bad Bill. We are opposing it. We believe that what the Government should be doing is addressing meaningful micro-economic reforms of the nature I have indicated and trying to reduce the costs to industry of operating in this country so that Australian industry is able to become internationally competitive without having to dip into the taxpayers' pockets. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Liberal and National parties' Economic Action Plan is to turn this country around so that once again we are strong enough for Australian manufacturers to be able to produce their products at reasonable prices with sufficient quality that international companies and people will want to buy Australian made products and Australians will want to buy Australian made products-not only because they are Australian made but also because they are of such good quality and retail at such reasonable and moderate prices that we are proud of them. We will be able to do that only if this Government gets around to addressing the fundamental problems of the economy and gets those right first. Until we have achieved that, Australian manufacturers, as I say, will have to dip into the pockets of the taxpayers of this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating cognately the Bounty (Photographic Film) Bill 1989, the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping) Bill 1989, the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1989, the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1989, the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1989 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989. I confine my remarks to the Bounty (Photographic Film) Bill, which is a totally inappropriate measure and could set a dangerous precedent, as has already been pointed out, within Australian industry. Above all, this legislation is preferential, not only as to the product but also as to the location of the industry. In the past few years certain products have attracted bounty and subsidies. I mention a few of these products, in declining order of magnitude: textile yarn, books, metal machines and robots, printed fabric, computers, ships, bed sheeting and ship repairs. The Australian Government has been gradually trying to phase out bounties. In a similar way, tariff assistance has been reduced gradually and is due to be eliminated by 1992. This is in line, we presume, with the Government's commitment to a program of micro-economic reform and a level playing field. The Government has told us time and time again how well we are going with this reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Bearing this in mind, I take this Bill to indicate only one thing, and that is the absolute failure of this Government's industry policy. It is an absolute admission by the Government that its policy has failed. Not only is it an admission of failure, but also it has caused a lot of companies around Australia to wonder whether they are doing the right thing in sticking to the path of micro-economic reform. They could be excused for taking the easy path and asking the Government to treat them like it treated Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd and get a bail-out-and that is exactly what it was; nothing else. The Government is setting a bad precedent, and it will have to live by its actions in the future. The Government's industry policy is obviously now being administered by knee-jerk reaction. The pattern is becoming clear with other knee-jerk reactions occurring around Australia in matters of policy and management. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the Government's reaction over Kodak, we have the cave-in over Coronation Hill. We had a chance to develop Coronation Hill into probably Australia's richest goldmine which would go a long way towards correcting our overseas trade imbalance. But the Government caved in, as usual, to the greenies. Another example is the deal with the banks over interest rates whereby the banks were able to get more interest on their statutory deposit to help selectively certain users of credit. The Government has given $755,000 in subsidies, to the end of November, to the airlines. Hopefully, the Government will recoup some of that subsidy that has been paid when the airlines get the damages that they have been awarded by the court. In fact, on 16 January the court will determine the exact amount of those damages. A few weeks ago in this Parliament Senator McGauran asked whether, when the airlines got their damages, they would repay the subsidy that they have received from the Government. Of course, the Government has provided assistance, although very belatedly, of about $31.25m to the tourist industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It is well known and generally acknowledged that Australia's biggest single problem is overseas debt, which is a result of our huge and unbearable trade deficit. In other words, there is an excess of consumption as against internal production. There are only two ways of improving the trade deficit: first, by increasing productivity and, secondly, by increasing our savings. In fact, we do not even have a choice between the two-we have to do them both and do them quickly. As I have often said in this chamber, for far too long Australia has relied too heavily on the only efficient industries in Australia-agriculture and mining-to keep us afloat. While the primary industries have struggled to do this, the Government has deregulated the domestic wheat market but has not been game to deregulate the waterfront and some of our transport industries. While the primary industries have kept Australia afloat, the rest of Australia has fallen further and further behind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, he is doing his best; he has marginal agricultural land on his agenda, which we have to look into very soon. The manufacturing industry, aided by the trade union movement, has been put in a declining phase with extinction in sight. This Government's decisions of expediency have not helped. I have already cited some points but there are many other examples, such as Coronation Hill, of resources being locked up and projects cancelled to appease this green lobby. An example of this is the Wesley Vale pulp mill, which Senator Button wanted and, I believe, still wants. So what are we doing instead of going ahead with the Wesley Vale mill? We are chopping down forests, sending wood chips to Japan and then importing the value added paper. This is utter madness. At least Mr Kerin has had the fortitude to say, `Enough is enough'. He has seen for himself that Australia is going down the path of self-destruction by listening to radical people that this Government still kowtows to. If one reads this morning's Sydney Morning Herald one sees that Mr Kerin, having seen the light and which way Australia is going, has incurred his third rebuke from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Who are these people that the Government kowtows to? They are people who want a high standard of living and yet want to close resources; people who eat meat but do not want farmers to have animals in captivity; people who live in timber houses but do not want forests cut; people who must have the best of jarrah furniture, especially in Western Australia where the jarrah grows, but want jarrah forests locked up; and people who want electricity but do not want coal burnt. I could go on and on.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. If the Australian Democrats get their own way we will not be able to have a duck or two for the festive season. Why has Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd had to ask for this bounty? If one takes the Hansard from the other place as a reliable source of fact-I am not saying that it is unreliable but Mr Campbell, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, is always saying that the Senate Hansard is not worth reading-one sees that the problems may have been imported. The worldwide rationalisation program that the parent company, Eastman-Kodak, is conducting has a lot to do with a patent libel suit currently taking place in the United States. Australia was to be part of that rationalisation. The Government should have delved into these matters before going ahead with the bail-out. It should have looked to see what was causing the problem. I now consider this bail-out to be preferential.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators may remember that I spoke in this chamber in June 1989 on legislation introduced by the Government to cut the subsidy paid to Australian manufacturers of certain products under the Subsidy (Cultivation Machines and Equipment) Act 1986 and the Subsidy (Grain Harvesters and Equipment) Act 1985. Although the legislation had a sunset clause of 30 June 1990, the subsidy was cut from the date of the 1989 April statement. This resulted in a saving of $29.4m That is a very significant figure. It almost lines up with the amount that the Government is giving away to Kodak. In 1988 Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd had an operating profit of some $22m and its retained profit was $89m. Where has that $89m gone?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Parer" NAMEID="KI4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having it reinvested would have been prudent but I suspect that it was expatriated. It is on record that Kodak has been engaging in some transfer pricing. Chemicals available in Australia have been purchased from its United States parent company at 10 times the price. What better way is there to expatriate profits and reduce tax liability? As I say, this is an exportation of profit. This way, the profit of the Australian company is non-existent. Any profit transmitted increases the profit in the United States. This has also been the case with Kodak (Australasia) paying excessively for Kodak technology from Kodak United States. The same applies to second-hand equipment being bought from Eastman Kodak of the United States at three to four times its value.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, before deciding upon this quick $35m bail-out, the Government should have looked further into this matter. I repeat that this measure is very preferential. I have already said that the Government cut a subsidy of $29.4m in respect of the manufacture of cultivation and harvesting equipment. It is very coincidental that $29.4m was removed at the time. Senator Robert Ray mentioned the April economic statement and in his second reading speech on the Subsidy Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> As outlined by the Treasurer . . . in the April economic statement, the Government is determined to ensure that fiscal policy is kept tight in order to maintain downward pressure on Australia's trade deficit. </PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to tell us that the savings would be used to offset cost measures mentioned in the 1989 Economic Statement, which would assist families and pensioners. Obviously, that is a strange change. While the Government was cutting subsidies of $29.4m to Australian manufacturers we had a complete bail-out of a multinational-and one whose shots are called from the United States. Speaking during that debate, I cited the example of John Shearer Ltd, a manufacturer in Adelaide. It is an Australian company which has been manufacturing in Australia for 125 years. The Government sought to cut its bounty, which had only until 30 June 1990 to go. At the same time, that company had been brought almost to its knees by the trade union movement when the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union had a strike for two weeks over compulsory unionism. The Government did not offer to help in that case; it left the company to its own devices. It then added insult to injury and cut the bounty 12 months early. The Government refused to pay bounty even on machines that were on the order book or going through the factory. However, I believe that it did back down on that a little later on. Of course, the firm was in Adelaide and probably in a secure seat, not in Melbourne in the electorate of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Farm machinery and primary industry are of lesser concern for this Government; they are there simply to carry on for Australia. The Bill is very selective. Shearer Ltd may have to go offshore to manufacture Australia's best tillage machinery and then import the machinery back into Australia. One cannot be more selective than that. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this is the modus operandi of the Government as we run down to the election. The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) made some interesting comments in the House of Representatives. He said that Kodak and many other Australian companies were not on a level playing field because of what governments do on foreign shores-something we know very well. He concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>It is also worth while going back to see why these kinds of things occur and why the Australian economy, any government in Australia or any State government is so vulnerable to these kinds of approaches and this kind of blackmail. It is blackmail; there is no question about that, and I am not afraid to accept that and I have used that term in the past regarding other companies. </PARA>
<PARA>There we have a full admission that this approach by Kodak is blackmail and nothing else. Even though it is admitted that it is an efficient firm, and we know it is an efficient firm, we are being blackmailed into helping it out because of decisions that were made in other places. When we talk about non-level playing fields on other shores, not only Kodak but every other company around Australia, and especially the agricultural and mining industries, has to put up with the distorted economic systems in other places. However, as I have already said, this does not excuse the Government selectively helping companies; worse still when that selectivity is directed towards a multinational company in Australia rather than an Australian manufacturer such as John Shearer Ltd of Adelaide. All other Australian export reliant industries bear the same problems. The problem does not belong only to Kodak (Australasia). In return for this government hand-out one would assume that Kodak (Australasia) would do whatever was possible to ease the balance of trade problem. The Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown) said in the House of Representatives:</PARA>
<PARA>The signals from Eastman Kodak also suggested that a window of opportunity existed not only to overturn the closure decision-</PARA>
<PARA>I presume of Kodak in Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>but to press for a commitment to enhance Kodak's Australian operations in the Asian region in return for temporary assistance from this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not quite what happened. An article in the Sydney Morning Herald indicates that a Canberra-based firm had received an order from Shanghai for $1.2m worth of colour film and that Kodak (Australasia) refused to supply it. The reason given was that Hong Kong agents handled all Kodak's business in China. An approach to the office of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) asking why Kodak (Australasia) had refused to supply such an order, considering the $36m of taxpayers' money that is being granted to it, resulted in much stalling. I refer again to the House of Representatives Hansard, in which Senator Button's letter was cited. When the Minister finally responded, his letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA>While the Government is keen to encourage a greater export commitment by Australian industry generally individual marketing arrangements and decisions by firms need to take account of the nature of particular agreements with distributors and the complexities of particular overseas markets. In the case of Kodak, arrangements between the company and its agents or other traders are matters of a commercial nature which are best left to the parties involved. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what Senator Button had to say in his letter when he finally gave an answer as to why Kodak (Australasia) refused to supply that $1.2m worth of colour film. The Government should have sorted these things out before and made sure that Kodak was willing to supply any market, especially in South East Asia. So much for reciprocal arrangements towards reducing Australia's imbalance of trade. </PARA>
<PARA> This bounty is bad for Australia and for industry in general. It does nothing for the small manufacturers at the mercy of record interest rates. It does nothing for the farmers around Australia, who are under the same burden as Kodak and any other company or industry in Australia that is burdened by record interest rates. Those industries are still carrying Australia. The Opposition will oppose this Bill and our Leader has undertaken to reverse the decision when in government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Bounty (Photographic Film) Bill 1989, the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping) Bill 1989, the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1989, The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1989, the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1989 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989. I wish to address myself to the Bounty (Photographic Film) Bill 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to provide a bounty of $3.75 per square metre of photographic film that is sensitised and finished in Australia for three years from 1 January 1990 to 31 December 1992. If the second reading speech presented with this Bill indicates the basis of a Cabinet decision to provide this bounty, it is an indictment of the decision-making process of this Government. I doubt that I have ever seen a document so full of inconsistencies. Government is supposed to be the guardian of the taxpayers. In this case it is quite apparent that the Government sacrificed taxpayers' money for what it saw as political expediency in the electorate of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). It shows again how arrogant and out of touch this Government has become. It also has the same foul smell about it as Western Australia Inc. </PARA>
<PARA> By comparison, it is interesting to note that a small garment factory in Queensland, which makes clothing for Stubbies, last week fired 100 people; this week a further 150 people from Stubbies have been fired. There was not a whimper from this Government. In a period of just 10 days, in the little town of Gympie and in Brisbane, we have seen 250 people put off. Honourable senators will recall that one of the major reasons given by the Prime Minister at the time as to why he would give this hand-out to a foreign company was that he wanted to save the jobs of 500 people, at a cost then of $60m. It has subsequently been reduced to $36m. That was the excuse given. The Australian Financial Review editorial of 20 September, in referring to this opportunism, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The more disturbing implication-</PARA>
<PARA>this is of the Kodak bounty-</PARA>
<PARA>is that in its senility this Government has decided that the level playing field is too remote a concept, that-with an election around the corner-it would instead move into Lady Bountiful mode. </PARA>
<PARA>The question we must ask is: why was Kodak chosen to receive the largess when hundreds of Australian companies are in import replacement or the export business, or have the potential to export, and would and could expand with a fraction of this hand-out of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also noted that the conditions for Kodak to receive the bounty are that it will be required to engage in the sensitising process for only three years and in the finishing operations for only five years. The sensitising process-preparation and coating-is the tricky business in film making. After three years Kodak will be free to import rolls of sensitised film from anywhere-presumably from Brazil because, according to the information obtained by Senator Austin Lewis, Eastman Kodak's original proposal was to shut down the operations in Australia and supply the Asian market from Brazil. </PARA>
<PARA> After three years the company will be free to import rolls of sensitised film. Having got $36m of taxpayers' money from the Federal Government and another $6m from the Victorian taxpayers, it will be able to go anywhere and buy its sensitised rolls. We could see rolls of sensitised film coming in and, after another two years, we will be left with only the mechanical process of cutting and packaging the film, a process which is not new but has been going on for many years, as my colleague Senator MacGibbon will know, in the medical, dental and industrial x-ray film market where rolls of film are brought in, and just cut up and packaged. </PARA>
<PARA> The introductory paragraph in the Minister's second reading speech states that the Bill provides bounty for Australian manufacturers-notice it is plural-of sensitised photographic colour film. It should be pointed out-although most people probably realise-that only one company is involved, Kodak Australasia, a wholly owned subsidiary of Eastman Kodak of the United States of America. As such, it is not an Australian manufacturer at all. The second reading speech is misleading. Kodak is a foreign company manufacturing in Australia. It is a pity that the Government was not more honest when it came out with these sorts of statements in the second reading speech. In support of the bounty Senator Button claims that Kodak's Coburg operation is Australia's second largest exporter of what is termed these days `elaborately transformed manufactures' or ETMs. That itself is an indictment of the Government's industry policy after seven years. But if, after three years, the plant is to be reduced to cutting and packaging imported film, will the process still be classified as elaborately transformed manufacture even if there is some export? Senator Button also says that even Eastman Kodak recognised the efficiency of the Australian operation but that it was planning to shut it down for a host of other reasons-strategic reasons, the existence of better tax regimes in other countries, high tariff walls in other countries, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing I note-I think the general public has come to realise it-about this Government is that there is always a range of excuses as to why it is someone else's fault and why it is not better or possible to manufacture in Australia. The Government never addresses the real problems. It refuses to confront the real issues of what is termed micro-economic reform-particularly in the rigid industrial relations area-which everyone knows would increase productivity and reduce unit costs of production. It is apparent that not even Senator Button believes the nonsense about being efficient and competitive. On page 3 of his second reading speech-this is what I termed earlier `inconsistencies'-he states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if Kodak Australasia could substantially improve its economic performance, Eastman Kodak would undertake to maintain and develop its Australian operations. </PARA>
<PARA>He cannot have it both ways. Senator Button cannot say that everyone recognises that it is an efficient, profitable operation from the parent company down and then go on to say, `However, if you can substantially increase your economic performance we will keep you alive'. However, the question we have to ask is: How was this to be done? How would the company increase its economic performance to enable it to continue in Australia, having been here for decades? This is not a new industry that has sprung up, has had problems and has suddenly deteriorated. It has been here for decades. For decades Kodak had a virtual monopoly of the film market. </PARA>
<PARA> I have shown the appalling inconsistencies in Senator Button's second reading speech. The measures which are proposed lack credence. However, for what it is worth, the scheme is that Kodak is to undertake to deliver $20m per annum in productivity improvements. Nowhere has it been spelled out how this is to be achieved. Senator Lewis gave some examples from the industrial relations point of view where the company has moved to two 12-hour shifts and so on, but how will it deliver $20m? Is it true? We have to have doubts. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor governments are wonderful on hand-outs of other people's money. The Victorian Government said it would give $6m of Victorian taxpayers' money for three years on condition that the Federal Government provided further assistance. Here we have the pincer movement. Kodak was promised $6 by the Victorian Government if the Federal Government would come to the party. If the Federal Government came to the party the company would not shut down, and so on. Hence we had the remarks about blackmail which were made earlier by my colleague Senator Panizza. </PARA>
<PARA> Initially the Federal Government agreed to provide $60m over five years. That was subsequently reduced to $36m over three years. That is all taxpayers' money. As I mentioned a number of times earlier, I suspect that the final result will be that after three years we will have a plant which will be engaged in the cutting and packaging of imported film, not sensitising it, making it or doing the tricky expensive parts of the process. In regard to the efficiency of Kodak I have extracted key figures from Kodak Australasia's annual return for the years ended December 1988 and December 1987 and have applied the bounty and assistance package to the figures. I seek leave to have the resulting table incorporated in Hansard. I referred it to Senator Ray earlier, and he agreed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A $35m operating profit. The income tax expense was $13m so the profit after tax was $21.7m If we add the assistance package of the $12m per annum from the Federal and $2m per annum from the Victorian Government, using 1988 figures-which were inflated because of the Bicentennial last year; if they were less the effect would be worse-the company would end up with an effective operating profit of $48m with the bounty and assistance. After deducting tax at 39 per cent, or $19m, the profit after tax would be $30m. That makes an effective company tax rate of 15 per cent. A foreign company is being given a tax holiday for three years of 24 per cent of the tax it should pay compared with the normal company tax rate of 39 per cent. If Kodak slipped back to the pre-bicentennial year's progress and brought in a profit equivalent to that of 1987, it would have the luxury of a negative tax of minus 36 per cent. That would be the effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Offering tax holidays was a particularly successful method of attracting new industries to the growth countries of Asia, particularly Taiwan, Korea and more recently, I believe, Thailand. It would not be successful in Australia on its own, particularly while we have a rigid centralised wage fixing system, which may have had some relevance in the distant past but which today, with all its archaic entrenched rackets and rorts, continues to destroy the potential productive capacity of this inherently rich country. The fact that this Government has applied such a package to a foreign company which, as I mentioned, has been here for decades and which has had a virtual monopoly is testimony to this point. It is not as if the Government is offering across the board tax holidays to investors prepared to invest in value added manufacture which would help our export industries. It is applying the package to a company that has been here for years. If a coalition government had pulled a stunt like this for short term political expediency it would have, quite rightly, been pilloried by the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> Our country, with its inherent wealth and highly educated population, should be one of the most affluent countries in the world. It should be a place in which everyone wants to invest, adding value to the resource wealth we have. But people do not. We know why and the Government knows why. Unit costs of production are too high. The costs and delays on our waterfront are a worldwide scandal. If the Government addressed the corruption of the economy by its comrades in key areas, it would go a long way to getting our great country back on track and returning our standard of living to what it should be. A bandaid solution to the Kodak problem is only postponing the day of reckoning. </PARA>
<PARA>5 Senator Button in recent times has been talking an awful lot-ad nauseam-about philosophical justification. He attempts to criticise the opposition. Let him explain to the Senate his philosophical justification for a taxpayer hand-out to a foreign owned company in Australia which has been here for decades, with no assurances whatsoever of the continued long term manufacturing of photographic film in this country. As pointed out on 3 November in the Australian, Senator Button is right about the $30m subsidy being an aberration. It is a scandal. Senator Button makes the irresponsible scattering around of public money no more palatable by expressing qualms about it. Rather, he makes it look as if he is losing his grip on his portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> As mentioned by previous speakers, the Opposition will oppose this Bill. When in government we will remove the bounty. It is an incredible situation that a package has been put forward which is, from the second reading speech, totally illogical and inconsistent. Statements on one page conflict with statements on the next page. There is no doubt that it is yet again political expediency. It just happens that the plant we are talking about is in the Prime Minister's electorate. People can draw their own conclusions from that. If we are to go down this course, let us make it across the board. Let us not just pick out a company. If one is going to pick out a company one should be clever enough to pick one out that at least is Australian owned and where one could be sure that the payment out of taxpayers' money would guarantee that we would continue to be in import replacement and export down the track. But this package does not guarantee that. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have mentioned a number of times, within three years the whole sensitising plant could well be shut down, and it probably will be. Then, at the end of five years, there is no guarantee that the company will be cutting and packaging the import of sensitised film. We may be importing the lot. The Opposition opposes this Bill and we look forward in the committee stage to hearing some of the justifications by Senator Button of the claims he has made. </PARA>

However, I will confine my remarks entirely to the Bounty (Photographic Film) Bill, as has Senator Parer and one or two other speakers. I do so for a variety of reasons, but the prime reason is that in all my many years of experience either in politics or in the Public Service dealing with economic and industry matters I have never seen a more flagrant, politically oriented approach to any use of taxpayers' money for industry purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government stands absolutely condemned for its decision on this Bill. The Opposition will vote against this Bill. If we do not win the day on that, when we win government next year we will repeal the bounty. As the shadow Minister for industry and commerce, Mr John Howard, has said in another place, the arrangements contained in the Bill are wrong in principle. They are economically bad. If we are to have some kind of export encouragement it should apply to everybody; it should not be provided just on ministerial whim and in a particular electorate. As has been pointed out, the Kodak plant is, or was until the recent redistribution of the boundaries, in the electorate of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). It is now just marginally out of it, but for all intents and purposes it is in the Prime Minister's electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole handling of this matter has been quite extraordinary. We discovered the original proposal only by flushing out the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, through a series of questions in September. In that context I pay tribute to the role that my colleague Senator Austin Lewis played in forcing the Government to disclose-or drawing it out, inch by inch-what it was on about. Fortunately, the Government's original proposal, which was a bounty spread over five years and totalling $60m, has now been reduced by two years to three years and the figure, accordingly, reduced to $36m-nevertheless, a very large amount of taxpayers' money. The original proposal was to make this deal without having special legislation to effect it. In that context, the original proposal was illegal because, as we know, under the Industries Assistance Commission Act there is specific prohibition of the provision of assistance to a particular industry for a period exceeding two years unless the Minister administering the Act, that is, the Treasurer, has received a report from the Commission about the matter. Indeed, the Act prohibits a Minister from taking any action with respect to this matter until the report is received. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government proposed to ignore absolutely that legislative provision in the Industries Assistance Commission Act and to make an illegal payment. It was only through questioning in the Senate that that was disclosed. As a result, the Government has now brought forward this extraordinary piece of legislation in an attempt to legitimate the proposal in terms of the financial arrangements. The Parliament through the provision in the Industries Assistance Commission Act has very deliberately prohibited long term grants of assistance to industry without proper inquiry. This is not a temporary payment, as the Minister tries to argue in the second reading speech-three years is not temporary. There has been no inquiry into this assistance package. In other words, the Government has been prepared to overturn the whole basis of the process established by governments and parliaments of this country for the examination and provision of assistance to industries. It is simply another example of the Government's preparedness to spend taxpayers' money unendingly in an attempt between now and the next election to cling to power. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear that many Ministers are very concerned about this decision. The so-called responsible Minister, Senator Button, obviously is concerned about it. He was so concerned that in September when the negotiations were still taking place, before the present arrangements had been finalised-when the $60m deal was still on the go-he told journalists to use `black type to emphasise that the Kodak deal was not a precedent'. The Minister was tested as to this role in bringing the matter to Cabinet. He said, `I have had a part in the decision-that's all'. He was then tested as to what had been taken to Cabinet. He did admit that he took the matter to Cabinet in the sense that he took a document. When tested as to what that document was, he said that it was a memorandum; it was not a Cabinet submission at all. There is a very real question as to what was contained in that memorandum. What size was it? What analysis did the memorandum contain? What basis did it give for Cabinet to take the decision that it did? In an article by Michelle Grattan in the Age on 31 October the Minister is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>If one had one's life to lead in a completely academic, remote world, one wouldn't have made a decision like this. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the responsible Minister was admitting that this was a decision that was taken on purely political grounds and without any real substance and basis. The Treasurer (Mr Keating), when asked about the matter in September, was quoted in an article in the Australian Financial Review as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it's one we have had to make a judgment about. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not a matter of my judgment. </PARA>
<PARA>If the responsible Minister, Senator Button, and the person who is in control of the Industries Assistance Commission and the purse strings of this country, namely the Treasurer, walked away from this decision and were not party to making it, in the sense of wishing to see it happen, how was this decision taken? Who really took this matter to Cabinet? Senator Button has said that he took the memorandum but he has never been prepared to say that the Prime Minister did not initiate his taking that matter to Cabinet. Under pressure and under questioning here, Senator Button has never been prepared to dismiss the Prime Minister's involvement in initiating this matter. An article by Paul Cleary in the Sydney Morning Herald on 28 September stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Official sources said yesterday that they did not believe that Senator Button was fully behind giving help to Kodak, and that they believed Mr Hawke was the initiator because the plant was located in his electorate . . . It is also understood that Senator Button had taken the matter to Cabinet on behalf of Mr Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA>If any better demonstration of the political nature of this exercise is required, I do not know how one could find it. Who really took the matter to Cabinet? In my view there is very strong evidence that the whole matter was initiated by the Prime Minister against the wishes of the responsible industry Minister, Senator Button, and against the wishes of the Treasurer. On whose judgment was this deal made if it was not Senator Button or Mr Keating? Why was the deal taken? Why was the deal made at all?</PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Parer put very well in his remarks today, the circumstances surrounding Kodak are those which relate to a small subsidiary-a big company by Australian standards-of the Eastman Kodak empire, said to be efficient in the course of a very inconsistent and illogical second reading speech which was incorporated in Hansard by Senator Robert Ray where contradictory statements are made in succeeding paragraphs. One paragraph on page 2 of the speech says:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian operation is recognised, even by Eastman Kodak, as an efficient and world competitive operation. However, for strategic reasons, Eastman Kodak is unwilling to close down its less efficient operations in other parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA>In the following paragraph of the speech the Minister says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . an undertaking from Eastman Kodak was obtained that if Kodak Australasia could substantially improve its economic performance, Eastman Kodak would undertake to maintain and develop its Australian operation. </PARA>
<PARA>So, either the company is now efficient or it is not. I believe it is obligatory for the Minister, when he sums up at the end of this debate, to tell us whether the Government believes that we are dealing with an efficient operation or whether we are dealing with an operation which could become efficient. When we look at the second reading speech which contains what the Minister purports to be the major commitments wrung from Eastman Kodak and Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd as part of this deal, the whole thing looks more and more peculiar. The first commitment said to be given by Eastman Kodak is that Kodak (Australasia) will be retained as a manufacturing plant for colour film, employing sensitising operations for a minimum of three years and finishing operations for a minimum of five years. Senator Parer has commented on that aspect and I will not go into it further. It is a very open-ended undertaking in my view. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, Kodak (Australasia) will retain its corporate mandate as the sole producer of Kodacolour 100 colour film for Australia and at least those Asian and other markets currently supplied by the company. That undertaking should not be seen as a great, positive achievement. I am a very strong supporter of foreign investment in Australia-I think it has added greatly to Australian industry and real living standards over many years. So I am not in any way decrying foreign investment in Australia. But what does concern me is that we should have situations where Australian-based companies are restricted by their parent companies in terms of where they can conduct their export operations. To say, `We have wrung a commitment from Kodak that it will at least maintain the Asian and other markets currently supplied by the company', seems to me to be something that we should have expected in any case, regardless of any deal that has been done. Similar comments apply to the third so-called commitment, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Kodak Australasia will retain its export mandate into those Asian and other markets currently supplied by the company, and be entitled to seek further export markets in these regions. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, it should be entitled to do that. It should not need to have a shonky deal with the Government to make that sort of arrangement. The second reading speech continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Fourth, Kodak Australasia will implement significant productivity improvements through award restructuring, inventory, overheads and production line improvements. </PARA>
<PARA>Any company worth its salt-and, hopefully, all Australian companies-is doing those things now. Why is $36m being paid to a single, particular company that the Government has plucked out of the air to benefit at the cost, therefore, of all other companies in Australia on the basis of, among other things, a commitment to do things that it ought reasonably to be doing and which one would expect it to be doing in any event?</PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, another commitment states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Kodak . . . will be broadening its research and development activities . . . over the next five years. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, I would have thought any far-sighted and reasonable company would be doing that in any event. On close examination, the positives that are outlined by the Government as the quid pro quo for the use of taxpayers' money in this outrageous way add up to very little indeed. One is inevitably led back to the argument that this whole matter is entirely political. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just the Opposition that is concerned about this matter; so too is a whole range of the private sector. Industry has been unanimous in saying that the package is inconsistent with the Government's own stated policies, that it is politically motivated and that it will set a very dangerous precedent. That criticism and comment has come from a broad base of industry. Mr Bill Henderson, the National Executive Director of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, said that the Kodak proposal would lead to a flood of requests for government assistance from other companies. Why not? Why should it not lead to a flood of requests from other companies? What is so special about Kodak that it should be fenced off from other companies in Australia? The chief economist of the Australian Chamber of Commerce, Mr Brent Davis, has strongly criticised the proposal. He is quoted in the press as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>``The aid package would basically represent a transfer of money from Australian taxpayers to the US shareholders of Eastman Kodak. </PARA>
<PARA> ``Throwing money at these sorts of companies will not solve their fundamental problems of poor productivity. The Government is merely bribing Kodak to stay in Australia for another five years.''</PARA>
<PARA>The Executive Director of the Business Council of Australia, Mr Peter McLaughlin, is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government should not have become involved in the first place . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So, it is not just the Opposition which sees this arrangement as extraordinary and of a purely political nature, governed essentially by the requirements of the Prime Minister and a desperate attempt by this Government to buy votes at the next election with taxpayers' money. If this were just a one-off example of the Government acting in that way, that would be bad enough. But it is part of a pattern that we have seen increasingly in recent months of the Government taking shoot from the hip, ad hoc political decisions involving a great deal of taxpayers' money and distorting the whole investment field and economic climate in this country, the long term consequences of which will be very dangerous. </PARA>
<PARA> One example which readily comes to mind and which occurred at about the same time as this decision was the deal done with the banks to give them a higher return on their non-recallable deposits to keep down the level of housing interest rates. </PARA>

The Government should be doing what it can to get interest rates down across the board. Australia has, under this Government, the highest interest rates in the Western world. It will not solve that problem by doing behind-closed-doors deals with the banking system. It will do it by getting its policies right. The Government has shown absolutely no prospect of doing that. That is why the sooner the Government occupies the Opposition benches, and we take its place in this Parliament, the better. That is the only way to get interest rates down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The deals are legion. The biggest dealer of the lot with the Government is the trade union movement. If one wanted an example of that, one would have only to look at what Bill Kelty said when he was introducing Paul Keating to the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) congress in September this year. Never has Mr Kelty's power been more clearly explained than by Mr Kelty himself when paying tribute to Mr Keating. Brad Norington, the industrial editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, referred to the power that Mr Kelty `has as the unseen senior Cabinet Minister in the Hawke Government and the voice of the trade union movement'. In paying tribute to Mr Keating at the ACTU congress, Mr Kelty said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I must say that when things get tough dealing with the Government, the bloke you go to see is Paul Keating. </PARA>
<PARA>He rattled off a litany of favours that Paul Keating had done for him and the trade union movement. In this respect, one need refer only to the disgraceful deal on superannuation in 1986 and the unconscionable involvement of the ACTU in determining the taxation policy of this country. This Government does not move on any economic policy without getting the imprimatur of the trade union movement. The Government has put itself in this disgraceful, anti-democratic situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most telling criticism of the Kodak decision comes from Senator Button himself. Just a week or so before the details of the Kodak negotiations broke, Senator Button addressed the Manufacturing Outlook Conference. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps our greatest achievement has been to persuade the community that Government hand-outs and regulation are not the route to long term international competitiveness, and that change is essential. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a statement which we, the Opposition, totally agree with. Yet in one stroke, just a few days later, Senator Button shot down in flames everything that underlies that very laudable statement because with the Kodak decision Senator Button-or the Government-has told industry that the easiest profits come from the taxpayers' pockets and that under the Hawke Government the hand-out mentality is alive and well. The Government will have to live with the consequences of that. The implications are very profound indeed, not just for the taxpayers. One wonders how much longer Australian taxpayers can operate and exist under the enormous burdens being imposed on them by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as being concerned about that, one fears greatly for the future of this country if our economic activity is to be distorted week in, week out, month in, month out, by Government decisions which are taken on a totally irrational, illogical basis and which remove any concept of the level playing field, which I thought was a bipartisan view, as an absolute necessity in this country. Week in and week out that level playing field is being rutted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We must really be entering an election phase because quite a deal of what Senator Short has said was clearly of an electioneering type rather than addressing the issues before us. For instance, he dealt with who might have made the decision in relation to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd and said that he was sure it was Mr Hawke and not Senator Button. It does not make a great deal of difference who made the decision; it is the decision that we should be looking at. The implication is that, irrespective of whether the decision was a good one or a bad one, presumably the Opposition would reverse the decision precisely because it could have been made by Mr Hawke. That is not the issue we are here to debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to deal with only two of the Bills. I will pick up, first, the Bill that Senator Short devoted so much attention to; that is, the Bill that is quaintly called the Bounty (Photographic Film) Bill 1989. It could well have been called the `Kodak Assistance Package'. We certainly agree in general terms with some of the principles outlined by the Opposition in relation to the desirability of not picking off and advantaging particular companies. If one is supporting a government move to spend money to prop up certain companies, one needs to bear in mind the alternative advantages which might come from an investment of a like amount of money in other areas. Indeed, Senator Short has eloquently quoted the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) in support of his criticism of this Kodak Bill. I will be returning to that shortly in relation to the other Bill to which I wish to draw attention, the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4), because the IAC has had quite a bit to say about the matters that lie behind that Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that one should not slavishly follow ideology to that extent. I think that one does need to look at the particularities of the Kodak situation and in the light of that make a determination whether what is being proposed by the Government is in the best short term interests of Australia. If that is the case, one clearly makes an exception. </PARA>
<PARA> Kodak (Australasia) has been operating in Australia for a number of years. I understand that it employs some 1,500 workers. It has sales which run to some $472m and exports throughout South East Asia of about $164m. It is said to be the second largest exporter of manufactured goods from Australia. Clearly if such an industry suddenly were to disappear from the Australian scene, enormous penalties would be imposed on the Australian economy through that disappearance. I believe it is more difficult than was outlined by the Opposition to decide whether some support for such an industry is or is not in the best interests of the Australian economy and the Australian people. It seems to me that the figures work out in such a way as to indicate that it is of advantage to Australia in this particular case to offer the support which the Government has offered, particularly in view of the conditions which attach to that support should Kodak (Australasia) renege on those undertakings, so the Government and the people of Australia, represented by the Government, are in a safe and secure position with respect to the offered help. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know how much tax is paid by 1,500 workers in Kodak (Australasia), but I suspect that it runs to the order of over $6m a year. On the total sales of $472m I imagine that Kodak pays substantially more in company tax and various other charges than is being offered back to it by way of $12m a year which the Government is offering to that company. For those reasons it seems to the Democrats that, on balance, this proposal should be supported. </PARA>
<PARA> We note, for instance, that the safeguards that the Government has extracted from Kodak (Australasia) are that it will be retained as a manufacturing plant for colour film employing sensitising operations for a minimum of three years and finishing operations for a minimum period of five years. Certainly the Democrats considered the technology which Kodak is employing because we are aware, as many other honourable senators will be aware, that photographic technology is undergoing a considerable revolution. There are already prototype cameras which can record images digitally through an electronic device onto something like a floppy disc. Eventually these things could be recorded on a type of compact disc. That technology has enormous advantages over the present technology. </PARA>
<PARA> We considered the possibility that if Kodak (Australasia) was not developing that technology here we may well be left behind by offering this sort of support. That was a consideration we had in mind. However, it is equally clear that there must be hundreds of millions of cameras using film around the world, particularly in Australia and South East Asia, and that those cameras will continue to use film for a very long period. Under those circumstances there is clearly a reasonably long term opportunity to sell colour film even though that technology may, over the next 10 or 15 years, become obsolete. The assistance being offered is for three years only and again, it seems to the Australian Democrats that it would be unwise to kill off that industry and deny ourselves the short term advantage which would come from being able to supply the Australian and South East Asian market from Kodak (Australasia). </PARA>
<PARA> Kodak (Australasia) has also given an undertaking that it will retain its corporate mandate as the sole producer of Kodacolour 100 colour film for Australia, and at least it will retain its export mandate in the Asian and other markets currently supplied by the company. It will implement significant productivity improvements through award restructuring. In the event that Kodak (Australasia) does not maintain its mandate in the region over the next five years, it has agreed to pay back any Federal Government assistance provided. </PARA>
<PARA> It is absolutely true, as several honourable senators on the Opposition side have said, that many of these things should be done by companies operating in Australia. I do not know whether we can call Kodak (Australasia) and Australian company as it is wholly foreign owned, but companies operating in Australia should be carrying out these things anyway. The fact remains that Kodak (Australasia) was not planning to carry out these things. It was intending to shut its doors. It is against that sort of background that we need to consider the alternatives of providing this short term assistance and maintaining the industry in this country for a time; of allowing it to go to the wall; or of seeing where else in the economy we could spend that $36m and derive the same or a greater benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats will support the Bounty (Photographic Film) Bill 1989 because we believe that, while in principle these sorts of decisions should not be entered into lightly, in this particular case there are sufficient and significant advantages to the Australian economy and to the Australian people for the Government to take this course of action. </PARA>
<PARA> The Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1989 seeks to correct an anomaly which has appeared as a consequence of the challenge to the law as it is. My understanding is that the provision of commercial tariff concessions under the commercial tariff concession system has been operating for a number of years under a law which more recently has been given an interpretation by the courts which has thrown into doubt the way in which that law has been hitherto interpreted by the Australian Customs Service. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to look at the report of the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) on commercial tariff concessions with respect to PVC foam blocks and DC electric motors. The IAC drew attention to several important general issues which arose out of that inquiry. These issues are very much the matters which underlie the Bill before us. The IAC drew attention to the fact that in providing these commercial tariff concessions orders, or CTCOs, there were two criteria that the Australian Customs Service should take into account and that neither of these criteria was really satisfactory. The criteria were the likeness or similarity of goods for which tariff concessions were being sought compared with similar goods manufactured or potentially capable of being manufactured in Australia. So on the one hand there was the likeness of the goods and on the other hand there was a characteristic relating to a broader interpretation of likeness-whether there would or would not be a significant cross-elasticity of demand. That impacted, of course, on the matter of whether the potential sale of similar but not identical goods manufactured in Australia would be affected. The IAC says:</PARA>
<PARA>The cases under review-</PARA>
<PARA>and here the IAC is drawing general conclusions from the particular cases that were being reviewed-</PARA>
<PARA>suggest that these Sub-sections-</PARA>
<PARA>and these are the subsections to which the present Bill addresses itself-</PARA>
<PARA>have obscured rather than clarified that objective. </PARA>
<PARA>The objective is the consideration of the general tariff concessions. I will read several sections of the report because they are important in understanding what the IAC is talking about. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>The effect of interpretations by the Federal Court of ``identical goods''-</PARA>
<PARA>and that goes to the first characteristic-</PARA>
<PARA>and the Attorney-General's Department's opinion is that the Act and Regulations confer no power on Customs to change the description of a class or kind of goods provided in a CTCO application . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So the effect of the court interpretation which has been given in the last five or six years is that Customs must take very precisely and narrowly the description or class of goods for which the CTCO application has been made. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The legislation would appear to enable, if not encourage, applicants to specify their CTCO applications in narrow terms exclusively to suit their commercial interest. </PARA>
<PARA>My interpretation of that is that, given the court ruling in this matter-and I am referring to the Federal Court decision in the Corinthian Industries Pty Ltd case-it would be possible to import an enormous range of goods provided one could sufficiently narrowly draw the terms of the application. The IAC report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission doubts that the end result of such practices would necessarily be different than under previous arrangements, because an artificially narrow description designed to be compatible with ss.269b (3) would still encounter problems with ss.269b (4) and, conceivably, with s.269e . . . The processes involved in administering the system, however, would be more fragmented and cumbersome, as would processing of imports under CTCOs. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, the IAC there is drawing attention to the complexity of dealing with a potentially much larger number of necessarily much more narrowly drawn applications for tariff concessions. Dealing with the second criterion by which these applications for concessions are to be measured, the IAC report says:</PARA>
<PARA>The requirement, in ss.269b (4), that Customs satisfy itself that there would be no significant cross-elasticity of demand between locally produced goods and those which are the subject of a CTCO application can, in practice, only be applied qualitatively. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . cross-elasticity of demand is useful in many economic analyses. But it cannot be measured in prospective market situations-</PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely the situation in which the Customs Service must consider these applications because these are applications for goods to be imported and goods which are likely to impact on Australian manufacture. So the Customs Service is being asked to take into account cross-elasticity of demand under circumstances in which, according to the IAC, such a prospective consideration is impossible. The Corinthian Industries interpretation really puts the Custom Service in a catch-22 situation. In relation to cross-elasticity the IAC report says:</PARA>
<PARA>But it cannot be measured in prospective market situations or with respect to the closely specified goods which are usually the subject of CTCO applications. </PARA>
<PARA>Putting those two things together-goods which are very narrowly specified, which is a requirement under the court's interpretation, and at the same time the necessity to consider the question of cross-elasticity-the problem becomes almost an insoluble one. Concluding that paragraph on these general issues arising from this inquiry, it says:</PARA>
<PARA>In the Commission's view, the wording of ss.269b (4) [and 269b (3)] now encourages confusion rather than precision in assessing whether goods serve similar functions. </PARA>
<PARA>I was particularly interested to hear Senator Short draw upon IAC opinion when he was dealing with the Kodak Bill-the Bounty (Photographic Film) Bill. It seems to me that, if the IAC is to be taken seriously, the Opposition should also be looking quite seriously at what the IAC says about the interpretation of these clauses which are the subject of amendment in the Bill before us today. I will just mention briefly the other problem to which the IAC draws our attention in these general remarks-the difficulties faced by applicants for CTCOs. The IAC quotes several people who gave evidence to this inquiry. Among other things, it says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the applicant does not-and in most cases, cannot-obtain full information without the co-operation of local manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA>That means that, in applications which have to be narrowly drawn and cannot, in any way, be modified by Customs, the onus is entirely upon the applicant to ensure that there are no conflicts between those narrowly described goods and local manufacture, whereas under the Act, as it has been interpreted, the Customs Service is able, by interpreting more generously the form of the application, to satisfy itself that it can assist in inquiring into the conflicts which might arise with local manufacture. The IAC report says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . where manufacturers make claims they cannot necessarily substantiate but which require the applicant to decide whether to under `an exhaustive market survey' to prove his case. </PARA>
<PARA> Placing the onus of proof on the applicant for a concession was part of the original design of the CTCO's and was intended to facilitate administration of the scheme. However, experience has shown that this can create difficulties, as local manufacturers who object to a proposed CTCO are often reluctant for commercial reasons to divulge much more than the fact of their objection to the applicant. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, the operation of the law as it is, as interpreted in the Corinthian Industries decision, would place very considerable impediments in the way of importers, who would have to obtain all the information themselves and draw their application sufficiently narrowly so that it did not fall foul due to potential conflict with potential Australian manufacturers. One wonders whether the Opposition, in its proposed amendments, is seeking to protect more broadly Australian industry-something that would surprise me somewhat-or whether it is trying to do the reverse of that and to allow a wider range of goods to come in. If it is the latter, I think it must realise that the amendments which it is proposing put a very considerable potential hurdle in the way of those who would import goods under the commercial tariff concession system. </PARA>
<PARA> I outline those matters to indicate the difficulties which bedevil this Bill and the way in which, through a court interpretation, a procedure that has stood in place for a number of years has come to be threatened, and in which the Government is seeking, through amendment, to restore to the Act those conditions which were believed to apply to that Act but which had been found, through that court decision, not to apply. I think this piece of legislation is one which has considerable difficulties associated with it. We will be very interested to hear further debate from both the Opposition and the Government in the committee stage of this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak on the Bounty (Photographic Film) Bill 1989 first, which is the Bill that has generated the most discussion. I think it is fair to put the debate in its true perspective. I suggest that maybe Senator Coulter is the only speaker in the Senate who has, in fact, done that. We are talking about a major exporter and manufacturer in Australia with world wide operations; about implications to revenue, to industry, and to employment in this country; and about laying the foundations for an expanded industry in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the point was made that it is very easy to look at all these issues that come before the Senate in an ideological fix, in an ideological frame, but in reality what is involved is the future of Australia's second largest exporter of elaborately transformed manufactures. It is an operation that already contains a major research and development and manufacturing and distribution capability employing some 1,500 people. For 1989, Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd forecast that of its total sales of $472m, exports of $164m would be generated, so we are also talking of implications in terms of the wider economy. The point has been made: why, in view of the fact that the company here is operating so well, has the Australian operation been chosen for closure. The second reading speech has already traversed these arguments quite well, but it needs to be stated that Kodak in Australia was not targeted for closure for the reason of efficiency. It was chosen very much because of strategic company operations worldwide. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already mentioned briefly the costs and benefits of the implications of this legislation. I will go through them very briefly because we do not have that much time. If one looks at exports and compares the figures for exports if the plant were to close with those after the bounty, one sees that over the years 1990-94 in 1989 dollars we are talking of a net benefit of $1 billion. In terms of company tax over that period we are talking of a net benefit of $120m. In terms of wages to employees we are talking of a net benefit of $155m, and 970 jobs. Our balance of payments is positive by $100m over five years. Closure of the operation would turn that positive balance into a negative one of $1.3 billion over five years. Whereas on the one hand governments-State and Federal-are putting in in the vicinity of 442m, the benefits from this injection of funds to society, to revenue and to the balance of payments cannot be underestimated. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not an unconditional bounty. Senator Coulter went through some of the conditions involved. Basically, we are talking about a money-back guarantee. We are talking about a commitment which would involve a significant contribution in terms of increased productivity in an area where it must be acknowledged we have a most efficient operation. We are talking about a significant contribution in terms of jobs. In terms of those conditions agreed to by Kodak and the Government we are also talking about a very clear intention to enhance Kodak's operations not only within Australia but within our region. We are leading towards the development between the Government and Kodak of a photographic industry development agreement containing a detailed work program for research and development and investments. Obviously the Senate should take that into account when looking at all the implications of what is involved. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, we are talking about a money-back guarantee, the bottom line of which, in the Government's view, will allow, facilitate, support and enable the company to complete its restructuring satisfactorily, expand its export base substantially and enhance its research and development capabilities. It is easy for honourable senators to come in here in an ideologically fixed frame of mind and complain about what the Government is doing, but in view of the decision's impact on the immediate society and community and its wider economic implications, it will go down as a good one. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also very easy to come in here with an ideological fix and criticise the decision when so much of what is argued against it is based on ignorance and a lack of willingness to understand the truth. Senator Short, for instance, said that the Government is acting illegally as there is a prohibition in the Industries Assistance Commission Act on ministerial action without an IAC reference. This legislation is an acknowledgment of the role that Parliament has, that parliamentary action can change the legal framework in which these decisions are made. That is precisely what is happening here. We are not talking about any illegal action; we are talking about the Parliament acting in response to a real life situation. </PARA>
<PARA> We were asked why the reference was not sent to the Industries Assistance Commission in Accordance with the IAC Act. In this case, we have a couple of very specifically peculiar problems related to the issue in question. When faced with an overnight closure, governments need to respond very quickly. That is what happened in this place. By injecting funds, the Government was able to obtain a number of performance guarantees, a number of conditions for the future operation of the company involved. In that case, obviously, we need to respond with flexibility. That is precisely why we have taken this approach. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other arguments were raised in the context of the debate. One of the pitfalls of the Senate is that much of the debate that take place here can be anticipated if one reads the Hansard record of the debate in the House of Representatives. The point raised by Senator Panizza about transfer pricing and so-called opportunity for export to China which was made available to Kodak were answered in the debate in the House of Representatives. In respect of the first point, it was very clearly canvassed in the other place-and here we are talking about assistance for activities for which much of the raw material involved was purchased from Australia companies with very minor opportunity for significant cash transfers by way of a transfer price system. In terms of his second point, it should be recognised that, as was explained in the House of Representatives, the approach made offering this $1.2m export order came from an unreliable source, one that is still being followed up. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think I need to go into the other Bills which are listed as part of the cognate debate. I summarise by saying that in this particular circumstance we have a decision which, despite the cynical response which has permeated not only the Opposition but much of the media in this country, by its immediate and long-term financial implications and creation of opportunities is a good one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A few weeks ago I raised in the Senate the question of the behaviour of the Headmistresses Association of the Independent Girls Schools in Victoria concerning the sale of a very valuable property, Invergowrie, which was given to them nearly 50 years ago. I hoped then that the headmistresses would see their way to using the property for a purpose which would have been approved by the donors, rather than taking the money from the sale and using it for their own purposes. These hopes have been dashed. The property has been sold, and the Headmistresses Association has pocketed the money. The Headmistresses Association is very much richer, but the community is much poorer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The headmistresses were given Invergowrie by the McPherson family, and here to make clear the points I intend to make I shall have to repeat some of the background information I gave to the Senate last time I spoke. The McPherson family have been remarkable benefactors of education in Victoria. They gave the Emily McPherson College of Domestic Economy, the Engineering School at Swinburne Institute of Technology and, in a different field, the Jessie McPherson Wing of the Queen Victoria Hospital. My particular concern is what is happening to the donation they made of their family home, Invergowrie, an historic building in the inner Melbourne suburb of Hawthorn, to the Headmistresses of the Independent Girls Schools. This gift was made, nearly fifty years ago, partly so the headmistresses could run a homecraft hostel, designed to fill a large gap in the education system as it then was, that is, teaching girls to run homes economically, but more importantly to preserve the historic Invergowrie homestead. </PARA>
<PARA> The house itself was built in 1846, and is by any standards one of the most important historic buildings in Victoria. It was, for instance, the site of the signing of the Deed of Separation of Victoria from New South Wales. Even more important are its nearly three acres of park-like surroundings including a tree which is a remarkable Aboriginal relic, because from this tree we can clearly see where the Aborigines carved out a canoe. By any standards the preservation of this historic building and surroundings should be of great importance to the entire Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> Here I should reveal a personal interest. My wife was a McPherson, the daughter of one of the donors of Invergowrie. This has, of course, the advantage that I am well informed about what went on, and what the family intentions were. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be accepted that the concept of a homecraft hostel, teaching girls how to run homes, is no longer viable. Girls who until the 1970s would have attended Invergowrie now go to university, though whether or not they learn more there how to run households efficiently could be a matter of dispute. Whatever one feels about that, the fact is that people are no longer going to come to a homecraft hostel to be taught how to run a home. </PARA>
<PARA> But that is not the end of the matter. The crucial question is whether the headmistresses held the property in trust, and if so, was it a moral or a legal trust? Representatives of the headmistresses have repeatedly stated, in speeches and in writing, that the property was held in legal trust. For instance, the headmistresses own published history of Invergowrie, written by Miss Daniels, the Headmistress of Ruyton, one of the independent girls schools, referred to the gift as being in perpetual trust to the youth of Victoria, and their solicitors repeatedly stated, in writing, that the property was held in trust. When the matter came before the court, they changed their minds and said that they had made a mistake and there was no legal trust. As Mandy Rice-Davies said in the Profumo case, `They would say that, wouldn't they?'. </PARA>
<PARA> About a month ago the Victorian Supreme Court decided that there was insufficient evidence that there was, in fact, a legal trust. The main reasons for this judgment seem to be that much of the available evidence about the trust was not presented to the Court by the Victorian Attorney-General, for technical legal reasons, and many of the contemporary documents which dealt with the nature of the trust, and which were held at Invergowrie itself, have disappeared. One cannot help wondering if someone's shredder was working overtime. But if there is no legal trust, surely there must be, on the headmistresses own admission, a moral trust. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, a decision having been made by the court that the property legally belonged to the headmistresses, they tried to sell it quickly, boasting that it was to be sold without any restrictive covenants. Some trustees of an historic property the headmistresses turned out to be! How quickly they were able to forget about its being held in perpetual trust to the youth of Victoria. At the auction, the headmistresses could not get their reserve price, but they have since sold it for $5.5m. This price, although in the present unsettled property market well below its real value, was substantially higher than the price they could have expected if they had put proper covenants on it to preserve it. Worse still, I understand the purchasers intend to use it for office accommodation, which will destroy its character. Some trustees the headmistresses turned out to be! The only hope now is the Hawthorn Council, which is better than most councils in the protection of historic sites. Throughout all this saga one could see the bright glint of dollar signs in the eyes of the headmistresses. The money goes to the Headmistresses Association. There is no trust. What is the money to be used for-overseas, so-called `study' trips for headmistresses, or scholarships for their own schools? Neither of these would ever have been contemplated by the donors. </PARA>
<PARA> The headmistresses have consistently refused, in any serious way, to consider alternative uses for the property which would have been compatible with the inclinations of the donors. They left all the arrangements to a single headmistress who was both obstinate and uncooperative. Nevertheless the headmistresses as a whole must take responsibility for the behaviour of their agent. What they really wanted was no trouble and lots of money. They always pretended to be interested in alternative uses, but in practice they raised insuperable barriers. For instance, they refused to give plans of the property, refused access to it, and refused to give any information about the running costs. They pretended cooperation but in fact were totally obstructive. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give honourable senators an example: the concept of Invergowrie being used as a centre for music performance. A proposal to this effect was put to the headmistresses on 3 November, and 11 days later a reply was received from the headmistresses' solicitors saying that the headmistresses were impressed by the principal aims stated in the paper. They went on to raise a series of questions which were quite legitimate, such as town planning constraints, Historic Building Act restrictions, upgrading of buildings, and finished by saying that, in their words, to be persuaded to withdraw Invergowrie from sale the headmistresses would need to have before them a properly costed plan for a use acceptable to them and consistent with their objects. They would need to be assured that money was available to implement the plan, and that the constraints on the use of Invergowrie would be overcome. </PARA>
<PARA> The Music Centre Development Committee worked hard, and I think effectively, to answer the headmistresses' problems, only to be told on 24 November that the headmistresses were not prepared to adopt the proposal. It is quite clear that what they wanted, and what they have always wanted, was the money. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether the Headmistresses Association has a motto, but if it does not, perhaps I could suggest one, `Greed is Good'; as a gesture to their academic pretensions, I will give it to them in Latin, `avaritia bona est'. </PARA>
<PARA> I have watched this saga developing, and I think the behaviour of the headmistresses has been contemptible. As I said a moment ago, greed seems to be their dominant characteristic. So I can give one piece of advice to anyone who might be contemplating making a donation or bequest of any description to the Head Mistresses Association of the Independent Girls Schools in Victoria. That advice is `don't'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the latter part of July and in early August of this year I briefly visited Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Vientiane and Hanoi, and spent nearly a week in Pakistan. My trip, which was excellently assisted by officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, was designed in each case to allow me to meet with women parliamentarians, members of non-governmental women's organisations and, where possible, to visit projects associated with Australian aid which are of particular relevance to women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In each of the six countries, the Australian mission had sensibly used my visit to make contact with leading women with whom it had previously little or no pressing reason to meet. The Indonesian Minister for Women's Affairs, for example, was delighted to discuss, for the first time, matters of mutual concern to women of her country and to Australia, and the response to my visit was equally warm and productive in each of the countries. We share a concern for the education and training of women, in order that they may become self-sufficient, or contribute to their household incomes, and perhaps even more importantly to expand the literacy without which women are unlikely to acquire the knowledge and capacity to enhance their own health and that of their children, and to control their own fertility. </PARA>
<PARA> Women who live in cities are much more likely to have access to education, public education campaigns and services, as is the case in Australia, where our remote communities are in some respects as difficult to reach as the scattered islands of Indonesia, the mountainous areas of Malaysia or the rural villages of Laos and Vietnam, where the roads are regularly washed out by torrential rains. The secluded women of rural Pakistan are in another category altogether-unimaginably isolated by custom as well as by geography. </PARA>
<PARA> In many countries, including those that I visited, domestic violence is recognised now as crime against the community and Australian initiatives to raise public awareness of the great cost in human and economic terms attracted considerable interest. Our structural arrangements, which have entrenched the status of women as a primary concern of government, also met with keen interest, and I have arranged for all the publications of our Office of the Status of Women, and its Consultative Council, to be sent to the relevant Ministers in each of the countries that I visited. Since my return, I have received a request from a group of women lawyers in Lahore through the Australian High Commission in Pakistan, for advice about how to set up refuges for battered women. This has resulted in an extensive exercise being undertaken by my electorate secretary and the coordinator of a nearby refuge who are combining the essence of a wide search of the literature and practical experience for the benefit of Pakistani women. I thoroughly recommend a Canadian publication in this regard entitled Battered But Not Beaten. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that we can build on such links, learn from each other and, working closely with non-government organisations, develop an ever widening network of projects, backed up where appropriate with government services, or vice versa in Thailand, where I met with the Minister for Women's Affairs, Supatra Masdit. There is a very effective family planning program, in the course of which the use of condoms has become highly accepted, and the better education of women is also clearly a factor in control of population growth, and the capacity of women to participate in the very rapid growth in the economy of Thailand as a result of the investment of overseas capital in large amounts. One of my new Indonesian friends, a woman who manufactures clothing and cosmetics, believes that there is a simple answer to population problems, `Give the woman a job', she says, waving an elegant finger, and of course, she is correct, except that there are a number of prerequisites, like transport, child-care training and basic literacy. </PARA>
<PARA> In Laos and Vietnam the womens unions are part of the official structures, and their respective presidents are given additional status by being delegates to their parliaments. Literacy is still a problem for women in Laos, as is the delivery of health and family spacing advice, and of quite basic services. The cadre system of organisation, however, is very effective, and I was very impressed by the commitment of the union women, and their newly elected government Ministers who clearly recognise the value of enhancing the lives of Laotian women. As in many countries-not only those shattered by war economically and in many other ways-there is a serious shortage of nurses and other health workers. There is a real challenge, as in Australia, to train locally respected people, building on their traditional skills, and encouraging the retention of elements of, for example, birthing practices which are of advantage to the mother and child, while educating women about the dangers of other traditional practices. One of them was commented on yesterday at the United Nations Children's Fund meeting, that is, dressing the umbilical cord with dung, often resulting in infant death from tetanus. </PARA>
<PARA> In Vietnam, where literacy among men and women is not such a limiting factor and is said to be about 85 per cent, the Women's Union is also very active and well organised, partly funded by its own publishing house. Currently it has a campaign under way to encourage each Vietnamese woman to, `Grow a tree, keep an animal, and learn a skill'. Mrs Than, President of the Union, kindly arranged, in conjunction with our mission in Hanoi, a day trip for me to see the activities of a branch of her Union in the Thai Binh province where, with aid from Australia, funds had been provided for three fine pigs for the teaching of animal husbandry, and for a number of sewing machines, in use for some months now as the local women learned to make clothes for themselves and their children. </PARA>
<PARA> Other aid measures by Australia to Vietnam include the setting up of a condom factory, and the supply of large quantities of Australian tree seeds, which are given to the elderly village women to nurture into saplings ready for planting. As in Laos, it was apparent that the economic and social devastation of a long drawn-out war would take years to repair, and that Western nations should be, by now, accepting that they have a deep responsibility to assist such countries to rehabilitate. </PARA>
<PARA> My time in Pakistan was also well spent, thanks to a comprehensive program arranged for me by the Australian Ambassador and his staff including a meeting with the Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto, whose determination to improve the lot of the women of her country must be among the most difficult challenges faced by any national leader. As the result of a rigidly fundamentalist interpretation of Islam, which condemns women to seclusion from the time of puberty to menopause-to which time few survive-women are consigned to illiteracy, poor health, total domination by their spouses and male relatives, early and repeated pregnancies, and often early death. The phenomenon of `son preference' has horrifying consequences for girls, as, for example, clinic staff reporting that 80 per cent of the children being brought for medical attention are boys. Some work that has been done by the United Nations Committee on Traditional Practices which Harm Women and Children indicate that countries with strongest `son preference' are Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Korea. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, the previous regime in Pakistan introduced ordinances which have resulted in women being gaoled for adultery in very strange and tragic circumstances. Prime Minister Bhutto cannot repeal these ordinances without the support of her Senate, which includes only two members of her Party. She has ordered that women so imprisoned be released from gaol, but they are inevitably rejected by their families and are therefore completely without resources. At least they are being fed and sheltered in gaol. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a paper which has been sent to me by a committee appointed by the Government of Pakistan which describes the Zina Ordinances. </PARA>

<PARA>ZINA ORDINANCE</PARA>
<PARA>The Women's Legal Rights Committee has considered exhaustively the Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hadood Ordinance, VII of 1989). It is noted the Ordinance is undemocratic. It was promulgated by the Chief Martial Law Administrator having assumed the Office of President of Pakistan in pursuance of the Martial Law Proclamation 15 July 1979, read with Laws (continuance in force) order 1977. The Ordinance was the figment of few people in power interested in holding onto power. The Law was never put before any group of intellectuals or Islamists with forward looking views and it was never tested for its effaciousness (sic) by being presented, discussed in detail and candid consideration by any legislative body representing the people of Pakistan. The Law was suddenly thrust onto the people of Pakistan through the Television, Radio and Press. The people of Pakistan had nothing to do with the making of the Ordinance. The Ordinance was promulgated under false pretences namely ``circumstances exist which render it necessary to take immediate action''. In fact there were no such conditions. It was not as if the men, and women of Pakistan were increasingly committing the crime of Zina. There was no social menace of Zina. The menace of corruption, misuse of power for personal aggrandisement, unlicensed arms, drugs all were allowed to continue to make insecure, life and property in Pakistan which are inviolable is Islam. The fair name of Islam was exploited by those in power by bringing in the Ordinance on the pretext of bringing the Ordinance ``to bring in conformity with the injunctions of Islam the Law relating to the offence of Zina''. The Ordinance was part of the false stance of Islamisation. The Zina Ordinance is unIslamic in the content and spirit. It allows the long aim of the Law to harass, demean and falsely brand innocent men and women as adulters, fornicators, rapists etc. The Committee noted several reported cases of miscarriage of justice due to defective unIslamic Law. These included the cases of the blind girl, Sofia Bibi, who complained of rape but instead of punishment to the culprit she was convicted of Zina by reason of her pregnancy. There was a furore by the Women's Organisations. The Federal Sirafat Court perceiving the injustice Suo Motto ordered her release on bail on her own bond and finally acquitted. The shame and humiliations suffered by her can never be washed away. The story of Sofia Bibi has been repeated several times and several poor young helpless young innocent girls complaining of rape to the police have had to suffer the humiliation of being accused and for being falsely convicted of Zina. This possibility has become so pronounced that many women and their families prefer to desist from filing a complaint of rape and the rapist goes scot-free and continues to repeat his crime. Women have become much more vulnerable to rape over the past decade. The poor unprotected women of Pakistan suffer from a double jeopardy. Often when a woman is raped she suffers in silence or is forced to remain silent for the sake of family honour. When she finds herself pregnant she becomes liable to conviction of Zina. Can such a law be Islamic?</PARA>
<PARA> The other reported case was of Janmia, where a child of twelve was convicted of Zina because she had become pregnant. All know the vulnerability of the illiterate dependent girl-child in the family. How much does the Pakistan girl-child of twelve know to comprehend the crime if she is persuaded to willingness and what means does she have to protest or escape from being subjected to such treatment? The family is only concerned about their society only with blame and the State offers no support, but convicts. Children are the worst sufferers under the Zina Ordinance. Several children are born and live in jails all over the country awaiting trial or undergoing punishment along with their mothers. In a case reported by the Pakistan Women Lawyers Association Legal Aid Centre, a woman accused of Zina bore a child in jail. On being brought to Court the Legal Aid Centre Lawyers asked her if she would like to be released on bail and if she has any place to go to. The answer was no. On being asked what can be done for her, in tears she asked that she be allowed to see her son and daughter whom the police has snatched and given to the complainant. When the complainant was questioned about the children, he nonchalantly stated ``the children were by the previous husband and not my responsibility, the girl died and the boy is lost''. Does Islam allow such callous death and desolation of children which is perpetrated every day under the Ordinance, unsung and un-reported?</PARA>
<PARA> Many studies and interviews have clearly brought out that several men and women are accused and convicted for Zina not because they had any Mens-Rea to commit Zina but simply because are unable to produce proof of their previous divorce or present marriage. Islam bases a marriage by two adults on a proposal and acceptance, yet the law refuses to accept this Islamic precept. There are several cases where due to technical defects in the divorce proceedings such as notice to Chairman or unavailability of two witnesses, the women who have been genuinely divorced and remarried are often punished for Zina. The Islamic respect for the institutions of marriage is torn asunder. It is not unusual to accuse a person of Zina especially women in cases of enmity.</PARA>
<PARA> Several cases have come to light where the Zina Ordinance is misused for purposes of black-mail. Several women have been made to sign papers giving up their rights to children and foregoing Haq Mahers, allowing second marriages, even gifting their personal property to the husband under threat that the alternative will be a false complaint of Zina. Women are so afraid of being painted with the accusation of Zina that they often give up everything whereas for males in our society Zina is not a serious matter. Does Islam stand to dehumanise innocent women as is being done under the Zina Ordinance?</PARA>
<PARA>Custodial Rape</PARA>
<PARA>It was noted that the vast majority of women arrested by the police are those under the Zina Ordinance. On a complaint being lodged by any person against an innocent woman, the police are prone to make cursory investigations and for considerations, make out a case and arrest innocent women. The arrests are usually on Thursday to enable the police to torture, threaten, cajole and very often subject the women to sexual abuse while in lock-up. (Friday is the Holy day.)</PARA>
<PARA> Harrowing stories by women in jail of rape by policemen shakes the very basis of the Zina Ordinance. Can Islam allow a law which perpetrates custodial rape on women?</PARA>
<PARA> The Zina Ordinance has injured the image of Islam within the country in the hearts and minds of the people who have suffered through it. People were falsely led to believe that it is Islamic, all the crimes under the Ordinance are committed under the guise of Islam. Nationally and internationally the name of Islam is being coupled with this psuedo-Islamic law, leading people to the misconception that Islamic law is inhuman. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted that several authorities have been concerned with resultant in-humanities resulting by convictions, under the law. Mr Justice Muhammad Afzal-Zullah, Judge of Shariat Bench of the Supreme Court-was quoted to have said that the Supreme Court had required the jail authorities to submit before it petitions for appeals by all women convicted under the Zina Ordinance and in several cases bail was granted on personal bond to women prisoners. (PLD 1989, Journal Section, ``Legal Aid Services''). Justice Dr Javed Iqbal (PLD 1988, page 198 ``Crimes Against Women'' Journal Section) has quoted several examples of the misuse of the provisions of the Zina Ordinance in his experience as a judge. ``In Multan a women, sought refuge with her sister in order to escape the physical cruelty of her husband and filed a suit for dissolution of marriage against him. The husband filed a complaint that she was committing Zina with her brother-in-law, on the basis of which they were both arrested. In view of the circumstances I released them on bail''. </PARA>
<PARA> The doors of many places of refuge have been closed to women due to the Zina Ordinance. The bashed wife, the abused daughter or daughter-in-law sexually violated sister are afraid and unable to seek refuge with family or friends for fear of being accused under the Zina Ordinance. Does Islam advocate such degradation of women?</PARA>
<PARA> Dr Javed Iqbal recounts ``Rabimyar Khaf a sixty year old man and his sixteen year old daughter-in-law were arrested on the charge of Zina because they refused to grease the palms of police patrol at the railway station. They had arrived in Rabim Tar Khan from Karachi at midnight after seeing off the girl's husband. They were forced to spend the night in the waiting room as there was no transport available to their village at that time. They were released on bail after spending twelve days in confinement. Those cases can be multiplied manifold. Several middle aged couples have been arrested by the police to produce their nikah names and allowed to go only after payment. Does the law of Islam require every married couple to carry the nikah with them? Does the law of Islam prohibit the daughter-in-law travelling with her father-in law?'' The Zina Ordinance states this question in Pakistan. It is the product of prejudiced biased unhealthy minds obsessed with sex. Islam allows conviction for Zina only on the evidence of four witnesses, but the Zina Ordinance makes it incumbent on the judge to award punishment even in the eye of witnesses. The male often goes free on the basis of benefit of doubt but the woman who has become pregnant even by valid marriage stands convicted. The Quranic ayat 2,4,5 and 13 of Surah a Al-Noor relate to the offence of Zina and prescribe the number of witnesses to prove this charge. In Ayat 15 it is explicitly mentioned that in case of failure to produce four witnesses by the prosecution the witnesses who might have appeared are liars in the eyes of Allah. Yet sadder the Zina Ordinance on the evidence of a complainant who is characterised as liar, (not having produced four witnesses) an innocent man or woman can be convicted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Shariat (PLD 1989, p. . . . 5) in a recently decided petition has given the finding that in the present day circumstances accusations and complainants are made without giving due consideration. The words commission of Zina are used despite the fact that the required evidence is not available and even where the contents of the complaint do so point to the commission of Zina. </PARA>
<PARA> This finding by a full bench of the Federal Shariat Court supports the contention of unfounded allegations of Zina. Numerous instances abound of false complaints of Zina which have been taken cognizance of and prosecuted by the police bringing shame and disrepute to women, which makes them miserable for the rest of their lives. Can Islam be designed to perpetrate such misery?</PARA>
<PARA> In a society where witnesses can be bought, where police are most powerful and where false cases can be easily instituted can this Zina Ordinance be supported on the basis of Islam? The Quranic requirement of truthful unbiased weightiness are more often impossible to find, can the Ordinance be said to have provided Quranic justice to the people of Pakistan?</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Shariat Court having realised the large scale of false evidence in Court going unpunished has in the said judgement recommended amendments so that false witnesses may be punished under the Qazf Ordinances. The present practice is for liars to go unpunished. No amendment in the Qazf Law can possibly protect the people of Pakistan from the unIslamic defective Zina Ordinance. It is incompatible with Human Rights and Kidati Fundamental Rights granted under the Constitution of Pakistan. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a strong demand from the Human Rights groups and activists, women's Organisations and Welfare Organisations all over Pakistan to repeal the Zina Ordinance which is a Crime against the Women of Pakistan. It is incompatible with Human Rights. </PARA>
<PARA> It is noted by the Committee that there is nothing in the Eight Amendment which precludes the Government from bringing about the repeal of the Zina Ordinance by the Parliament. All that the Eight Amendment requires is the permission of the President of Pakistan for each repeal. The Committee having documented the above injustices, illegality, unIslamic, results in equities and terror on women under this Ordinance, hopes that no one will stand in the way of its repeal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee strongly recommends that in view of the foresaid evidence demonstrating the unIslamic, unjust, undemocratic, defective, inhuman nature of the Ordinance, this Government should take immediate steps to repeal the Offence of Zina (enforcement of Hadood) Ordinance VII of 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> The law should be reverted to as it stood before the Ordinance. The unruled Sections 366, 372, 373, 375 and 376 of Chapter VI and Section 493, 497 and . . . 1866). </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion it is noted that the Ordinance has not in any manner diminished the incidence of Zina. Prostitution, rape, kidnapping, abduction, killing of women, enticing away women or any other related crimes against women. On the contrary the Zina Ordinance has lowered the regard and respect for women in our country. The Ordinance is among the reasons for the rising incidence of crimes against women which has been accentuated by the sexist attitude against women recently evident by the rise tide of crimes against women especially rape and custodial rape. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also noted that the psuedo-Islamic Zina Ordinance has affected the concept of Islamic equity and justice in the eyes of the international community under its inhuman consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendation for repeal of the Zina Ordinance is supported by all the following members of the Committee who attended the meeting/discussing on the subject:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Chairperson-Mrs Raahida Patel, Karachi. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The strong and forceful Minister for Women's Development has established committees of talented, educated women who are working on plans to provide legal aid and shelter for such women. I met with women who are members of an organisation called the Womens Action Forum which interestingly was based-since its inception in 1981 in Pakistan-on the Australian Women's Electoral Lobby. This is a progressive group dedicated to reform of Pakistan's oppressive laws and attitudes to women. Such educated women defend Islam as a flexible and compassionate religion, but bitterly condemn the ways in which it has been interpreted to oppress the women of Pakistan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Ambassador Mr Geoffrey Price-he is now the High Commissioner-took Mrs Price and me with him on an overnight trip to Peshawar. We drove up the Grand Trunk Road between rows of Australian eucalypt and callistemons in order that I might see work being done among the refugee women who are part of the 2.5 million refugees who cannot yet return to Afghanistan. At Peshawar, I met members of an Australian army engineers team who are teaching the refugees how to recognise and defuse mines, a little known or recognised contribution being made towards the rehabilitation of these refugees. We were dressed in our shalwa kemeeze and large shawls to conform with national standards of modesty. The only women seen on the street were wearing the burka, a tent-like garment which completely shrouds the wearer, and provides her with a little drawn thread work through which to see. </PARA>
<PARA> We were very interested to see a camp for Afghan widows, walled in as is the custom, of course. They were being encouraged to use and develop their traditional sewing and quilting skills, in order to be able to generate some income. The most delightful aspect of this particular camp was that the little daughters of the windows were being educated. Of the 150 schools for refugee children, only two are for girls. In this case, the daily issues of milk, vitamin A enriched, was ready for collection after the classes, so the bright eyed, clear skinned little girls came to the classes equipped with bowls and basins and collected also a little learning which would otherwise have been denied them. In response to questioning they told me that yes, they did tell their mothers about the classes and yes, they did pass onto their mothers the learning that they were receiving so that on the return to Afghanistan I think there will be some changes in some of the remote villages. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I say how very grateful I am to each of the six missions which helped to organise my trip and which, I believe, helped me to make good use of the time from their point of view and from mine. I sincerely hope and expect that out of the contacts we made there will be some intelligent use of the information that we are now able to exchange more freely and that this, in the long run, will be of benefit to women in a number of countries. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Tasmania)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(1.08)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Giles is to be congratulated on the valuable work that she has been doing, as revealed in a most moving address to the Senate about uplifting the status and role of women in depressed countries. It has been brought to my attention, Mr President, that whilst the Australian Government has, over the last five years, changed the Australian taxation legislation with an alleged view to making the system fairer and more equitable, there are cases where the reverse has happened. In fact, the whole system of overseas income is hardly in the interest of either Australian corporations or individuals operating abroad. Today my mission is not so much to examine the problems of corporations but rather a specific group called the Australian Volunteer Development Workers. These people are generally employed for two years in developing countries as part of the Australian Volunteers Abroad (AVA) program. On returning to Australia they faced taxation bills in the order of thousands of dollars from the Australian Taxation Office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The tax changes were designed to catch entrepreneurs who shift profits overseas into tax havens. For some they are tax havens but for others they are countries to which Australian volunteers provide much needed voluntary technical assistance. While some Australian volunteers pay income tax in their country of employment, others are not subject to such a levy and therefore must pay income tax to the Australian Government on the money earned overseas.</PARA>
<PARA> If the overseas income is subject to tax in the overseas country it is considered as exempt income for Australian taxation purposes and will not therefore be subject to double taxation in Australia. This exempt overseas income must, however, be included in the Australian taxation return and acts to `gross-up' any Australian income, therefore making the Australian income subject to the higher marginal rates of tax applicable in Australia. While this system might seem fair, it must be remembered that Australian volunteers, during their assignments overseas, merely receive a local salary with which to purchase food, equipment and medicines which are often sold to them at greatly inflated prices, due at times to a high level of consumption tax which operate in those countries. Such taxes do not affect the entrepreneur who does not live in a tax haven, let alone endeavour to exist on a local salary. </PARA>
<PARA> To quantify the effect that the foreign tax credits system is having on Australian volunteers, I offer three examples: in the Cook Islands a volunteer on local salary of $A11,000 pays local tax at a rate of 24.4 per cent which is equivalent to $A2,684. In Australia a person on the same salary would pay tax of $1,553, therefore the volunteer pays $1,131 more in overseas tax than would apply in Australia. If, while serving overseas, the volunteer had Australian income-such as bank interest, home rental-of $5,000 he is then subject to a further tax bill in Australia of $1,370 which represents a tax rate of 27.4 per cent. This is because the exempt overseas income of $11,000 is used to `gross-up' the Australian income of $5,000 so that the volunteer pays Australian tax on this $5,000 at the marginal rate that applies to the $11,000 to $16,000 bracket. Another volunteer in Vanuatu, receiving $11,000 while paying no income tax in that country, is nevertheless subject to a very high level of indirect tax on food, medicines and other essential household goods. However, for Australian taxation purpose, this income is treated as not having been taxed at all, and therefore the volunteer suffers Australian tax on the full $A11,000 on an amount over $1,400. </PARA>
<PARA> While Vanuatu is considered a tax haven country for companies which pay little or no company tax on profits, the foreign tax credits system discriminates against Australian volunteers who live there, and of course they have to pay a high level of consumption tax. A third volunteer in Botswana earning $A11,000 would pay tax in that country of approximately $1,100. This overseas income would be considered exempt for Australia tax purposes. However, the same situation as the Cook Island example applies when Australian income is earned; that is, if $5,000 Australian income is earned it is taxed at a rate of 27.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 23ag-that is, the general exemptions provision of the Income Tax Assessment Act-does exempt from Australian tax income earned overseas that is subject to overseas projects. An approved overseas project is typically one which meets certain criteria that focus on the project's commercial benefit to Australia. The Overseas Service Bureau which administers the Australian Volunteers Abroad project has been advised by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce that the AVA program would not be able to gain a blanket exemption as an approved overseas project under section 23af. This is regrettable. </PARA>
<PARA> In individual cases, however, some volunteers may be able to satisfy the criteria laid down for approval to be granted, although this is not clear and would only provide relief for a very small number of volunteers and would not be granted without going through an horrendous appeals process. </PARA>
<PARA> In light of the above it is requested that, firstly, the Federal Government provide a mechanism whereby the income earned by volunteers as a result of their work overseas as part of the Australian Volunteers Abroad program be classified as exempt income under section 23 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. That would not be difficult because there are other classes which fall into this category if they are considered of commercial benefit to Australia. Perhaps Senator Gareth Evans should look at this closely. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, any other income earned by volunteers which is not classified as exempt under my first example, should be taxed at the rates that apply to Australians earning income solely in Australia so that they are not penalised as a result of their volunteer work abroad. This means that their Australian based income is not `grossed-up' by their exempt income. Again, this is a perfectly reasonable request. After all we are not asking for millions of dollars from the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the Federal Government should provide a mechanism whereby volunteers, whose sole income is earned overseas, are not required to lodge an Australian tax return until the end of the financial year following the completion of their term overseas. I understand that in June this year the Overseas Service Bureau requested that the Australian Government recognise the contribution made by the Australian volunteer development workers and provide the necessary mechanisms to overcome this additional onerous tax burden. Up to date no reply to this request had been received by the Overseas Service Bureau. Therefore, I take this opportunity now of drawing the Government's attention to this situation and calling upon it to give its immediate consideration. I ask for urgent action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the trials and tribulations of the job we occupy as senators and representatives of our States is that from time to time we receive numbers of letters from constituents and organisations. Sometimes those letters are particularly rude and offensive, and usually they are conveyed-certainly this is the case in my office-immediately to the rubbish bin. Last week I received one such letter which not only was highly offensive personally but also was highly impertinent. The amazing thing about it is that it actually came from an honourable senator who serves in this House. Senator Jean Jenkins, the Australian Democrat senator from Western Australia, wrote to me on 28 November 1989. She opened her letter by indicating how pleased she was to hear, when I spoke in the Senate some weeks ago, that I was one of the success stories in relation to epidural injections for back pain. I thank Senator Jenkins for her concern on the matter. At that time I was seeking to put the record straight and to indicate that this form of treatment did benefit some individuals, contrary to the views being expressed in this place and in the media throughout Western Australia. Senator Jenkins went on:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>My impression from two years of research on this issue is that you are one of a fortunate few and you probably should thank your lucky stars. Until your comments and those of Senator Knowles, I had heard from just five individuals who claimed to have derived significant benefit from the procedure-one of whom was a doctor reporting that one of his patients had been helped. On the other side of the ledger I am now in touch with well over a hundred people who claim to have experienced adverse reactions to epidural Depo-Medrol. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly agree with Senator Knowles on that, but I do not agree with the comments Senator Jenkins made in the paragraph I have just quoted from. The reality of the situation is that, like me, Senator Jenkins is not qualified in medicine. I am not going to put down the medical opinion. The reality of it is that Senator Jenkins actively went out and solicited opinions from people who suffered ill effects from this form of treatment. She did not ask any of the tens of thousands of people who have received this treatment over a period to proffer their views. Not unnaturally, because there are people who have been hurt and have suffered adverse reactions, she heard from them but she did not hear from the ones who benefited. She then demands that the treatment ought to be stopped.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am one of the lucky ones, although I am unlucky in the sense that I have a spinal injury which requires treatment from time to time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge Senator Knowles's interjection. The treatment provided me with a significant amount of pain relief, which I needed at the time. In my irregular visits to doctors and hospitals, both public and private, over a number of years I have come in contact with a number of other patients receiving this treatment, the vast majority of whom got benefit from the medical procedure administered. I continue from Senator Jenkins's letter:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> You may or may not be aware that Mr Tony Cook-</PARA>
<PARA>that is incorrectly spelt-</PARA>
<PARA>of the TLC in WA is very concerned about these injections and the fact that many injured workers in WA have been pressured into having them by the threat of withdrawal of workers' compensation benefits. Some were incapacitated by the treatment and are now invalid pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA>I know Tony Cooke very well. Tony was actually compensation officer with the Trades and Labour Council whilst I was going through a compensation settlement and was aware of the treatment I was receiving at that time. I am also aware that from time to time individual patients are pressured to undertake procedures but, again, I do not have medical knowledge and cannot comment on specific cases. I have been talking to Mr Cooke about these matters and will again. Senator Jenkins's letter goes on, and this is where I think it becomes not only impertinent but, as Senator Knowles said in an earlier interjection, downright rude:</PARA>
<PARA> In order to make sure that we are not talking of different treatments, could I ask whether you have checked with your doctors and are in a position to state unequivocally that your injections were epidural injections of methylprednisolone acetate (Depo-Medrol)?</PARA>
<PARA> If epidural Depo-Medrol is confirmed, I would also be interested to know the answers to the following questions:</PARA>
<PARA>Then we get six questions, the first of which asks: how many injections did you receive? We are talking about my health, my treatment with my individual doctor, and it is nobody's damned business how many injections I had. I really think it is impertinent for the honourable senator to put this in writing to me. I have no problems about talking individually to any honourable senator about my medical treatment, as we are all prone to do from time to time. Honourable senators would be surprised by the number of people around Australia who have neck injuries. We all swap tales, do we not, Senator Newman? There are six questions in all Senator Jenkins asks about the intervals between the injections, whether the doctor informed me that Depo-Medrol was involved, and so on.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A couple of weeks ago a report was tabled in the Senate by the parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Public Works. It was a report on the `Defence Housing Authority Housing Developments at Randwick, Holsworthy and East Hills, Sydney'. At the time I was unable to speak on this report and yet, as honourable senators would know, the housing of Defence Force families is a matter that has been dear to my heart ever since I became a senator and I would not wish the opportunity to pass without making some comments on this report and the work of the Defence Housing Authority generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the report sets out, the Defence Housing Authority has a portfolio of about 23,000 houses and a current housing investment program in excess of $100m per annum. Back in 1986 we all recall that the Government gave a commitment that over the following 10 years it would introduce $750m to the program for defence housing. The need was that 60 per cent of defence housing had been classified by the Department of Defence as being substandard. At the time we had service families living in houses without hot water systems or with shared laundries in the case of flats. That was not something which this Government could be particularly blamed for. It was certainly something that had accumulated over the years. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem lay particularly at the door of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement which had meant that the ownership of many of the Defence Force houses remained with the States and had had inadequate maintenance over many years despite all sorts of attempts to improve the system. I commended the Government at the time for introducing the Defence Housing Authority as a statutory body to improve the housing of our Defence Force families. </PARA>
<PARA> I have noticed of recent times however that the current Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons) is claiming that his Government is putting $1 billion into Defence Force housing. I would like to put on the record that this is a very careless use of figures. What has happened is that the commitment of $750m a year has not been increased. In fact the $750m, not per year but over 10 years originally, was understood to be by way of grant. When the fine print was finally settled it turned out that this $750m was to be by way of loan. That in itself is bad enough but what the Minister is now talking about in terms of $1 billion, in fact, is the right which has been given to the company to go out into the commercial market and borrow money up to that amount. So it is, I believe, a rather careless or wilful misuse of financial figures and is designed to be misleading. </PARA>
<PARA> But putting that to one side I am glad to see that also the Government has introduced a proposal which I have been pushing ever since I came into the Senate, that is, to copy some overseas Defence Force housing arrangements whereby a housing authority can rent from the private sector and sublet to the defence forces. This has been an excellent way, in some countries, of helping the taxpayer from having to provide too many of these houses out of capital grants but to subsidise the rental, if you like, of houses which are provided by the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> At last, from 1 November this year, the Defence Housing Authority will commence to progressively take over the housing function which was provided until now by the temporary rental allowance. That is, where there are insufficient defence married quarters, service men and women with families are entitled to go into the private sector and search for a house and eventually, after a great deal of bureaucratic measures, they can get some assistance with the rental and can finalise a lease. Unfortunately, however, being very much a bureaucratic process, the amount of the rental subsidy has never been up to date in terms of the current rental market. Some areas in Australia have not been surveyed for a rental subsidy increase since 1986, and we all know what changes have occurred in the cost of housing between 1986 and 1989. It has meant that servicemen have been in a very disadvantaged position in trying to find quarters in some of the more difficult areas in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The handing over of this area to the Defence Housing Authority will mean that servicemen will in decreasing numbers be required to go out and find a private rental themselves. They will be able to go straight to the Defence Housing Authority and be subtenants of the Authority in private homes that are leased by the Authority. The report talks in clause 21 about the implementation of the new arrangements, which can be expected to result in the Defence Housing Authority providing approximately 4,500 houses throughout Australia through leasing over the next three to four years. The report also says that 3,750 additional houses will need to be acquired over the next five years because there is such a shortage of houses available to Defence Force personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things the Housing Authority is doing to solve that problem, and I have seen a number of these houses myself, is go out and spot-purchase houses on the private market. Some of the housing that has been bought is of an excellent standard, and I am very glad to be able to commend the Authority on the quality of housing it is buying for our personnel. I remind honourable senators that these are not people who are at the bottom of the pecking order in this country; these are people who are very precious to us. They are people who have many skills. They are people who have had an enormous amount of taxpayers' money invested in their training and it is cost effective to keep them. One of the most important retention measures is to house them properly in housing that recognises their importance to us. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to speak specifically to some of the items in this report. The defence forces have been looking for some time now at the possibility of providing extra housing in the Sydney area, and particularly to making use of the spare land at Randwick which was Defence Force stores land. I am glad that finally the Defence Housing Authority was able to purchase six hectares of land there in June this year through public tender. The question of the purchase of this land was one I have pursued for some time through the Defence estimates; I felt that the government departments were not entering into the spirit of things because they were making it extremely difficult for the Defence Housing Authority to acquire land which was already Defence land. I am glad to say that it finally did get this land. </PARA>
<PARA> The report states that the site is well located to a number of regional, community, educational, commercial and recreational facilities. It is, but there is one terrible lack: no child-care is available to Defence Force families in that area. Defence Force people come into an area on a two- to three-year posting, put their children's names on a waiting list for child-care, and do not expect to get to the top of the list by the time they are posted somewhere else. Any development of housing in that area must provide for child-care as well. There is an urgent need for Defence Force families who are without the support of their extended families to have child-care provided for in a crowded, congested area such as that, where the existing services are under so much pressure. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter which has been raised with me by some service families relates to the Randwick development and the fact that it is going to be increased density housing. People are worried not just about whether there will be mixed play space for children but whether there will be private enclosed areas for play spaces for families. I urge the developers of the site, and it will be done in a joint development with private enterprise, to provide that sort of facility for Defence Force families in the medium density areas. I am glad to see that there is a recognition that there will be a choice of housing types for Defence families which will be consistent with community standards. It is extremely important, as I said before, that these people are entitled to standards of housing comparable with those in the community they are pledged to defend. I am glad to see that there will be a consistent quality of landscaping and streetscape development. That has been too often neglected in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also glad to see that the Defence Housing Authority will dispose of some of the smaller housing in the Holsworthy village. All those things are important. I draw attention to the fact that future development in the Holsworthy village will mean that not only will there be a subdivision in Holsworthy, there will also be a shopping complex containing a group of shops, a bistro, a community centre and two cinemas. Long-day care centres will also be established in the village on land provided by the Commonwealth. There is also talk of a service station. The background to this is that it is meant to be a joint venture. Private enterprise is meant to be involved. There is a developer keen to get on, and the Government is dragging its feet in a most appalling fashion. This community centre and associated public works have been going on for too long; it is totally unsatisfactory. I believe that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, who knows very well that this has been so long awaited, should be condemned for the delays he has allowed to continue on that community centre which is so urgently needed. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to delay the Senate much longer, but I do point out that the Committee draws attention to the fact that holding costs for the East Hills property, which is to be developed when the environmental matters have been finalised, and they are working on those now, are at 18 per cent interest, which amounts to $20,000 a week. When we look at the development at Holsworthy that has been dragging on so long, when we look at all these developments, if there is administrative or governmental delay it is at great cost to the taxpayer. It is quite unsatisfactory for these delays to be allowed to continue. I am glad that the Committee has recommended that these projects go ahead. I simply draw attention to the fact that the Opposition's policy recognises the need for quality Defence housing. </PARA>
<PARA> Our defence science and personnel policy states that we will provide an incentive to the Defence Housing Authority to speed up the improvement of Defence housing based on the capacity of the Authority to improve its operating performance year by year. We will maintain a program for the disposal and or upgrading of remaining substandard family accommodation, with a view to raising standards for all ranks to reflect those in the community. We will maintain an efficient repair and maintenance system for married quarters. We will implement a program of management by the Defence Housing Authority of private rental houses for subletting to service personnel. In conjunction with those commitments on accommodation, we will facilitate the provision of family day care, occasional care, and long term child-care, with improved access for the children of Defence Force personnel. We will facilitate private enterprise to establish adequate shopping facilities on or adjacent to bases where such facilities are not readily available. </PARA>
<PARA> We know what needs to be done. The parliamentary inquiry into the losses in the Defence Force said that these were things that were meant to be done. The Government has started only on the first step. There is urgent need for more to be done, and until the Opposition is placed in government in this country I do not believe those steps will be taken. Nevertheless, I do wish to commend the work to date of the Defence Housing Authority. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to express my concern that once again the Australian Taxation Office is delaying, either intentionally or unintentionally, the refund of multimillions of dollars to Australian taxpayers that they have been owed since August or, at the very latest, September. The Australian Taxation Office has an obligation which it has yet again failed to meet, and that is to pay refunds promptly and properly to the many millions of Australians who pay their taxes on time and who are entitled to fair and reasonable treatment from the Tax Office. They are not getting it. In the Illawarra region, there are thousands of rebates that have not been paid, even though the tax return went in on time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> People are suffering needlessly; families are suffering needlessly in the run up to Christmas. They have not got the tax rebate on which they had been depending for not only paying such things as their huge mortgage repayments-that is as a result of this Government's high interest rate policy-but also simply to provide a decent Christmas for their kids. Last year we had this problem and the Tax Office said that it was a once-off occasion, that it was because of the tax amnesty which was diverting a lot of attention into pursuing that particular matter, rather than getting refunds out. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time I spoke in this place-in fact, on 25 November last year-complaining about the situation, reporting to the Senate a letter from the Tax Office saying, `Yes, we recognise that we are a bit behind, but we are trying to fix this up'. This, of course, is all in the context of the Tax Office having changed its system, theoretically, to speed up refunds for those people who are entitled to them, a system now which involves spot audits rather than individual pursuit of an individual examination of each tax return. It simply has not been working. I said at the time that the Tax Office and the Government had better smarten up their priorities. The priority of the Tax Office is to service taxpayers not to service this Government. The service to taxpayers involves giving taxpayers back money that this Government has been wrongly pocketing for months and months before it eventually gets around to giving the money back to the people it belongs to; that is, the taxpayers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This delay is absolutely ludicrous. I have had repeated complaints from people in my region, the Illawarra region. I will give one example. It is just a tiny tax office in a small centre. Almost all this centre's tax returns went in by the end of August or early in September. There were only 609 of them. There are 160 tax rebates still outstanding, the bulk of them from returns submitted in August. It suits the Government, of course, to have all this money on hand, the money that belongs to taxpayers. It suits the Government to have it on hand, because it diminishes the amount of interest bill the Government must pay on money it has to borrow to finance its activities. </PARA>
<PARA> So, this Government, now as a matter of course-because it did it last year-is using taxpayers money, which is due to the taxpayer, to help offset its interest bill and is saving itself money at the expense of ordinary Australians. I think that this is absolutely intolerable. As I said, 160 returns from this small office, something like one-quarter, are still outstanding after months and months. The cynicism of the Tax Office in this situation is demonstrated by the fact that another large office that I know of in my region, having received very few tax refund cheques, all of a sudden, on 6 December, started to get a burst of them. It got 103 tax refund cheques for its clients in one day, having got two, three and four or so a day over the previous couple of months. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Tax Office is capable of processing 103 tax refunds in one day for the clients of just one tax accountant in the Wollongong region, why is it delaying so many other payments? What are the Tax Office's priorities and when will it get it right? I had a look at the Tax Office's annual report to see what its priorities are, to see whether it was even acknowledging its disgraceful performance regarding tax refunds. As I said, it had an excuse, it was the tax amnesty. What is the excuse this year? Have we heard anything from the Tax Office this year? Did it even admit in its annual report that it had fouled up last year in terms of getting money back in reasonable time to individual and honest taxpayers. The answer is no. </PARA>
<PARA> I looked through this annual report which, by the way, is still on the Notice Paper and will probably still be there by the time we get up. We will not have the opportunity of dealing with it, no doubt, although it is a very important report and also deals with the role of the Commissioner, which is a matter which has been concerning many members of the Opposition. In that report, when we look at the highlights of 1988-89, we see that one is that there was an increase of 15.2 per cent in the tax revenue collected. It does not say anything about what the increase was in rebates, or how long it took the Office to get the rebates out. That does not figure. What it does say is that audit methods have been designed specifically to ensure that everyone pays his fair share of tax. Good, the Opposition is in favour of that. It goes on, `More sophisticated selection techniques have been developed to minimise the inconvenience to those taxpayers who have got it substantially correct'. Minimise the inconvenience! They are maximising the inconvenience to taxpayers in my region and I presume it is the same throughout Australia with these disgraceful and unjustifiable delays in returning money that is due to taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> The supreme irony is that the Tax Office in its discussion of the future says, `We have designated 1989-90 as the year of service for the Australian Tax Office with the motto, Get it Right the First Time. We recognise that our task is not just to collect the revenue but to provide a service to those who provide the revenue'. I say to the Tax Office, `I would rather you cut out the flowery words and hurried up with posting the refund cheques'. This sort of excited statement, when it is not backed up by any meaningful effort to service the honest taxpayers of Australia, just adds ire, adds anger, to the justifiable disappointment of those people who are taking out their anger on the staffs of tax consultants, tax advisers, the people who are preparing these tax returns. They are getting abused because the clients quite rightly think, `What is the delay all about? It surely would not be the Government. The Government has promised to get our tax returns back. It has promised to be fair. This is the year of service where it is looking after the clients'. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Tax Office might find that many of its own officers are being subjected to a lot of client abuse because of its failure to have a proper sense of priorities to get these tax refunds out. I then looked at page 22 of the annual report to see the performance indicators. There we see how the Tax Office is meeting its performance indicators. Under phone inquiries it says that the objective is that 95 per cent of calls are to be answered within two minutes. In fact, the Tax Office got around to 73.5 per cent of calls answered within two minutes. I will not deal with the failure to meet its objectives here. </PARA>
<PARA> All I can say, though, is that there is no stated objective of getting tax refunds out in reasonable time. It is not even important enough in the Tax Office's sense of priorities to be listed in its list of what its performance indicators should be. It is about time it was because this is, as I said, the second year in a row that the Tax Office has failed to meet any kind of decent standard. It does say that one of its key objectives in revenue collection is the processing of returns and remittances within agreed standards. I understand that the agreed standard-which is not stated here-is something like 10 weeks. I also understand that its way of measuring the 10 weeks is ludicrous. It does not start measuring it until about two or three weeks after most returns get in. </PARA>
<PARA> The annual report also says that, under the tax amnesty arrangements, returns for taxpayers with little or no liability have been deferred to concentrate on current returns with significant revenue implications. Once again, the ordinary, honest, decent taxpayer is being put second in the Government's priorities to pursuing current returns with significant revenue implications: not a fair distribution; they come second. It is not putting appropriate concentration on refunds to Australian citizens and appropriate concentration on those Australians who owe tax money. The priority has gone to those people who owe money to the Tax Commissioner, and the good, honest Australian taxpayer has come last yet again. The annual report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Due to the extended due date for lodgment and the commencement of work on redesigning jobs we have experienced delays in processing returns beyond our goal of ten weeks. We have, however, achieved significant improvements in the accuracy of system support facilities. </PARA>
<PARA>Great. So people wait a lot longer, but they can feel more confident that when they eventually get their tax assessments they may be more accurate. This is not chickenfeed. In the latest financial year 11.5 million individual and company returns were processed, generating 17.8 million notices of assessment. This was an increase of 6 per cent over the preceding year. In practical terms, these notices resulted in $5.4 billion in refunds. We are not talking about chickenfeed which the Government is cheating Australian taxpayers. Up to $5.4 billion is being held by this Government and not handed back in reasonable time to taxpayers, as a deliberate matter of policy within the Tax Office. Its priorities simply are not to pay back this money. </PARA>
<PARA> I just remind the Tax Office that Christmas is coming. It would be very nice if families who depend on their tax return to have any kind of Christmas could eventually get their tax refunds. I know the Tax Office and Christmas appear to be at opposite ends of the pole-those are almost incompatible terms-but it is about time this Government gingered the Tax Office. It is up to the Government to determine what the Tax Office should be doing in relation to people. It is not as independent an office as all that. It is the Government's responsibility to ensure that the Tax Office carries out the Government's policies. If the Government's policy is that it does not give a damn whether people get their tax refunds in reasonable time, then I think the Government should be reminded of that fact at election time. </PARA>
<PARA> One other simple and brief thing I want to mention is that, because of these ludicrous delays, there are many other government agencies which are not providing the assistance they are required by government policy to give because people who depend on that support have to provide their tax assessment forms from the Tax Office. One cannot get Austudy, for example, unless one can come along with a tax assessment. But there is no tax assessment, so what are people doing? They are being knocked back. Until recently, as I understand it, and particularly last year, because of the ludicrous delays from the Tax Office government instrumentalities were prepared to accept the copy of the tax return when it was done by a registered tax agent. There has been an administrative ruling that this will not take place. The Department of Social Security no longer allows those returns to be accepted. So people are being knocked back for social security and other things to which they are entitled because of the incompetence of the Tax Office and the incompetence of this Government, which probably does not even know any of this is happening. That is my guess. The Government does not know what is going on in its own departments and if it does know and has done nothing to fix it, it stands condemned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the attention of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories been drawn to comments in today's Australian by North Broken Hill Peko Ltd that the Wesley Vale pulp mill project abandoned in March would have complied with the Federal Government's national pulp mill guidelines announced on Tuesday? Is this claim accurate? If so, why did the Government prevent the Wesley Vale pulp mill from proceeding? Does the Minister agree that North Broken Hill, by conceding that any new mill proposal will incorporate flexible technology to eliminate chlorine bleaching, is in fact accepting the sensible package adopted by the Federal Government?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think North Broken Hill has adopted a very sensible attitude to this proposal since the Cabinet decision last March. I have had quite a number of meetings with it and have found myself in agreement with it on most points. It is heartening to see that it says it will be able to meet these much tougher guidelines. However, the claim that these guidelines were in fact good enough for the Wesley Vale pulp mill to pass last time is simply not true. The emission limits that have to be met to satisfy these Commonwealth guidelines are far more demanding in a whole range of respects than those that were set by the Gray Government in Tasmania. In the liquid effluent stream, the allowable levels for organochlorins, total suspended solids and biochemical oxygen demand are all lower. As far as air emissions are concerned, all of the levels for oxides of nitrogen, particulates, total reduced sulphur compounds, hydrogen chloride, opacity, sulphuric acid mist and sulphur trioxide are tougher, as set in the Commonwealth guidelines, than they were before.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These guidelines do not stop simply at emission limits either for air or liquids. The reality is that the guidelines specify that, as a prerequisite for consideration there have to be baseline studies. I think it was the lack of meteorological and hydrological studies done prior to an approval for Wesley Vale that caused so much strife. There was a grave suspicion, on the face of available evidence, that the point to which the effluent pipe was to go had very little tidal movement around it and this caused many people on the land and, of course, the fishing industry in Tasmania to get so concerned and aggravated the last time. So on the basis of all those criteria not being met, it is hard to see how Wesley Vale could possibly have met these criteria the last time. The proponents chose not to proceed last time, and I am heartened to believe that this time they might.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as flexible technologies are concerned, I think North Broken Hill has shown a commendable attitude on this. It has since last March stressed to the Government that it is prepared to look at changing its technology if and when the technology for a different kind of process arrives or, indeed, if the market need changes. The Government has agreed with North Broken Hill to have a look at the changing technologies and also at the Bureau of Industry Economics which is looking at possible markets for unbleached paper over time. So I do not think we have got too much of a problem with North Broken Hill on that and I am delighted that it is still able to proceed with the proposal, albeit on very much tougher guidelines.</PARA>

I take it that I am to understand from the Minister's reply that the Prime Minister may have disagreed with Mr Kerin's remarks but that he has not rebuked him for them. I repeat Senator Chaney's earlier question: What does the Minister understand by the principle of Cabinet solidarity? As an example of that principle in operation I remind him of the resignation of Minister West over the uranium issue in 1983. Does the Hawke interpretation of the principle prevent outright opposition-perhaps one might call it failure to rebuke-such as that by Minister West, but allow more subtle defiance such as that indulged in by Mr Kerin?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am at risk in saying this, but I do not know precisely what is in the Prime Minister's head at every hour of the day. One is at risk in saying this because the Opposition perhaps gets a little bit of excitement out of a remark such as that. I have a lot better knowledge of what is in Andrew Peacock's head-nothing, at every hour of the day. I am unable to say whether the Prime Minister agreed with Mr Kerin. As to the question of Cabinet solidarity, if the Cabinet had made a decision last week that there were many trendy green environmentalists running around the country who ought all to be shot, Mr Kerin's statement would be in conflict with it. But we did not make any decision about that. We did not make any decision about whether we wanted to add value to particular raw materials; about what we thought about various sections of the green movement and so on. So there is no breach of Cabinet solidarity. If Opposition senators want to know, Mr Kerin got closest to it when he criticised the Kakadu decision a few months ago. At the time those opposite did not make very much of that; it went through to the keeper.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has Senator MacGibbon finished? The Prime Minister announced that he is seeking the cooperation and commitment of all Australian Premiers to the improvement of a range of services available to children and families with children. As the first step towards that, he proposed that the States join with the Commonwealth in the establishment of a ministerial committee on services for children. The job of that committee will be to examine the range of services provided by Commonwealth, State and Territory governments, with particular focus on family support services-health services, education services and community legal services. One of the major roles of the committee will be to identify current weaknesses in the provision of these important services, particularly in respect to the geographical coverage of those services. It will also examine and define ways of better coordinating these services. The committee will make an initial report to the next Premiers Conference in mid-1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Zakharov mentioned the family allowance supplement. That is the important first step on which this committee will build on the Government's record in this area. Income support is obviously a primary factor in the attack on family poverty. On the second anniversary of FAS, it should be noted that the family allowance supplement or its equivalent is now paid to over 560,000 families with 1.2 million children, including 190,000 low income working families. We should also remember that family allowance is paid to two million families with 3.7 million children. As we have said before, other factors are involved, including the provision of services. These factors are absolutely crucial to any attack on child poverty. It should be recognised that the Government's record on these services is already impressive. We need to think only of Medicare, increasing retention rates in schools, child-care and a whole list of other programs that Senator Button mentioned here yesterday.</PARA>

Those opposite ought to take into account three reasons why we are recognised as being sensitive and responding to the area: one, the people can remember the performance of those opposite. They can remember the seven years between 1975 and 1983 when those opposite increased child payments only once-in 1982. Secondly, they also remember that those opposite increased the number of children living in low income families by 50,000 each year, apart from the Opposition's special last year in office when it bumped it up by 150,000. They can remember the degree of disrespect for the issue. They also recognise that the Opposition's family action plan-the `short shelf life plan'-of a couple of months ago does not respond to their needs. Thirdly, and more importantly, people have no confidence in the Opposition's ability to deliver; they have no confidence in the Opposition's core Ministers; and they have no confidence in the Leader of the Opposition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope I got down all the parts of Senator Haines's question. The first part concerns the south-east forests of New South Wales and the Prime Minister's statement that, through efficiency improvements and the identification of alternatives, he was hopeful that the New South Wales Government would not have to go back into the National Estate forests. I think Senator Haines and all other senators are aware that my colleague Senator Cook negotiated an agreement with his New South Wales counterpart which sought to protect 91 per cent of those forests while some flora and fauna studies were conducted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It certainly is the intention of the Commonwealth to assist in identifying alternatives so that logging will not have to continue in that 91 per cent of the forests. I do not believe that we have ever made a commitment that we would be protecting the 9 per cent as well. I think any remarks the Prime Minister may have made-I have not seen a text of them-would be referring to the agreement and the 91 per cent. As far as the corporations power is concerned, what we have said is that if alternatives are identified and the New South Wales Government refuses to accept the identification of those alternatives and goes back into the National estate forests, then we will use the corporations powers. That remains our commitment.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as the decision in Victoria is concerned, I did become aware of it in the last couple of days. I have asked for a report from the Victorian Minister for Conservation, Forests and Lands, Kay Setches, on what is planned and whether alternatives have been identified. Unlike the situation in New South Wales and the south-eastern forests, with those areas of Gippsland the Victorian Government has in the past couple of years identified some very large areas which have been reserved in national park and, therefore, thought the rest could be available for logging. Because it is on the National Estate and the Commonwealth has a duty to look at prudent and feasible alternatives where possible, I have asked Kay Setches to let me know whether there was any attempt to identify those alternatives and whether any were identified. I assume that the answer will come back that there were none possible, but I do not yet have an answer. I am promised to have the answer by tomorrow afternoon, so I can have a look at it then. I will undertake to inform Senator Haines on Monday of what Kay Setches has had to say.</PARA>

The Minister for Urban Services and Finance, Craig Duby, who was known in his previous incarnation as a No Self-Government candidate, says that it is desirable that the benighted burghers of Canberra should be saddled with two extra ministers. Other reformed No Self-Government candidates are now calling for a new parliament house to contain the inmates. For example, the Speaker of the Assembly, Mr Prowse, is quoted as saying that the Federal Government should pay for a new Parliament for the Australian Capital Territory. When asked what would happen if the Federal Government refused to pay, he said, `We will call them a few names, just like we have done before'. Will the Minister indicate his views about these sophisticated requests for extra funds?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the Australian Capital Territory Administration has shown its priorities very well in this area. Its priorities are more Ministers and a new home. I understand that, as Senator Aulich has said in his question, one No Self-Government candidate is now a Minister and one of the other No Self-Government candidates wants to become a Minister as well. I am not sure who the funding for the second suggested new ministerial position is intended for. As far as I am concerned they can whistle for it, and ditto for their new Parliament House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the more general financial background to the ACT, the process of aligning the ACT Budget with the States began three years ago. In that year the Commonwealth Grants Commission conducted an inquiry and concluded that a relative factor with the States for the Australian Capital Territory was 1.57, which implied overfunding relative to the States at that time of some $84m. The Grants Commission has not done another inquiry but it is the belief of the Department of Finance that, based on that same factor, the level of overfunding has now reached about $100m. Part of the reason for that widening, of course, was that the Australian Capital Territory was given a guarantee of maintenance of funding in real terms for the three years ending 1990-91. It may be questionable whether they should be given such a guarantee, but they were, and it still has 18 months to run. In the same period, the States had no such guarantee and there were significant reductions in Commonwealth funding to the States, as there should have been, given the economic circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> The reason for that generosity-some might suggest excess generosity-was to give the Australian Capital Territory three years in which to get its financial house in order. There is little indication that that is happening, although there was some indication a while ago that it was. All minority governments, or all governments who have a minority in either House of a parliament, have trouble implementing a responsible fiscal policy, and the previous Australian Capital Territory Administration had some of those troubles. There is no indication whatsoever, that I am aware of, that the new Australian Capital Territory Administration will take advantage of that three years to get its fiscal house in order. Indeed, all the indications are that it will be doing the opposite.</PARA>
<PARA> The last point I make is that the Grants Commission is about to receive a reference on the Australian Capital Territory which will be the basis of determining a two-year transitional arrangement after the three-year funding guarantee expires in 18 months time. I do not expect that that review will suggest that the Commonwealth should fund the self-aggrandisement with which the present Australian Capital Territory Administration is so obsessed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can say categorically that I have ruled out any question of repatriation of James Savage to serve any sentence of imprisonment that might be imposed on him by the court in Florida. This man has been convicted of murder in the first degree, robbery with a deadly weapon, and sexual battery with great force and with a deadly weapon. He has been convicted of very serious crimes and if, indeed, he is spared the death sentence-and I know that all honourable senators would wish that that sentence not be imposed-then he will serve his term of imprisonment in Florida rather than in Australia. There is no capacity within the Australian legal system for the detention within Australia of a person convicted of a crime overseas. There is no customary international law and, indeed, no treaty, such as I believe the United States has entered into with some other countries, to enable this to occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Though slightly at a tangent, it needs to be said that, as far as Australians travelling abroad are concerned, it is the policy of this Government to try to make them as aware as possible of the fact that if they commit a serious crime, for example in South East Asia to do with drug trafficking, then they face very severe consequences in terms of the penal laws of those jurisdictions, perhaps facing the death sentence or certainly long terms of imprisonment, sometimes in very primitive conditions. A warning appears on the plastic cover of passports issued to Australians travelling abroad and I believe that it ought to be heeded and taken very seriously: there will be no occasion when an Australian is brought back to this country to serve time imposed in a jurisdiction abroad.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the Savage case, which has, of course, excited great emotions, it is quite well-known that the Australian Government decided to help provide witnesses at the sentencing stage of the trial in order to try to mitigate the sentence that might be imposed-namely, the death sentence. As recently as last week in the hall just outside this chamber the leaders of all the major political parties in Australia, the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Democrats-indicated that their parties abhorred the death sentence and made representations to try to avert that penalty in appropriate cases when imposed abroad. To try to avert that sentence I provided funds to enable some persons to travel to Florida to be available to the defence counsel to help bring about a situation where a life sentence of imprisonment is imposed rather than the death sentence. For that reason it was very aggravating to me to see in an Australian Associated Press report a day ago the remarks made, when Mr Justice Hall Wootten was stopped from giving evidence in the case, by a Mr Chris Loorham, apparently a lawyer with the Aboriginal Legal Service in Victoria, who is in Florida. The report stated:</PARA>
<PARA>`The judge ruled that because Justice Wootten did not personally know Russell (Savage) his evidence should not go to the jury,' Mr Loorham said.</PARA>
<PARA>. . . .</PARA>
<PARA> `The reason he had not met Russell was that he arrived here exhausted, suffering jet lag a couple of days ago and hasn't had a chance to meet him which he would have had to do at night at the jail'.</PARA>
<PARA>. . . .</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Loorham said the Federal Government, especially Justice Minister Michael Tate, had been tardy in the matter, and had responded only at the last minute.</PARA>
<PARA>The application for funding for these witnesses was received on 23 November 1989. The application was approved on 24 November 1989-in other words, within the day. The United States attorneys were advised orally that day and a letter confirming the grant of funds was sent the next day. Far from being jet lagged, Mr Justice Wootten took two days to get from Australia to Florida, having two overnight stops along the way, and arrived in Florida six days before the hearing, so he was available for such consultations as might have been required. I totally reject the allegation made against me and refuse to be set up by Chris Loorham in order to be some sort of scapegoat in the event of a particular penalty being imposed on Mr Savage.</PARA>
<PARA> No Australian wants to see the death sentence imposed. On the other hand, this man has been convicted in a fair trial of most heinous crimes against a woman and I believe that in this situation whatever sentence is imposed by the court ought to be accepted and served in the United States.</PARA>

<PARA>I could refer Mr Wells and his colleagues to an establishment a few yards away from the News Ltd offices. It is a pub called the Evening Star. I have seen quite a number of Mr Wells's colleagues go in there, disappear for a number of hours, go under and come out with very strange looks on their faces indeed. On the basis of what Mr Wells has had to say I wonder whether an effort to disguise the word `lesbianism', while printing the word `shirtlifter' in full, can be applied to the activities that go on in the Evening Star.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Wells's suggestion that men face the same problems as women in regard to lack of participation in sport is nonsense. It is well documented that Australia has a major and growing problem with adolescent girls dropping out of sport from the age of 13 on. As a Government and as a nation we must address that. To that end we began the women's sport promotion unit. We have enormously increased that body's funds. A few months ago I announced the next step for Australian sport, which included a massive increase in funds for the Aussie sports program, which allows adolescent girls the opportunity to play sports they could not have played under the old regime. As an adjunct to that there is a youth sports program which particularly targets young girls from 13 up. Mr Wells aside, I think most Australians accept the fact that there is a need to do more in that area, and we are doing it.</PARA>

Substantial improvements in recovery action within Austudy are expected this financial year, with the developments which are currently under way to improve systems and procedures. It is probably true-indeed, I would say almost certainly true-that all sorts of administrative actions in the Department of Education have been hampered by union obstructionism over at least the last two years. I understand that something has been done about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The five proposals that have been put up by the Opposition, as I have said, are already in operation. I am pleased to see that the Opposition is taking an interest in this area, but every time the Government proposes a more effective mechanism for the detection and reduction of fraud and overpayment in general, the Opposition knocks the measure over. It opposed the tax file number. Opposition members all hold up their hands and cry `Shock! Horror! There is fraud and overpayment', and then oppose every measure that will be a cost-effective way of dealing with it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I draw to the Minister's attention-this is quite contrary to his final remark, which was self-serving at the least-that this week the Opposition supported the amendments to the Austudy legislation in order to deliberately extend fraud and overpayment regulations to the unlegislated schemes. I ask the Minister whether he is aware of that and of the fact that the Government, by adopting the measures the Opposition has been putting forward for some months now, is beginning to catch up with the Opposition in this matter?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was Senator Chaney, if I remember correctly. Steadily, over a period of years, the ratio of people in receipt of unemployment benefits to people shown by the Australian Bureau of Statistics surveys as looking for full time employment blew out from 98 : 100 to 125 : 100. The cost of that was in the order of $600m to $700m, at present levels of unemployment. This Government took action against that and reversed the stupid decision made, on false economy grounds, by the coalition Government in 1981. We put a number of other measures in place and the ratio has come back to where it was before then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So Senator Teague should not try to lecture me or this Government about taking effective action-or as effective as we are able to take, given the constraints that are imposed on fiscal responsibility by the Senate. He should not lecture me about the Government being in any way tardy in this respect. But I am pleased to see that he and the Liberal Party have finally taken an interest in this matter. I assume that they would not do again anything as stupid-if they ever got back into government-as they did in 1981 and, perhaps, it is a more forlorn hope, that some time they might start to change some of their antediluvian ideas and think about some really effective means of eliminating fraud and overpayment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Resources. I refer to the Minister's attendance at the Western Australian Iron Ore Industry Consultative Council meeting. I ask the Minister whether he can advise the Senate on what the industry's performance is in relation to exports, productivity and industrial relations. Further, has the company Robe River Iron Associates been a participant in the Consultative Council process? If not, is it considered by the industry to be a member of the Council?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4554" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="RESOURCES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first part of the question is about the performance of the iron ore industry. The performance of the iron ore industry has been outstanding. For the first time ever, the Pilbara will export in excess of 100 million tonnes of iron ore. That is a record. It is up from 96 million tonnes last year, with a total value of in excess of $1.8 billion to the Australian economy. For the first time as well, for the first half of this Japanese financial year the Pilbara will claim 50 per cent of the Japanese market. That is a record and one hopes that it can be maintained. As well as that significant penetration with our major customer, the iron ore industry now has other customer countries, which constitute 53 per cent of its trade. Therefore, the emphasis on the Japanese market has been decreased. We have spread our trade across the north Pacific and Europe and have a much more balanced trading environment because of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Productivity per head has increased from 1984 by 32 per cent until today's date over the whole of the industry, representing a 23 per cent per hour increase per employee in tonnes shipped over that same period. So there has been a dramatic increase in productivity. The number of industrial disputes has decreased dramatically. We are now looking at concluding this calendar year with a record low in terms of industrial disputation in the Pilbara.</PARA>
<PARA> There is something about the Australian culture which focuses, in industrial relations, on the dispute index when often the most time lost on major projects is due to accidents. If we look at the accident and safety index we find that there has been, from the first days in which the Consultative Council was constituted until now, a steep ramping down of work days lost due to industrial accidents. Indeed, this year to the end of November there has been, compared to the end of November last year, a 32 per cent reduction in time lost through industrial accidents. The industrial accidents index is down right across all the indicators: the number of accidents, the time lost in all occupational groups and all types of injury. We had a 15 per cent price increase last year, with the bigger volumes, and this year we are expecting a price increase of very significant proportions, too. So, according to all the indicators, the industry has been performing extremely well.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator McKiernan asked me about Robe River Iron Associates. Robe River has chosen voluntarily not to attend, as a company, the Iron Ore Industry Consultative Council in the last three years and be part of this general consultative approach to obtain greater efficiencies. Therefore, the Consultative Council does not consider Robe River as a member of the Consultative Council, active or passive. I am absolutely disgusted by that company's nineteenth century view of industrial relations, which is legend in the Pilbara. It took the form, just in the last week, of trying to deny unions, which under their own independent banner are signatories of the Consultative Council's charter, from having representatives attend the Consultative Council. Robe River informed the unions that representatives could go to the Consultative Council meeting if they sought leave. The shop stewards applied for leave and were told that it would not be granted unless they took their annual leave. When they applied for annual leave to attend the Consultative Council meeting they were told that it would not be granted unless they took it in five-day blocks. When they applied for a five-day block of annual leave to attend the Consultative Council meeting, they were told that it would not be granted because they had not given a month's notice. In the first instance, all they sought was leave without pay in order to be part of this consultative process that has obtained these types of results.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not read the article but fortunately the person who has written the answer has. My colleague Senator Gareth Evans was informed of the article by Herb Feith concerning East Timor prior to its publication in the Age on 7 December. In correspondence with Dr Feith, the Minister indicated that he shared a strong concern about the manner of annexation of East Timor by Indonesia. The Government recognises Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor. This was enunciated clearly by the Prime Minister in his statement to Parliament on 24 August 1985. Such recognition of Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor means that the Government would only support the proposal for creating a kind of special territory or autonomous region status for East Timor if it were accepted by the Indonesian Government. The Prime Minister made it clear at that time that recognition of Indonesian sovereignty had permitted us to pursue human right and aid issues in that province.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government gives its full support to international efforts, particularly those of the United Nations Secretary-General, to assist Portugal and Indonesia to achieve agreement on East Timor, taking into account the interests of all parties involved. Australia is not a party to those negotiations. We would, of course, be prepared to assist in any way that we can, provided we are invited to do so by both major parties. Whether other outside states and international organisations may contribute to the winding down of the war is a matter for them.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government has consistently supported the efforts of international organisations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations Children's Fund, to assist and improve the welfare of the people of East Timor. The Government would not dispute that deaths and casualties still occur as a result of conflict in the province nor that there are human rights violations there. It remains the Government's firm view that the only practical way to assist the people of East Timor, including on human rights issues, is by working through the Indonesian authorities.</PARA>

Coming off the high of an Expo 88 year and a bicentennial year, some drop-off was to be expected. But it is a worry that the numbers have gone down as far as they have.

The second one was a Ms Stokes who signed up for a personal superannuation plan with Friends' Provident into which she paid $125 a month for two years, which totals about $3,000.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, perhaps I should have just said a loss. One does get a bit hooked on the jargon sometimes. In each case the basic problems were those of high commissions being paid to the savings plans sales people and high upfront fees. The article goes on to argue that high front-end fees were charged in such a way as to be effectively disguised. I make no comment on whether they were effectively disguised-I just do not know. There can be no doubt that when this sort of thing happens-whether or not the up-front fees are effectively disguised-once people find out about it it will be a deterrent, not an incentive, to saving.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is worth quoting the opening paragraph of the article. The article was written by Anne Lampe, and I suggest to any people who are listening to the Senate broadcast that they read it. It is in the Sydney Morning Herald, dated 13 December 1989, at page 29, and states:</PARA>
<PARA>Savings plans sold by life insurance companies and their agents without adequate disclosure of all the fees and charges usually come back to haunt the company which backs the plan.</PARA>
<PARA>It is perhaps worth quoting the final paragraph of the article as well. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Companies which don't charge excessive front-end fees on savings plans include the GIO of NSW, Westpac Life, ANZ Life and Oceanic Life.</PARA>
<PARA>That is probably not an exhaustive list, but just an example. I am not suggesting that every company not named on it is guilty of-shall we say-shady practices. I will refer the article to the Treasurer and see whether he can do anything about it. The final point I want to make as far as national savings are concerned is that there is no doubt these were losses to the individuals concerned, and might well have been losses to national savings as well if the people who received the front-end fees and the high commissions blew them all on an overseas trip and another Porsche.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>During the debate on the matter of public interest I mentioned some aspects of the annual report of the Commissioner of Taxation, particularly the failure of that report to indicate, among its priorities, any emphasis on trying to provide refunds within a reasonable time. I now want to draw the attention of the Senate to that section of the annual report which deals with the role of the Commissioner of Taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Senate will be aware, the Opposition has been concerned at times about the role of the Commissioner, particularly his intervention in what the Opposition sees to be political debates on policy areas of taxation, not on the administration of the Australian Taxation Office. In particular, the Opposition is concerned about the appearance of advertisements in newspapers, which clearly seem to be of a political nature, over the names of the Commissioner or the Taxation Office. This is an unfortunate trend which has prompted responses of a political nature from the Opposition which the Commissioner may well feel are inappropriate. There is no doubt in the minds of members of the Opposition that the inappropriate nature of the activities emerges from the Commissioner's involvement in creating and debating policy matters-and controversial policy matters, I might say-when he should be at arm's length and dealing with the administration of the Taxation Office. It is interesting to note in the annual report the Commissioner's own explanation of his role. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>While the Treasurer is answerable in Parliament for the Tax laws, the clear intent of the general administration and secrecy powers is that the day-to-day running of the Tax Office, and decisions about tax liability, are for the statutory office-holder and not the political head, or anyone else for that matter. In other words, the Tax Commissioner is given independence (subject always to the law and the courts) and he is in a different and stronger position than the Secretary of a Department of State. He has a clear custodial role in relation to the tax system established by the laws he administers. </PARA>
<PARA>The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The duty of the Tax Office, which the Commissioner of Taxation heads, is to administer those laws, the aim being to collect the correct amount of tax that is payable under the law, no more and no less. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to stress the words `no more', because that is the very concern of the Opposition-it appears, from the Commissioner's intervention in policy areas, that he is going beyond the bounds of the constraints he sets upon himself in this annual report. The matters the Opposition is concerned about of a policy nature-defending the Government's policy decisions, outlining the `benefits' to the public of the Commissioner doing various things-appear to go far beyond this `no more and no less' proposition which the Commissioner has stated in this annual report. It is only right that the Opposition points out when these interventions take place. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to stress that no vestige of criticism can be made by the Opposition about the proposition that the administration of the tax laws is entirely up to the Commissioner. Whether he makes misjudgments in that administration is, of course, a matter which is properly capable of being discussed. Many people take the view that the highly publicised raids that the Commissioner has introduced in some areas are open to debate. One wonders whether some of those raids are for the purpose of putting other taxpayers in terrorem, fear, rather than getting a good result from that particular raid. There are those people who think that the end justifies the means, and whacko if a dilatory taxpayer is terrorised into coming clean-fair enough.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>Given that the Senate will be debating the Australian Heritage Commission Amendment Bill 1989 during this session of parliament, I think it is timely that the annual report precedes that debate. Let me preface my comments by stating that I concur with the Australian Heritage Commission's raison d'etre. The concept of the National Estate is a valid one. Just as I accept that the National Estate should be conserved, it is also acceptable to me that conservation is essentially about better management. It is the matter of conservation of the National Estate which I wish to address. The Chairman, Mr P. J. Galvin, in the opening pages of the report, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The year . . . has been, in many respects, one of taking stock and preparation for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Although some of this self-examination began early in 1988, it gained momentum following the Government's decision to strengthen the role of the Commonwealth in the conservation of the National Estate. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975, the Commission's aims are, first, the preparation and maintenance of the Register of National Estate places; secondly, the provision of advice to the relevant Minister and to other Ministers and government authorities on government proposals which may affect the national Estate and on other matters relating to the National Estate; and, thirdly, the development of policies and programs for research, professional training and public information and education. </PARA>
<PARA> Without wishing to pre-empt the forthcoming Australian Heritage Commission Amendment Bill, I believe that the above aims will remain unchanged-I hope they will-as a result of the amendments. Given the above aims, as I interpret them-and as I take it they are meant to be interpreted-it was interesting to read the Chairman's interpretation. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> Legislation sets out the Commission's principal tasks of maintaining and developing the Register of the National Estate and advising the Government on the-</PARA>
<PARA>this is the interesting word-</PARA>
<PARA>protection of our national heritage. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the regular use of the word `protection' nowadays, rather than reference to the `conservation' or `maintenance' of National Estate values, which I find particularly disturbing. I believe it is not in keeping with the legislated purpose of the Australian Heritage Commission. The protection-preservation attitude to the National Estate comes through particularly in Chapter 3.2 of the report entitled `The present condition of the National Estate'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Mining, manufacturing, agriculture, forestry, tourism and massive redevelopment in central business districts continue to place under threat parts of Australia's natural heritage. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the heading `Forestry issues' in this chapter the comments on clearfelling and pulp mill developments read like something from a Wilderness Society brochure. The Heritage Commission knows that no logging takes place in areas listed on the National Estate Register or interim list without its having input in the form of advice to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission should also be aware that there are many areas where logging is conducive and essential to maintaining the National Estate values for which an area has been listed. In support of my statement, I instance the Ben Nevis Foothills listing for which the statement of significance says that the area supports one of the best remaining populations of the rare endemic plant acacia pataczeckii. Under the heading `Condition' we are told, `Good, this has been selectively logged in the past'. Thus selective logging is conducive to the good condition of an endemic species, possibly preventing it from extinction. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than adhere to a protection-preservation attitude, the Australian Heritage Commission should practise the view expressed recently in a letter to the editor by Gerard Early, the Acting Director of the Australian Heritage Commission. In that letter, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Listing of a place-</PARA>
<PARA>on the National Estate register-</PARA>
<PARA>does . . . alert the Federal Government to the special values of that area, when Federal Government ministers and authorities are making decisions which may affect it. In this way heritage values can be considered alongside other values-land use, economic, employment and so on. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is important that we get our terminology right and that we understand what we are doing under the heading of preservation of the National Estate. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>It is regrettable that there is such a short time to address these agreements because one of them at least finally lays bare the absurd situation that this Government's misplaced enthusiasm for a military alliance with the United States of America has got us into. The agreement on communications, which is treaty No. 16, is essentially a machinery measure designed to update and upgrade Australia's military linkages to the United States (US) and to keep information from the public. It is no new departure. </PARA>
<PARA> Treaty No. 17 concerns the defence communications service and there is an agreement between the United States and Australian governments; yet in Article 1, section 3a it refers to the involvement of the New Zealand Ministry of Defence, which is pending. It is concerned with the United States-New Zealand responsibilities for the Simpson system and obviously requires bilateral talks between those two governments. I mention it to highlight the fact that post-ANZUS not a lot has changed for the New Zealanders. They are officially left out of the annual talks as a face-saver to the United States to prove that their relationship is now that of friend rather than ally. Yet when it comes down to the nitty-gritty-that is, the exchange of so-called military intelligence, which has often been called a contradiction in terms-the United States still extracts its pound of flesh and the New Zealand Government still acquiesces. It is business as usual. It is a continuation of the mostly one-way flow of information from both Australia and New Zealand to assist the United States military strategists. </PARA>
<PARA> The Simpson system involves the New Zealand defence communications network which is linked to allied military communications networks through Australia and the United States of America. This system provides secure telegraph and data communication channels for the exchange of narrative record traffic. In concert with a planned upgrade of the Simpson communications system and a US legislative requirement for formalised agreements, a draft United States-New Zealand agreement is currently under review by the United States Department of Defense. This agreement is similar to the Australian-United States agreement which I understand was signed in November 1989. It is anticipated that the New Zealand-United States agreement will be signed early in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreement on logistic support is another matter. I need to remind the Senate of the words of the Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, in March 1987-words which were also in the speech of the present Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) when he tabled the Defence White Paper in the Senate. Mr Beazley said:</PARA>
<PARA>A particular aspect of our relationship with the United States that assures our capacity for self-defence is our guaranteed access to ready resupply of essential warstocks. Emergency warstocks of equipment and munitions would be prohibitively expensive to maintain ourselves. However our needs could be relatively easily met from US stocks. </PARA>
<PARA>So the Government in 1987 came into the Parliament and spoke about our guaranteed access to supplies of American war material should this be required. But what do we find with respect to the agreement before us today? I refer honourable senators to the explanatory press release issued by the Minister for Defence on 4 November which says with uncharacteristic honesty:</PARA>
<PARA>The Agreement provides that neither Australia nor the US would necessarily be committed to militarily supporting one another's forces in contingency situations, should it be against their respective national interests. </PARA>
<PARA>What has happened to the `guaranteed access to ready resupply' that Minister Beazley spoke of in 1987? Critics of the American alliance have never believed in it anyway. Now we find that the Government has finally had to admit that its critics were right. </PARA>
<PARA> This agreement is a sham. It is a farce. It is an example of the politics of the warm inner glow. It must make the Government, its conservative friends in the Opposition and the Americans feel good to sign an agreement like this, but nobody can stand up in this place today and truthfully say that we have any guarantee of resupply by the United States. It will supply us if-and only if-it suits it. This is why the Government and its fellow conservatives in the Opposition strive to outdo each other in protestations of loyalty and support for the alliance. That great greenie and environmentalist, Senator Richardson, says in the Senate that he welcomes United States nuclear warship visits and can hardly wait to get aboard. We have to grovel-he has to grovel-to keep the Americans on side. </PARA>
<PARA> We should, however, welcome the tabling of this agreement because it reveals the complete bankruptcy of the promilitary alliance policies of the conservative Government and the conservative Opposition. As cold war alliance edifices crumble all over the world, we find Australia locking itself ever more closely into an obsolete alliance. But as this agreement shows clearly, the alliance, even in its own terms, is not worth the paper on which it is printed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the Department of Primary Industries and Energy on its annual report and on its endeavours to encourage the growth of an adaptable and efficient primary industries and energy sector. I note that on page 1 of the report that the Department, which was established in 1987, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These industries, which represents about 80 per cent of Australia's merchandise exports, have a significant role to play in meeting two important national challenges. These are the Current Account deficit (and related foreign debt level) and the management of our natural resources to provide for ecologically sustainable long-term development. </PARA>
<PARA>As honourable senators would know, I represent a State which is very proud of its place in helping Australia to meet its economic challenges. Queensland is a very decentralised State. It is at least 1,500 miles in length and 1,000 miles in breadth. Over the years I have made many trips throughout the State and I realise the value of primary industries and the tremendous contribution they make to the economy. However, it saddens me that too often people, especially many in government, fail to realise the tremendous cost for rural industries in trying to meet the challenge of giving Australia a buoyant economy. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government chooses to penalise those who work in our primary industries and, sometimes I think deliberately, fails to recognise not only the physical hardship of working in that environment but also the tremendous financial burden being placed on the shoulders of the man on the land. It is all very well to have the land and the seed to grow the crops or to allow the livestock to graze, but often it is forgotten that to get the end product, to make ends meet, the man on the land has to rely on things over which he has no control. First he hopes for rain to allow the crops to grow. He hopes that there will be good markets and prices for his goods, that interest rates will not cripple him, that fuel prices will not be prohibitive, and that the roads on which he has to transport those goods will be passable. After farmers plant the seed and wait for rain, they have to clean up the crop for weeds and spray for bugs. Finally, if they get a crop to harvest, they either look at using large machinery, which costs an enormous amount of money to buy, or at employing workers to come in and help with the harvesting. This is where many expenses are incurred on the land. </PARA>
<PARA> It is often when assessing the rural industries that we talk only in terms of how much they have contributed to Australia's export growth and not in terms of the effort made to achieve those exports. I note on page 21 of the report that one of the objectives of the Livestock and Pastoral Division is:</PARA>
<PARA>To foster the development of efficient, low cost, internationally competitive, innovative and adaptable livestock and pastoral industries and so further enhance their contribution to the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA>Some of the industries which the livestock and pastoral section deals with include wool and goat fibres, beef and veal, sheep meat, pig meat, chicken meat, livestock exports, dairy products, honey and eggs. These industries had a gross value of production in 1988-89 of about $13 billion and earned $9 billion in export revenue. But it is here I would like to point out that in the goal to achieve these low cost internationally competitive industries the Government has to be aware that it could be killing the goose that laid the golden egg. I am referring not only to some of the major public controversies that the Department was involved in last year but also to many of the minor actions that the Department and the Government have taken which have had adverse effects on the man on the land. Some of these controversies include the divisive stance taken on wheat marketing reform, the removal of the sugar import embargo, the reform of wool research and development arrangements, the implementation of quotas to conserve gemfish resources and the delineation of boundaries for world heritage nominations. If in the process of achieving cost efficient industries we push the small family farmer off the land, in the long run we are serving no really good purpose for Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also congratulate the Department of Primary Industries and Energy on its annual report. The report refers to the new Wheat Marketing Act, and there are concerns about how it will work out in the short term. My concern-and this was never expressed by the proponents of the change to the wheat marketing system when the matter was being discussed six months ago-is that although we have always been told that the Australian Wheat Board will continue to pool the wheat instead of the wheat being sold to private buyers, nothing has been mentioned about how the pooling system will operate. We were not told that the pool would not necessarily last for 12 months. Previously, we had one pool for one year running from 1 November to 31 October the following year. Everyone in that pool got the benefits or disbenefits, if I could use that term, of what might have happened during the year. Even though we were told that the Wheat Board would remain working as it has been working, I have been told in the last few weeks that under this system the pool could last a very short time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This could be rather discriminatory around Australia. A pool may start when Queensland starts its wheat harvest. Then harvesting moves to northern New South Wales and then goes to mid-New South Wales. Then the harvest starts in the north of Western Australia, with the eastern parts of Western Australia next and the more northern parts of South Australia. That is when the best world wheat prices are available-when the northern hemisphere harvest starts to be exhausted. At that point the new northern hemisphere crop is growing and we get a better idea of what is there. Generally, come the end of December and early January, the world wheat price is slightly depressed. That would quite legally let the Australian Wheat Board cut the pool off at that point and create a second pool which would not be able to get the advantages of the earlier prices. Mr Kerin certainly did not tell us that that would happen when he successfully sold the new wheat marketing system. </PARA>
<PARA> In the brief time I have left, I want to mention another fear-it is not mentioned in the report-that has come out in the last few days. Senator Richardson, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, has mentioned once again what he wants to do with marginal land. Some of the marginal wheat lands around Australia are the most important producers of wheat exports. This would be the third time--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pursuant to my contingent notice of motion, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Dunn moving a motion relating to the conduct of business of the Senate, namely, a motion to provide for the consideration of General Business order of the day No. 83 relating to Government papers, being the Government response to the Foreign Affairs Committee report on visits by nuclear powered vessels. </PARA>
<PARA>As I understand it, when the Government responds to a committee report it is not usually buried in the papers of the day and there is some obligation on the Government to table its reports. This has clearly not been done in the present instance. Clearly, it is a matter of some concern to the Australian population. This is a report which was prepared over a period of nearly three years. It has cost the Australian taxpayer thousands and thousands of dollars. Over 102 submissions were received by the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Quite clearly, it is a matter of some concern to the Australian public, particularly because it concerns their safety. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that it is urgent that this motion come on because both the Committee and the Government have stressed the importance of informing the Australian public about the safety arrangements, particularly about the importance of making safety plans public. This forms a considerable part of the Government response to the Committee's report. Indeed, it is a major part of the Committee's report. That is why I think we cannot afford to let this be buried right at the end of the papers, at No. 83, where it apparently does not belong in any case. It should have been tabled separately, and I am sure that my fellow committee members, including you, Mr Deputy President, would have wanted an opportunity to comment on the Government's response. There are other senators, of course, in this place who would have liked an opportunity to comment on it. Given that we rise next week for the session, I do not think we can afford to put off the results of this major report any longer, considering the amount of time, effort and money that was put into the Committee's deliberations, in which you, Mr Deputy President, took such a major part. </PARA>
<PARA> It is urgent that the motion come on also because the Government cannot be taken seriously when it buries its response to the Committee's report right at the bottom of the papers list. I feel sure that this was probably deliberate. The Government is fully aware of the controversial nature of this report. It generated much debate at the time. There have been many media responses to the report. Indeed, all the public opinion polls show that there is a great interest in the community about the subject of the report, which I am not going to mention here today. However, the title of the report, which shows that it is a report by the Committee into contingency planning for the visits of nuclear armed and nuclear powered war ships to Australian ports, indicate something fundamental, not only about the safety of the Australian population and the degree of preparedness--</PARA>

Those of us who have responsibilities to people in the community who are concerned must bring these matters on for discussion. If that interferes with the legislation, which is not our intention, so be it. These are also legitimate matters for Independent senators and the Australian Democrats, who are concerned about them, to raise and make sure they get debated.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been many occasions on which people have been dissatisfied with the order in which papers are listed. Let me say this: the papers are listed in the order in which they come in and the Government does not interfere in their listing. The charge made by Senator Dunn thereof is totally false. Does Senator Dunn know what the decent senators do? They come to me and ask whether a particular paper can be moved up the list because they have a special interest in it. By leave, we do that. The stunters do not ask. Those who want to come in here and abuse the processes of the Senate cannot even pick up the phone or come to see me at Question Time or when I am available in this chamber and say, `Senator Ray, this is a critical issue. With the concurrence and leave of the Senate, can we please move it up the list?'. That is the first point I want to make in terms of whether this is urgent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point I want to make is that I moved a motion in this chamber that debarred debate on papers and private business for the last two weeks of this session. Senator Dunn voted for that, or at least she did not oppose it. However, when a lot of papers arrived at the last minute, I added, without hesitation, 4 1/2 hours to the time allotted for debate on papers in this chamber. Yesterday we moved a critical paper up the list and allotted one hour for discussion on it; Senator Dunn was given 10 minutes in which to speak. I am sick of hearing the whingeing about the rights of the two Independent senators and the others. We have rights too-the 32 senators on the Government side and the 34 senators on the Opposition side have some rights. We have the responsibility, however, to pass legislation in an orderly manner. Senator Dunn does not have that responsibility. She flips; she flops; off she goes. It might surprise Senator Dunn to know that one of the reasons this chamber exists is to pass legislation. We are not here only to listen to all sorts of comments. It is not as though she does not have her right of say. She speaks on the adjournment every night, boring everyone absolutely witless with her views. But we tolerate that; that is her safety valve. The adjournment provides an opportunity for the crackpots of the Parliament to come in and say what they like. I do not want to take this much further. We are already up to paper No. 49. </PARA>

The Australian Democrats support the motion because they object to the manner in which a government response to a major report was brought before the Senate. It is an acknowledged practice in this place that a government response to a report is given the same standing as the report itself. Therefore, it should have been tabled by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), thereby giving honourable senators the opportunity to speak for 30 minutes to the Government's response.

I object to this technique. Senator Ray and Senator Button have claimed that this is an abuse of procedure. I say that the placement of a response to a report amongst Government papers is an abuse of procedure. That is why we believe that it should now be debated. We object to the abuse of procedure by the Government. This is our first objection. It is not a paper; it is a response to a report and therefore has a different status.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second thing we object to is the allegation that this is a stunt. The placement of this response, hidden in this list of documents, is a stunt supreme. The stunt making has come from the Government and we are simply responding to it. As for the point that we are wasting the taxpayers' money this afternoon by taking 20 minutes of the Senate's time, I remind Senator Ray that this 500-page report about an absolutely critical aspect of Australian safety is also taxpayers' money. It is a major report. It was tabled in this Parliament and addressed as a major report. The Government has now responded to it and we cannot address its response in a serious way. The way that the Government has treated it is the waste of taxpayers' money. It is an offence to the people who took part in the process of formulating this report and the thousands of hours that went into its production that it is, by means of a stunt, being buried among these papers today. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is calling upon us to cooperate with it in its processes. Seven Democrats cooperate with the Government day after day, week after week, month after month. We find it offensive that we are being accused this afternoon of being uncooperative because we are speaking in defence of the normal, legitimate and established procedures of the Senate. I speak very strongly in support of this contingency motion because this response should have the standing of a report and honourable senators should each have 30 minutes to address it, because it concerns the safety of Australians. We have argued that it is a flawed report in the first place, and we argue that the Government's response to it is equally flawed. </PARA>

<PARA> It is a very misleading document in the way it has been presented-even before it gets onto the agenda of the Senate.

It is very important that it be fully debated in this place before the Senate rises next week, otherwise it may never see the light of day next year. I think Senator Dunn is quite right when she says that it is so embarrassing for the Government that it does not want it fully debated. That does not give enough credibility to the people who worked on the report initially, to the many people who made submissions or to the many Australians who oppose the visits of the warships.

There is not the slightest doubt that the Government's response to this report should have been brought into the Senate as a ministerial statement to enable the Senate to debate it in that fashion. That has not been the case, but we have a series of arrangements concerning the conduct of business for these last sitting weeks of the parliamentary session which looks like having the Senate sitting later than ever before to get through government business. Those arrangements were agreed to some weeks ago and, as the Manager of Government Business, Senator Ray, has said, no opposition was raised to the conduct of business at that time.

We approached the Government and came to an amicable arrangement with the Manager of Government Business to enable that paper to be discussed.

I do not agree that the Independent and Democrat senators do not receive a fair share of the time available in the Senate. I would say that the back bench senators of the Government, in particular, and of the Opposition receive far less time and far fewer opportunities to air their views because they work as a team and try to cooperate to see that the democratic process proceeds.

<PARA> Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-This report deals with the operations of the Committee in 1987-88. Included in the report are statistical data and analytical discussion of the scrutiny it has undertaken during that period. This report, together with the regular reports and Alert Digests issued by the Committee, describe the parameters within which the Committee operates. A perusal of the three annual reports of the Committee, the paper entitled The Operation of the Australian Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills 1981-85, printed as Parliamentary Paper No. 317 of 1985, together with the regular reports and Alert Digests, will inform senators, Ministers and their advisers of how the Committee has applied the principles set out in its terms of reference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I place on record my thanks to the senators who served on the Committee in 1987-88 for their high service. A legislative scrutiny committee depends to a large extent on the input of its legal adviser. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee has been fortunate to have the services of Professor J. L. R. Davis of the Law Faculty of the Australian National University and on behalf of the Committee I wish to record my thanks to Professor Davis. </PARA>
<PARA> The report deals with the work of the Committee from July 1987 to June 1988. The report includes statistics relevant to the work of the Committee over the year as well as the manner in which the Committee has applied the principles set out within its terms of reference. A matter of particular significance to the operation of the Committee is the number of amendments made by the Parliament as a result of the Committee's comments. These are incorporated in Appendix II of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> Ministerial responses have become better both in terms of content and expedition. Ministers' responses which treat the comments of the Committee as constructive, positive efforts to improve the quality of the information available to the Senate greatly assist both the Committee and the Senate. Given the time strictures within which the Committee operates, the Committee cannot and does not hold its reports and digests out as exhaustive critiques of all provisions of all Bills that come within the terms of reference of the Committee. What the Committee does is to examine every Bill that is introduced into the Parliament in a technical, non-partisan fashion. The product of this examination by the Committee is that any measures in a Bill that may breach the principles of the Committee are placed in an Alert Digest. The Alert Digest makes the Committee's comments on Bills introduced into the Parliament available to the Senate in the week in which the Bill is introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The role of the Committee has developed to the point where it is now an expeditious, non-partisan and effective instrument of the Senate to help it review legislation. The Committee acts as a guardian of personal rights and liberties, examines administrative procedures falling within its terms of reference, and acts as a watchdog against the erosion of the prerogatives of Parliament. The Committee remains concerned at the continuing practice of legislation by press release. This arises when a change to legislation is announced, usually by a Minister, at times months before the draft legislation is available to the Parliament. The practice causes people to reorder their affairs to accord with the policies announced in the press release. This means that Parliament comes to look at legislation after people have acted in reliance of the press release. If the legislation is changed people have acted on a basis which turns out to be incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was concerned in 1987-88 with the number of provisions in Bills allowing for delegated legislation. The Committee will examine closely all clauses in Bills providing for delegated legislation. It considers that all delegated legislation should be numbered, consolidated from time to time and published to the same general standards as instruments in the Statutory Rules series. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee is effective only when it receives support from both Ministers and senators. It is when the reports and Alert Digests issued by the Committee are acted upon by senators and Ministers that it has maximum impact in improving the quality of debate in respect of legislation passed by the Senate. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2F4">Senator BURNS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the report I have just tabled the Committee has recommended the refurbishment of the Reserve Bank of Australia, 60 Collins Street, Melbourne at an estimated cost of $25m at June 1989 prices. In recommending that the work proceed, the Committee has drawn attention to a number of matters. The Committee is concerned that staff will be occupying floors while asbestos is actually being removed from those floors. The Committee has recommended that the Reserve Bank examine the need for this and also that strict safety measures be adhered to during asbestos removal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee has questioned the need for modifications to the ground floor facade at an estimated cost of $800,000 and has recommended that the Reserve Bank re-examine the need for this expenditure. Finally, the Committee has recommended that the Reserve Bank give consideration to the provision of additional toilets for the disabled. The Committee does not believe that the provision of only one toilet for the disabled in a building of 17 storeys is adequate. </PARA>
<PARA> The year 1989 has been an extremely busy one for the Public Works Committee. It has tabled 26 reports and held public hearings and inspections in all capital cities except Adelaide and also in many regional centres. The Committee held 66 meetings during the year, made up of public hearings, inspections and private meetings. In total during 1989 the Committee recommended the expenditure of $1,100m on public works proposals. In fact, apart from 1972 when 35 reports were presented, including projects in Papua New Guinea and local Northern Territory projects, this is the highest number of reports the Committee has presented on purely domestic projects. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Button for being in the chamber for the debate on the Bounty (Photographic Film) Bill 1989. Senator Button will appreciate that this is of considerable importance to the people of Australia because it dips into the pockets of Australian taxpayers for about $36m to finance a subsidy to an Australian subsidiary of a multinational company in order to enable the Australian subsidiary to send that $36m off to the multinational in the United States. A couple of matters are raised in the second reading speech but we have some difficulty in finding them in the Bill. We seek an explanation from the Minister as to how these arrangements are supported. For example, the Minister, in the second paragraph of his second reading speech, says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation will remain in force for a further period of two years to 31 December 1994 for the purpose of securing the performance of undertakings under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The first question is: what undertakings? Would the Minister be prepared to tell us what undertakings have been provided to, I presume, the Government? As the Australian taxpayers are footing this bill, they are entitled to know what those undertakings are. The second question is: Who has given the undertakings? Is it Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd or is it Eastman-Kodak, the United States parent company? The third question is: If those undertakings have been given only by the Australian subsidiary, how will they be fulfilled if the parent company takes some action either to liquidate or change the structure of the Australian subsidiary so that it is no longer in the form of the company which has apparently entered into the undertakings?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to ask a couple of questions about the second reading speech. A claim is made on page three of the second reading speech that one of the prerequisites by Eastman-Kodak for Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd to continue operations in Australia was that it would deliver $20m per annum in productivity improvements in addition, of course, to seeking the Federal and State Government subsidies and whatever the Victorian Government provided by way of bounties and assistance. Did the Government assure itself of this $20m per annum improvement in productivity? If that is the case, how were these improvements to be achieved? The Minister in his second reading speech stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian operation is recognised . . . as an efficient and world competitive operation. </PARA>
<PARA>At no stage is the company mentioned as being economically viable. Last year's annual report of Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd showed that the return on shareholders' funds for what was a very good year, considering the Bicentennial, the operating profit-in other words, before tax-was about 13.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bolkus who came in here at the end of the second reading debate, rather than Senator Button, said that the net benefit of tax-I think he said over the next five years-would be $120m. Did he really mean net benefit? Did he mean company taxable income or was that supposed to be the net benefit less the bounty and the assistance provided by the Victorian Government? I have some other questions but I think they are sufficient for the Minister to go on with. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A couple of questions were asked and a number of statements made in the course of the remarks by Senator Lewis and Senator Parer. Senator Lewis said that $36m of taxpayers' money will be sent off to the United States to satisfy that fat multinational to which he has obviously taken a dislike. Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd has not paid a dividend to its parent company since 1983. The proceeds of the business have been reinvested in the company and the proceeds of the bounty will go to further investment in Kodak (Australasia). Senator Lewis asked a question about securing performance as it was referred to in the second reading speech. The methods of securing performance will be contained in the regulations made under this Bill, which will be tabled in the Parliament and subject to the normal scrutiny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator asked who had given the undertakings-Eastman-Kodak in the United States or Kodak (Australasia). The answer is that both have given the undertakings. He then asked: How can the undertakings be fulfilled if they were given only by the Australian subsidiary? That question becomes irrelevant in the light of the answer I have just given. Senator Parer asked about productivity improvement. Kodak (Australasia) has given certain undertakings to its parent company about productivity improvement. That includes rearrangements in the work force, award restructuring, some changes to management, management practices, some increased volume as a result of investment-a variety of things which go to the question of improved productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Parer referred to the fact that Kodak (Australasia) was described as efficient and world competitive and asked whether it was economic in the sense that it was providing only a 13.5 per cent return on shareholders' funds. The answer to that question is yes, it is regarded as economic by the company. Certainly it is regarded by the Government as a viable economic unit. With regard to the question of tax liability, if the plant closed its operation here during the period 1990 to 1994 it would be $80m and with the bounty it would be $200m in corporate tax, with a net benefit of $120m. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to argue with the Minister about what will happen to the proceeds of the bounty, but it is clear that the whole purpose of this arrangement on the part of Kodak (Australasia) and Eastman-Kodak is for Kodak (Australasia) to start paying a dividend to its parent company. While it might use the proceeds of the bounty in investment in plant or equipment or some other form of investment, the ultimate result of this procedure will be that a dividend will be paid to the parent company. So that, in effect, is taking money out of one pocket and putting it in to another, using different proceeds and funds to pay dividend. I say to the Minister that the whole truth of the matter is that this bounty is being paid to enable the subsidiary company to pay a dividend to the parent company. As to the regulations, I presume those undertakings have been already made, and I ask the Minister to confirm that the undertakings have been made. Is he in a position at this stage to provide us with a copy of the proposed regulations so that the Parliament can have some knowledge of what the undertakings are about before we pass this Bill?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a question of Senator Button relating to the points Senator Lewis and Senator Parer were making. Has any undertaking been given by Kodak (Australasia) to meet the so-called commitments outlined in the second reading speech before it pays any dividend to Eastman Kodak out of the proceeds of the bounty? Also, I think I am right in saying that the Minister has emphasised on numerous occasions that this arrangement should not be seen by other companies as setting any sort of a precedent. I noticed that in the second reading speech the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) made the point that Eastman Kodak is unwilling to close down its less efficient operations-that is, operations less efficient than those in Australia-in other parts of the world for strategic reasons. I would think there are probably a lot of international companies with subsidiaries in Australia, like Eastman-Kodak, which take investment decisions globally on strategic as well as purely economic bases. Without naming specific industries, we could all think of some. Why should none of those companies regard this decision in relation to Kodak (Australasia) as in any way constituting a form of precedent for them as well?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are four points in what has been put by Senator Lewis and Senator Short. Before we get too excited about this legislation and go off down a dangerous track, I must say that it is implicit in some of the suggestions from the Opposition that there is something unique about a bounty being paid to a multinational company operating in Australia. There is not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator MacGibbon" NAMEID="YH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGibbon</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I beg your pardon, but it is. If the honourable senator does not mind, I will deal with the speeches that have been made on the Opposition side. He can have a yarn in the pub about it later on. Senator Short's follow-up question goes to the point of whether we have an undertaking that there will be no dividend paid to Eastman Kodak by this company until these obligations have been discharged? That point followed from Senator Lewis's point, which suggested that this money was being paid irresponsibly by the Government, sloshed into the coffers of Kodak (Australasia), whence it would be sloshed into the coffers of the big multinational monster Eastman-Kodak. I do not think honourable senators opposite ought to get too excited about that point. For years industry assistance has been administered in this country and it has been paid to companies irrespective of where their corporate headquarters happen to be-whether it be in Australia or somewhere else. Strange as it may seem, IBM receives a small bounty under legislation which honourable senators opposite voted for. A number of foreign-owned textile companies receive bounties under legislation for which honourable senators opposite voted. Honourable senators opposite did not get too fussed about that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That does not make any difference to the principle. This coming in here and bleating in an Orwellian manner-four legs good, two legs bad sort of stuff-is really getting a bit silly. We have to deal with the argument, not bleat away like Senator Short does, and did a minute ago. I am just uttering a bit of warning about getting too fussed about that sort of stuff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Lewis asked me whether the undertakings had already been received. The answer is yes. He asked could he look at the draft regulations as soon as possible. The answer is yes, probably today. They will come before Parliament in the usual course. Regulations are not always available--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Lewis" NAMEID="NG4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator Lewis</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, of course it would, but that does not mean that those opposite will not do it. That is the normal procedure. We will make them available as quickly as we can. Senator Short asked had there been any undertaking by Kodak (Australasia) not to pay a dividend to Eastman-Kodak until the undertakings it had made under this legislation had been discharged. The answer is no, there has been no such undertaking. On present form there will be no dividend either because it is committed to using the bounty for investment purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally Senator Lewis took up the point of whether there was any precedent in this. There is no precedent. Senator Lewis referred to the words `Eastman-Kodak, for strategic reasons, has decided to keep plants in some other countries' in the second reading speech. That is true, but that is not why we are paying Kodak (Australasia) a bounty. It has nothing to do with the payment of a bounty. The company has strategic reasons for keeping a plant in Europe. The division of the Eastman-Kodak empire is quite simple. United States operations are serviced by United States plants and South American operations are serviced by a South American plant-protected by a 60 per cent tariff, as I recall, against Japanese competition, which is why the company wants to keep that operation. There is a European operation. Having regard to the post-1992 integration of Europe the company wants to keep the plant there. They are strategic reasons. From Australia's point of view the important thing about the Eastman-Kodak empire is that Australia has the plant which provides the exports to the Asia-Pacific region. That is where the proceeds of the Kodak (Australasia) plant go. That is strategic for Eastman-Kodak and it is also, in my view, strategic for us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On page 4 of the second reading speech there is a list of some commitments which Eastman-Kodak and Kodak (Australasia) Ltd apparently have given. The fifth is in relation to Kodak (Australasia) maintaining its mandate for the Asia-Pacific region over the next five years. Is the Minister aware of a recent opportunity for the sale of over $1m worth of Kodak products into mainland China where the executive of Kodak (Australasia) simply refused to enter into the contract on the basis that the deal would have to go through a Hong Kong agent, notwithstanding the fact that an Australian agent who was in mainland China had been offered the contract? Firstly, is the Minister aware of that? Secondly, can the Minister explain to the Senate what is meant by Kodak (Australasia) maintaining its mandate for the Asia-Pacific region? If the Hong Kong agent were another subsidiary of Eastman-Kodak, which I think it is, Eastman-Kodak would in effect be interfering with the so-called mandate for the Asia-Pacific region. So, although the product may be supplied from the Australian plant, the price and other factors are determined by Eastman-Kodak and not necessarily by the Australian subsidiary. Can the Minister give us some explanation about this so-called mandate for the Asia-Pacific region?</PARA></TALK.START>

It is agreed between Eastman-Kodak and Kodak (Australasia) that the mandate will be maintained, and extended to embrace one other country.

All the excitement need not have happened. I suppose one day in the life of a journalist is something we have all got to put up with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Kodak receives on a regular basis two or three calls a week from people purporting to have export orders or who are working on export orders and who say, `We will buy this much film and sell it in China'-or Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the United Kingdom or wherever. As a matter of policy, Kodak does not follow up those sorts of contracts unless the firm is known to be a very reliable one and unless substantial information is provided on the possible opportunity. In the specific instance to which Senator Lewis refers, the firm was not known to Kodak. The approach was made to a relatively junior officer who is not involved in export matters, and substantial follow-up information was not provided. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important point is that photographic film is a perishable item. In the past Kodak has had experience of exporters, or potential exporters of the kind referred to, buying their film and selling it some time later in another country when the quality has deteriorated. Kodak provides, as it were, a daily service by air into its market in Asia and is properly concerned that the quality of its film is maintained and that the appropriate shelf life is preserved. If distribution is allowed to fall into the hands of a wide variety of people who may not ensure quality control one runs a risk of damaging the reputation of the product. Kodak has had that experience in the past, which makes it very cautious about some of these sorts of suggestions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I turn to another matter. In relation to current competition in Australia with Kodak, the Minister will recall his assuring the Senate that there was no-one in Australia who competed with Kodak. But I think the Minister was not aware at that stage that Kodak operates a subsidiary which is involved in film processing. So a large number of small businesses in Australia compete with Kodak. I think the Kodak subsidiary is called the Rabbit processing company. So a large number of Australian film processors are in competition with the subsidiary of a multinational which is receiving this very substantial bounty payment. As the Minister was apparently unaware of that competition, I ask him whether that affected his judgment in any way. What sort of undertaking did he get from Kodak in relation to the fact that the Government is subsidising Kodak? A large number of these Australian business people allege that Kodak is undercutting them in a film processing price war and that it has been enabled to do this by the bounty being paid to it by this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of companies might be alleging that, but a discerning, astute chap like Senator Lewis will quickly realise that that is not a likely course of events. When I said that there was no competition for Kodak in Australia, that is true. The legislation which we have before us and which we are debating is called the Bounty (Photographic Film) Bill. If Senator Lewis looks at the definitions in the Bill, he will see that it is about paying bounty in respect of the sensitising and finishing of film, a production activity in relation to new film. On page 2 of the Bill, `relevant activity' is defined as relating to the production of photographic film, meaning any activity that is part of the sensitising operation, which is a production activity-making films, as distinct from processing them-or the finishing operations undertaken in the course of producing film.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to a question, Senator Button threw away a figure when he said that over the next five years, with the bounty, the taxation revenue payable by Kodak (Australasia) would be $200m. That is $40m on average over the next five years. I would like to know the basis of that throwaway figure of $200m. The reason I ask is that, in the financial year ended December 1988, the income tax attributable to profit was $13.4m. With a pretty high operating profit-largely, I believe, because of the effects of the bicentennial year-on a calculation that I did on the basis of the annual report and adding in the bounty effect and the Victorian Government assistance effect of $2m, this would lift the operating profit or taxable income of Kodak (Australasia), assuming that last year's figures are indicative of the future, to about $49m. On the basis of 39 per cent tax, it would provide a taxation revenue to the Government of $19m, which includes the bounty, the Victorian Government assistance and the tax thereon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister has said that, with this bounty and the Victorian Government assistance package, suddenly the tax will rise to $40m a year.

Presumably film would still be marketed in Australia under the Kodak brand name, Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd, and Kodak would come out with a profit on which tax would be paid. Senator Button is saying that the manufacturing set-up-I want to come to that in a minute-of the sensitising or finishing, or whatever the two processes are called, would somehow disappear altogether if the bounty were not provided.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would just like to ask the Minister a couple of short questions. How can the Government or the Minister deny that there is favouritism shown to certain manufacturers in Australia when it comes to creating bounties in various areas. For example, I refer to the April statement when the bounty on farm machinery and farm harvesting equipment manufactured in Australia was removed, saving about $29.5m. In that case a sunset clause was applicable under which the bounty was due to run out at June 1990-I am pretty sure that that is the date.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The removal of the bounty, which was announced in the April statement-although I do not think that the bounty was actually removed until June or July-provided a saving of $29.5m. The company that was mainly affected was John Shearer Ltd in Adelaide-the leading manufacturer of Australia's tillage machinery. That company was on the brink of disaster for a few reasons. That company was denied the bounty even though, legally, the bounty should have continued for a further 12 months. Now, in this case, six months later, more than $29.5m is paid to a single firm with its manufacturing operations in Melbourne. I cannot see why there should be a difference: either both companies or neither company should have been helped if we want to have a level playing field. John Shearer Ltd is strictly an Australian company, manufacturing in Australia, although I believe that it has an assembly factory in South Africa. The company has been thinking of shifting its manufacturing operation to South Africa because it cannot carry on in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other question I want to ask the Minister is: is it correct that in return for the payment over three years of $36m, Kodak has undertaken to stay in Australia only for the period of the bounty? In other words, in three years time will Kodak have satisfied its obligations for receipt of the bounty?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. In the earlier part of the question Senator Panizza referred to the bounties paid for different manufacturing industries. By the way, I think Senator Panizza made a slip when he said that the agricultural equipment bounty was $29.5m. That is right, but that is per year. The Kodak bounty is $36m payable over three years-$12 million per year. That is the comparative figure that Senator Panizza has to refer to. Bounties over the years have been altered, reduced or abolished depending on fiscal circumstances of Budgets. That is what happened to the farm machinery bounty. The farm machinery industry was advised at the time that after many years of encouragement from government and assistance by way of bounty, it had done nothing in terms of export performance, nothing in terms of mergers of companies that should have been merged. There was very little, if any, export activity from that industry. There was no point in sustaining the industry by a bounty in the circumstances in which it existed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Panizza mentioned John Shearer Ltd, which is a firm with which I am quite familiar. When the bounty was removed there was a bit of a noise from John Shearer's, but that company had more and bigger problems to make a noise about, as Senator Panizza well knows, which have now been resolved and Shearer's is continuing in business. Senator Panizza mentioned that John Shearer Ltd is an Australian company. I am afraid that makes no difference from the point of view of the argument. What he said was nice and warm emotionally. I share the honourable senator's view that it would be nice to give bounties only to Australian companies and not to other companies which operate here, but that cannot be done under the Constitution. If a company is registered in Australia it is eligible for the benefits and detriments associated with the law of this country. One cannot discriminate on that basis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to return to a couple of points made by the Minister, partly in response to questions from this side of the chamber. The Minister said that no precedent for other companies is involved in this decision. In that sense he also mentioned the situation of IBM Australia Ltd. My understanding is that IBM receives a bounty-as does any other bounty recipient in Australia, with the exception of Kodak now-as a result of the operation of proper, normal, due process which includes, in particular, reference to report by the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC). I would like confirmation from the Minister on that point. I would also like to know how many other companies have been awarded bounties in Australia without having gone through the IAC reference and report process. To some extent, this is a sideline to the precedent issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I come back to the main point of my earlier question, in which I pointed out that the Minister had said in the second reading speech that there were strategic reasons for the decision by Kodak (Australasia) Ltd to look at the question of moving from here. The Minister said, quite rightly, that Kodak has a strategic global plan. But so do a large number of other American, British and Japanese international companies. I would like to press the Minister further on this because I do not understand what makes the situation of Kodak unique to such an extent that the Government believes it creates no precedent at all for any other situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to pursue a little further the response of the Minister to Senator Lewis's question about the measurement aspect. Senator Lewis referred to a statement in the second reading speech as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Any changes in Government policy that would provide a comparative financial advantage to Kodak Australasia-for example, reduction of corporate tax rates or of tariffs on input costs-will be taken into account and any assistance provided reduced accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Minister: What is meant precisely by the word `comparative'? Comparative with what? Does it mean other producers in Australia or other companies in Australia producing any other product, or is Kodak being compared with producers of this product in other countries? That part of the second reading speech seems very vague. </PARA>
<PARA> Reference was made in the speech to the reduction of tariffs on input costs. Even if there were no change in stated tariff rates, the amount of duty paid on input costs would vary with variations in the exchange rate. Obviously, the Minister is referring to input costs relating to imports. I would like to understand better just how these changes will be measured, because it is not immediately apparent. What is apparent is that it would be an extraordinarily complex issue, and the method of valuation would be very important in that context. </PARA>

I do not think it would be terribly important, unless one is feeling a bit obsessive about all this. Any company operating in a floating exchange rate environment has to take the swings and roundabouts of the movements in the exchange rate. Clearly, what is meant is an alteration to the rate of the tariff, because that would be consequent upon Government action. That is what I meant when I referred to the tariff.

Sure, they all have different policies which are adopted by their corporate headquarters. Some of them may have a strategy rather like Kodak's, of dividing up the world and so on. Senator Short could take this debate a lot further if he could point to one of them operating in Australia which has been here for a long time and has exported $160m worth of goods manufactured in Australia to Asia-sophisticated manufactured goods. If Senator Short could point to one company that was doing that and was in trouble through no fault of its own, he would be pretty close to his precedent, but he cannot. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to follow up the question Senator Short raised in relation to profit, because I raised it earlier. The profit last year was $35m with a return on shareholders' funds of 13.5 per cent, which Senator Button said he thought was pretty reasonable. Subsequently, in response to a question I asked in regard to the anticipated future profit, Senator Button indicated that Kodak (Australasia) had advised him that for 1990 it anticipated that the actual tax bill would be of the order of $35m. A quick calculation backwards on that, which includes the bounty and the Victorian Government assistance, would indicate that the operating profit, without the bounty and assistance, then goes to $76m, which shows a return on shareholders' funds of the order of 28 per cent. The reason we are questioning this is that Senator Button has intimated, according to newspaper reports, that he felt he was blackmailed even though he did not like it. I am wondering whether he was not conned as well. If the figure he gave me earlier is correct, we now have a company that says that next year, excluding the bounty and the $2m, it will have an operating profit before tax of $76m, of a 28 per cent return on total shareholders' funds, including the funds that have been reinvested since 1983.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question I am asking, in addition to those asked by Senator Short, is: How can the Minister justify the payment of the bounty under those conditions at a rate of return which most companies would give their eye teeth for? Why would a company with that sort of potential require Government assistance?</PARA>

It decided to cut back production capacity in Australia unless the performance of the company improved.

No one could claim that a company which forecasts that next year, pre-bounty, it will make a 27 to 28 per cent return on its shareholders' funds has economic problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will now move to the manufacturing side, which is made up of two parts-the sensitising operation and, I think it is called, the finishing operation. With the provision of taxpayers' money through a bounty, why was it possible to get only an assurance-assuming from Kodak (Australasia) and Eastman-Kodak-for sensitising operations for three years? That is the tricky part; the high technology part. Senator Button, in his second reading speech, makes great play of the fact that we will be exporting ETMs, elaborately transformed manufactures, through Kodak because it happens to be the second largest exporter of these items in Australia-which is a pretty sad indictment of this country, though I am not holding the Minister responsible. But that is for three years only. I would like a response from the Minister as to why that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Having committed taxpayers' money to this extent, we have to be suspicious that at the end of three years we will end up importing sensitised film-whether it be from Brazil, the Philippines, or somewhere else-and we will be left with what is called the finishing operation, which is cutting and packaging. That only needs to go on for two years. How confident is the Minister that this injection-if we can call it that-of taxpayers' money will benefit this plant for the long term and not just the short term? Are we not running a risk of just postponing the inevitable?</PARA>

The Ford Motor Co. of Australia exports. Hopefully it will increase its exports significantly over the next few years because it is doing a good job and it is confident that it will continue to do so. Let us say that the parent company in the United States proposed to take a similar decision in relation to Ford Australia that Eastman-Kodak put to the Minister in relation to Kodak (Australasia).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would not be a big package. What is the real reason for handing out this money? From what I have been able to glean this afternoon, it is not economic. We already have the Minister's assurance that next year the company will not be paid any bounty and that it will have a rate of return on total shareholders' funds of 27 to 28 per cent. The Minister also says that there is a risk involved. In other words, there is no guarantee whatsoever that after three years we will be producing sensitised film in Australia-and I suppose the chances are that we will not-and that at the end of five years we will be cutting and packaging film. So I am not too sure-and I am not sure whether the Minister himself can justify it, although I know he will do his best-that this support can be justified.</PARA></TALK.START>

We have not been given long term guarantees that the company will continue with this high technology and the export of elaborately transformed manufactured goods, because that is assured for only three years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the second reading speech on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1989 the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) referred to the fact that schedule 6 operates on and from 1 August 1989 and provides quota free and duty free access for certain ski boots and cross-country ski footwear. I do not have any particular objection to that exercise. I am raising not the $6m a year that we have been discussing for Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd-it is not even $600,000; it is not even $60,000-but an amount of $6,000. We are quite happy to allow ski boots and cross-country skiwear to be dealt with in this way yet, seemingly, we are buried in an almost miasma of confusion with regard to boots for spina bifida children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have engaged quite properly-and I am not objecting to this; in fact I supported at the time the harmonisation of the tariffs-in changing the definition with regard to orthopaedic appliances. We have adopted the harmonised definition-and I am not objecting to that either-which says that orthopaedic appliances mean footwear made to measure for a specific disorder. The difficulty is that the interpretation that the Australian Customs Service has put on `made to measure' is, I feel, such a pedantic one as to really be very difficult to swallow. We are looking at boots for spina bifida children, which have to be placed on the child's feet at a pretty early stage so that weak feet, paralysed feet or feet not treated very rapidly do not end up severely deformed. </PARA>
<PARA> It so happens that the boots that are provided in Australia are all imported. They come from France. We import about 250 pairs a year. The strange thing about the way that they are made is this: a spina bifida child has a mould made of its feet. That mould is then used to select, from a range of shoes which are pre-made, the shoe that fits that particular child. To do anything else, quite frankly, would be pretty stupid because that is the best way of dealing with the issue. One has to cycle through a number of these boots. They are quite expensive. The basic cost is about $60 each, and we are putting a 45 per cent import duty on them. I say it is 45 per cent, but the Minister might be able to find out something else. I have ploughed through hundreds of pages dealing with footwear and it seems that, if there is a stitch at the top rather than at the bottom, the amount is changed. I originally thought the import duty was 50 per cent. I am lead to believe that it is actually 45 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The differences between these boots and ordinary footwear are quite extensive in terms of the height; the ankle support for rigidity; the reinforcement to prevent sideways movement; the arch support, dealing with the junction of the back foot and front foot movement; the front part, which has to be additionally wide to allow free movement of toes; the heel, which has a one centimetre maximum to allow the back foot-forward foot movement; the sole, which has to be made of leather as an anti-skid arrangement; and the cushions, which are very important for children who do not have much feeling in their feet because they could be knocked, have serious bruising and not know it. That could rub, and there could be additional problems there. That means you have to have a very supple leather with a lack of stitching so that any risk of irritation is avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> All of that, quite frankly, constitutes a highly specialised boot. But the interpretation of `made to measure' has been done in what I consider to be a most extraordinarily pedantic and bureaucratic way. These boots are made to measure. In fact, if the people in the Australian Customs Service knew anything about the way that made to measure boots are made, they would know that most of them are made in an identical fashion. The feet are measured up, and then the customer goes into a room and selects from ones already there. Those boots cost about $300. I happen to know that, if Senator Button is interested, because my son has to have them and I have seen them made. That is perfectly all right. But I ask: how precisely are imported boots going to be made to measure in any form under the interpretation given by the Australian Customs Service? Presumably, one would go overseas and have them measured up. Alternatively, one would have to have them measured up here and send measurements overseas. They would be made up, sent back for fitting, and then sent overseas again. We are dealing with a most extraordinary proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The total cost to revenue would be about $6,000. I hope that the Minister is listening because this is an important issue. It is only about 250 pairs of boots for children suffering from spina bifida. I am sorry it is not about Kodak! In fact, this absurd exercise has been going on now for months. People have been flying around the country. I think we have spent more than $6,000 already. Today I ask, `When are we going to get a decision on this?'. The Minister has somebody in his Department-in fact, two people-dealing with this issue now, and we are told that there will be no decision until the middle of January. Quite frankly, it is not good enough. This is the type of thing that could and should have been solved within a day, and that should have been done months ago. It is not a difficult problem. If, in fact, the interpretation is such as to make it absolutely impossible to solve this problem, the Minister has the discretion under the Act to be able to deal with it. Do not tell me that we are going to find ourselves in a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade debate over 250 pairs of boots in the harmonising exercise. I do not want to involve myself in the harmonising exercise-as I have already said, we support it totally-but that is the excuse I keep getting in the myriad of letters that are churned out on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I am appealing to the Minister for a little commonsense in what has become a bureaucratic maze. It is no fault of the Minister. I am not castigating him on it. It is probably the first he has heard about it. It is just one of these absurd situations where everybody feels they have to run along with words which could not possibly have the meaning being put on them. This situation could easily be solved by the operation of the Minister's discretion, which hopefully could be done within the next 24 hours. </PARA>
<PARA> That is all I really want to say on the matter. I want the situation to be cleaned up, as I am quite sure the Minister does, so that these people who have these children and who are dealing with this matter are not put to the type of expense that is now suggested, that is, that they are going to have boots made at $300 a pair. If children cycle through these boots at a fairly rapid rate, it is already an extremely large cost to add to families that are already bearing quite significant add-on costs as a result of having a child with spina bifida. </PARA>

Quite frankly, I do not think there should be any more letters written on this matter, anybody else jetting around the country, or somebody highly paid sitting in one of the Government's departments until the middle of January working out whether we should or should not. Knowing the Minister's decisive manner of dealing with these things, I am sure that he could fix up the situation in a couple of minutes after he gets out of the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just put my first amendment on the table to use that device to question the Government as to why it is doing things and to cover the generality of the whole procedure of moving to guidelines, getting away from the specifics. I used the formal device of moving that clauses 18 to 21 inclusive be opposed to give the Committee the opportunity to question the Government as to why on broad grounds it is moving away from specific and legislated definitions or set of definitions into a series of guidelines and from particular goods to a class of goods. I ask the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), who is at the table, why the Government is doing what it has done in this proposed legislation. I read the second reading speech with interest. I make the comment in relation to section XVa that the theme of the speech is that there are some minor administrative problems that need to be corrected. It said that there is a need for some slight finetuning to the administration. In the second reading speech, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Experience with the system has pointed to several changes which could-</PARA>
<PARA>I note use of the word `could', not `would'-</PARA>
<PARA>be made to improve operational efficiency. In the May 1988 Economic Statement the Government announced that it would modify the system to more closely align its operation with the Government's industry and technology policy objectives.</PARA>
<PARA> Subsequent to that Economic Statement, decisions by the Federal Court have highlighted restrictive and narrow interpretations to various definitions contained in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> To restore the Australian Customs Service's ability to administer the legislation in accordance with the Government's intentions, it is necessary to make appropriate changes to the legislation and fine tune operational aspects of the system. The amendments proposed in this Bill seek to achieve this. </PARA>
<PARA>I argue that the theme of the speech is for some administrative finetuning, yet we have a major rewrite of the Bill; there is not only a rewrite of the provisions, but also a change in the whole format. Whereas before we had very precise definitions that had to be met in order to qualify for the importation of goods which were not manufactured in Australia and for which there was no readily available Australian substitute, very precise conditions defined in law, they have now all be thrown out and we are given some guidelines which will be written by the Australian Customs Service and proclaimed by the Minister. They will be disallowable instruments laid before the Senate, but we will move from the precise to the imprecise. We will move from the known to the unknown and the unknowable in so far as they can be changed quite readily. I wonder whether the Minister for Resources can offer some explanation as to why this is being done. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of explanation, I diverge a little into the history of the matter. The Industries Assistance Commission report of 2 July 1982 recommended some changes to improve predictability and certainty and to reduce the scope for dispute. Both of those faults were undeniably present in the guidelines that existed prior to the 1983 changes to the Act which created the present section XVa. When Senator Button introduced the scheme in 1983, in his second reading speech he also said that he wanted to reduce disagreement and legal disputation and to achieve the result of predictable administration. The legislation was incorporated in the parent Customs Act and it has been in place now for about six years. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at what has happened in those six years, we see that the Australian Customs Service has struggled since 1 July 1983 to retain its earlier by-law control. It has challenged the legislation by whatever opportunities open to it in an attempt to get back to the old system, which was clearly unsatisfactory. It has tried to limit the width of making particular concessions where there was any hint of questioning by local industry and it was at variance with the expressed law. Looking at the history of the six years of the current legislation, we see that the Australian Customs Service has nearly always made concessions when the local industry agreed. It has never stood on its own feet and made decisions on their merits. That can be seen from the statements the Service has made to people who have applied. It has tended to avoid the second stage of the requirement of section XVa that it has to consider the relevance of cross-elasticity in demand. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of this, we have seen the Federal Court actions of Davies Craig Pty Ltd, Amcor Ltd and Corinthian Industries (Sydney) Pty Ltd where the judgments have all gone against the Customs Service and it has been advised to reconsider its decisions on the correct basis. In my judgment, we have not seen a cooperative move by the Australian Customs Service to administer the legislation as it is on the books. When the matter has been raised in the courts, it has been found repeatedly that the Customs Service has not interpreted the law. I want to know why the law is not being interpreted and has therefore not really had a fair trial. In the light of the IAC report which set up the legislation in 1983, the Minister's second reading statements when the amendments were put in the Act in 1983 and the Minister's second reading statements today in which he said that he wants administrative finetuning, I want to know why we do not fix the present law instead of throwing it out entirely. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The chamber has before it an amendment to the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) which has been moved by Senator MacGibbon on behalf of the Opposition. Having a few minutes ago answered some very detailed questions by Senator MacGibbon, I am coming quickly to a basis of knowledge from which I can supply authoritative answers. I cannot be 100 per cent sure that I can answer all his questions in the way he posed them, but I will take a run at it by going back to what was said in the second reading debate and, hopefully, picking up the answers to his questions by a full explanation of the points that the honourable senator's amendment implies. With your leave, Mr Temporary Chairman, I will consult my notes fairly extensively in this process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The rationale for the Government's proposed amendments of the commercial tariff concession system (CTCS) in clauses 18 to 28 of the Bill was well set out, as the Senate should be aware, in Senator Coulter's second reading debate comments. It is not, as Senator MacGibbon has said, or would wish us to believe, an attempt to pre-empt the announced review of the system by the new Industry Commission. While review by the Industry Commission of the CTCS is in fact programmed, the review is not expected to commence until late next year, and it is anticipated that it will be of about 12 months duration. In the meantime, with concession applications being received at the rate of about 150 per month, the Government believes that immediate action is necessary to enable the system to operate as it was originally proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments are intended to restore the pre-Corinthian case status quo which Senator Coulter addressed and to which I will refer shortly. The amendments are not intended to pre-empt any review of the overall objectives and the operation of the system, which is quite properly the province of the independent Industry Commission. In accepting the 1982 Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) report on a modified commercial by-law system, both the previous Government and this Government intended the new CTCS system to be broad in application and predictable in outcome. The concepts conveyed by the terms in part XVa of the Customs Act were intended to be broad rather than narrow in interpretation so that, where appropriate, concessions would be available to all importers of like goods. The system was not designed or intended to enable importers to use the CTCS mechanism in narrow terms exclusively to suit their own commercial interests. </PARA>
<PARA> In practice, it has been concluded by the IAC that the definitions contained in the legislation have tended to confuse, rather than offer precision, and have obscured, rather than clarified, the system's objectives. I should say that Senator Coulter quoted from the IAC report No. 416 of 1 February this year concerning two CTCS references during his second reading debate comments. Similarly, recent Federal court cases have led to a narrower and more restrictive application of the terms of part XVa than was envisaged. Until recent Federal Court judgments, for instance, it was believed that the Comptroller could write a concession for a class of goods having regard to the goods described in the particular commercial tariff concession orders application and the goods produced, or capable of being produced, in Australia with which they would compete. However, in the Corinthian Industries (Sydney) Pty Ltd versus Customs case of 7 April 1989, the Federal Court clearly stated that the provisions of section XVa limited the scope of a concession order to the `particular goods' that are the subject of an application. I will give an example. The legislation only permits concession orders to be written in accordance with the description of the goods set out in the application. Where an application seeks concessional entry for blue felt pens and there is no legal manufacture of blue felt pens, a concession can only be issued for blue felt pens rather than all felt pens. I hope that is an illuminating example. This could lead to separate concessions for blue pens, black pens, turquoise pens or pens of any other description. </PARA>
<PARA> Frequently in the course of their discussions, importers negotiate with local manufacturers to determine the scope of a concession which could be made. The power to narrow concessions, for instance, to cover fewer goods than were originally applied for, is important for applicants as inquiries with local manufacturers might establish that the concession, as originally applied for, cannot be issued within the scope of the original wording. However, without the power to vary this wording, no concession can be issued requiring a new application with a new operative date which, in many instances, might be later than when the goods were actually imported, thus resulting in no concession for those goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, not being able to change the description of the goods applied for has the potential for applicants manipulating the system to specifically exclude competitive imported goods-this point is acknowledged by the IAC in its report No. 416, previously referred to and quoted by Senator Coulter in his remarks during the second reading debate-or increasing the number of concession orders thereby raising costs for both the Australian Customs Service and users, or loss of operative date of concessions and thus the inability on the part of importers to obtain refunds of duty. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments proposed in the Bill seek to restore the Australian Customs Service's ability to effectively administer the CTCS, in accordance with the original objectives of the system, pending the review and report on the system by the Industry Commission in late 1991. I hope that Senator MacGibbon has found that a more illuminating explanation for the first 13 of the Opposition's amendments. I think amendment No. 14 requires a different and fuller explanation which I will give in a minute. But I hope that that answers the question that Senator MacGibbon raised with respect to this issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not answer my question. It raises a whole heap of questions. The Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) did not tackle the fundamental point as to why it was necessary. I will touch upon one of the Minister's latter points before I come back to some earlier ones. The point that the Minister raised about an entry or application being made for an order and it not being accepted or accepted in the form that it is required is perfectly valid. But had the Customs officers worked through the amendments that were proposed by the Opposition and taken the trouble to sit down and go through them and compare them with the changes to the legislation that the Government is proposing, they would have found that that point is covered more than adequately, because we pick up the precise terms that the Government proposes in its legislation to allow the earlier starting date. So that is a non sequitur and irrelevant to the discussion at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Does the Government agree with the argument that Senator Coulter put forward before lunch? I find that his argument is quite at variance with the argument that the Minister made in his second reading speech, where he argued for administrative changes. Yet Senator Coulter was arguing from the basis of the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> During the lunch hour I reread the Industries Assistance Commission report on Commercial Tariff Concessions (PVC Foam Blocks and DC Electric Motors). I did not use it in my speech because, quite frankly, it is utterly irrelevant to this Bill. It deals with two specific cases where two companies had applications for tariff concessions refused and the IAC supported the refusal. There are a couple of points that I want to make about this. I do not know whether Senator Coulter read the report. I have read it a couple of times, and I reread it again at lunchtime. It does not provide any comfort at all for the Government with respect to the amendments in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the points made in the opening part of the report is that although an IAC report was held on these two refusals, as is allowed under existing section XVA of the Act where a tariff concession order has been refused, the IAC report on those has no bearing on the Minister at all. The Minister does not have to accept the recommendations in any way at all. There is nothing binding on him. The most important thing about this report-I presume Senator Coulter derived all of his information from pages 26 and 27 under a two-page section entitled `General Issues Arising In The Inquiry'-is the issues and the views expressed by the IAC with respect to the legislation. They foreshadowed what has subsequently occurred-namely, a full inquiry by the IAC, or by its successor, the Industry Commission which, as the Minister said, will report in the immediate future. </PARA>
<PARA> I am interested to know whether the Government is changing its ground and is going on to pick up the argument which was advanced, I think, with respect, quite erroneously by Senator Coulter, because the IAC simply had nothing to do with this legislation. Senator Coulter said that there was a need for an overhaul of the system. The Opposition and, quite clearly, the Government believe that there is a need for an overhaul of the whole system, or a review of it, and that is why we have all supported the Industry Commission report in the future. We also support the Law Reform Commission's inquiry. But the IAC said in this report, No. 416, that it cannot be done in this particular legislation, and it is not being done. The review of the TCOs that is required is not being done by this legislation at all. What Senator Coulter is saying is very relevant to next year when the reviews are being done, and I find that at great variance with the Minister's theme that what is needed is to finetune the operational aspects of the system. That is certainly not a complete review. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, in an effort to shed some illumination on this point and hopefully, therefore, obtain passage of the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) more quickly, I think I should answer the question raised by Senator MacGibbon about the point of view exercised by Senator Coulter, and do so based on my very rapid accumulation of information on this point. The Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) report that is the basis of what the Government is proposing to address is entitled Commercial Tariff Concessions (PVC Foam Blocks and DC Electric Motors), 1 February 1989, Report No. 416. If that is not confusing enough, the section that I will rely on in answering Senator MacGibbon's question is section 5, `General Issues Arising in the Inquiry', and in particular the references and observations made by the IAC on pages 26 and 27.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a matter in which the Government is proposing to insert into the Bill guidelines rather than living tightly drawn definitions, and the IAC made relevant observations about those definitions, making a nonsense of the Government's intent or the intent of those definitions if those definitions, drawn tightly and narrowly and, I would have to say, understandably but somewhat stupidly, were to be applied. The intention of the insertion of the guidelines is to arrive at what was intended by a sensible, straightforward means without having to get into the litigious possibilities offered by narrow and, perhaps on reflection, insensitively drawn definitions. It is because of that and the observations made in section 5 of the report that the Government proposes these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator MacGibbon asks whether the Government concurs with Senator Coulter's view. In all honesty, I have to say that I did not hear Senator Coulter's erudite words in the second reading debate, so I cannot be absolutely sure whether I agree with all of them, but I am advised that Senator Coulter, in his second reading contribution, substantially captured the essence of the Government's position and there appears to be no difference between us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, as I said in my opening remarks in the committee stage of the debate, the difficulty is that we are dealing with two alternative views of a particular procedure. Senator MacGibbon is attempting through a series of amendments to move to one particular position and the Government is attempting to move to another one. I just draw attention, in relation to what has just passed between Senator MacGibbon and the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), to page 8 of the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) report No. 416, where one finds that the Industries Assistance Commission is saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The term ``identical'' was (implicitly) interpreted to take its literal dictionary meaning so that it was hardly capable of practical use. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that Senator MacGibbon is attempting to write back through a series of amendments a definition which implicitly-that is the word used by the IAC-assumes identicality between the goods for which a concession is sought and goods manufactured in Australia whereas the IAC is saying that it is hardly of any practical use. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not in any sense relying only on pages 26 and 27 of that IAC report, but it seems to me that the IAC report in general raises serious doubts about the ability of the tests which have to be applied to be interpreted clearly enough so that they can be properly applied-and that goes more to Senator MacGibbon's amendments, which are consequential upon the particular one that he is presumably about to move. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that Senator Coulter has raised a very good point there. He has quoted from the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) report No. 416 about the difficulty that the Industries Assistance Commission had with the word `identical' and, quite clearly, the Australian Customs Service (ACS) has the same problem with it. As I said in my speech in the second reading debate, this matter is defined in the legislation and it is proper for the courts of Australia to determine what the legislation means. With the greatest of respect to the IAC and the ACS, it is not for them to interpret what the legislation means. They can have their views on, but the ultimate arbiter is the courts of Australia. It is very interesting to look at the Corinthian case which apparently provoked this whole exercise and at the judgment of the presiding judge of the Federal Court in that case. I will quote more from Corinthian Industries v. Comptroller-General of Customs later, which was decided as recently as April of this year, but one particular paragraph of the judgment is very relevant to what Senator Coulter has said. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not useful for the purposes of this case to attempt to expound on the circumstances required to make goods identical. It is sufficient for present purposes that the word `identical' is an ordinary word in the English language, as is the word `goods'. The provision will apply when goods satisfy the ordinary conception of identical goods and will not apply if the goods are not identical in that sense. </PARA>
<PARA>The court has made a judgment as to what the word `identical' means. I submit that Senator Coulter and the Government have to accept that the ruling of the courts, which is the proper place for meaning of the legislation to be tested overrides the views of the IAC and the Australian Customs Service. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I think your observation as to how we might proceed is eminently sensible, and I would like to follow your suggestion. As Senator MacGibbon has foreshadowed his opposition to these proposed sections, we might take them all together. If Senator MacGibbon so wishes he may then move his amendments. He can deal with it in that way. Otherwise, we will simply lap the course possibly twice or maybe more times with no real benefit, gain or utility to any of us. If we get to the point where we simply repeat our arguments by calling out the numbers by which the amendments are noted, it will also make a farce of this process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I sit down I will make a quick comment on what Senator MacGibbon has just said. He has made the observation that it is appropriate for the courts of Australia to decide the meaning of `Acts of Parliament'. That of course is true. But if the courts of Australia decide that definitions or meanings are such that in the practical workaday world it becomes virtually impossible or indeed extremely awkward to function, then it is appropriate that the legislature should revisit that and solve the practical problem. On the advice and information before me, it seems that the Corinthian case clarified a legal view of the legislation. It imposed practical and realistic workaday world constraints. We are trying to return the Act to what was intended so that business and commerce can function smoothly within its original intent. We had set down the legal words to mean certain things but we have found them not to mean those things. I do not contend with Senator MacGibbon's initial view of what the court's role might be, but if a nonsense is thrown up in law it is entirely appropriate that the legislative wheels should turn and correct that. As I understand it, that is the basis of this exercise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I understand Senator MacGibbon correctly, he is saying that laws should always stand without amendment and that we should simply abide strictly by the interpretations which the courts place on those words. I do not think that is what he really means. I think he is saying that he would prefer to stick with the definition which the courts have put on this form of words, whereas I understand the Government to be saying that, in line with the judgment of the Industries Assistance Commission and others, the interpretation which the courts have given to these words is so fraught with difficulty that the words have very little meaning at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have drawn attention to the words of the IAC in relation to `identical'. Pages 26 and 27 and the point in relation to cross-elasticity of demand have been picked up several times. On these pages the IAC says that it cannot be measured in a prospective market situation. Surely it is obvious that one cannot do that. Yet that is the sort of test that Customs is being asked to apply. Surely, under those circumstances-this is directed to Senator MacGibbon-it is appropriate for the Government to bring that law back into this place so that we can debate a better form of words. That is what we are about. We do not stick with the words as they are simply because the court has given one interpretation of those words. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Coulter has gone off on the wrong line. It is always possible for the courts to point to defects in the legislation and it is quite proper for the Parliament to amend those changes in the light of the experience of the courts. I do not wish to pursue that any further. As I said about 10 minutes ago, I see no point, as we will not reach agreement on the report No. 416. I am still seeking an explanation from the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) as to why the Government feels it important to make these changes. The Minister said that the terms were too narrow and that that led to confusion. I would have thought that a reasonable person would have made the assumption that the more precise the definition, the less the field for confusion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take the Minister back to the whole basis of issuing tariff concession orders: they are to allow goods to come in without detriment to Australian manufacturing industry where those goods are not produced in Australia. The whole purpose of a tariff concession is to protect Australian industry and to advance it so that manufacturers can pick up components, put them with other products, make bigger units and sell them in Australian and world markets. It is very much against the interests of Australian industry to have the gateway so wide that, instead of being precise as to what good or goods can come in, a whole class of goods are allowed to come in, as this legislation proposes. I simply cannot see the logic of the Government's argument that it needs to move from a precise definition of particular goods, which are very precisely defined in legislation, to a whole class of goods, which by its very definition encompasses a whole range of things which will compete with Australian manufacturing industry to the detriment of our production. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I have now understood the difference between me and Senator MacGibbon. Senator MacGibbon is saying that the definition that is now in place and for which we now have a court interpretation should stand. I am saying that the terms which are used in that definition are unsatisfactory. That has been pointed to by a number of people. The question that really should be directed to the Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, is: given that the actual criteria which are used are unsatisfactory-and everybody agrees they are unsatisfactory-can the Minister suggest other terms which might be put in the place of these terms found to be unsatisfactory without broadening the ambit, which seems to concern Senator MacGibbon and a number of other people? Are there not other criteria which could be set up and put into place far more simply than the large number of amendments sought through this legislation? Has consideration been given to other criteria that might not be open to woolly interpretation? They might have the same precision that Senator MacGibbon is seeking. They might not leave the discretion so widely with the Australian Customs Service, which also seems to upset Senator MacGibbon. Are there not other criteria which could be put in place which would precisely define and which could do this job far more simply?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a bit surprised at the turn of this debate. The intention of the Government is not to open floodgates or indeed to strangle off possibilities of trade but to effectively capture the original intention. Because of the Corinthian Industries Federal Court case, which effectively restricts the scope of the concession order to the particular goods subject to an application, we have moved to a position of inserting guidelines, which do not propose to broaden or to constrict but to capture our original intent. The amendments will just validate the status quo. The new facility can be used as much to narrow concessions, to cover fewer goods than originally applied for, as to broaden them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clause 20 (2) is a savings provision intended to validate any existing tariff concession orders which may be in doubt as a result of the Federal Court decision in Corinthian Industries (Sydney) Pty Ltd v. Comptroller-General of Customs and Others, an example being that since September 1988 the concession order was written for something wider or narrower than that applied for. The subclause treats such orders as if they were made under subsection 369c (1) of the Customs Act 1901, as proposed to be amended by this Bill. I understand the point that is being made by Senator MacGibbon and the supplementary point being made by Senator Coulter, but to view this amendment as a widening is to characterise it incorrectly. Its purpose is to meet the original intention of the Government so that the definition as interpreted, now we know what the words mean as a consequence of the Corinthian case, can be installed. That is the significance. Of course, a number of other orders are affected by the Corinthian decision and uncertainly about their fate needs to be removed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Now that the Minister has brought up the Corinthian decision and subclause 20 (2) I want to deal with those two matters. First of all, in the Corinthian judgment, which Senator Cook has said can be wider or narrower as the situation demands, the judge discussed the relationship of particular goods. The argument can be advanced that that is precisely capable in the present definition because the judge says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The definition of `particular goods' in s.269b (1) makes it clear that the application need not refer to specific goods but may refer to goods included in a particular class or kind of goods. </PARA>
<PARA>At the end of the judgment the judge found in effect that the legislation was perfectly adequate for the intention of the Government. I will not take the time of the Committee by reading it out, but the judge in no way found that the existing legislation was deficient. </PARA>
<PARA> I now want to turn to clause 20 (2), since the Minister raised it and it is within the group of clauses 18 to 21 that we are discussing. What does the Minister understand that proposed amendment to mean? I take it that it means that, unless a tariff concession order is permanently revoked before the day that the Act is proclaimed, all existing tariff concession orders will stand. In what the Minister has said we have heard a little inference that the Australian Customs Service is under a lot of pressure because there are something like 150 applications a month for tariff concession orders. In correspondence with me the Customs Service has said that something like 9,000 tariff concession orders currently operate in Australia. If the Service receives 150 applications per month and 9,000 are in operation, there is no way on earth one can claim that the present scheme is unworkable. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to subclause 20 (2). I have asked whether that means that tariff concession orders that are in place are validated, but I think there are some other implications, as I read that subclause. I take it to mean that concession orders that have been granted thereby comply with the new legislation. I wonder why that qualification was put in the subclause because, as I understand it, the Bill does not say only that they stand there but that, by virtue of their standing there, they satisfy the requirements of the proposed changes to the Act. Is that true or false?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We seem to be making heavy weather of this. I find the observation of Senator MacGibbon extraordinary. It is not at all unusual that a practice is engaged in in the full belief that that is the intention of the law and that it is engaged in comprehensively across the board by many people. If one individual or company then decides to read a different definition into it and takes a case to court, a court may then determine that that individual was right. We as a government need then to pay attention to whether, given that precedent that has been established, all of the existing custom and practice remains true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this case it is obvious to me that we need to amend the Customs Act in order to validate what has happened and to protect previous orders; otherwise we will be in clear breach of the precedent that has been set. If the interpretation is that the Corinthian case may only narrowly be concerned with Corinthian and no-one else and that the lessons and dicta laid down in that case do not apply more comprehensively, our view is that we would be failing in our duty if we did not pay attention to those dicta as they would apply across the board and take steps immediately to remedy the situation thrown up by the interpretation of the law. That is the intention here. It seems to me that that is good, prudent and sensible administration by a government and would be the case irrespective of what government was in power. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I do not think the Minister quite understands what I am saying here. First, if his amendments are not passed, there is no threat to tariff concession orders that are already granted because that provision stays. The legislative base has not changed. I am not concerned at all, if the legislation passes, that tariff concession orders that have already been granted are to remain valid. It is commonsense that they should. I have no argument with that at all. My question is a legal one. My understanding of subclause 20 (2) is that it goes beyond saying that tariff concession orders are valid, that it goes to the point of saying that they satisfy and shall be taken to satisfy the new proposed legislation. That is the point on which I wish to have a yes or no answer.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think there is genuinely a disagreement here. It may be that that disagreement will remain in open contention in spite of my answer. If that is the case it is unfortunate, but I guess that is how life is sometimes. My advice is very strongly and very determinedly on the point that we need to make this amendment in order that the other existing orders are not open to challenge in the same way that Corinthian was. That is why subclause 20 (2) is a necessary amendment. If subclause 20 (2) were carried we would feel comfortable that the existing orders could not be challenged in the same way. As I said a moment ago, that is a necessary comfort to give to people whose future and livelihood depend on these orders operating for the smooth and ready transfer of commerce. I do not think it is right to contend, as Senator MacGibbon did in his intervention a moment ago, that those orders somehow have a life irrespective of the Corinthian decision and cannot be called into question because of that decision. Clearly, given the dicta laid down in the Corinthian decision, if those precedents were used in an application under another law, we may well have the same outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner we were talking about clause 20 (2). I had made the point that I really was not concerned about the provision that is in that to validate the tariff concession orders that have already been granted and to carry them forward in the future. That was not the point. The point that I was seeking an explanation of is that part of the subclause (2) which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . that order is taken to be, and always to have been, as effective as if the amendments made by this Act had been in force at the time it was made or purportedly made. </PARA>
<PARA>My reading of that is that, in effect, it is saying that the tariff concession orders which are in place and which are carried forward to the future are held to satisfy the conditions of the proposed legislation which will become the Act. My reason for asking that is that, while the great majority of existing tariff concession orders are defined with precision, if one looks at the schedule of concessional instruments from tariff concession orders-I was looking at some during dinner-one finds that the goods are described in three columns. There is a tariff reference on the left, a description of goods in the centre and then a prescribed item and validity date, which does not concern us, on the right. </PARA>
<PARA> Am I right in the interpretation that those concessions that are carried forward are taken to satisfy the Act and, if that is so, what is the legal part of the existing tariff concession orders? Are the tariff reference column and the description of goods linked to form a legal unit or, under the new legislation, will it only be the descriptions of goods, or the tariff reference, that is carried forward?</PARA>

<PARA> (14) Page 11, after clause 29, insert the following new clause</PARA>
<PARA>Review of decisions</PARA>
<PARA> ``29a. Section 273ga of the Principal Act is amended by omitting from subsection (1) paragraphs (m) and (n), and inserting the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA>`(m) a decision of the Comptroller for the purposes of Part XVA;'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the deficiencies in part XVA is that there are no appeal provisions other than under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. Those appeals can be based only on the grounds of a narrow interpretation of law. It is possible to make an appeal to the Industries Assistance Commission, as has been instanced in the early part of the debate. But that appeal has no effect on the Minister; the Minister is not bound to accept it. It is a reasonable proposition that section 273ga of the principal Act be amended by allowing appeals to be made against decisions or determinations made by the Comptroller-General. I have selected the word `Comptroller-General' with care because I wish to exclude any decisions made by the Minister, and those decisions would be in the national interest. I believe that those decisions are properly the decisions of executive government and should not be subject to appeal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government does not accept the amendment. We ask the Committee to note that there are three avenues of review available in the particular circumstances we are talking about. Firstly, we have the normal internal Customs review. Secondly, we have the capacity for a reference by the Minister to the Industry Commission, as it now is known, for review of the question of whether an order should have been made or revoked. Thirdly, and most importantly, we have the capacity for judicial review in the Federal Court under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. The process of administrative review of decisions taken under the proposed legislation, before the amendments, basically is the same as presently exists in respect of decisions under the current scheme. I refer here to part XVA of the Customs Act. Basically we are saying, firstly, that there are three avenues of review. Secondly, if we are looking at decisions such as this, we really should be looking at maintaining consistency with the rest of the Customs Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the argument which has been put to us, essentially we are talking about making available for merit review decisions under the commercial tariff concession scheme (CTCS) by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal process. We maintain quite strongly-and previous governments have also taken this view-that where we are talking about decisions such as merit review of industry policy decisions, it is quite appropriate for the independent review to be done by a recommendatory body rather than by what has been proposed by Senator MacGibbon. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that since the introduction in 1983 of the CTCS there have been just under 10,000 concession orders in existence and only two have been referred to the IAC for merit review. I ask the Committee to note, again, that not only has this been the policy of this Government, but it also has been the policy of previous governments. It is a policy that has been well grounded. In July 1982 the report of the IAC that we have a recommendatory system in this area was supported by the Liberal Government of the day. Not only that, the Administrative Review Council in its recommendations made very much the same sort of point, that we should stick to a recommendatory review process. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence, we are saying, firstly, that there are three systems of review available already. Secondly, the decisions that are being canvassed in this area are more appropriate. Given the fact that they go to merit review of government policy making and industry policy decisions, it is more appropriate for a recommendatory body to make an assessment of them. In that respect, it is most appropriate that we maintain the current system of review. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat the point that not only has this process been embodied in the Act, but also it has been embodied on advice from, amongst other quarters, the IAC and the Administrative Review Council. I also ask the Committee to note that it is not just this Government that is doing it; it is a policy that has been consistently held by this and previous governments. I refer once again to the July 1982 decision of the previous government. The Government does not support the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Three Bills are to be debated together in the Senate this evening. The first is the Migration Legislation Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1989, the second the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, and the third Bill, which was introduced in the chamber only this morning, is the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989. I will refer to the least complicated Bill first, the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill. The Bill enacts some minor but necessary amendments required to be made to the Overseas Students Charge Act to make the Act consistent with the Migration Legislation Amendment Act 1989, which will be proclaimed next Tuesday, 19 December. Accordingly, the Bill is urgent. It is unexceptional. The Opposition supports it. The Bill is in a separate form because the Overseas Students Charge Act is a tax Act and so its amendment must be subject to a separate Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Migration Legislation Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill is of considerable substance and was considered in the other place in October. In the second reading speech, the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding) summarised the measure in these words:</PARA>
<PARA>The primary purpose of this Bill is to amend various Commonwealth Acts as a consequence of provisions of the Migration Legislation Amendment Act 1989 . . . which amends the Migration Act 1958. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also makes a number of other minor amendments to the Amendment Act. The majority of the amendments, update terminology, make slight changes in wording or correct internal references within the Amendment Act. The Minister has said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is inevitable in the case of legislation as complex as the Amendment Act that some minor corrections will be necessary. Several amendments then are made because of the complexity of the original Act and various omissions and misstatements now require correction. </PARA>
<PARA>I am glad that the Minister has referred to the complexity of the Act. It is not only the legislation and the Act itself that is complex, because there have in fact been these four Bills before us over the past six months which have totally transformed Australian law with regard to immigration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill was determined in May and June this year. The Migration Legislation Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill was debated in the House of Representatives in October and is being debated here this evening, with the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989; and the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 was introduced in here this morning. All of these four bills will be brought together and there will be a great deal of renumbering involved in putting all of these amendments together into one coherent set of legislation next week. But, in addition, there are the regulations and, because of the way in which this legislation is composed, all of Australia's immigration policies and programs, indeed the whole operation of the Department and its procedures, are determined in the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, there are regulations in transition from the existing regulations under the Act. Secondly, there are new machinery regulations covering the operation of a completely restructured and enlarged Act. Thirdly, there are new compliance regulations covering illegal entrants and custody, apprehension, deportation and prosecution of offenders under the Act, and many of those procedures are quite new. Fourthly, there are new procedure regulations covering the concept of the status of the visa system and the entry permit system. A new distinction is being introduced by the regulations in the Act. Fifthly, there is a whole set of regulations-literally hundreds-that define the new immigration criteria. They cover all of the precise criteria that define scores of different types of visa and entry permit categories. Included in this is the new points system and the pooling selection system which will operate for the first time from next week. Also covered by these criteria are some forms of visas that must be very flexibly defined. They are important visas, nevertheless, in the form of humanitarian and refugee entry permits. Until recently it was not guaranteed that the way in which those regulations were expressed was not ultra vires the Bill that we adopted earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there are completely new reviewed regulations which cover the new Immigration Review Tribunal, which again will be established next week. The procedures that that tribunal will follow will also be established. It is fair to summarise the situation by saying that if the Act is complex, the regulations are 10 times as substantial and complex. So we have before us tonight an enormous amount of new legislation. Next week we will see the Minister publish in the Commonwealth Gazette and no doubt table in this Parliament the regulations from all of the categories that I have outlined. However, up to this point none of the regulations have been made public. No-one who has a direct concern in an immigration application, let alone those groups of persons more habitually and professionally involved in giving immigration advice, has of right as a member of the public seen the regulations. They will not be released until next Tuesday. For completeness, as I understand it, all the regulations that will be published next Tuesday will be reissued two days later in a completely renumbered order so as to fit the variety of amending Bills that I described earlier and which are expected to be adopted by them. Next week, even for the experts, there will be an enormous array of Bills, regulations and renumberings, and perhaps by 1 January there will be one consolidated set of statutes and regulations. So the matter is highly complex, and the public has not seen the vital part-that is, the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> I will come back to that important deficiency because even now, although Senator Jenkins, who follows me in this debate, and I have been appointed by the Senate to the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations, which has met perhaps 20 times in the last 30 days-and Senator McKiernan, who is sitting across the chamber, is also a member-we are unable to disclose the deliberations of that Committee. Two of our major reports have gone to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray), and we are looking forward to his tabling those reports, together with his, I trust, positive responses, next week; and if not the full reports, then the responses to those specific and positive suggestions and recommendations that the Committee has made to him. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has the gravest reservations about how this whole process has been managed. We are critical of the haste. If the Minister in his eventual response to this debate says that six months is not haste, I will still use the word `haste', because it has been very evident that the first draft of the regulations was available only at the beginning of November and we are seeing them promulgated only some six or seven weeks later, even if, with a number of contributions from parliamentarians and the Department itself, they have gone through second, third and fourth drafts in those six or seven weeks. There has been haste, and we in the Opposition are not confident that it will all come out in a sensible and integrated way. I know that the Minister must profess that he has confidence that it will, but I do not have that confidence, and neither does the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> We are likely to see unintended consequences. Again, the Minister will give a quick response that he will seek, as genuinely as possible no doubt, to remedy those unintended consequences by changes to the regulations as soon as they become clearly established, but even next week there may be some public alarm either at some particular elements of the regulations-at those few items of new policy that the Minister may make when releasing the regulations-or just in the first-look confusion at the complexity of events that will occur in the coming week. </PARA>
<PARA> These outcomes are the responsibility of the Minister and the Labor Government. The Opposition, for its part, has insisted that the Government agree to the establishment of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Migration Regulations. Honourable senators would know that to set up such a committee is rather an unusual step. It is certainly not a standing committee of the Parliament, but it is not one which we think is going to last only for these two months; it will have a continuing life well through the coming year. Even with a change of government next year, there will be a need for such a parliamentary committee to review regulations because of their immense effect upon Australia's immigration policy and programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Opposition expresses its lack of confidence that the whole scheme of the Act, the regulations and the manual for the Department's use will be ready to operate from next week. In the light of that, we strongly urged the Minister three weeks ago-on 24 November to be precise, when the House of Representatives was still here and could deal with an amending Bill-to bring in a separate Bill that would amend section 4 of the Act to give the necessary flexibility to delay the operation of the new law if it was necessary. My colleague Philip Ruddock, the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, wrote to the Minister in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I believe that for more abundant precaution it might be appropriate that you give consideration to an amendment to section 4 to enable the proclamation to be deferred for a further period by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> In that way the matter would still be in your hands but it would mean that if for any reason the new administrative arrangements you contemplate are unable to be put in place you would then be in a position to ensure that existing administrative arrangements remain in place and our immigration program is not interrupted. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that this decision should be made and a judgment formed at a point closer to a date for implementation of the new administrative arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> These comments are not meant as any reflection on the competence of your professional officers who I believe have endeavoured to draft the regulations on very tight deadlines. However it is a pity that a good deal more work had not commenced on the regulations before the Migration Legislation Amendment Act came before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> My concern still remains that the range of possible defects in this new regulatory framework is such that a good deal more public exposure for comment would be a more desirable way to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the view of the Opposition; it is still the view of the Opposition. Whilst we were not, by agreeing to support such an amending Bill, insisting that the Minister defer the Bill, we wanted him to have the option, the power, so that any defects that remained on 19 December, or even a week or two or three weeks after that, could be remedied in time for the new integrated approach to migration law to start on a sound basis. We certainly wish the Act and regulations well. That is why we have all been working so positively to that end. I notice Senator Collins, another member of the parliamentary committee, has come into the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> To summarise these points, I give the Opposition's assurance that we will continue to be vigilant next week and all the following weeks and to be responsive to sound representations from all around Australia. We will respond in three particular ways: first, through our active involvement in the parliamentary committee; secondly, through our policy initiatives which, if necessary, we will take to the coming federal election and implement in government; and, thirdly, more urgently than that, perhaps in the days when we return for the sitting of the Senate in February and March, by considering the use of the power in this Senate to disallow regulations on a sitting day if we regard those regulations as still defective and in need of remedy. </PARA>
<PARA> To complete my remarks on the Consequential Amendment Bill I will refer briefly to some particular provisions, all of which are improvements to the legislation and all of which the Opposition supports. The Bill provides that regulations may be made that will prescribe matters to be considered in the making of decisions concerning discretionary deportation orders. Also, these regulations affirm the essential feature of the Amendment Act, namely the separation of processes of selection, based on the criteria in the regulations, from the processes of expulsion, which matter is in the hands of the officers whose responsibility is compliance with decisions of the Minister. That is a proper separation which the Opposition supports. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also provision in the Bill to enable prompt and efficient granting of visas in respect of a select set of visas where the normal procedure would be administratively burdensome. There is also a provision in the Bill to make sure that the point system is sufficiently broad to permit its proper operation. There is also a provision to clarify the definition of custody in the meaning of the compliance aspects of the Act. There is also a provision that puts beyond doubt the consequences of escape from custody. There is a strengthening of the intention already in the Act to ensure that persons who hold valid entry visas are properly treated as holders of valid entry permits and are not, for technical reasons, deemed illegal entrants. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the possibility for endorsements to be entered on visas and entry permits. It also provides for the making of regulations in regard to imposing fees for English language tests and for a better definition of certain proof provisions which will apply in criminal deportation proceedings. Another provision will amend a number of Commonwealth Acts, in addition to the Bill that was passed last June, that are consequential upon the passing of the amending Bills now before us. There are some other provisions of a technical nature to ensure that the legislation is complete. </PARA>
<PARA> Of all these provisions of the Bill, one of the significant matters concerns the power to make regulations for, and the prescription in the regulations of matters to be considered in, the deportation of illegal entrants. Since the original debate in May and June the Opposition has urged that these procedures be carefully and specifically defined to ensure natural justice, that the rights of applicants be preserved and that sound and accountable procedures be followed. The Opposition has been particularly concerned where circumstances of a compassionate or humanitarian kind are involved-for example, the circumstances of refugees. Accordingly, we welcome this provision in the amending Act to make regulations. However, the regulations themselves have yet to be announced and have not been seen by the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations. This whole provision depends upon these regulations. We are very conscious that the Minister has, nevertheless, understood our requests through all these months and we accept his assurance that the specific requirements that we have urged will be in these regulations next week. We will then examine them carefully. With these reservations about the subsequent and dependent regulations themselves, the Opposition supports the Migration Legislation Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn more briefly to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, which was introduced this morning and which is much easier to deal with. The Opposition has called for and supports the measures which are provided in the Bill. In May, June, October, November and December-at all stages of this year's debates on immigration legislation-the Opposition has maintained some strong recurring themes. They are these: The elected government of the day, and not the department, should be actively responsible and accountable for all aspects of immigration policy and the operation and management of the immigration programs. There should not be a fudging of that responsibility to an anonymous departmental officer acting upon the, however tightly expressed, Act and regulations. Rather, the Minister should be actively responsible and accountable for everything that happens in the immigration program. </PARA>
<PARA> Another theme is that the Minister must retain responsible flexibility to make decisions in cases where compassion and fairness ought to require the Minister's intervention. A third theme that has been recurring in the Opposition's view is that the new legal framework to be determined by the principal amending Act and the new comprehensive regulations must preserve not only announced Government policy but also the longstanding practices of the Minister and the Department to deal with individual cases of merit, despite such cases not easily fitting the complex of definitions required by the criteria for granting visas and entry permits in the great majority of circumstances. In brief, the Opposition has all along insisted that the new migration law must retain ministerial responsibility and flexibility for the Minister to intervene favourably where compassionate and humane considerations require it. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, for want of these features in the original Bill last May, the Opposition decided then to reject the Bill. The legislation was revived later that month when significant changes to meet the Opposition's views-these things that I have expressed-were introduced. For example, the word `Minister' was substituted for `Secretary' wherever it occurred in the original Bill. Particular attention was given to section 64u, which now provides for the Minister to intervene to favour an application and so reverse a decision of the Department and reverse a decision even of the Review Tribunal. Also, the Minister has now given an undertaking to monitor all the regulations continually, but especially in the first months and first year of operation, in order to add or amend regulations so that their effect is to gain the objectives intended and to ensure that justice and compassion are reflected in the operation of the regulations to the greatest extent practicable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition welcomed this assurance of the Minister, but all of these changes still had not satisfied us. Thus we come to the Bill. Thus, to be more complete, we called for and now have before us the measures that are in this Bill. What does it provide? It provides, through new additions to section 61, that the Minister for immigration may exercise the power set out in section 64u to intervene in an applicant's favour at an earlier stage of the processing of an application. Whenever this early intervention is exercised, the Minister must meet two extra accountability requirements, that is, the Minister must report his intervening decision to Parliament and he must set out the reasons for his decision, attesting it to be in the public interest. These two requirements of section 61 are already established in the Act for the section 64 interventions, which can be made only after the Review Tribunal's consideration is determined. What we then have is a fast track version of section 64u. It provides a short cut for the Minister, but a short cut that is responsibly defined and requiring much greater accountability to Parliament, a short cut for the Minister to intervene favourably for an applicant and so have the capacity to act humanely, compassionately and justly where, in the Minister's discretion, the particular circumstances of the application warrant such a decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Had this amending Bill not been presented, then I and my Opposition colleagues predicted that there would be many instances arising where the Minister would be hog-tied by his own law. The Minister would have found himself genuinely sympathetic with an immigration application but would have been prevented by the Act and regulations from varying the normal logic of decision by his Department and the first tier of review within his Department. Moreover, had the Minister been confined to the 64u provision, he would have had to wait perhaps 12 months, until after the third stage of the Review Tribunal's determination, before being able to intervene. Many cases arise which are much more urgent than the section 64u provision would allow, hence the fast-track approach of proposed new section 61 in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before us places two additional provisions in section 61 and in a new section 64u. These make explicit what the Act has until now put forward as implicit. Firstly, the Minister is not compelled to use the power of intervention. The Minister does not have a `duty', as the Act puts it, to intervene and this prevents appeals to the court which might have sought to use this as a ground to try to wrest the court's judgment in the place of the Minister's. The Opposition supports this protection for the Minister's decision. Secondly, the Minister is not able to intervene where to do so would be contrary to other provisions in the Act itself. That is explicitly set out in sections 61 and 64u as proposed in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the Tribunal, the new procedure as set out in clause 3 (b) of the Bill makes clear that, where this fast-track intervention by the Minister leads to determination of an application, the applicant does not have the normal ability to appeal to the Review Tribunal. The Opposition notes the comments of the Minister in the second reading speech on this matter that he will be monitoring this to see whether there is not some need in certain circumstances for a review to be able to be made to the Tribunal. The Opposition supports those remarks and would want to see that monitoring enhanced and, where necessary, adjustments made. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer finally to the public interest definition that the Minister made in his second reading speech. This has been of concern to the Opposition because we would not want a narrow interpretation to be given to the term `public interest' so as to negate compassionate and human considerations of a particular individual or that person's family. But the Minister has rightly given a very broad meaning to the term `public interest', and that is certainly welcomed by the Opposition. In conclusion, I note that the Minister referred in part of his speech this morning to the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations but he has not yet referred-no doubt he will next Tuesday-to this whole Bill being suggested to him by that Committee. I believe that that acknowledgment is not only factually correct but is appropriate to be made in this debate because it has been one of the very positive outcomes of the all party deliberations of that Committee. In brief, the Opposition supports all of the Bills before the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating three Bills, the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 and the Migration Legislation Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1989. Two of these Bills are consequential amendments to the Migration Legislation Amendment Act which was passed by this Senate in May of this year, while the third Bill is the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989. I will address my first remarks to the two consequential amendment Bills. The Australian Democrats regard the Migration Legislation Amendment Act 1989, passed earlier this year, as a disastrous piece of legislation. In the committee stage I will be moving some amendments which, if passed, would remove some of the undes- irable features of that legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the greatest of the many defects of that legislation was the attempt to codify-almost to automate-migration decisions as if to remove all discretion from those responsible for those decisions. Those who have framed the legislation-the Government, which introduced it, and the coalition Opposition, which ensured its passage-seem to have forgotten that we are dealing with human beings here; we are dealing with people's lives. Human beings and human circumstances exhibit an almost infinite range of variation. People simply do not fit neatly into a limited number of pigeonholes or categories. If we try to simplify and codify the process of making decisions about human beings beyond a certain point, we are led into creating a mass of rules and regulations which will inevitably confuse the issue, lead to gross injustices and bring about inefficiency instead of the very efficiency which was the aim of the exercise in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what I believe the Government has achieved with its migration legislation. The Migration Act 1958, as amended, was an already lengthy and complex document. It was widely regarded as out of date and difficult to use. The Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies recommended a complete rewrite of the Act, and that was that we all believed the Government would do. But the Government rejected this recommendation and, instead, the Migration Legislation Amendment Act added approaching 100 pages of amendments to the old Act. The legislation is to be further elaborated by way of regulations which are provided for in it. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 came before the Senate these amendments were unavailable to the Senate for scrutiny and, six months later, the Senate still has not seen them, although the Department for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has been hard at work preparing its manuals. Indeed, as Senator Teague stated earlier, the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations has also been hard at work with its review of the regulations which were made available to it. The new regulations are due to take effect from 19 December, in just five days time. I gather, from the questions I have been asked by the media recently, and from a letter which was written by the Minister to the Chairman of the Committee on Migration Regulations, that it is the Minister's contention that the Australian Democrats are responsible for the rush to implement the Migration Legislation Amendment Act as from 19 December. However, the Government's own drafting instructions state that although it is the Government's preference for legislation to be proclaimed no later than six months after passing through the Parliament, nonetheless the Minister has the option of a later date provided there is a suitable reason. I would have thought that very complex legislation which depends on very complex and numerous regulations would provide such a reason. Paragraph 5.8a of the drafting instructions state:</PARA>
<PARA>As a general rule, the commencement clause for Acts which commence on proclamation should provide a specific date, or a specific period after royal assent (such as six months). Where preparatory work is required before an Act commences, a realistic assessment should be made of the time required to complete the preparations and a specific date or a specific period after royal assent for commencement included in the drafting instructions . . . an explanation for choosing that commencement must be included in the notes on clauses in the explanatory memorandum . . . Where an unusually long period of time for that commencement has been included (for example-longer than 6 months after royal assent), an explanation should be included of why this period has been chosen. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Minister, and possibly the Department, did not realise at the time how complex the regulations would have to be in order to codify the whole of the immigration legislation in the way that it has been. I really believe that the complexity was not foreseen. However, having said that, I believe that once the complexity was realised, and the inevitable delay was realised in having draft regulations available, the Minister should have considered changing the date for implementation. It may well be that there is confusion concerning the motion moved by Senator Macklin on 29 November 1988, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> That there be laid on the Table of the Senate, on or before 31 May and 30 November each year, details of all provisions of Acts which come into effect on proclamation and which have not been proclaimed, together with a statement of reasons for their non-proclamation and a timetable for their operation. </PARA>
<PARA>That motion resulted in a number of Acts coming before the Senate which had not been proclaimed. Therefore, it was decided that Acts preferably should be proclaimed within six months, if that were at all possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) amends section 26 of the principal Act with regard to the Minister's discretionary powers. Section 64u, as it stands, provides that the Minister can overturn the decision of the Immigration Review Tribunal in a way that is favourably disposed towards the applicant. The Australian Democrats applaud the definition that the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) has introduced as far as the term `public interests' is concerned. The Minister, in his second reading speech, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The term `public interest' is not limited solely to public issues. Consideration of the public interest could involve consideration of the circumstances of the particular case having regard to an unusual, unforseen or other features that are deserving of a favourable response against the background of Australia being a compassionate and humane society. </PARA>
<PARA>I applaud the Minister for including in his second reading speech the definition of the term `public interest'. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA> Concern has been expressed at the time it will take for a case to proceed through each tier of review before the Minister can use the power contained in section 64u. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments in this Bill will meet these concerns and enable such urgent cases to be decided by the Minister at an earlier stage of the process. When the Minister reviews these cases, and finds in favour, he must table in the Parliament the reasons for doing so. I am also encouraged by the Minister's statement that the Government will keep under review those cases where the Minister's decision was more favourable than the first tier review decision with a view to determining whether review by the Immigration Review Tribunal should be available in some circumstances. Although I have been extremely critical of the Bill as a whole, I commend the Minister and the Department for making some amendments at this late stage which will soften the impact of the legislation which has disturbed not only some of us here in the Senate but also people in the wider community. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have in this new Bill is a discretionary power of the Minister, which is what we asked for earlier and what I tried to have included in the legislation when it went through the Senate last May. That discretionary power is needed. There will be need at times for a fast-track urgent decision to be made for compassionate reasons. We have all heard of cases of a terminal illness and where a person literally has no time to wait for a decision to take a year or even two years. The Australian Democrats have some reservations with regard to review by the Immigration Review Tribunal not being available in these circumstances, but would not want to jeopardise in any way the facility for a genuine, urgent case to be fast tracked by means of ministerial discretion. </PARA>
<PARA> As with the discretionary power to overturn decisions of the Immigration Review Tribunal and substitute a decision, more favourable to the applicant, likewise when fast tracked and overturning a first tier review officer's decisions to a more favourable one to the applicant, the Minister must table his reasons in both Houses of Parliament-in this instance, twice a year. This has the advantage for the Parliament to see how many fast-track decisions have been made in favour of the applicant and whether there is a consistency in changes of decision. If that were the case, the determining factors, as legislated and regulated for, should be reviewed and possibly changed. I know that the Minister has this in mind because he has stated on more than one occasion that he will be keeping the process and procedures of the new immigration Act with its regulations under scrutiny. The Australian Democrats believe that to be consistent the Minister should also give the number of fast track appeals which he reviewed and did not decide favourably for the applicant, together with a statement giving a summary of the reasons for his decisions. In this way we will start to have some idea of how the whole thing is working. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn my attention to the Migration Legislation Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill, which also refines the migration legislation of May earlier this year. This legislation is basically a tidying up Bill. It deals with refinements which the Government wishes to make to the major package of migration legislation. At this stage I thank the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs for providing a copy of the consolidated immigration Act. As I said before, the 1958 Act has been amended so many times, and we have also amended the amendments so many times that it makes it difficult to cope with. At last we have a consolidated Act of the old section which went from No. 1 to No. 67, including en route bizarre numbers such as 11za through to 11zl, and 64a through to 64zz. Blissfully, the new numbering simply goes from 1 to 181. It is a blessed relief to cope with. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, the consolidated migration legislation will undoubtedly stand as a monument to bureaucratic obfuscation. I suspect that Opposition members who were on the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations have begun to realise over the last few weeks what a monstrosity it helped the Government to create. If they find themselves in government after the coming election I predict that they will come to curse their decision to support the present Government's approach relatively uncritically-and certainly wholeheartedly if we turn back to read their speeches on the second reading. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some most unfortunate aspects in the legislation. One, I believe, is the provision for two types of deportation: mandatory deportation of illegal immigrants, and deportation of illegal immigrants. I asked a question in the Senate some days ago about a well-known presumed illegal immigrant who is on trial in Victoria. My understanding of the legislation is that, if that individual is found to be an illegal immigrant 28 days after the proclamation of the legislation and it is deemed that he should have a deportation order placed on him under section 17a, after this period of grace expires the Minister would have no option other than to deport him from Australia, which could save his facing many charges on counts covering many millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the Minister in his response or during the committee stage will be able to explain to this chamber when a deportation order under section 17a will be applied, and when deportation under section 18 will be applied and what discretion, if any, there is in that. If there is discretion in that the Minister can decide whether to place on a person a mandatory non-revokable deportation order or a deportation order that is revokable, we need to know why and what the criteria will be. It is for that reason that my first amendment seeks to delete from the Act section 17a. As I said, the Minister can deport a person from Australia under section 18. There is nothing to prevent his deporting whomsoever he wants under that section. If the Minister put a 17a deportation order on a person and then found that circumstances had changed or that there was something about the circumstances he was not aware of, he would be faced with the difficult choice of deciding whether to deport the individual or break his own law by neglecting to make the decision to do so. As I stated earlier, this could cause all sorts of problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether or not such an application would succeed-that is, if a person preferred to have a 17a deportation order on him and put the Minister in a position where he would have to deport him and the Minister did not, and this was tested in the courts-I am certainly not in a position to speculate about. But I am not happy with the possibility of a government putting itself in a position where it could treat its own laws with complete contempt, applying the full rigour of them when it felt like doing so-this would be very dangerous in politically sensitive or embarrassing cases-or ignoring them when that course of action suited it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department has a history of being a law unto itself. It has a poor reputation with some of its clients, a situation which has been around for some years. The Commonwealth Ombudsman commented in his annual report on the very high level of complaints he received against decisions of the Department of Immigration. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ray once thanked me for saying that the Immigration portfolio was a verit- able ministerial graveyard. Since I came to the Senate 2 1/2 years ago, I have been the Democrats spokesman for immigration and ethnic affairs and Senator Ray is the third Minister that I have shadowed in that short time. I believe that there is unfortunate resentment in the community as a result of the new immigration Bill, and I hope that the resentment which is out there will not build up in the way it seems to be doing at the moment. There is a fear that people affected will feel the force of cold and cruel legislation. This, I feel, is most unfortunate. But, of course, for the rich, under the new rules, all will be well. Those who have enough cash, however it has been accumulated, will continue to be able to buy Australian residence and, therefore, citizenship. Other wealthy individuals will be able to cope with some of the harsh requirements and weave their way through the complex system of permits and visas, paying the appropriate fees at each step of the way and able to return overseas while they await the outcome of change of status decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel that someone who has been in Australia and has illegal status may or may not be aware of their status. We have examples of people who came into this country perhaps, under a fiance visa. It would have been stated on their visa that they would be able to stay provided they married the person named on that visa within three months. They may have done that. That may have been some years ago. They may have thought that, having done that, they had fulfilled all the obligations and were here perfectly legally. But once this legislation comes into force on 19 December, if they have not in the meantime reported to the Department then those persons, as I see it, will be illegal entrants and subject to deportation. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Government plans to place advertisements in the newspapers after 19 December warning people that the legislation has changed and that they have limited time to report to the Department. I ask the Minister what will happen to people who either do not see those advertisements or are not aware that those advertisements refer to them. We had an example in the Senate of a senator who was not aware that he was not an Australian citizen. It is possible for people who have been in this country for years and who have families and businesses here not to be aware of that fact. I will be very interested in the Minister's response to that. </PARA>
<PARA> I will move a second reading amendment. I am doing this out of a feeling of frustration. If I were in a position to change the date of implementation of this legislation, I would certainly do so but as I see it I am not in that position. We put ourselves on this fast express train last May and there is no getting off at this stage. That is to be regretted because the legislation will come into force next Tuesday. We will see the regulations as they stand next Tuesday. Immigration officers will have to apply the legislation and those regulations as from next Tuesday, so there is no way out at present. It is for that reason that I move the following amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1989:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add: ``, but the Senate condemns the Government for setting in motion the process of making complex and weighty Migration Amendment Legislation which depends heavily on Regulations, which are themselves equally complex and weighty, without first giving the Parliament a proper opportunity to scrutinise and approve those Regulations''. </PARA>
<PARA>It appears that the Senate has a new view as far as regulations are concerned. Just a couple of days ago the Senate when considering health legislation dealing with nursing homes determined that the legislation should not be proclaimed until the regulations on which it depends heavily have been passed by both Houses of Parliament. I have previously described the system of having legislation which depends heavily on regulations as being basically an undemocratic system. My experience with the current migration legislation does not make me move from the stance. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer briefly to the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill (No. 2). This Bill amends the Overseas Students Charge Act as a consequence of the provisions of the Migration Legislation Amendment Act. The amendments in the Bill are of a purely technical nature. However, I will make a few remarks with regard to overseas students. In yesterday's Australian there was an article headed, `Overseas student intake at risk'. The writer of the article, Jane Worthington, described a lack of cohesion within various government departments as regards full fee paying overseas students and said that overseas student councils yesterday warned that capricious changes in government policy regarding overseas students could cause Australia to lose its market share to Canada and New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to our overseas students, Australia has a history of having set things up very hastily in the early 1980s and of not having learned from the early experience in the United Kingdom, where students went to schools which did not always operate in the best possible way. The industry there was poorly regulated and the result was that the market became flooded by all sorts of fly-by-night and exploitative entrepreneurs who ran courses in cheap and unsuitable premises, employed unqualified teachers, and did their utmost to rip as much money out of the foreign students as possible. The result was that the whole industry in Britain developed a very bad name and, as I understand it, for a time the bottom dropped out of the market. I would not like to see that happen in Australia, although I must say that the situation in recent months has not been a happy one. We have had the occurrence in Perth of a private college going broke and closing its doors, greatly inconveniencing students enrolled for both current and future courses, who have not been able to have their fees refunded. I make those remarks in the hope that the Minister will also respond to those, because I regard that as a serious situation. </PARA>
<PARA> When we have overseas students in this country it is important that we give them the correct education to which they are entitled, qualified staff and proper premises. Of course, one of the problems in the past has been that being an overseas student in this country has been a mode of illegal entry. Here again, I think that the Department has been at fault because check-ups have not been done on these people in the right way. I suppose there is a fine line between over-checking on people and that being regarded as the bureaucracy gone mad and people being able to come in, enrol in courses, not turn up to classes at all and disappear into the beyond, therefore becoming illegal entrants to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I believe that we are stuck with this legislation. I believe that it can be improved through the amendments that I will move in the committee stage and I hope to have Opposition support for my amendments. In the meantime, I think it is up to all of us who are involved in this process to try to improve the quality of the regulations as best we can, although I very much fear what will happen when those regulations see the light of day this coming Tuesday. Everything is rather back to front because the regulations will be made public on Tuesday and then there will be full public debate and scrutiny. So potentially we have a situation whereby we have legislation and its dependent regulations coming into being in a few days time with the possibility of them being disallowed at a later date. That is not a happy situation at all and I believe this gives unnecessary uncertainty to the whole immigration process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) concludes the debate, I would like to speak very briefly to the amendment that has been moved by the Australian Democrats. It is the Opposition's view that where regulations are so overwhelmingly significant to the operation of an Act, as is the case in this legislation, then those regulations should be tabled in draft form in Parliament to allow sufficient time for adequate public consultation, in the same way as the introduction of significant legislation itself should proceed after a period that allows for public consultation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not often that I get up in the Senate and admit that I am a fool, but I must be. Fancy being foolish enough to want to transpose migration policy and migration direction, over which this Parliament had no scrutiny whatsoever, into law. I must have been mad to take that desperate step to make it publicly accountable and clear to everyone, rather than the old Byzantine system of direction by the Minister, where the Minister is equivalent to Kublai Khan and can change policy at a moment's whim, can jump the points up by 10 or 20 points overnight and can close categories overnight without this Parliament being able to say boo to a goose. I must have been a mug to do that, because it was a long and complex task over which we knew we would cop punishment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting that the greatest critics of this legislation in the human rights field and the law field have never once acknowledged this fact, even though they put this up as the number one priority in all their submissions to the FitzGerald Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policy. But never once have they acknowledged since it has gone through that it was a good idea to make all migration decisions and criteria accountable in law. I will come back to Senator Jenkins's second reading amendment later. </PARA>
<PARA> I correct something that Senator Teague said because I think he assumed that I am going to make public the observations-not the report-of the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations. I make it quite clear that the agreed process was that that Committee was to give me its observations by 21 November. That did not prove possible. I did not kick up at all. I extended the deadline even though the Parliament had dictated otherwise, and waited. I got it in two volumes, and no doubt I will get another volume-and I have no hesitation in saying that I welcome that. My job then involves a three-stage process. Some of those observations have already been absorbed into the regulations. Some of the more complex ones will be absorbed into the regulations over the next few months. I will also tell the Committee quite clearly which ones I totally reject. So it will be that sort of a process. Five sitting days after the regulations are tabled here, it is then the Committee's duty to report to this Parliament on the progress up to that time, and it is at that point that the Committee's observations and report will become public. I think that is a sensible process. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jenkins apparently does not place as much weight on the Macklin motion for deadlines as I and my Department do, because if my Department had thought some time ago that it would have a longer period to draw up these regulations it would have done, but we observed what we thought was a direction of this Senate for a six-month deadline. I will come back to that point later. I make the point, because it has been too misinterpreted, that the regulations that will come into force at one minute past midnight on 19 December are not holy writ, nor should they be. They are so lengthy and complex that there will be flaws in them, and we acknowledge that. Especially once they are in working order and are able to be tested as a working system, we will remain totally flexible and open about changing them to make them work appropriately. I think that is best seen in practice. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Teague in a clever way-and I do not blame him-said that this is all the responsibility of the Government. I take that responsibility. We are doers; we are not going to wimp out, we are not going to avoid doing anything because we are afraid of criticism. We have taken that responsibility. We will take some criticism over it, but I guarantee Senator Teague that at the end of the day it will be a better, fairer and more equitable process than has existed in the last 30 years. There is no question about that. </PARA>
<PARA> We were asked at one stage to defer the Bill. There was a practical problem with that. When I got that particular request we were tied up in the Appropriation Bill committee stage in this chamber and House of Representatives legislation was under guillotine. The only possible way to go was to amend one of these consequential Bills and, with the House of Representatives not coming back until 21 or 22 December, any amendment to the Migration Legislation Amendment (Consequential Amendment) Bill other than on the second reading sinks the Bill because it must come into force prior to the regulations and the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) being proclaimed. So it would not have been possible to do it that particular way because if I had not promulgated the regulations by 19 December the Bill would have been proclaimed, and if the regulations did not come into force no one could be admitted to Australia. By the time the queue had got right round to the domestic terminal, I think the Opposition would have given in and said, `Yes, we can put a regulation through'. </PARA>

It was hard enough getting this other Bill through that we all agree on universally, and we would not have agreed on that Bill universally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Teague said that the Government should be accountable. I agree with that. But I also say that we should be accountable under the law. There is nothing wrong with the Government being accountable under the law. Honourable senators opposite continually talk about compassion and fairness, but never on one occasion when we have had this debate in the chamber has any honourable senator defined compassion or fairness, much less ranked it and said, `How are we going to have any sort of criteria on which to assess it?'. One person's view of compassion and fairness differs from another person's view. When I have hundreds of officers overseas, it is my duty to see that they apply consistent criteria. How can I rely on their compassion and fairness being doled out in equal doses? After all, Senator Jenkins talked about human nature. That is a major difficulty. That is why, as much as possible, one makes the primary selection criteria objective and measurable. </PARA>
<PARA> In one instance in our history 110,000 people were admitted to this country by application to a Minister's office. Most drug pushers got in in that one year than during the rest of the years put together. Such a deluge simply cannot be handled. We have had ministerial intervention without any accountability. I think everyone acknowledges that that major problem is rectified in both the legislation and the consequential legislation. A Minister will not be going out and spending $1.5m to deport a drug pusher and, after all that money has been spent, have his colleague come in the next day and write one word on the form-`admit' with a signature. We will do away with this business of marginal seat candidates trooping into a succession of Labor and Liberal Ministers and saying, `I must get this case up because it will help me save my seat'. All that rotten borough system had to be done away with. All that political sleaze had to be sunk, and the only way to sink it was to make migration policy into law and that is what we have sought to do. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Teague said something very remarkable for which I congratulate him. He said that these regulations were supposed to bring in announced policy. I congratulate him for that. Everyone else thinks that the regulations were supposed to introduce existing policy, but all along it has been announced policy. Senator Teague has picked that up, and I thank him for it. It is announced policy; not existing policy. While I am on that subject, we have changed some policies since June. Therefore, in my view, the Migration Regulation Committee is entitled to examine not only whether that policy is being put into regulations but also the merits of that new policy. I have never disputed that. However, there has been some misunderstanding about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Teague went on to say that there are many examples for fast tracking, but did not mention one. This is a difficulty. I do not think there will be that many cases for fast tracking; there will be some. Senator Jenkins alluded to health problems. A family arriving in Australia but having to leave a child behind because it has leukaemia is an obvious example where fast tracking will be of immense advantage. I can imagine other such cases. But I do not see this getting into tens of thousands. When this matter was first put to me by the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations, there was talk in terms of scores a year. I think that will be the case with those that need to be fast tracked. I thank the Committee for raising this problem of fast tracking. I wish the Committee would thank us for coming up with the ingenious solution but no doubt that will come in the report; so far it has not come to me in any other form. </PARA>

I am quite happy and at ease with it. Again, I stress, it does not matter what the regulations say. I can intervene in the public interest, but I must report to this chamber as to why I have intervened. That is our critical achievement in this progress through the migration law. Let us make sure that those reports are scrutinised by every honourable senator. If that happens we can guarantee that fairness and equity can flow in immigration like it never has before. I thank Senator Teague for his contribution. I disagreed in part with a few comments he made but agreed with much of what he said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Jenkins ran the old argument of `not enough notice'. I will quote three paragraphs from the Hansard of 5 April 1989. Never let it be said that I did not put everyone on notice. I said then:</PARA>
<PARA>Senators will be aware that given the scope, the complexity and the inter-relationships of immigration rules, translating them into regulation will be an extremely lengthy process: in part this will reflect the fact that the approach is a completely novel one, and will involve the development of new skills and processes. Accordingly it will take up to 18 months to complete regulations for all classes of decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I decided therefore that in order to accelerate the process, I would put the Bill forward at this stage to obtain legislative backing to what is a fundamental re-thinking of the administration of the Migration Act. My intention is, given that legislative backing, to draw up regulations for the major classes of decision as a matter of urgency, so that these can be implemented and have the force of law as soon as possible, rather than wait for every minor issue to be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly when the Bill is proclaimed, there will still be some gaps in the policy criteria as set out in the regulations. These areas will continue to be discretionary until policy criteria for these areas can be incorporated into regulation. </PARA>
<PARA>We put a lot of that on notice. But the most objectionable part of Senator Jenkins's views was when she described the Bill and the whole system as monstrous. She has never put forward what the alternative should be. I would love to hear her selection criteria and how they would be determined. I only get glimpses. From other statements she has made I know there would be no business migrants or skilled migrants. Therefore it is narrowed down to two categories-humanitarian, which I think she would take from 12,500 to 20,000-and family reunion, of which there are at least 71,000. But how would she choose the people? She has never stood up and said how. Does she want to have a lotto? Is that the fairest way of doing it? She makes offhand comments about people buying their way into the country-without ever nominating them or properly understanding the criteria that we place on the business migrants. It is not a question of having $500,000; they must have a sound track record of entrepreneurship. It is not a case of winning the lottery and buying one's way in. At least in a broad sense-I do not expect her to have the accurate details-it is incumbent upon Senator Jenkins to say what her selection criteria would be. I would love to know. If they are better than mine I might adopt them. I have never heard from Senator Jenkins on that matter; I have just heard general carping criticism. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge and thank Senator Jenkins for her comments on the public interest. I put the remarks about that matter in the second reading speech not as an afterthought but as an extension of what our thinking always has been on this issue. We never envisaged a narrow definition of public interest. Other people have interpreted it that way. That is why we put it in the second reading speech-to make sure that, if it ever gets into the courts, the courts would understand the definition that Senator Jenkins and I have both endorsed tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> Complaints are made that the whole area is complex. I do not know how to simplify it. It is a complex area. Fairness and simplicity are not handmaidens. Sometimes knocking out loopholes and dotting every `i' and crossing every `t' is the way to equity and fairness. There is no simple way, and I do not think there was much choice but to take the route that we have taken. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jenkins has again repeated her remarks on illegals. The question about the distinction between discretionary and mandatory deportation was well answered and is contained in a confidential committee report. I will not refer honourable senators to the page number but it is clearly laid out. Senator Jenkins and I simply have a different approach to illegals. Senator Jenkins takes a very humanitarian and sympathetic approach to illegals. My view as the Minister for Immigration is that all my sympathy goes to the legal people who are lined up in queues overseas waiting to get here. My sympathy does not go to those who get on a plane and queue-jump. We will never agree on that so I am not going to take that matter any further. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jenkins then went on to say how unfortunate it is that I am in the graveyard. If I have to listen to a few more woolly-minded ideas from her I will go into the study and do the right thing, I promise. It can be a graveyard; I agree with that. We are dealing with new and complex issues every day where human emotions are involved. That could include the future of Australian circuses one day, defecting diplomats another day, deaf and dumb defecting Polish athletes another-the whole gamut and range comes across my desk day in and day out. What makes it hard is that all the time one is measuring consistency throughout the lot-trying to make it consistent, not favouring one over another. That is why it can become a graveyard for anyone. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the final points made by Senator Jenkins concerned the illegals who do not see the advertisements. Stiff cheese; that is all I say. But there have been plenty of advertisements in the last few weeks. We have taken more money from application forms today than in the history of migration. Even though one might have read an advertisement in the West Australian saying that the migration office there will be closed tomorrow, I have made sure that it will stay open so that people can exercise their rights of application right up to the nineteenth. There is still a fair degree in the regulations that will give them rights after that. But I do not have a duty to spend millions of dollars telling people who are staying in this country illegally of their rights. I simply do not have to do that. They are the ones who are breaking the law; they are the ones who are queue jumping; they are the ones who are abusing the hospitality of this country; and they are the ones who are going to have to find a way out of this, either by returning home or by applying for a change of status as allowed within the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point that Senator Jenkins made, the most valid and telling criticism, is that this Government, in its attitude to students, has had an unfortunate history. Obviously, I have to acknowledge that, because we have changed it dramatically in the last few months. One of the problems that we had was that, especially in short term, non-formal courses, the overstay rate was 25 per cent on average. For some countries it was as high as 40 per cent. This had to stop, and we have put a stop to it through a whole series of I think very fair changes in policy. So I can say that I agree with Senator Jenkins's criticism. It is well founded. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me move on to the last matter in the second reading amendment. I often think that there is not much justice in the world, but when this amendment passes the Senate I will have to say that I am a bit annoyed. But I will not divide on it. Heaven knows, for the first time in the history of the Senate we circulate regulations to members of the Senate as a select committee. The Opposition, in government, never did it once. </PARA>

If the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) can deport, then he can deport. There seems to be no need at all to place an obligation on him to deport. This is an obligation which in some circumstances could be highly inconvenient. In my previous speech I went into that in a little detail. I am especially afraid that two sections on deportation could provide the Minister with just what he does not want: the discretionary power to choose to move a deportation order either under section 17a-that is mandatory and non-revokable-or under section 18. The fear would be that this could be used for political reasons or for people who could provide an embarrassing situation for the Government. In Western Australia we are all very much aware of the situation of the Orionia community. I believe that it is wrong for the Senate to allow the passage of a measure which permits and indeed encourages discriminatory treatment against some individuals whom the government of the day might want to get rid of. I remind the Senate of the case of the Chilean activist Sergio Buschmann. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions exist without having two sections. These sections could be used against people who represent viewpoints with which the government of the day does not have sympathy and not necessarily in any sense to protect the Australian community. It could possibly be used against people who have been in Australia for a very long time and who became illegal residents a long time ago without being fully aware of this fact. The Minister does not seem to appreciate that this is the case with a number of people. Once this legislation comes into being the Minister will be in for some surprises as far as this is concerned. I fully agree with the Minister that people who come here and who try to jump the queue, who come here specifically for that reason should not have sympathetic treatment. I agree with the Minister that the people who do the right thing and who apply overseas for entry should be the ones given the greater consideration. But I can assure the Minister that there are people here who are technically innocent illegals. This will be shown to be so during the course of next year. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a problem with the sub-clause which makes deportation orders under section 17a non-revokable. Such an order, at some stage, could be made against an individual and, although the Minister has put forward procedural steps which would have to be taken before the deportation order could be enforced, there is still the possibility of an administrative error. If the order is non-revokable, it would have to be enforced and there would be no judicial power or ministerial discretion to overturn it once it had been made.</PARA>
<PARA> It is possible that such an order could be made against a person who might have escaped from custody and whose whereabouts was unknown. I suppose the order could remain in force for years. Perhaps the Minister can enlighten us on that aspect, too. The wrong person might be apprehended and, in that case, the wrong person might, or might not, be deported. </PARA>
<PARA> There could be a change of government in the country to which the person is to be deported, which would put that person at risk. I know of a case in Western Australia some years ago where five students from Afghanistan were on a course. I know of another case of students from Cambodia attending another course. In both cases the students were here at the time when right wing governments in their countries were replaced by governments of the opposite persuasion. Under this provision, if an illegal entrant against whom such an order had been made were apprehended, a government would have no option but to deport that person back to, perhaps, a Pol Pot-type situation. The Government has so tightened the rules in this respect that, except in the most tightly defined circumstances, we could find ourselves in a very embarrassing situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister again why we need to have another section in respect of the deportation of an illegal entrant. The Minister can deport anybody he deems suitable for deportation under section 18 as it stands. I would like to know why we need that second section and why people who need to be deported cannot be deported under section 18. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not support the amendment moved by the Australian Democrats. I am not persuaded by the arguments that Senator Jenkins has just set forth. I understand her concerns, and those concerns led us to examine carefully the regulations that will be promulgated under section 17a of the Migration Legislation Amendment Act 1989. In fact, the only reference to section 17a in the Migration Legislation Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill is the positive measure which, clearly, all honourable senators in this chamber now support-that is, to insert the words, `after following the prescribed procedures'. Without those words I would have to say that there are many in the Opposition who would share the kinds of misgivings that Senator Jenkins referred to in her contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But the assurance has been given that, following the addition of these words by this amending Bill, those regulations will be substantial and the safeguards that many of us want-that there will be due process and a set of exact, specified requirements before all the steps are completed to have mandatory deportation-will be legally followed. They will not be able to be evaded. That is the genius of the addition of the words on page four of the Bill in front of us, `after following the prescribed procedures'. Accordingly, there is no need for us to accept amendment No. 1 put forward by the Australian Democrats which would take the entire section 17a out of the Act. It is our view that, after due process, there needs to be a strengthening of the mandatory power to deport because this has been a problem area in the immigration program for some years, not least in recent months. Therefore we need proposed new subsection 17a and section 18-that is both a mandatory power and a discretionary power-for the reasons that have been set forth. I can only emphasise the importance of the additional words that I have referred to on page 4 of the Bill that we are debating. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Jenkins has changed her position substantially between today and 30 May where she simply moved amendments to make the mandatory deportation revokable. Now she wants a deletion of the whole clause. Mandatory deportation is one of the two ways in which people can be deported from the country. Its first and shining virtue is its deterrent effect on anyone coming here in the first place but, secondly, only senior members of my Department and I will have the power to issue mandatory deportations; it will not be the average officer in the field. Of course, if some of the examples Senator Jenkins has raised do not come before us, the mandatory deportation order cannot be made. I guess that means that if it sits in my in tray for 12 months it is not made. That covers many areas where someone may be required to give evidence in court, or whatever else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Jenkins mentioned the Sergio Buschmann case but, of course, he was not mandatorily deported. I ordered his deportation under the other types of provisions in the Act because he was in breach of migration law in two specific instances. Just for the record, I gave him the option of leaving voluntarily and he did not go. It has always been our policy as much as possible to let people leave voluntarily. Why should we pick up the air fare? Also, as Senator Jenkins will notice in the regulations, it is much better to leave this country voluntarily, in terms of a penalty on return, than it is to be deported. After 19 December people will have 28 days in which to apply for a change of status on virtually all grounds. Even within the first year they can apply for a change of status, unless they have been arrested, on limited grounds. If they are arrested they may apply for refugee status. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jenkins brought up two examples of Afghans and Cambodians and what will happen with a change of Government. If they are in danger they are entitled to apply for refugee status. The regulation will make it quite clear that the officer has to ask the person, `Have you or do you wish to apply for refugee status?'. So it can be done within the first two days of arrest. </PARA>

<PARA> This particular amendment would delete all reference to mandatory deportation. I think that would be a major negative if it were to be supported. I believe that it is a great deterrent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to point out to the Minister that, if he placed a mandatory deportation order on a person and that person volunteered to leave, the Minister would be obliged to deport him and pay all his expenses. It is for that reason that I really do not see the point in a mandatory deportation order where the Minister has the ability to place a deportation order which, after following the prescribed procedures, must then be carried out unless the Minister himself chooses to revoke it. I really cannot see the Minister's argument. We do not need two forms of deportation orders. I will stick by my amendment because the Minister can still deport whomsoever he sees fit after following the prescribed steps. I say to Senator Teague that the prescribed steps are there for both mandatory deportation under proposed new subsection 17a and deportations under proposed new subsection 18 of the Act. The steps still have to be followed. In the case of the mandatory steps which cannot be revoked, I sincerely believe that the Minister is placing himself in a situation which he might find regrettable. It is all very well for the Minister to say that he can leave that deportation order at the bottom of his in-tray, but this may not be possible.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point I made about voluntary departure is that the point of arrest to the point where the mandatory deportation order is made is where the window of opportunity exists and where people will be encouraged to leave. That will be somewhat reinforced by the provisions, once they are regulated for, for the seizure of assets. So we will have these two things pushing people on arrest not to wait for mandatory deportation but to go. Mandatory deportation which is not reversible by the courts is far more likely to make them go. All the examples seem to be brought up in terms of when these people are in danger of going somewhere else. Under those circumstances they have the option of appealing for refugee status, which is something we have never once tried to circumscribe in this legislation. They are able to appeal on that basis in spite of the fact that many people so appealing will just use it as a device to extend their time in the country.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>These amendments are all very similar. They reflect on the amendments put forward in the Migration Legislation (Consequential Amendments) Bill. The Government has added the words `after considering the prescribed matters and no other matters' with regard to the deportation of illegal entrants under proposed new sections 17A and 18 with regard to the execution of the deportation orders under section 20 of the principal Act and with regard to the requirement by the Minister that illegal entrants should leave Australia. In all these cases this Bill amends the sections to add the words `after considering the prescribed matters and no other matters'. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to amend those amending clauses to state instead `after considering the prescribed matters and other relevant matters'. I do this because I can see that the Government wishes in these circumstances, when making these final decisions, to be restricted absolutely to matters which have been prescribed and codified down to the last dotted `i' and crossed `t'. The phrase `prescribed matters' remains. But I believe that if the phrase `and other relevant matters' is not included, there is a danger of correct natural justice not being carried out. This is a simple question of basic justice. </PARA>
<PARA> If we exclude consideration of all but certain precisely defined factors, the Government's proposed legislation will inevitably put the decision making process into a straitjacket. That makes the decision making process easier, I suppose, but if one is also not allowed to consider other relevant matters-and I think the operative word is `relevant'-the Department could be guilty of a significant injustice in a minority of cases. Here, as previously, I do not believe that we are talking about a lot of cases, but we are talking about cases which, as well as causing injustice, could be an embarrassment for the Government and perhaps blow the situation out of all proportion in the press. It could become an embarrassment to Australia. We do not want to find that we are so restricted by our own legislation that we put ourselves in the position where, even though we may want to act justly, fairly and sensibly, we may have to act unjustly, unfairly and irrationally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not support the three amendments moved by the Australian Democrats. The rejection of the words `and no other matters' means that, when an officer of the Department is enforcing a deportation order or any other circumstances that are outlined relevant to these words, that officer will be required to follow all the specific matters set out in the regulations but no others. I believe that that is appropriate. Because the regulations have not yet been published, nor will be widely seen until next Tuesday, the caveat must remain that the Parliament would give a very close scrutiny to those specific requirements, that is, the matters that are to be specifically considered by the enforcement officer and no others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the other hand, to go beyond the matters that would be set out specifically in the regulations with the words that Senator Jenkins has suggested-`and any other relevant matters'-is, I would have to say, totally open-ended. Not only would it mean that the enforcement officer would put forward any matter that he thought was relevant or that he thought a subsequent court might regard as relevant, but it would also break down what is established in the Bill that is before us-a separation between the decision made on the criteria for a visa or entry permit from those who are to execute subsequent and quite different powers, that is, the enforcement procedures. The Opposition believes that it is reasonable and right to have a separation of such powers. Because the words `any other relevant matters' are so open-ended and would break down that separation, we will not support the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposed amendments 2, 3 and 4 run counter to the essential feature of the legislation to reform the Migration Act. The firm intention behind the reform was to separate the determination of permission to stay from the processes of enforcement of departure of non-citizens who have no permission to stay. The legislation provides for criteria of entitlement for entry permits. It provides for processes of review of decisions on entry permits by a review officer, in the first tier, and the Immigration Review Tribunal, in the second tier.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It also provides for residual power in the Minister under section 64u to intervene in favour of an applicant, notwithstanding the criteria. All those provisions, together with a period of grace under section 5j and the provision for judicial review of decisions on grant of entry permits under the general law, were intended to provide for a fair, consistent and conclusive determination of the question whether a non-citizen present in Australia should be allowed to remain in Australia. At the end of the day a non-citizen who does not obtain permission to remain in Australia by way of an entry permit or by way of refugee protection in Australia is expected to depart Australia. If he does not, the compliance process comes into play. The compliance process addresses the question of when and how to secure the departure of a non-citizen present in Australia who has not been granted permission to remain. It is not appropriate at that stage for the compliance process to review or reconsider the question of stay because the compliance process is a by-product of an earlier determination of that very question. To do otherwise would lead to a circular approach which is a mischief that the Parliament, in passing the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill, sought to cure. The proposed provisions in the Bill were intended to secure more firmly the separation of the determination of stay from the consequential processes of compliance with that determination and, of no lesser importance, to ensure that the compliance procedures followed due process. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments proposed by Senator Jenkins throw that fundamental premise to the wind and invite the compliance process to review the review process in which all prior decisions, including the decisions by an independent Immigration Review Tribunal, are opened up for consideration. This is a case of getting the tail to wag the dog. Putting it another way, it is akin to asking a police officer seeking to enforce a taxation assessment to reassess the tax. The legislation reforms have put us on track to get the selection process right. A non-citizen who fails the selection process, including opportunities for merit and judicial review, should abide by the outcome. The compliance process is there to ensure that they do. I cannot accept Senator Jenkins's amendment. It is too open-ended. It fuzzies the edges between the decision as to whether a person should stay or go and the compliance of it. They are two entirely different processes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The publisher and editor of a high quality magazine, Australian Wellbeing-which may be known to some of my colleagues-was drawn to my attention by my colleague the Hon. Michael MacKellar, who had drawn to his attention by the magazine an Australia Post press release dated 14 April 1989. That press release was headed `Postal Charges to Increase'. It announced that postal rates, including the charges for registered publications, such as Australian Wellbeing, were to be increased from that date. I direct my remarks to those particular charges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The press release claims-and I have it with me here-that Australia Post's losses in this area of business, that is, registered publications totalled $200m in 1987-88. In an answer to Senate Question on Notice No. 1226 which appeared in Hansard of 25 October 1989, the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly) stated that on information provided by Australia Post, the loss on registered publications business was estimated at $21m in 1988-89. I remind the Senate that the loss was $200m in the previous year and $21m in 1988-89. Since the press statement makes it clear that increased charges for registered publications were not to be imposed on most publishers until after October 1989, I would welcome an explanation from Australia Post as to how it managed to reduce its losses on registered publications by $17.9m in 12 months without the benefit of increased postal charges. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague says that it may have been some sleight of hand. In fact, such an achievement, if correct, must cast real doubt over the need for the drastic exclusions and the rate hikes implemented by Australia Post on registered publications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now turn to some exclusions which have been made in relation to this rate increase. I note that on 26 June 1989 the Chairman of the Australian Postal Corporation, Mr Bob Lansdown, announced that the postal rate would increase to 45c, and that publications with a cover price of more than $5 would not be eligible for that registration beyond 2 October 1989. The Chairman stated that the aim was:</PARA>
<PARA>to achieve a moderate reduction in the subsidy which these publications have enjoyed in the past. </PARA>
<PARA>Subsequently, Australia Post lifted the postal rate for registered publications to 47c. The impact of these decisions is best shown by quoting the effects on the publishers of Wild magazine. Media reports suggested that they will pay 47c postage per issue on a cover price of $4.95, which is just below the $5 limit. The price is about to be increased to over $5, and if this occurs they will lose their eligibility to be a registered publication and they will pay a postal rate of $1.65 per copy inside Victoria and $2.15 per copy elsewhere. This is a very substantial and, I have to say, to my way of thinking, an unreasonable penalty to pay for what might only be a 20c to 30c increase in the price of the magazine. The Chief Mail Manager of Australia Post, Mr Christopher Grosser, has responded, saying:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . publishers can offset the increases by raising advertising charges. Why should commercial operators be subsidised by ordinary postal users. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an excellent question, Mr Grosser, and I ask Mr Grosser why the commercial operators still enjoying the registered publications concession should be subsidised to the tune of $21m, if that is his argument. He has to be either completely consistent one way or completely consistent the other. But even more to the point, I am sure that the publishers of the approximately 150 publications which are to be excluded from the registered publications concession would like to hear Mr Grosser's justification for the special discount rates which Australia Post apparently offers to certain high volume clients. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am going to mention the Readers Digest. I thank Senator Puplick for mentioning the Readers Digest. It is widely speculated in the publishing industry that the Readers Digest, for example, has successfully negotiated a rate of between 20c and 25c per copy for its postage. So when Australia Post's chief mail manager asks-and I repeat the question-`Why should commercial operators be subsidised by ordinary postal users?', and that is what he wrote, I would respond by asking Mr Grosser again: why should some commercial operators be more heavily subsidised than others?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia Post's decision to use the retail counter price of a magazine as the criterion for retaining the registered publications concession does not appear to have been well thought out. It seems to have been an arbitrary decision and lacking in commercial logic, fairness or commonsense. Consider two magazines, both of approximately the same weight and volume and both pre-sorted into postcode areas. The cost to Australia Post of processing each magazine must be almost identical, yet one with a cover price of $4.95 can be posted for 47c while the other priced at $5.05-just 10c different-is posted at $1.65. I just cannot accept that Australia Post is able to offer any rational or acceptable explanation why, in this instance, the $5.05 magazine must subsidise its competitor selling for 10c less. That is what it is: it is a subsidy to the tune of $1.20 postal costs for each copy that is posted. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me go back to the special discounts which the publishing industry believes are in the order of 20c per copy for some high volume publications. My colleague Senator Puplick mentioned the Readers Digest. Australia Post admitted in the answer to Senate Question on Notice No. 1226 that the rate increase and the $5 exclusion decision was:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . part of a package designed to contain the loss on the registered publications service and reduce it by half over the next three years. The loss in 1988-89 is estimated at $21 million. </PARA>
<PARA>I have already mentioned that figure of $21m. So if the new registered publications rate of 47c per copy will leave Australia Post with ongoing losses of between $10m and $20m, how can Australia Post justify a special discount for high volume publications like the Readers Digest of about 20c? Australia Post in its answer will claim that it is economies of scale. If a registered postal rate of 47c will still incur losses of up to $20m per year-losses which we have to pay for-I invite Australia Post to convince me that the economies of scale achieved in handling high volume publications are sufficient to justify a discounted rate of over 50 per cent on top of that already low concessional rate of 47c. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to think that Australia Post thoroughly researched its registered publications business before coming to a decision to increase the rate of 47c and to exclude all magazines priced at $5 or more. But all the evidence available to me suggests that this has not been done and that this was not the case. The $5 barrier is surely arbitrary, because Australia Post's chief mail manager justifies it by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> If people can afford to spend more than $5.00 on a magazine, they can afford to pay ordinary postal charges. </PARA>
<PARA>If there were some consistency to the treatment between different publications, we might understand, but there is no equality of treatment. So Australia Post is now into the business of making value judgments about the affluence of magazine buyers. That is what is going on. Will Australia Post decide next year that people who buy magazines with a cover price of $4 are also affluent enough not to warrant registered publication concessions; or will it be $3? Where will it end? What is Australia Post on about? It is nonsense for a commercial organisation to have to put itself into this position. Its mandate is to move postal articles from the sender to the receiver in the most efficient manner possible, and to do so at a profit. If a $5.05 magazine cannot be posted profitably for 47c, Australia Post has every right to increase the postal charges to a level which is profitable or to decide not to offer a concessional rate at all. The same criterion should be applied to the $4 magazine and to the high volume publications currently receiving negotiated discount rates. Otherwise, we will have a situation of unequal treatment in a very competitive commercial area. </PARA>
<PARA> Had Australia Post adopted the businesslike approach which I have just suggested there would at least be some fairness. But Australia Post has thrown into turmoil some sections of the highly competitive magazine industry. Some smaller operators face the prospect of closure. Others are considering re-formatted magazines and cheaper presentations to reduce costs and others are contemplating offshore printing. Still others will have to restructure the way they print in order just to get under whatever is the arbitrary limit set by Australia Post. It is still not too late for Australia Post to review its decision and change it. Australia Post could replace that decision as soon as possible with a fair and commercially acceptable and profitable rate structure for all its registered publications service. I want equality of treatment for all people trying to compete in this area. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IG4">Senator Vallentine</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 6 October 1989:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) As new regulations require prospective students who wish to follow their English course with a course of further study to provide details of the selected course plus provisional acceptance from an Australian institution, and given that neither the Australian Embassy in Beijing, nor the Australian Consulate in Shanghai provides information or counselling services to prospective Chinese students nor are prospective students permitted to enter the Australian Embassy to consult academic handbooks, how does the Minister explain that this requirement can be fulfilled-particularly if the objective is for the pipeline to be processed by the end of this year?</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Can the Minister affirm that Chinese students (whose initial course of study concludes but who have been permitted to remain in Australia and work or study until 31 July 1990) will be able to revert to student status after 31 July 1990, provided they are enrolled in a further and accredited course of study?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4622" SPEAKER="Walsh Sen The Hon P.A." NAMEID="TJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Senator Vallentine raised a valid point about counselling services on study options available to prospective students overseas.</PARA>
<PARA> Educational institutions, including ELICOS institutions which will continue to market in China under the new arrangements, are responsible for marketing their courses overseas and for providing such information as required to enable prospective students to make decisions about further study. To assist institutions discharge this responsibility, the Government is considering a recommendation to establish up to 10 Australian Education Centres which could provide an independent advisory service on study options in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> In the interim, it is in the interests of the students concerned, that the large backlog of applications received by the Embassy before the new arrangements were introduced be cleared. This is, and will remain, the primary focus of attention for the student section at the Embassy in Beijing.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs is responsible for making an assessment regarding the situation of all PRC nationals who have chosen to accept the Government's offer to remain in Australia until 31 July 1990.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 10 October 1989:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In view of reports of the US State Department relating to mass murders and torture of civilians by the new military regime in Myanmar, what Australian intelligence reports are available relating to recent events in that country.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) What is the state of diplomatic and governmental relations between the Myanmar and Australian Governments.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The present military regime in Myanmar, under General Saw Maung, came to power in September 1988 after suppressing popular demonstrations in favour of democracy in which an estimated 3,000 people, a large proportion of whom were students, were shot by security forces. The regime has announced that elections will be held on 27 May 1990 and that they will be ``free and fair''. However, repressive measures taken by the regime against its political opponents cast serious doubt on the credibility of the election process. In particular, the leaders of the main opposition party, the National League for Democracy, Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin U, have been held under a form of house arrest since 21 July and thousands of their supporters and other political activists have been detained. Reports of mistreatment and torture are commonplace. Also, severe restrictions have been placed on public gatherings and freedom of speech.</PARA>
<PARA> The regime has come to rely increasingly on the exercise of martial law. Military courts have been empowered to try civil offences and according to figures released by the authorities themselves, no less than 100 people have been sentenced to death, although it appears that to date none of these sentences have been carried out. There are also well substantiated reports of large numbers of people being press-ganged to work for the army as porters in the insurgent areas in conditions where they have suffered severely from starvation, disease and mistreatment.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Australia maintains normal diplomatic relations with Myanmar. The question of recognition does not arise as Australia recognises states and not governments.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government has never indicated support for the regime, the way it came to power, or its continued suppression of opposition groups. On the contrary, Australia has been at the forefront of those countries encouraging the Myanmar authorities to hold early general elections and to improve the observance of human rights.</PARA>
<PARA> In my statements of 21 July and 18 September, and on other more recent occasions in Question Time, I called for the lifting of the restrictions on political activity and for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners in preparation for free and fair elections, and for respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the people of Myanmar. I was able to further emphasise Australia's concerns on 4 October, when I met the leader of the Myanmar delegation to the UN General Assembly, Brigadier General Nyan Lynn, who is a member of the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council. Representations on human rights issues have also been made regularly through our Embassy in Yangon and through the Myanmar Embassy in Canberra. These representations have included specific cases raised by the Parliamentary Group of Amnesty International.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government will continue to do all that it reasonably can do to encourage the military regime in Myanmar to meet the democratic aspirations of the people of Myanmar and to improve its observance of fundamental human rights.</PARA>

<QUESTION.NUMBER QON.NUMBER="1285">(Question No. 1285)</QUESTION.NUMBER><QUESTION PAGE="4623" SPEAKER="Archer Sen B.R." NAMEID="IE4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="TAS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IE4">Senator Archer</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 27 October 1989:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 1. In relation to the Minister's reply to my Question on Notice No. 1088, (see Senate Hansard of 26 September 1989, page 1363) on what evidence is his comment based that, internationally, chalkbrood is not regarded as a major infectious disease of honeybees.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Does the Minister's comment that chalkbrood can lower production in weakened and/or badly managed hives imply that the disease does not lower production in strong and/or well managed hives.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Is it correct that of 15 samples of honey taken from shop shelves in New Zealand, 12 had chalkbrood spores.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Is there a danger of introducing chalkbrood through importation of honey; if so, why does proclamation No. 132a include bulk honey and honey pre-packs.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4623" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 1. Chalkbrood is not considered a major infectious disease of honeybees by the Office International des Epizooties (OIE), the recognised international reporting body on animal diseases and it is not listed in either of the OIE List A or List B categories. As Australia is free from the disease, however, quarantine restrictions are in place to address the risk of the disease reaching the Australian bee population. The import of bee products is currently under review due to concerns raised over the import of chalkbrood fungus in such products.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Chalkbrood may lower production in strong, well managed hives, but it is usually of less economic importance in such hives.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Informal advice is that a research project performed in New Zealand obtained this result.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service awaits a final report of the research project performed in New Zealand. On receipt of this report it will make an assessment of the risk of chalkbrood entering Australia in honey and honey pre-packs.</PARA>
